   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6949**] is a 51 year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic
   respiratory failure s/p trach, COPD, and morbid obesity who presented
   from [**Hospital **] Rehab with hypotension and is admitted to the MICU for
   further management
   # Hypotension/?Sepsis:  Acute hypotension is likely related to sepsis
   given coag neg staph in blood cultures and ESBL klebsiella in urine
   culture, which was not yet treated.  Pneumonia also possible source.
   There may be a component of beta blocker toxicity but this seems
   unlikely considering that patient was stable on his current regimen for
   three days and was not bradycardic on presentation.  The differential
   also includes opiate effect, decompensated heart failure, PE, and
   tamponade, though no pulsus.
   - CT chest to evaluate for pna but low suspicion for PE and CKD so will
   not perform PE protocol
   - cautious with IVFs given ?volume overload
   - unable to measure CVP with femoral line
   - blood cx from periphery and PICC
   - cx and wound c/s for right flank ulcer
   - sputum and urine cx
   - f/u cx data from [**Hospital **] rehab
   - minimize opiates
   - ECHO
   - cont vanc and start meropenem
   - check TSH/FT4
   - check vanc trough prior to third dose
   - weane levophed
   - consider glucagon if BP refractory to pressors
   # Hypoxic/Hypercapneic respiratory failure: Multifactoral respiratory
   failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease and
   obesity hypoventolation, s/p tracheostomy on [**2178-8-13**].  Possible CHF vs
   pna on CXR, and recently treated for pseudomonas VAP.  ABG c/w chronic
   respiratory acidosis with PCO2 near baseline of 70s.  On FiO2 of 40% at
   rehab.
   - recheck sputum cx
   - albuterol, ipratropium bronchodilators
   - will diurese once BP stable
   - continue AC/CMV
   - will not restart tobramycin at this time
   # Altered mental status:  Was gazing to the right and had rhythmic
   movements of chin/teeth clattering concerning for seizure versus
   clattering from hypothermia vs electrolyte abnormality; appeared to
   respond to ativan.  Per [**Hospital **] rehab, usually responsive to name and
   does occasionally have rightward gaze.
   - head CT
   - check RPR, TSH. B12 normal in past
   - neuro c/s in a.m.
   # Rash with erythematous patches:  concerning for urticaria though has
   received beta-lactams before without reaction.  Improved with
   bennadryl.
   - continue to monitor
   # Chronic kidney injury:  Cr of 1.3 is improved from creatinine at last
   discharge of 2 and has had elevated Cr during recent hospitalizations.
   Cr baseline was 0.6 in [**2178-8-5**].  History of AIN.
   - renally dose meds
   - continue to trend creatinine
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Was on metoprolol at rehab for rate control,
   not on warfarin secondary to history of RP bleed.  CHADS score of 0.
   - holding metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - no anticoagulation for now but would consider aspirin

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, and morbid obesity. He presented with hypotension and was admitted to the MICU for further management.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypotension/possible sepsis: The patient has acute hypotension, which is likely related to sepsis given the presence of coag-negative Staphylococcus in blood cultures and ESBL Klebsiella in urine culture. Other possible sources of infection include pneumonia. The differential diagnosis also includes beta-blocker toxicity, opiate effect, decompensated heart failure, pulmonary embolism (PE), and cardiac tamponade. 

2. Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease, as well as obesity hypoventilation. This is evident from the chronic respiratory acidosis with PCO2 near baseline of 70s. Possible causes include CHF vs pneumonia on CXR, and recently treated for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Altered mental status: The patient exhibited gazing to the right and rhythmic movements of chin/teeth clattering, which could be indicative of a seizure or clattering from hypothermia vs electrolyte abnormality. The patient appeared to respond to lorazepam.

4. Rash with erythematous patches: The patient presented with a rash that improved with Benadryl, but the cause is unclear. It could be related to an allergic reaction or something else.

5. Chronic kidney injury: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, which is improved from previous values. The patient has a history of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN).

6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was on metoprolol for rate control, but not on warfarin due to a history of retroperitoneal bleed. The patient's CHADS score is 0.

Overall, the patient requires further evaluation and management for these conditions, including appropriate antibiotic therapy, optimization of respiratory support, management of hypotension, and addressing any other potential complications or concerns."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6949**] is a 51 year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic
   respiratory failure s/p trach, COPD, and morbid obesity who presented
   from [**Hospital **] Rehab with hypotension and is admitted to the MICU for
   further management
   # Hypotension/?Sepsis:  Acute hypotension is likely related to sepsis
   given coag neg staph in blood cultures and ESBL klebsiella in urine
   culture, which was not yet treated.  Pneumonia also possible source.
   There may be a component of beta blocker toxicity but this seems
   unlikely considering that patient was stable on his current regimen for
   three days and was not bradycardic on presentation.  The differential
   also includes opiate effect, decompensated heart failure, PE, and
   tamponade, though no pulsus.
   - CT chest to evaluate for pna but low suspicion for PE and CKD so will
   not perform PE protocol
   - cautious with IVFs given ?volume overload
   - unable to measure CVP with femoral line
   - blood cx from periphery and PICC
   - cx and wound c/s for right flank ulcer
   - sputum and urine cx
   - f/u cx data from [**Hospital **] rehab
   - minimize opiates
   - ECHO
   - cont vanc and start meropenem
   - check TSH/FT4
   - check vanc trough prior to third dose
   - weane levophed
   - consider glucagon if BP refractory to pressors
   # Hypoxic/Hypercapneic respiratory failure: Multifactoral respiratory
   failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease and
   obesity hypoventolation, s/p tracheostomy on [**2178-8-13**].  Possible CHF vs
   pna on CXR, and recently treated for pseudomonas VAP.  ABG c/w chronic
   respiratory acidosis with PCO2 near baseline of 70s.  On FiO2 of 40% at
   rehab.
   - recheck sputum cx
   - albuterol, ipratropium bronchodilators
   - will diurese once BP stable
   - continue AC/CMV
   - will not restart tobramycin at this time
   # Altered mental status:  Was gazing to the right and had rhythmic
   movements of chin/teeth clattering concerning for seizure versus
   clattering from hypothermia vs electrolyte abnormality; appeared to
   respond to ativan.  Per [**Hospital **] rehab, usually responsive to name and
   does occasionally have rightward gaze.
   - head CT
   - check RPR, TSH. B12 normal in past
   - neuro c/s in a.m.
   # Rash with erythematous patches:  concerning for urticaria though has
   received beta-lactams before without reaction.  Improved with
   bennadryl.
   - continue to monitor
   # Chronic kidney injury:  Cr of 1.3 is improved from creatinine at last
   discharge of 2 and has had elevated Cr during recent hospitalizations.
   Cr baseline was 0.6 in [**2178-8-5**].  History of AIN.
   - renally dose meds
   - continue to trend creatinine
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Was on metoprolol at rehab for rate control,
   not on warfarin secondary to history of RP bleed.  CHADS score of 0.
   - holding metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - no anticoagulation for now but would consider aspirin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, COPD, morbid obesity, and tracheostomy. He presented from a rehabilitation hospital with hypotension and was admitted to the MICU for further management. The patient's vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. His blood cultures are positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and ESBL Klebsiella, indicating possible sepsis. Imaging studies reveal pneumonia, severe pulmonary artery hypertension, and a dilated right ventricle with depressed contractility. The patient has altered mental status, a rash with erythematous patches, chronic kidney injury, and a history of atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The positive blood cultures suggest a possible infection causing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure, coupled with pneumonia and severe pulmonary hypertension, increases the risk of further respiratory failure and hypoxia.
3. Right Ventricular Failure: The dilated right ventricle and depressed contractility indicate compromised right ventricular function, which can result in pulmonary hypertension and potentially lead to right-sided heart failure.
4. Pneumonia: The consolidation seen on CT chest indicates pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory distress and contribute to sepsis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with hypotension. They have a history of chronic respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient's ECHO shows normal left ventricular systolic function but hypertrophy and dilatation of the right ventricle, along with severe pulmonary artery hypertension. The patient's ABGs indicate respiratory distress. They have been receiving various medications, including norepinephrine, heparin, hydromorphone, and lorazepam. The patient's vital signs are stable, but their blood pressure is low. They are on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, set at a tidal volume of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. The patient has received multiple transfusions of blood products. The physical examination reveals no peripheral edema or jugular venous distention. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count and troponin levels, as well as signs of renal dysfunction. Imaging studies show consolidation in the left lower lobe of the lung, unchanged emphysema and fibrotic process, and no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of chronic respiratory failure and current mechanical ventilation indicate ongoing respiratory compromise. The presence of consolidation in the left lower lobe may suggest pneumonia or acute exacerbation of the fibrotic process, further contributing to respiratory failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6949**] is a 51 year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic
   respiratory failure s/p trach, COPD, and morbid obesity who presented
   from [**Hospital **] Rehab with hypotension and is admitted to the MICU for
   further management
   # Hypotension/?Sepsis:  Acute hypotension is likely related to sepsis
   given coag neg staph in blood cultures and ESBL klebsiella in urine
   culture, which was not yet treated.  Pneumonia also possible source.
   There may be a component of beta blocker toxicity but this seems
   unlikely considering that patient was stable on his current regimen for
   three days and was not bradycardic on presentation.  The differential
   also includes opiate effect, decompensated heart failure, PE, and
   tamponade, though no pulsus.
   - f/u blood cx from periphery and PICC
   - f/u cx for right flank ulcer
   - f/u sputum and urine cx
   - cont vanc and meropenem; low threshold to start tobramycin
   - check vanc trough prior to third dose
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   # Hypoxic/Hypercapneic respiratory failure: Multifactoral respiratory
   failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease and
   obesity hypoventolation, s/p tracheostomy on [**2178-8-13**].  Possible CHF vs
   pna on CXR, and recently treated for pseudomonas VAP.  ABG c/w chronic
   respiratory acidosis with PCO2 near baseline of 70s.  On FiO2 of 40% at
   rehab.
   - sputum cx w proteus, sensitivities pnd.
   - albuterol, ipratropium bronchodilators
   - will diurese once BP stable
   - AC/CMV
   - PS trial today; goal sats 92%
   - if destabilizes consider tobramycin
   # Hypernatremia: autodiuresis yesterday.
   - free water TF, D5W bolus: goal decrease 0.5/hr
   # Altered mental status: improved overnight.
   - f/u RPR, TSH. B12
   - if seizes then neuro c/s.
   # Chronic kidney injury:  Cr of 1.3 is improved from creatinine at last
   discharge of 2 and has had elevated Cr during recent hospitalizations.
   Cr baseline was 0.6 in [**2178-8-5**].  History of AIN.
   - renally dose meds
   - continue to trend creatinine
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Was on metoprolol at rehab for rate control,
   not on warfarin secondary to history of RP bleed.  CHADS score of 0.
   - holding metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - no anticoagulation for now but would consider aspirin

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, and morbid obesity. He presented with hypotension and was admitted to the MICU for further management. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently on several medications. His vital signs are unstable, and he has abnormal laboratory results including elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and elevated creatinine level. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient's acute hypotension could be related to sepsis, given the presence of coag-negative staphylococci in blood cultures and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella in urine culture. Pneumonia is also a possible source of infection. Other differential diagnoses include beta-blocker toxicity, opioid effect, decompensated heart failure, pulmonary embolism (PE), and cardiac tamponade.
2. Hypoxic/Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure secondary to obstructive COPD, restrictive lung disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and recently treated for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Chronic respiratory acidosis with PCO2 near baseline in the 70s is evident. Management includes bronchodilators, diuresis"

   add the following points:  51 y/o obese  m with h/o COPD and IPF,
   recent hospitalization with hypercarbic resp failure, s/p trach,
   presents from rehab with septic shock  from esbl uti/line infection,
   and pna.  Heparin gtt stopped (LENIs neg, no acute change in RV by

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and morbid obesity. He presented from rehab with hypotension and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has several medical conditions including anemia, respiratory failure, altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and impaired skin integrity. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/63 mmHg to 138/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy tube with assisted ventilation. 

The patient's lab results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 180 K/uL, and abnormal kidney function with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. His electrolytes are imbalanced, with hypernatremia (sodium level of 151 mEq/L) and hypokalemia (potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L). Other lab abnormalities include elevated lactate levels, low albumin, and elevated liver enzymes.

Plan:
1. Sepsis treatment: The patient is being treated for sepsis, possibly due to a line infection, pneumonia, or urinary tract infection. Antibiotics have been started, and further"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and morbid obesity. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension from a previous hospitalization. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including norepinephrine, lorazepam, hydromorphone, colace, lansoprazole, clonazepam, fentanyl patch, beclomethasone, and mucomyst.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem), and further investigations are ongoing to identify the source of infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to chronic COPD, fibrosis, and possible acute pneumonia. Treatment includes continued pneumonia treatment, attempting pressure support ventilation (PSV), and targeting PCO2 levels between 60-70 and oxygen saturation (sats) between 90-94%.
3. Hypernatremia: The cause of the patient's hypernatremia is unclear, and it is uncertain whether the sodium level is correct. Aggressive fluid repletion may be necessary if the hypernatremia is confirmed.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CRF): The patient's creatinine level has improved since discontinuing heparin.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6949**] is a 51 year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic
   respiratory failure s/p trach, COPD, and morbid obesity who presented
   from [**Hospital **] Rehab with hypotension and is admitted to the MICU for
   further management
   # Hypotension/?Sepsis:  Acute hypotension is likely related to sepsis
   given coag neg staph in blood cultures and ESBL klebsiella in urine
   culture, which was not yet treated.  Pneumonia also possible source.
   There may be a component of beta blocker toxicity but this seems
   unlikely considering that patient was stable on his current regimen for
   three days and was not bradycardic on presentation.  The differential
   also includes opiate effect, decompensated heart failure, PE, and
   tamponade, though no pulsus.

","Summary:
Mr. [Known lastname 6949], a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, and morbid obesity, was admitted to the MICU from [Hospital] Rehab with hypotension. The patient has several medical complications, including hypotension, altered mental status, hypernatremia, chronic kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, and suspected pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient presented with acute hypotension, which is likely related to sepsis given the presence of coag-negative staph in blood cultures and ESBL klebsiella in urine culture. Other possible causes include opiate effect, decompensated heart failure, pulmonary embolism (PE), and tamponade. The differential diagnosis also includes beta blocker toxicity, but this seems unlikely as the patient was stable on his current regimen for three days and was not bradycardic on presentation.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which has improved since admission. Neg RPR, normal FT4, and B12 levels were found. If the patient experiences seizures, neurocognitive studies should be performed.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels improved with D5W fluid boluses yesterday. Free water and D5W boluses will continue, with a goal decrease of 0.5/hr."

Other possible sources include pneumonia, beta-blocker toxicity, opiate effect, decompensated heart failure, pulmonary embolism (PE), and cardiac tamponade.

2. Hypoxic/Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure secondary to obstructive COPD, restrictive lung disease, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. There is a possibility of congestive heart failure (CHF), pneumonia on chest X-ray, and recently treated pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia due to autodiuresis. Free water and D5W bolus are recommended to decrease serum sodium levels gradually.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status has improved since admission. Further evaluation, including neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, may be necessary if seizures occur.

5. Chronic Kidney Injury: The patient has a history of chronic kidney injury with elevated creatinine levels during recent hospitalizations. Renal dosing of medications is necessary, and close monitoring of creatinine levels is required.

6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was on metoprolol for rate control, but it has been withheld due to hypotension. Considering the patient's CHADS score of 0, anticoagulation with aspirin may be considered.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the patient's progress note. Additional tests and assessments may be needed to confirm these findings and guide further management."

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with morbid obesity, emphysema, and pulmonary fibrosis who is currently in the ICU with sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been monitored closely, and various interventions have been implemented to manage his conditions.

Key findings include:

1. Overnight, the patient experienced tachypnea and dysynchrony, leading to an ABG result of 7.32/77/48. In response, the TV was increased to 600, PIPs were adjusted between 40-50, and then decreased back to 500. Currently, the PIP is 37, and the Pl is 34.

2. The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin), pain management (hydromorphone), heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and lorazepam for sedation. The patient is also on other ICU medications and has a list of medications from home.

3. Review of systems and flow sheet data indicate that the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and neurologic assessment are all within normal limits. However, the patient does have impaired skin integrity.

4. Laboratory results show an elevated sodium level (high), decreased hematocrit (anemia), and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, while platelet count is within normal range. Other lab values, such"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, and morbid obesity. He presented from a rehabilitation hospital with urosepsis, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and possible pneumonia superimposed on severe lung disease. The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, likely due to sepsis, and requires norepinephrine support. He is receiving vancomycin and meropenem for suspected infections. Cultures have been sent, and there is a consideration for restarting tobramycin due to a history of resistant pseudomonal infection. The patient also has hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure, which is multifactorial and secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease, as well as obesity hypoventilation syndrome. He has a possible pneumonia on chest CT and was recently treated for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's ABG shows chronic respiratory acidosis with PCO2 near baseline of 70s. He is on FiO2 60% and requires dead space calculation. Other medical issues include hypernatremia, which has resolved, altered mental status, chronic kidney injury, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has coag-negative staph bacteremia and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in his urine culture. These infections can"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, and morbid obesity. He presented from another hospital with urosepsis and possible pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU due to acute hypotension, which is likely related to sepsis given the presence of coagulase-negative staphylococcus in the blood cultures and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in the urine culture. There may also be a component of beta-blocker toxicity, but this seems unlikely considering the patient's stability on his current regimen for three days and absence of bradycardia on presentation. Other differential diagnoses include opiate effect, decompensated heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and cardiac tamponade. The patient is on norepinephrine this morning after being off all night.

The patient's respiratory status is characterized by hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure secondary to obstructive COPD, restrictive lung disease, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. There is a possibility of congestive heart failure versus pneumonia on chest X-ray, and the patient was recently treated for Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows chronic respiratory acidosis with a PCO2 near baseline of 70s. The patient is currently on supplemental oxygen"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, morbid obesity, and other comorbidities. The patient presented with hypotension and was admitted to the MICU for further management.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note are:

1. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient has coag-negative staph in blood cultures and ESBL klebsiella in urine culture, indicating a possible source of sepsis. Immediate treatment with appropriate antibiotics and fluid resuscitation is necessary to manage septic shock.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease, as well as obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The ABG results show chronic respiratory acidosis with PCO2 near baseline of 70s. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings, bronchodilators, and consideration of adding tobramycin may be required to improve oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which improved with D5W fluid boluses yesterday. Continued free water administration and careful monitoring of sodium levels are necessary to correct the electrolyte imbalance.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status but has shown improvement since admission. Further evaluation and management should include ruling out"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old male with morbid obesity, chronic respiratory failure from end-stage lung disease, and dependent on a ventilator. The patient presents with hypotension from rehab and has been stabilized over the last several days. However, new hypotension has occurred this morning.

The patient's medical history includes anemia, respiratory failure, altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently being treated with norepinephrine, lorazepam, hydromorphone, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 107/67 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, and warm skin without rash or jaundice.

Laboratory results indicate hypernatremia, anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and altered kidney function. Imaging shows a tracheostomy tip located 5.5 cm above the carina, cardiomediastinal silhouette, widespread parenchymal abnormalities, known left lower lobe consolidation, and a small amount of pleural effusion.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypernatremia, anemia, chronic respiratory failure, altered mental status,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6949**] is a 51 year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic
   respiratory failure s/p trach, COPD, and morbid obesity who presented
   from [**Hospital **] Rehab with urosepsis, coag neg staph bacteremia and
   possible pneumonia superimposed on severe lung disease.
   # Hypotension/?Sepsis:  Acute hypotension is likely related to sepsis
   given coag neg staph in blood cultures and ESBL klebsiella in urine
   culture.  Pneumonia also possible source.
   - on norepinephrine this am after being off all night
   - cont vanc and meropenem
   - Resend sputum cultures, blood cultures, urine cultures
   - Consider restarting  tobramycin for h/o resistant pseudomonal
   infection
   - Hold Vanc (was 58 yesterday evening, 51 yest morning).  Recheck
   trough today
   - Place PICC given ESBL klebsiella
   - Pull femoral line today
   # Hypoxic/Hypercapneic respiratory failure: Multifactoral respiratory
   failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease and
   obesity hypoventolation, s/p tracheostomy on [**2178-8-13**].  Possible pna on
   CT chest, and recently treated for pseudomonas VAP.  ABG c/w chronic
   respiratory acidosis with PCO2 near baseline of 70s.  On FiO2 of 40% at
   rehab, now requiring FiO2 60%. Dead space was calculated at 85% by
   respiratory.
   - infectious w/u as above
   - albuterol, ipratropium bronchodilators standing
   - will diurese once BP stable
   - AC/CMV, goal sats 92%
   - if destabilizes consider tobramycin
   - Opiates as needed for air hunger
   - Will need different trach when stable (current trach not stable for
   travel, was placed by thoracics)
   # Hypernatremia: Na 149
   - Continue free water in tube feeds
   - Recheck Na at 4 PM
   # Anemia: Hct has slowly decreased from 29 to 23, may be secondary to
   phlebotomy and chronic illness
   - guaiac stools
   - type and screen
   - transfuse for hct <21 or if hypotensive
   # Altered mental status: improved since admission, neg RPR, nl FT4 and
   B12. Continue infectious treatment as above.
   - if seizes then neuro c/s.
   # Chronic kidney injury:  Cr of 1.3 is improved from creatinine at last
   discharge of 2 and has had elevated Cr during recent hospitalizations.
   Cr baseline was 0.6 in [**2178-8-5**].  History of AIN. Now with Cr 0.8.
   - renally dose meds
   - continue to trend creatinine
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Was on metoprolol at rehab for rate control,
   not on warfarin secondary to history of RP bleed.  CHADS score of 0.
   - holding metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - no anticoagulation for now but would consider aspirin

","The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, and morbid obesity. He presented from rehab with urosepsis, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and possible pneumonia superimposed on severe lung disease. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Hypotension/possible sepsis: Acute hypotension is likely related to sepsis given the presence of coag-negative staph in blood cultures and ESBL klebsiella in urine culture. Pneumonia is also a possible source. The patient is on norepinephrine and being treated with vancomycin and meropenem.

2. Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure: Multifactorial respiratory failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease, obesity hypoventilation, s/p tracheostomy. There is a possibility of pneumonia on CT chest, and recently treated for pseudomonas VAP. The patient's ABG shows chronic respiratory acidosis with PCO2 near baseline of 70s. The patient requires FiO2 of 60%.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level (Na 149). This may be due to dehydration or excessive intake of sodium. The plan is to continue free water in tube feeds and recheck sodium at 4 PM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, and morbid obesity. He presented from a rehabilitation hospital with urosepsis, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and possible pneumonia superimposed on severe lung disease. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient has acute hypotension, likely related to sepsis given the presence of coag-negative staph in blood cultures and ESBL klebsiella in urine culture. Pneumonia is also a possible source of infection. The patient is on norepinephrine and receiving appropriate antibiotic coverage.

2. Hypoxic/Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease, as well as obesity hypoventilation syndrome. He also has a history of tracheostomy, recent treatment for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and an increased dead space of 85%. The patient requires supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation support.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level of 149, indicating hypernatremia. This may be due to inadequate fluid intake or excessive fluid loss. The patient's free water intake should be increased, and his sodium levels should be monitored closely.

   respiratory failure s/p trach, COPD, and morbid obesity who presented
   from [**Hospital **] Rehab with urosepsis, coag neg staph bacteremia and
   possible pneumonia superimposed on severe lung disease.
   # Sepsis: Hypothermic and hypotensive O/N. Started on pressors.
   Cultured. Sputum growing GNRs. Unclear if colonized versus new pna.
   CXR, CT scan do not indicate pna.
   - Continue pressors
   - cont meropenem. Vanco still supratherapeutic, level 44.
   - F/u cultures
   - Consider restarting  tobramycin for h/o resistant pseudomonal
   infection
   - S/p PICC for antibiotics
   # Hypoxic/Hypercapneic respiratory failure: Multifactoral respiratory
   failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease and
   obesity hypoventolation, s/p tracheostomy on [**2178-8-13**].  Possible pna on
   CT chest, and recently treated for pseudomonas VAP.  ABG c/w chronic
   respiratory acidosis with PCO2 near baseline of 70s.  On FiO2 of 40% at
   rehab, now requiring increasing  FiO2 70%. Dead space was calculated at
   85% by respiratory. Sputum with GNRs, concerning for resistant
   pseudomonas. Increase in dead space is concerning for PE.
   - infectious w/u as above
   - CTA to r/o PE
   - albuterol, ipratropium bronchodilators standing
   - will diurese once BP stable
   - AC/CMV, goal sats 92%
   - consider tobramycin
   - Opiates as needed for air hunger
   - Will need different trach when stable (current trach not stable for
   travel, was placed by thoracics)
   # Hypernatremia: Na 148.
   - Continue free water in tube feeds; change free water to q4h
   - Recheck Na at 4 PM
   # Anemia: Hct has slowly decreased from 29 to 23, stable at 24.9
   - recheck hct, transfuse if hct<22
   - check retic ct
   - guaiac stools
   - type and screen
   - transfuse for hct <21 or if hypotensive
   - hemolysis labs
   # Altered mental status: improved since admission, neg RPR, nl FT4 and
   B12. Continue infectious treatment as above.
   # Chronic kidney injury:  Cr of 1.3 is improved from creatinine at last
   discharge of 2 and has had elevated Cr during recent hospitalizations.
   Cr baseline was 0.6 in [**2178-8-5**].  History of AIN. Now with Cr 0.8.
   - renally dose meds
   - continue to trend creatinine
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Was on metoprolol at rehab for rate control,
   not on warfarin secondary to history of RP bleed.  CHADS score of 0.
   - holding metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - no anticoagulation for now but would consider aspirin

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6949**] is a 51 year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic
   respiratory failure s/p trach, COPD, and morbid obesity who presented
   from [**Hospital **] Rehab with urosepsis, coag neg staph bacteremia and
   possible pneumonia superimposed on severe lung disease.
   # Sepsis: Hypothermic and hypotensive O/N. Started on pressors.
   Cultured. Sputum growing GNRs.
   - Continue pressors
   - cont meropenem. Vanco still supratherapeutic, level 44.
   - F/u cultures
   - Consider restarting  tobramycin for h/o resistant pseudomonal
   infection
   - S/p PICC for antibiotics
   # Hypoxic/Hypercapneic respiratory failure: Multifactoral respiratory
   failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease and
   obesity hypoventolation, s/p tracheostomy on [**2178-8-13**].  Possible pna on
   CT chest, and recently treated for pseudomonas VAP.  ABG c/w chronic
   respiratory acidosis with PCO2 near baseline of 70s.  On FiO2 of 40% at
   rehab, now requiring increasing  FiO2 70%. Dead space was calculated at
   85% by respiratory. Sputum with GNRs, concerning for resistant
   pseudomonas.
   - infectious w/u as above
   - albuterol, ipratropium bronchodilators standing
   - will diurese once BP stable
   - AC/CMV, goal sats 92%
   - consider tobramycin
   - Opiates as needed for air hunger
   - Will need different trach when stable (current trach not stable for
   travel, was placed by thoracics)
   # Hypernatremia: Na 148.
   - Continue free water in tube feeds; change free water to q4h
   - Recheck Na at 4 PM
   # Anemia: Hct has slowly decreased from 29 to 23, stable at 24.9
   - recheck hct, transfuse if hct<22
   - check retic ct
   - guaiac stools
   - type and screen
   - transfuse for hct <21 or if hypotensive
   # Altered mental status: improved since admission, neg RPR, nl FT4 and
   B12. Continue infectious treatment as above.
   # Chronic kidney injury:  Cr of 1.3 is improved from creatinine at last
   discharge of 2 and has had elevated Cr during recent hospitalizations.
   Cr baseline was 0.6 in [**2178-8-5**].  History of AIN. Now with Cr 0.8.
   - renally dose meds
   - continue to trend creatinine
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Was on metoprolol at rehab for rate control,
   not on warfarin secondary to history of RP bleed.  CHADS score of 0.
   - holding metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - no anticoagulation for now but would consider aspirin

The patient presented from another hospital with sepsis, hypothermia, and hypotension. He was started on pressors and cultured for GNRs. 

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, secondary to obstructive COPD, restrictive lung disease, obesity hypoventilation, and s/p tracheostomy. He has been treated for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and requires increasing FiO2 due to hypoxia. 

The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 148. He is being given free water in tube feeds and will have his sodium rechecked at 4 PM. 

The patient has anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) that has decreased from 29 to 23. It is stable at 24.9. He should have his Hct rechecked, and if it is less than 22, he should be transfused. A reticulocyte count should be done, and guaiac stools should be checked. A type and screen should be performed, and he should be transfused for Hct less than 21 or if hypotensive.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, COPD, and morbid obesity. He presented from another hospital with urosepsis, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and possible pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions and complications.

24-hour events include the placement and removal of a PICC line, worsening tachypnea after PICC placement, changes in ventilator settings, administration of sedatives, IV fluids, and medications for hypovolemia, hypernatremia, and hypertension. The patient also required norepinephrine for blood pressure support and was found to be hypothermic.

The patient has multiple infusions including midazolam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, lorazepam, heparin sodium, and hydromorphone. He has received various medications for different conditions and complications.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 119/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 28 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 80%, and RSBI deferred.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including hypernatremia (high sodium levels), anemia, respiratory failure, altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and impaired skin integrity.

24-hour events include the insertion of a PICC line and removal of a femoral line. The patient developed tachypnea and elevated peak pressures, leading to the initiation of IV sedation. The patient's blood pressure decreased, necessitating fluid replacement and the administration of levophed.

Medications:
The patient is receiving various medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, lorazepam, heparin sodium, and others.

Vital signs:
The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37°C (98.6°F)
- Heart rate: 90 bpm (67-118 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 98/55 mmHg (69-128/92 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute (25-45 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 96%
- Weight: 160 kg (admission weight: 154 kg)

Fluid balance:
The patient has received a total of 4,478 mL of fluids since admission, with an output of 2,370 mL. The current fluid balance is 2,108 mL positive.

Respiratory support:
The patient is on mechanical ventilation with the following settings:
- Ventilator mode: CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow
- Tidal volume (set): 550 mL (500-550 mL)
- Respiratory rate (set): 28 breaths per minute
- Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP): 8 cmH2O
- Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2): 80%
- Plateau pressure: 30 cmH2O
- SpO2: 96%

Laboratory results:
The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are low. Other lab values, including electrolytes, liver enzymes, kidney function tests, and cardiac markers, are within normal limits or slightly abnormal.

Assessment and plan:
The patient's condition is summarized as follows:
- Hypernatremia: Continue free water repletion and decrease the rate of D5W at 70cc/hr.
- Anemia: Hct stable
- Respiratory failure: Increase deadspace ventilation, increasing oxygen requirement with elevated PIP and plateau's. Obtain CTA to r/o PE given acute increase in deadspace ventilation. Consider broadening antibiotic coverage after evaluation of parenchyma on chest CT. Continue sedation to help with ventilator management.
- Altered mental status: Currently sedated
- Sepsis without organ dysfunction: On broad-spectrum"

The patient's current health progress includes being sedated, receiving mechanical ventilation, and having multiple lines inserted for medical management. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding respiratory failure, hypernatremia, anemia, and altered mental status. The patient has a history of obesity, and there is evidence of impaired skin integrity with a decubitus ulcer. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, and C-reactive protein, indicating an ongoing inflammatory response.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure on top of chronic respiratory failure. There is an increase in deadspace ventilation, and the patient requires higher levels of oxygen. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) will be obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE), and broadening antibiotic coverage may be necessary after evaluating the chest CT.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, and free water repletion should continue with a decrease in the rate of D5W at 70cc/hr.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. However, the patient's hct (hematocrit) is stable, so further intervention may not be required at this time.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, but it"

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU.
- They have a history of respiratory failure, anemia, hypernatremia, altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and impaired skin integrity.
- The patient's vital signs show tachypnea, hypotension requiring fluid replacement and levophed, and hypothermia improved with bearhugger.
- The patient has multiple lines inserted, including a PICC line and arterial line.
- The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, sedation, and other medications for glycemic control and nutrition.
- The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with low sodium levels.
- The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a tracheostomy tube, set Vt of 550 mL, RR of 28, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 80%, and ABG results indicating respiratory acidosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current condition of acute-on-chronic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is a risk of sepsis progression or development of new infections due to the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.

   # Altered mental status: improved since admission, neg RPR, nl FT4 and
   B12. Continue infectious treatment as above.
   # Chronic kidney injury:  Cr of 1.3 is improved from creatinine at last
   discharge of 2 and has had elevated Cr during recent hospitalizations.
   Cr baseline was 0.6 in [**2178-8-5**].  History of AIN. Now with Cr 0.8.
   - renally dose meds
   - continue to trend creatinine
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Was on metoprolol at rehab for rate control,
   not on warfarin secondary to history of RP bleed.  CHADS score of 0.
   - holding metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - no anticoagulation for now but would consider aspirin

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, morbid obesity, urosepsis, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and possible pneumonia. He presented from a rehabilitation hospital with sepsis, bacteremia, and potential pneumonia. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Bradyarrhythmia: The patient has a slow heart rate (83 bpm) which may be due to the use of midazolam and fentanyl infusions.

2. Hypernatremia (high sodium levels): The patient's sodium level is elevated at 148, indicating hypernatremia. This could be due to inadequate fluid intake or excessive fluid loss.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 29 to 23, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

4. Respiratory failure, chronic: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease. His ABG results show chronic respiratory acidosis with PCO2 near baseline of 70s, indicating inadequate ventilation.

5. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved since admission. Further evaluation is needed to identify the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment.

6. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has been treated for sepsis and bacteremia."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6949**] is a 51 year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic
   respiratory failure s/p trach, COPD, and morbid obesity who presented
   from [**Hospital **] Rehab with urosepsis, coag neg staph bacteremia and
   possible pneumonia superimposed on severe lung disease.
   # Sepsis: Changed from levophed to neosyn [**10-7**] due to tachycardia. WBC
   elevated to 15.7. Sputum growing pseudomonas. Unclear if colonized
   versus new pna. CXR, CT scan are difficult to read due to progressive
   lung disease, unlear if PNA present.
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin, will try to change to IV after
   discussing with ID
   - Cont meropenem. Vanco still supratherapeutic
   - F/u cultures
   - S/p PICC for antibiotics
   # Hypoxic/Hypercapneic respiratory failure: Multifactoral respiratory
   failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease and
   obesity hypoventolation, s/p tracheostomy on [**2178-8-13**].  Possible pna on
   CT chest, and recently treated for pseudomonas VAP.  ABG c/w chronic
   respiratory acidosis with very elevated PCO2. On FiO2 of 40% at rehab,
   now requiring increasing  FiO2 80%. Dead space has increased. Sputum
   with moderate pseudomonas growth, concerning for resistant infection.
   Increase in dead space is concerning for PE. ECHO, LENI no evidence of
   clot.
   - infectious w/u as above
   - consider CTA to r/o PE if more stable
   - albuterol, ipratropium bronchodilators standing
   - will diurese once BP stable
   - AC/CMV, goal sats 92%
   - Opiates as needed for air hunger
   - Will need different trach when stable (current trach not stable for
   travel, was placed by thoracics)
   - may need to consider paralysis to better control his resp status,
   however not ideal due to his profound weakness at baseline
   # Hypernatremia: Na 147, improved
   - Continue free water in tube feeds
   - Recheck Na at 5PM
   - D5W as needed
   # Anemia: Hct has slowly decreased from 29 to 23, stable at 24.9
   - recheck hct, transfuse if hct<22
   - check retic ct
   - guaiac stools
   - type and screen
   - transfuse for hct <21 or if hypotensive
   - hemolysis labs
   # Altered mental status/Disconjugate gauze: unclear baseline, neg RPR,
   nl [**Name (NI) 8013**] and B12. Continue infectious treatment as above.
   - d/c benzos and fentanyl patch
   - EEG to assess for sz
   - monitor gauze
   - opthamalscope
   # Chronic kidney injury:  Cr of 1.3 is improved from creatinine at last
   discharge of 2 and has had elevated Cr during recent hospitalizations.
   Cr baseline was 0.6 in [**2178-8-5**].  History of AIN. Now with Cr 0.8.
   - renally dose meds
   - continue to trend creatinine
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Was on metoprolol at rehab for rate control,
   not on warfarin secondary to history of RP bleed.  CHADS score of 0.
   - holding metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - no anticoagulation for now but would consider aspirin

","The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, and morbid obesity. He presented from another hospital with urosepsis, coag-negative Staph bacteremia, and possible pneumonia superimposed on severe lung disease.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Bradyarrhythmia: The patient's heart rate is low, which can be a concern.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, indicating dehydration.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating a decrease in red blood cells.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to obstructive COPD, restrictive lung disease, and obesity hypoventilation. There is a concern for pneumonia on CT chest and recently treated pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient requires high levels of FiO2 and has increased dead space, which may indicate a pulmonary embolism (PE). An echocardiogram (ECHO) and Lower Extremity Venous Ultrasound (LENI) were performed, but no evidence of clot was found. Further evaluation for PE may be necessary if the patient stabilizes.
5. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to various factors such as sepsis, medication effects, or underlying brain pathology. An EEG may be done to assess for seizures."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints are respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with severe COPD and underlying fibrosis, which has led to chronic respiratory failure. The patient is also experiencing hyponatremia (high sodium levels) and is being treated for pseudomonas pneumonia and a urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient's vital signs indicate tachypnea (rapid breathing), high ventilator requirements, and a low oxygen saturation level of 91%. The patient's heart rate is within normal range, but blood pressure is slightly low. The patient has edema in both lower extremities, indicating possible fluid retention or kidney dysfunction. The patient's neurologic status is compromised, with decreased muscle tone and no spontaneous movements.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Kidney function appears to be impaired, as indicated by increased creatinine levels. Liver function tests are within normal range. Blood glucose levels are stable.

Imaging results show right ventricular dilations and moderate global free wall hypokinesis, suggesting cardiac dysfunction. An echocardiogram (echo) shows an ejection fraction of 60%. The patient's chest X-ray is stable, but there is evidence of pseudomonas infection in the lungs.

The patient is being treated with multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, analges"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient's medical history includes severe COPD, fibrosis, and altered mental status. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has been sedated deeply to manage ventilation. The patient is also receiving treatment for pseudomonas pneumonia and urinary tract infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD and underlying fibrosis may lead to worsening respiratory failure, making it difficult to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not appropriately managed. The presence of multiple infections, including pneumonia and urinary tract infection, increases the risk of further complications.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers or infections at the site of impaired skin.

4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia (high sodium levels), which needs to be corrected carefully to avoid complications related to fluid balance and neurological function.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may contribute to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue perfusion.

6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiovascular status is compromised, as indicated by low blood pressure and decreased peripheral pulses. This can lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential cardiovascular"

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6949**] is a 51 year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic
   respiratory failure s/p trach, COPD, and morbid obesity who presented
   from [**Hospital **] Rehab with urosepsis, coag neg staph bacteremia and
   possible pneumonia superimposed on severe lung disease.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercapneic respiratory failure: LIkely multifactoral
   respiratory failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung
   disease and obesity hypoventolation. Overnight worsening respiratory
   failure. His intrinsic PEEP and airway resistance were low, making it
   less likely to be obstructive component. s/p tracheostomy on [**2178-8-13**].
   ABG w worsening acute on chronicc respiratory acidosis with very
   elevated PCO2. On FiO2 of 40% at rehab, now requiring increasing  FiO2
   to 100%. Dead space has increased. Pt dysynchronous with vent so
   paralyzed with cisatricurium, though minimal improvement in
   ventilation. Sputum with sparse pseudomonas growth, concerning for
   resistant infection. Started on IV tobramycin. Increase in dead space
   is concerning for PE. ECHO, LENI no evidence of clot. Increased CO2 may
   be secondary to underlying infection and he has large ulcer on Right
   side.
   - continue cisatricurium
   - infectious w/u
   - continue abx including tobramycin for resistant pseudomonas
   - consider CTA to r/o PE if more stable
   - albuterol, ipratropium bronchodilators standing
   - will diurese once BP stable
   - AC/CMV, goal sats 92%
   - Opiates as needed for air hunger
   - Will need different trach when stable (current trach not stable for
   travel, was placed by thoracics)
   # Sepsis: Changed from levophed to neosyn [**10-7**] due to tachycardia. Still
   hypotensive so added vasopressin with mild improvement. WBC elevated to
   18.9. Sputum growing pseudomonas. Unclear if colonized versus new pna.
   CXR, CT scan are difficult to read due to progressive lung disease,
   unlear if PNA present. Sent repeat cultures yesterday as more
   hypotensive.
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin, will try to change to IV after
   discussing with ID
   - Cont meropenem. Vanco still supratherapeutic
   - F/u cultures
   - S/p PICC for antibiotics
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] recs for ulcer
   # Hypernatremia: Na 135 overnight, improved
   - Continue free water in tube feeds
   - Recheck Na at 5PM
    # Anemia: Hct has slowly decreased from 29 to 23, stable at 26.4
   - recheck hct, transfuse if hct<22
   - guaiac stools
   - type and screen
   - transfuse for hct <21 or if hypotensive
   - hemolysis labs
   # Altered mental status/Disconjugate gauze: unclear baseline, neg RPR,
   nl [**Name (NI) 8013**] and B12. Continue infectious treatment as above.
   - d/c benzos
   - CT head if stable
   - fentanyl patch still on before paralysis initiated therefore keep on
   - EEG to assess for sz
   # Chronic kidney injury:  Cr of 1.3 is improved from creatinine at last
   discharge of 2 and has had elevated Cr during recent hospitalizations.
   Cr baseline was 0.6 in [**2178-8-5**].  History of AIN. Now with Cr 0.8.
   - renally dose meds
   - continue to trend creatinine
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Was on metoprolol at rehab for rate control,
   not on warfarin secondary to history of RP bleed.  CHADS score of 0.
   - holding metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - no anticoagulation for now but would consider aspirin

- The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, COPD, morbid obesity, who presented from a rehab facility with urosepsis, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and possible pneumonia.
- The patient has worsening hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure, requiring increased FiO2 and mechanical ventilation.
- There is an increased dead space, concern for pulmonary embolism, and a large ulcer on the right side.
- The patient has hypernatremia, anemia, altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and impaired skin integrity.
- Chronic kidney injury is present, with a baseline creatinine of 0.6.
- The patient had atrial fibrillation but is currently not on anticoagulation.
- The patient's condition is complex, with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, secondary to obstructive COPD, restrictive lung disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and possibly a resistant infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, including elevated WBC, tachycardia, hypotension, and growth of pseudomonas in the sputum. It is unclear if this is colonization or a new pneumonia.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6949**] is a 51 year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic
   respiratory failure s/p trach, COPD, and morbid obesity who presented
   from [**Hospital **] Rehab with urosepsis, coag neg staph bacteremia and
   possible pneumonia superimposed on severe lung disease.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercapneic respiratory failure: LIkely multifactoral
   respiratory failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung
   disease and obesity hypoventolation. Overnight worsening respiratory
   failure. His intrinsic PEEP and airway resistance were low, making it
   less likely to be obstructive component. s/p tracheostomy on [**2178-8-13**].
   ABG w worsening acute on chronicc respiratory acidosis with very
   elevated PCO2. On FiO2 of 40% at rehab, now requiring increasing  FiO2
   to 100%. Dead space has increased. Pt dysynchronous with vent so
   paralyzed with cisatricurium, though minimal improvement in
   ventilation. Sputum with sparse pseudomonas growth, concerning for
   resistant infection. Started on IV tobramycin. Increase in dead space
   is concerning for PE. ECHO, LENI no evidence of clot. Increased CO2 may
   be secondary to underlying infection and he has large ulcer on Right
   side.
   - continue cisatricurium
   - infectious w/u
   - continue abx including tobramycin for resistant pseudomonas
   - albuterol, ipratropium bronchodilators standing
   - will diurese once BP stable
   - AC/CMV, goal sats 92%
   # Sepsis: On neosyn, vasopressin. WBC stable at 18.9. Vanco trough
   today pending, yesterday was still supratherapeutic at 38. Sputum
   growing pseudomonas. Unclear if colonized versus new pna. CXR, CT scan
   are difficult to read due to progressive lung disease, unlear if PNA
   present. Sent repeat cultures yesterday as more hypotensive.
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin
   - Continue IV tobra, adjust dose per
   - Cont meropenem. Vanco still supratherapeutic
   - F/u cultures
   - S/p PICC for antibiotics
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] recs for ulcer
   - resend blood, urine cultures
   # Hypernatremia: Na 135 overnight, improved
   - Continue free water in tube feeds
   - Recheck Na at 5PM
    # Anemia: Hct has slowly decreased from 29 to 23, stable at 26.4
   - recheck hct, transfuse if hct<22
   - guaiac stools
   - type and screen
   - transfuse for hct <21 or if hypotensive
   - hemolysis labs
   # Altered mental status/Disconjugate gauze: unclear baseline, neg RPR,
   nl [**Name (NI) 8013**] and B12. Continue infectious treatment as above.
   - d/c benzos
   - CT head if stable
   - fentanyl patch still on before paralysis initiated therefore keep on
   - EEG to assess for sz
   # Chronic kidney injury:  Cr of 1.3 is improved from creatinine at last
   discharge of 2 and has had elevated Cr during recent hospitalizations.
   Cr baseline was 0.6 in [**2178-8-5**].  History of AIN. Now with Cr 0.8.
   - renally dose meds
   - continue to trend creatinine
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Was on metoprolol at rehab for rate control,
   not on warfarin secondary to history of RP bleed.  CHADS score of 0.
   - holding metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - no anticoagulation for now but would consider aspirin

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, and morbid obesity. He presented from a rehabilitation hospital with urosepsis, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and possible pneumonia superimposed on severe lung disease. 

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Hypoxic/Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing worsening respiratory failure due to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease, as well as obesity hypoventilation. His intrinsic PEEP and airway resistance were low, making it less likely to be an obstructive component. The patient had a tracheostomy on [**2178-8-13**]. ABG results showed acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis with very elevated PCO2. He required increasing FiO2 to 100% and had an increase in dead space, which is concerning for pulmonary embolism (PE). An echo and leni were performed, but no evidence of clot was found. The increased CO2 may be secondary to underlying infection and he has a large ulcer on the right side.

2. Sepsis: The patient is on neosyn and vasopressin for sepsis. His WBC count is stable at 18.9. He has vancomycin trough today pending, yesterday was still supratherapeutic at 38. Sputum is growing pseudomonas"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, and morbid obesity. He presented from another hospital with urosepsis, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and possible pneumonia. He has been experiencing worsening respiratory failure, hypotension, altered mental status, and hypernatremia. The patient is currently on multiple medications including vasopressin, cisatracurium, fentanyl, midazolam, and tobramycin. He also has a large ulcer on his right flank.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure and worsening respiratory failure, which could lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of urosepsis and coag-negative staph bacteremia, indicating an ongoing infection. This increases the risk of septic shock and organ dysfunction.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating poor perfusion. This can lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential ischemia.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be managed carefully to avoid neurological complications.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to several factors including sepsis, respiratory failure, and medication effects. This can increase the risk"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several ongoing medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to COPD, obesity, superimposed ARDS, and pulmonary edema. The patient's condition is worsening, and they are unresponsive with decreased muscle tone and no spontaneous movement.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is likely caused by vasodilatory shock. The cause of the shock could be infection from an unclear source, such as pneumonia or a decubitus ulcer. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with no clear response.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient is developing metabolic acidosis, likely due to reduced urine output and rising creatinine levels. This indicates potential kidney dysfunction.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has disconjugate gaze and altered mental status. An EEG is pending to further assess the situation.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, specifically a decubitus ulcer that requires evaluation by surgery.

6. Infection: The patient's sputum culture showed pseudomonas, and blood and urine cultures are pending. This suggests a possible infection that needs to be addressed.

7. Potential Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the patient's CXR yesterday did not show any pneumonothorax, there is a possibility of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are currently experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to COPD, obesity, superimposed ARDS, and pulmonary edema. The patient also has hypotension, which is believed to be caused by vasodilatory shock, possibly from an infection of unclear source, such as pneumonia or a decubitus ulcer. Additionally, the patient is dealing with metabolic acidosis, likely due to impaired renal function and decreased urine output. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, requiring a surgical consult. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's respiratory failure and presence of ARDS, they are at risk for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Infection: The patient's hypotension may be due to an infection of unclear source, such as pneumonia or a decubitus ulcer. They are already on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, but there is no clear response yet. There is also a concern for pseudomonas infection in their sputum. They are at risk for developing sepsis or septic shock if the infection spreads.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's metabolic acidosis and rising creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function. They may be at risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) if the renal dysfunction continues.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6949**] is a 51 year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic
   respiratory failure s/p trach, COPD, and morbid obesity who presented
   from [**Hospital **] Rehab with urosepsis, coag neg staph bacteremia and
   possible pneumonia superimposed on severe lung disease.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercapneic respiratory failure: LIkely multifactoral
   respiratory failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung
   disease and obesity hypoventilation. Overnight worsening respiratory
   failure. ABG w worsening acute on chronic respiratory acidosis with
   very elevated PCO2. On FiO2 of 40% at rehab, now requiring increasing
   FiO2 to 100%. Pt dysynchronous with vent so paralyzed with
   cisatricurium, though minimal improvement in ventilation. Overnight I:E
   ratio changed back to 1:1, PEEP decreased due to elevated pressures on
   esophageal balloon with minimal changes.
   - continue cisatricurium
   - infectious w/u
   - contineu inhaled tobramycin
   - continue abx including tobramycin for resistant pseudomonas
   - albuterol, ipratropium bronchodilators standing
   - AC/CMV, goal sats 92%
   - monitor plateau pressure
   # Septic shock: On neosyn, vasopressin. WBC stable at 18.9. Vanco still
   supratherapeutic. Known resistant pseudomonas. Unclear if colonized
   versus new pna. CXR, CT scan are difficult to read due to progressive
   lung disease, unlear if PNA present. Also has a 3-4cm deep ulcer on
   right flank, no purulent fluid expressed, but concerning for site of
   infection.
   - Continue pressors, bolus with IVFs prn (U/O decreasing or MAP<65)
   - Follow lactic acid from serial ABGs
   - Continue IV tobra, adjust dose per pharmacy recs (200mg Q72h with
   peaks and troughs)
   - Cont meropenem. Vanco still supratherapeutic
   - F/u cultures
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] recs for ulcer
   - resend blood, urine cultures
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   - Continue free water in tube feeds
    # Anemia: Hct has slowly decreased from 29 to 23, stable at 26.4
   - recheck hct, transfuse if hct<22
   - guaiac stools
   - type and screen
   - transfuse for hct <21 or if hypotensive
   - hemolysis labs
   # Altered mental status/Disconjugate gaze: unclear baseline, neg RPR,
   nl [**Name (NI) 8013**] and B12. Continue infectious treatment as above.
   - d/c benzos
   - CT head if stable
   - fentanyl patch still on before paralysis initiated therefore keep on
   - EEG to assess for sz
   # Chronic kidney injury:  Cr of 1.3 is improved from creatinine at last
   discharge of 2 and has had elevated Cr during recent hospitalizations.
   Cr baseline was 0.6 in [**2178-8-5**].  History of AIN. Now with Cr 0.8.
   - renally dose meds
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - bolus IVF prn u/o
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Was on metoprolol at rehab for rate control,
   not on warfarin secondary to history of RP bleed.  CHADS score of 0.
   - holding metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - no anticoagulation for now but would consider aspirin

","The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, and morbid obesity. He presented from another hospital with urosepsis, coag-negative Staph bacteremia, and possible pneumonia superimposed on severe lung disease.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure, septic shock, hypernatremia, anemia, altered mental status/disconjugate gaze, chronic kidney injury, and atrial fibrillation.

Key findings and assessments:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has worsening respiratory failure due to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease, as well as obesity hypoventilation. He is now on 100% FiO2 and requires increased support.
2. Sepsis: The patient is in septic shock and has a history of resistant pseudomonas bacteremia. Unclear if colonized or new pneumonia. Cultures are pending.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are high, but it has resolved.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased from 29 to 23 and is currently stable at 26.4. Further evaluation and transfusion if necessary.
5. Altered Mental Status/Disconjugate Gaze: The patient's mental status is altered, and he has a disconjugate gaze. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

   supratherapeutic at 32. Known resistant pseudomonas. Unclear if
   colonized versus new pna. CXR, CT scan are difficult to read due to
   progressive lung disease, unlear if PNA present. Also has a 3-4cm deep
   ulcer on right flank, no purulent fluid expressed, but concerning for
   site of infection.
   - Continue pressors, bolus with IVFs prn (U/O decreasing or MAP<65)

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, COPD, morbid obesity, and recent hospitalizations for urosepsis and bacteremia. He presented with worsening respiratory failure and is now in the ICU. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney injury, hypernatremia, anemia, altered mental status, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure has worsened, requiring increased FiO2 and paralysis. He is at risk for further deterioration and may require tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and bacteremia, and there are concerns about a new pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of infection and septic shock is necessary.
3. Chronic kidney injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.6, but it has improved from previous hospitalizations. Monitoring renal function and adjusting medications accordingly is important.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels have resolved, but vigilance is needed to prevent recurrence.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have decreased, indicating the need for further evaluation and potential transfusion.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status requires further assessment, including ruling out delirium, seizures, or other causes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with chronic hyperCO2 respiratory failure, urosepsis, and Staph bacteremia. He has been diagnosed with pseudomonal pneumonia and is currently in the ICU. The patient is paralyzed, morbidly obese, and on mechanical ventilation. He has a wound on his right upper flank, and his respiratory status remains unstable with persistent acidemia and elevated dead space. The patient's white blood cell count is rising, indicating ongoing infection. He is receiving multiple antibiotics and vasopressors due to septic shock. There are concerns about his mental status, and further evaluation is needed. The patient's family dynamics are also a concern.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD/fibrosis, along with pseudomonal pneumonia, continues to require mechanical ventilation support. The need for prolonged paralysis increases the risk of ventilator-associated complications such as ventilator-induced lung injury or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may lead to further organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Close monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and coagulation parameters is essential.

3. Pseudomonal infection: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a difficult-to-treat infection, and the patient's resistance to certain antibiotics may delay recovery. Inadequate source control or inadequate antibiotic therapy may contribute to persistent infection"

   # Hypoxic/Hypercapneic respiratory failure: Likely multifactoral
   respiratory failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung
   disease and obesity hypoventilation. Overnight worsening respiratory
   failure. ABG w worsening acute on chronic respiratory acidosis with
   very elevated PCO2. On FiO2 of 40% at rehab, now requiring increasing
   FiO2 to 100%. Pt dysynchronous with vent so paralyzed with
   cisatricurium, though minimal improvement in ventilation. Yesterday
   sats improved with amps of bicarb for acidosis and pressors to keep
   SBP>110. This am, PEEP was increased again to 14 due to de-sat while
   turning on current setting with ABG that showed worsening acidosis,

","Summary:
- The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, COPD, morbid obesity, who presented from another hospital with urosepsis, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and possible pneumonia.
- He has worsening hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure, possibly due to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease, as well as obesity hypoventilation.
- The patient is currently on multiple pressors, including vasopressin, norepinephrine, and levophed, to maintain blood pressure above 110.
- His oxygenation has improved with bicarbonate infusion, but he still requires FiO2 100% and is paralyzed with cisatracurium.
- He has anemia with a decreasing hematocrit from 29 to 22, possibly due to bone marrow suppression.
- The patient also has altered mental status, disconjugate gaze, and an ulcer on his right flank, which could be a source of infection.
- He has hypernatremia, which has resolved, and chronic kidney injury with a creatinine level of 0.8.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation is not being treated with warfarin due to a history of retroperitoneal bleed.
- He is receiving various medications, including antibiotics for resistant pseudomonas infection, bronchodilators, and other ICU care interventions.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6949**] is a 51 year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic
   respiratory failure s/p trach, COPD, and morbid obesity who presented
   from [**Hospital **] Rehab with urosepsis, coag neg staph bacteremia and
   possible pneumonia superimposed on severe lung disease.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercapneic respiratory failure: LIkely multifactoral
   respiratory failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung
   disease and obesity hypoventilation. Overnight worsening respiratory
   failure. ABG w worsening acute on chronic respiratory acidosis with
   very elevated PCO2. On FiO2 of 40% at rehab, now requiring increasing
   FiO2 to 100%. Pt dysynchronous with vent so paralyzed with
   cisatricurium, though minimal improvement in ventilation. Overnight I:E
   ratio changed back to 1:1, PEEP decreased due to elevated pressures on
   esophageal balloon with minimal changes.
   - continue cisatricurium
   - infectious w/u
   - contineu inhaled tobramycin
   - continue abx including tobramycin for resistant pseudomonas
   - albuterol, ipratropium bronchodilators standing
   - AC/CMV, goal sats 92%
   - monitor plateau pressure
   # Septic shock: On neosyn, vasopressin. WBC continues to climb. Vanco
   still supratherapeutic. Known resistant pseudomonas. Have started
   inhaled and IV tobra. Also has a 3-4cm deep ulcer on right flank, no
   purulent fluid expressed, but concerning for site of infection.
   - Continue pressors, bolus with IVFs prn (U/O decreasing or MAP<65)
   - Follow lactic acid from serial ABGs
   - Continue IV tobra, adjust dose per pharmacy recs (200mg Q72h with
   peaks and troughs)
   - Cont meropenem. Vanco still supratherapeutic
   - F/u cultures
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] recs for ulcer
   - resend blood, urine cultures
    # Anemia: Hct has slowly decreased from 29 to 22.  Received 1U PRBCs
   overnight.
   - ck retic count, may have component of BM suppression
   - recheck hct, transfuse if hct<22
   - guaiac stools
   - type and screen
   - transfuse for hct <21 or if hypotensive
   - hemolysis labs negative
   # Altered mental status/Disconjugate gaze: unclear baseline, neg RPR,
   nl [**Name (NI) 8013**] and B12. Continue infectious treatment as above.
   - d/c benzos
   - CT head if stable
   - fentanyl patch still on before paralysis initiated therefore keep on
   - EEG to assess for sz
   # R flank ulcer: From prior chest tube. Seen by wound care who
   recommended surgical consult. Possible source of infection.
   - continue [**Last Name (un) **]
   - ? surgical consult
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   - Continue free water in tube feeds
   # Chronic kidney injury:  Cr of 1.3 is improved from creatinine at last
   discharge of 2 and has had elevated Cr during recent hospitalizations.
   Cr baseline was 0.6 in [**2178-8-5**].  History of AIN. Now with Cr 0.8.
   - renally dose meds
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - bolus IVF prn u/o
    # Atrial fibrillation:  Was on metoprolol at rehab for rate control,
   not on warfarin secondary to history of RP bleed.  CHADS score of 0.
   - holding metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   -  no anticoagulation for now but would consider aspirin

- The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, COPD, and morbid obesity.
- He presented from a rehabilitation hospital with urosepsis, coag-negative Staph bacteremia, and possible pneumonia.
- The patient has been experiencing worsening respiratory failure, including hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure due to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung disease, as well as obesity hypoventilation.
- He has been treated with inhaled tobramycin and meropenem for suspected resistant pseudomonas infection.
- The patient also has septic shock, which has been managed with neosynephrine and vasopressin.
- He has anemia, with a decreasing hematocrit level from 29 to 22, and has received one unit of packed red blood cells overnight.
- The patient has altered mental status and disconjugate gaze, but his baseline mental status is unclear.
- He has a right flank ulcer that may be a source of infection.
- The patient had hypernatremia, which has resolved.
- He has chronic kidney injury, with an improved creatinine level from 2 at discharge to 1.3.
- The patient was previously on metoprolol for rate control of atrial fibrillation but is not currently on anticoagulation therapy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, COPD, morbid obesity, urosepsis, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and possible pneumonia.
- The patient presented from another hospital with hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure, which is likely multifactoral and secondary to obstructive COPD, restrictive lung disease, and obesity hypoventilation.
- Overnight, the patient's respiratory failure worsened, with an ABG showing acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis and very elevated PCO2.
- The patient was placed on FiO2 of 100% and paralyzed with cisatracurium due to dysynchronous ventilation.
- The patient received multiple amps of bicarb for acidosis and pressors to maintain SBP > 110.
- The PEEP was increased to 14 due to desaturation, and a STAT chest X-ray was ordered to rule out pneumothorax.
- Infectious workup, including blood cultures, was continued, and inhaled tobramycin was started.
- The patient is also being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for resistant pseudomonas and bronchodilators.
- The patient's WBC count continues to climb, and he is on neosyn and vasopressin for septic shock.
- A 3-4 cm deep ulcer on the right flank was noted, and cultures were sent.
- The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells overnight due to decreasing Hct.
- Other concerns include altered mental status, disconjugate gaze, anemia, respiratory failure, chronic, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and hypernatremia.
- The patient's Cr has improved from 2 at discharge to 0.8, with a baseline of 0.6 on [**2178-8-5**].
- The patient was on metoprolol for rate control but is not on warfarin due to a history of retroperitoneal bleed.
- The patient's current vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 37.0°C, HR: 97 bpm, BP: 145/83 mmHg, RR: 34 breaths/min, SpO2: 95%, and heart rhythm is SR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactoral and secondary to obstructive COPD, restrictive lung disease, and obesity hypoventilation. Worsening respiratory failure could lead to further hypoxia and hypercapnia.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, and there is evidence of infection with coag-negative staph bacteremia and possible pneumonia. Sepsis could progress to septic shock and organ dysfunction if not managed appropriately.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased from 29 to 22, indicating anemia. If not managed properly, anemia could lead to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.
4. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status and disconjugate gaze. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, which could include infection, metabolic disturbances, or other neurological issues.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, as evidenced by a 3-4 cm deep ulcer on the right flank. This could be a source of infection and may require surgical intervention.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia,"

   from [**Hospital **] Rehab with urosepsis, coag neg staph bacteremia and
   possible pneumonia superimposed on severe lung disease.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercapneic respiratory failure: Likely multifactoral
   respiratory failure secondary to obstructive COPD and restrictive lung
   disease and obesity hypoventilation. Overnight worsening respiratory
   failure. ABG w worsening acute on chronic respiratory acidosis with
   very elevated PCO2. On FiO2 of 40% at rehab, now requiring increasing
   FiO2 to 100%. Pt dysynchronous with vent so paralyzed with
   cisatricurium, though minimal improvement in ventilation. Yesterday
   sats improved with amps of bicarb for acidosis and pressors to keep
   SBP>110. This am, PEEP was increased again to 12 due to de-sat while
   turning on current setting with ABG that showed worsening acidosis,
   hypoxia. Hypoxia now worsening with PO2 in 30s on last ABG.

   # Septic shock: On neosyn, levophed, vasopressin. WBC continues to
   climb. Vanco still supratherapeutic. Known resistant pseudomonas. On
   inhaled and IV tobra. Also has a 3-4cm deep ulcer on right flank, no
   purulent fluid expressed, but concerning for site of infection.
   - Continue pressors, bolus with IVFs (U/O decreasing or MAP<65)
   - Follow lactic acid from serial ABGs

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, COPD, morbid obesity, urosepsis, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and possible pneumonia. He presented with hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure, worsening over the night. The patient's current condition includes severe lung disease, obesity hypoventilation, septic shock, anemia, respiratory failure, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and chronic kidney injury. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, receiving multiple medications including tobramycin, meropenem, lasix, heparin, fentanyl, and lansoprazole. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure has worsened overnight, with ABG showing worsening acute on chronic respiratory acidosis and very elevated PCO2. The patient is currently on FiO2 of 100% and receiving paralysis with cisatricurium.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis with coag-negative staph bacteremia and possible pneumonia. The WBC count is climbing, indicating an ongoing infection.
3. Septic Shock: The patient is in septic shock, requiring pressors including neo, levophed, and vasopressin. The patient's blood pressure is low, and there are concerns about organ dysfunction.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, COPD, morbid obesity, urosepsis, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and possible pneumonia. He presented from a rehabilitation hospital with worsening respiratory failure, requiring increasing FiO2 and PEEP. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with minimal improvement in ventilation despite paralysis. His ABG shows worsening acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis with very elevated PCO2. He also has septic shock, requiring pressors and vasopressin. His WBC count is still climbing, and he has a deep ulcer on his right flank, which may be a source of infection. Other conditions include anemia, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and hypernatremia, which has resolved. He also has chronic kidney injury and a history of acute interstitial nephritis. He was previously on metoprolol for rate control in atrial fibrillation but is not on warfarin due to a history of retroperitoneal bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory failure indicates a potential complication. The high levels of PCO2 and low oxygen saturation suggest inadequate ventilation and oxygenation. Continuous monitoring of ABG and respiratory parameters is necessary to assess and manage this condition.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and climbing WBC count indicate a possible"

   Hypoxemic, hypercapneic respiratory failure with large dead space and
   little respiratory reserve given underlying fibrosis, COPD and PNA
   has made very small progress, with this morning acute worsening in
   hypoxemia and rising CO2, despite maximal ventilatory support, as well
   as maximal pressor therapy, and s/p trial treatment with lasix.
   - continuing maximal ventilatory support, paralysis
   - continue abx
   - continue bronchodilators.
   - poor prognosis due to sustained hypoxemia; family made aware.
   Septic shock
 now on triple pressors (levo, vaso, neo)
 with little
   response in BP despite pushing bicarb
 likely secondary to PNA,
   continuing on tobramycin/vanco/meropenem (with vanc doses on hold for
   supratherapeutic vanc level).
   LFT abnormalities
 sudden rise in LFT abnormalities (with normal GGT,

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-inch tall, 160 kg morbidly obese male with a history of COPD and pneumonia (PNA) who is currently in the ICU due to hypoxemic, hypercapneic respiratory failure. He has been on maximal ventilatory support and pressor therapy, but his condition has worsened this morning with sustained hypoxemia. He is also experiencing septic shock, likely secondary to PNA, and has elevated liver enzymes indicating possible early manifestations of shock liver. The patient is currently unarousable and requires paralysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed and performing frequent suctioning of secretions will be taken to minimize this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and obesity increase the risk of developing DVT, which can potentially lead to a life-threatening PE. Prophylactic measures such as heparin subcutaneous injections will be implemented.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Prophylactic treatment with a proton pump inhibitor will be given to prevent this complication.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state due to septic shock and prolonged ICU stay increases the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypoxemic, hypercapneic respiratory failure with large dead space and
   little respiratory reserve given underlying fibrosis, COPD and PNA
   has made very small progress, with this morning acute worsening in
   hypoxemia and rising CO2, despite maximal ventilatory support, as well
   as maximal pressor therapy, and s/p trial treatment with lasix without
   improvement in O2 sats and ventilation
   - continuing maximal ventilatory support, paralysis
   - continue abx
   - continue bronchodilators.
   - poor prognosis due to sustained hypoxemia; family made aware of
   likely imminent cardiovascular collapse
   Septic shock
 now on triple pressors (levo, vaso, neo)
 with little
   response in BP despite pushing bicarb
 likely secondary to PNA,
   continuing on tobramycin/vanco/meropenem (with vanc doses on hold for
   supratherapeutic vanc level).
   LFT abnormalities
 sudden rise in LFT abnormalities (with normal GGT,
   CK)
 suspect early manifestations of shock liver.
   Altered mental status
 continues to require paralysis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a morbidly obese individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing worsening hypoxemia and rising carbon dioxide levels despite maximal ventilatory support and maximal pressor therapy. The patient's condition has not improved with the administration of Lasix. The patient is currently on triple pressors for septic shock, likely secondary to pneumonia (PNA). There is also a mention of sudden rise in liver function test abnormalities, suggesting possible early manifestations of shock liver. The patient requires paralysis due to altered mental status. The patient's prognosis is poor, with the family being informed of the likely imminent cardiovascular collapse. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a severe compromise in oxygenation, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.
2. Hypercapneic respiratory failure: The elevated carbon dioxide levels suggest inadequate ventilation, leading to acidosis and potential neurological complications.
3. Septic shock: The patient's dependence on triple pressors indicates severe hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ failure and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
4. Pneumonia (PNA): The presence of known pseudomonas in the sputum indicates an ongoing infection, which can worsen the patient's respiratory status and contribute to septic shock.
5. Liver dysfunction: The sudden rise in liver function test abnormalities may indicate"
