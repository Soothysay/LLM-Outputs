   Plan:
   # Septic shock - Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   tachypnea, and fever. Likely is aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia given
   history end stage Parkinson's and swallowing difficulty which place him
   at high risk for aspiration. Initial chest radiograph with evidence of
   bilateral opacities, repeat 4 hrs later consistant with ARDS.  Patient
   was paralyzed to achieve adaquate ventilation.
   - RIJ in place
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr
   - check central venous oxygen saturation
 Transfuse 1 U if low
   - pan culture blood, urine, and sputum
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin, Cefepime to cover
   pulmonary and GU sources, narrow abx pending sputum culture
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   - Echo to eval for heart failure given bilateral costophrenic haziness
   on CXR today
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Due to aspiration
   - sedation with fentanyl and versed
   - paralyzation with cisatracurium, Appropriate to try pt off
   paralyzation today and eval for synchronous/spontaneous breathing
   - wean FiO2 and PEEP to keep O2 >90% or PO2>60
   - titrate RR and TV to optimize acid/base status: given his current
   pathology, pH>7.25 would be appropriate to minimize vent associated
   lung injury
   .
   # Parkinson's disease- on Sinemet at home but unable to crush pills.
   - call pharmacy for possible alternatives
   .
   # Anemia
   - can transfuse if CV SO2 is low to keep Hct >30

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with Parkinson's disease who is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He also has hypotension, sepsis, and pneumonia. The patient is oliguric, tachycardic, and has been paralyzed. His condition is critical, and he has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function, which may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma from mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis increases the risk of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and neurological complications.
3. Pneumonia: The aspiration pneumonia may progress, leading to worsening lung infiltrates and systemic infection.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or the effects of mechanical ventilation. Persistent hypotension may lead to poor organ perfusion and acute kidney injury.
5. Paralysis: The use of paralytic agents for sedation increases the risk of muscle weakness and prolonged immobility.
6. Nutritional Complications: The patient's inability to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. Overnight, there were difficulties in ventilating the patient, primarily attributed to wheezing, which required a change in ventilation mode to PCV and pharmacological paralysis. A chest X-ray demonstrated progressive infiltrates. The patient also developed hypotension, which required the initiation of vasopressor support.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including aspiration and progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis, with a contribution from positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Fluid repletion and vasopressor support are being provided to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.
3. Sepsis: There is concern for a pulmonary source of infection, as well as possible urinary tract involvement. Empirical antimicrobials have been initiated.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration. Continued empirical antimicrobial therapy is planned.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia has improved and is likely attributed to hypovolemia. Heart rate monitoring is ongoing.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia complicated by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient is also experiencing hypotension, likely due to hypovolemia and sepsis. There are concerns about a possible urinary source of infection as well. The patient has been prescribed empirical antimicrobials to address the suspected pneumonia and sepsis. Other issues include tachycardia, oliguria (low urine output), and paralysis. The patient's Parkinson's disease appears to be stable, and nutritional support has been initiated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function remains compromised, which may lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: With multiple organ dysfunction, there is a risk of progressing to septic shock and multiple organ failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates poor perfusion and may lead to organ hypoperfusion and ischemia.
4. Oliguria: Reduced urine output suggests possible renal dysfunction or hypoperfusion, which can result in acute kidney injury.
5. Paralysis: The patient's current paralysis may persist or worsen, leading to immobility and increased risk of complications such as pressure ulcers and"

   D/C'd paralytic at 5pm last night after patient's ABGs w/ pH>7.25.
   Began to have increase in asynchronous breathing around 23:30.  ABG
   showed a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis (hyperchloremic,
   likely secondary to NS resuscitation).  Was given 2amps of bicarb in
   d5W, fluid resuscitation was continued with LR.  The patient continued
   to fight the vent and we decided to D/C fentanyl and versed and try
   propofol.  Patient became more comfortable, and ABGs improved markedly

   D/C'd paralytic at 5pm last night after patient's ABGs w/ pH>7.25.
   Began to have increase in asynchronous breathing around 23:30.  ABG
   showed a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis (hyperchloremic,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease and dysphagia who presented with septic shock due to a likely aspiration event. He meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever. The initial chest radiograph showed bilateral opacities, with the right side being greater than the left. This suggests an acute aspiration event. 

The patient has been receiving IV fluids to achieve a target CVP of 8-12, and transfusions have been given to maintain a Hct > 30. IV fluid boluses and Levophed have been used to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr. The plan is to wean Levophed this morning. Central venous oxygen saturation will be monitored, and blood, urine, and sputum cultures will be followed up. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover pulmonary and GU sources, with narrow-spectrum antibiotics pending sputum culture results. The WBC count fever curve will be trended.

The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure caused by aspiration. Propofol has been started, and fentanyl and versed have been discontinued. FiO2 and PEEP will be weaned to optimize oxygenation, and RR and TV will be titrated to optimize acid/base status, keeping pH > 7.25.

The patient has Parkinson's disease and is on Sinemet"

The patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease and dysphagia who presented with septic shock due to likely aspiration. The patient meets ARDS criteria and is currently intubated. Initial chest radiograph showed bilateral opacities, with the right side being greater than the left. The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease and swallowing difficulty, placing him at high risk for aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to intubation and ARDS. Close monitoring and weaning of FiO2 and PEEP are necessary to optimize oxygenation.
2. Septic shock: The patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever. The likely source of sepsis is pulmonary given the history of end-stage Parkinson's and swallowing difficulty. IV fluids, transfusion for Hct > 30, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are required to manage septic shock.
3. Anemia: The patient has a low Hct level of 28.6%. Blood transfusion may be necessary to increase the Hct to 30-35% or baseline.
4. GERD: The patient has a history of GERD. Continuing PPI (Protonix) is recommended.
5. FEN (Foley catheter): Holding TF (urine output) is mentioned, indicating the need for close monitoring of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis, respiratory failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of sepsis, hypotension.
   Currently improved, good gas exchange.  Evolving pulmonary infiltrates
   may represent progressive pneuonia, pulmonary edema (cardiogenic,
   underlying diastolic dysfunction) or ARDS.  Oxygenation remains
   remarkably favorable.  Doubt alveolar hemorrhage.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation. Monitor ABG.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.  Continue iv fluids,
   vasopressor, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg
   SEPSIS -- no clear etiology, although concerns include pneumonia.
   Cultures pending.  Continue current level of care, including empirical
   antibiotics.  Monitor lactic acid.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure and sepsis. They remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient had poor tolerance of tube feeds last night, resulting in high residual volumes. The patient's arterial line was started yesterday at 11:00 AM. Propofol was initiated, leading to good effect. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 94/55 to 72/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 7,530 mL and output of 1,635 mL, resulting in a balance of 5,895 mL. The patient is receiving SIMV/PSV/AutoFlow ventilation mode with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 26, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, and normal peripheral pulses. The cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI) and S1 and S2 heart sounds. The respiratory examination demonstrates clear breath sounds. The abdominal"

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis, respiratory failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of sepsis, hypotension.
   Currently improved, good gas exchange.  Evolving pulmonary infiltrates
   may represent progressive pneuonia, pulmonary edema (cardiogenic,
   underlying diastolic dysfunction) or ARDS.  Oxygenation remains
   remarkably favorable.  Doubt alveolar hemorrhage.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation. Monitor ABG.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.  Continue iv fluids,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, indicating severe respiratory distress. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antimicrobials, but the source of sepsis is still unclear.

The patient's vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 38 degrees Celsius and a current temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius. The heart rate is elevated at 104 beats per minute, and the blood pressure is low at 94/55 mmHg. The respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation is 98%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, an elevated lactate level of 2.2 mmol/L, and decreased platelets with a count of 143 K/uL. The blood glucose level is within normal range at 95 mg/dL.

The chest X-ray shows the development of bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, which may indicate pneumonia or pulmonary edema. The infiltrates could be due to progressive pneumonia, cardiogenic pulmonary edema (possibly related to underlying diastolic dysfunction), or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The assessment and plan include continuing mechanical ventilation, monitoring arterial blood gases (ABG), maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg with vasop"

The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. They were admitted with respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient has been on SIMV mode with IPS, and their medications have been adjusted. They are currently on Propofol, Norepinephrine, Pantoprazole, and Midazolam.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/55 mmHg to 72/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The physical examination reveals that the patient appears comfortable without any signs of distress. Their eyes are pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Their cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Their peripheral vascular examination is unremarkable, with no cyanosis or clubbing noted. Their respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds bilaterally, with no crackles, wheezes, or diminished breath sounds. Their abdominal examination is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Their extremities are warm and well-perfused, without any evidence of muscle wasting or edema. Their neurologic examination is unremarkable, with the patient being sedated and responsive to verbal stimuli."

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and a history of aspiration events. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a history of sacral decubitus ulcer, and his recent labs show anemia with a hematocrit level of 26. The patient has multiple comorbidities including Parkinson's disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and anemia. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and sedation with propofol. The plan includes daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), daily respiratory system compliance and resistance index (RSBI) assessments, and weaning of FiO2 and PEEP to optimize oxygenation. The patient's condition needs close monitoring for potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and daily chest X-rays will be important for early detection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as sub"

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- bilateral pneumonia vs early signs of ARDS.
   Good progress.  Maintain mechanical ventilation, lung protective
   strategy.  Monitor ABG
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia.  Continue volume
   resuscitation, vasopressor as needed to maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   SEPSIS -- no identified cultures, but concerns for pneumonia and UTI.
   Continue current level of support, empirical antimicrobials.
   ANEMIA -- no clinical evidence for blood loss.  Likely predominately
   dilutional and blood draws.
   HYPOPHOSPHOTEMIA -- replete to >2.5
   FLUIDS
 replete to CVP > 8 cm H2O.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and respiratory failure due to aspiration events, leading to ARDS. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, but he is still dependent on propofol for sedation and norepinephrine for hemodynamic support. The patient has anemia with a Hct of 26% and is being transfused with PRBCs to maintain a Hct above 28%. He also has a history of GERD and is on PPI therapy. The patient's code status is confirmed as DNR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and sputum cultures is necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT formation, which can lead to PE. Prophylactic measures such as heparin and early mobilization should be implemented.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and the use of certain medications like norepinephrine increase the risk of stress ulcers. Monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding and providing stress ulcer prophylaxis are important.
4. Pancreatitis: Propofol use can be associated"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease and dysphagia who presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely due to an aspiration event.
- The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- Vital signs include a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/63 to 87/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- Physical examination reveals diffuse expiratory wheezes/rhonchi and pupils that are 3mm but reactive to light.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there are abnormalities in potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and liver function tests.
- The patient's medical history includes Parkinson's disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and anemia.
- The plan includes continuing daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) assessments, and wake-up tests to evaluate the patient's readiness for extubation.
- The patient will be weaned off propofol sedation, and efforts will be made to reduce reliance on norepinephrine (levophed) while maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
- Other interventions include monitoring fluid balance, maintaining urine output above 30cc/hr, following I&O, and obtaining blood, urine, and sputum cultures.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover potential pulmonary and gastrointestinal sources of infection.
- The patient's Parkinson's disease medications, including Sinemet, will continue to be administered.
- Anemia management includes checking hematocrit levels regularly and transfusing packed red blood cells (PRBCs) as needed to keep hemoglobin levels above 28.
- GERD management involves continuing proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.
- FEN (likely referring to feeding) goals include advancing tube feeding to 40cc/hr as tolerated while replacing lost electrolytes, including phosphate.
- Access includes the placement of a radial arterial line (RIJ) and consideration for additional lines if needed.
- Precautions include preventing pressure ulcers, using chlorhexidine for skin cleansing, elevating the head of bed, and using subcutaneous heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- Code status is confirmed as do not resuscitate (DNR).
- Disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure due to ARDS requires close monitoring and management of mechanical ventilation settings.
2. Infection: The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics indicates a concern for hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration events leading to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has failed several spontaneous breathing tests (SBTs) and is unable to maintain adequate mean arterial pressures (MAPs) without norepinephrine. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 76 to 126 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, but there is an elevated lactate level and slightly elevated levels of lactic acid.

The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS likely due to an aspiration event. The plan is to continue daily SBTs, RSBI assessments, and daily wake-ups to evaluate the patient's status. FiO2 and PEEP will be titrated to optimize oxygenation, and daily chest X-rays will be performed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They have been unresponsive to spontaneous breathing trials, indicating poor tolerance. The patient has a history of sepsis, likely secondary to pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. They also have hypotension attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis, as well as thrombocytopenia. The patient recently experienced new-onset atrial fibrillation, which has now resolved spontaneously.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates a serious complication that requires immediate medical intervention. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is slowly responding to current therapy, suggesting an ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms is necessary to guide appropriate antimicrobial treatment.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis. It is essential to maintain adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support to ensure organ perfusion.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count requires evaluation for potential causes, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Immediate cessation of heparin and assessment for HIT antibodies are"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They have respiratory failure, with poor tolerance of a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) characterized by increased respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and reduced oxygen saturation. The patient also has sepsis, attributed to pneumonia possibly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. They are receiving appropriate antimicrobial therapy and supportive care. Hypotension is present due to hypovolemia and sepsis, and the patient is being volume resuscitated and maintained on vasopressors. Other concerns include nutritional support, renal function monitoring, and thrombocytopenia assessment for HIT antibodies before discontinuing heparin. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Barotrauma: The high pressure from mechanical ventilation can lead to lung injury and pneumothorax.
3. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Improper settings on the ventilator, such as high tidal volumes or plateau pressures, can cause further damage to the lungs.
4. Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI): Severe sepsis and septic shock can lead to renal dysfunction.
5. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at"

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent;  bronchospasm today --> possible
   reactive airways in setting of infection.  Would add steroids.
   SEPSIS -- slowly responding to current therapy.  Suspect pneumonia
   (?staph areus).  Continue suportive care.  Continue antimicrobials.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis (CVP <8).  Continue
   to volume resussitate, maintain vasopressor.  Propofol may be
   contributing to hypotension.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Continue to iv resussitate to CVP >8 cm H2O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF @ goal.
   RENAL FUCTION -- preserved.  monitor urine output, BUN, creatinine.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- d/c heparin, check HIT antibodies.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated. They have a history of sepsis and pneumonia, which is suspected to be caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension, and they require vasopressors for support.

The patient has a decreased white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Their blood glucose levels are within normal range, but their creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are elevated, suggesting potential kidney dysfunction.

The patient is receiving nutritional support through tube feeding (TF) and is being monitored for renal function. They are also on prophylactic anticoagulation therapy, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention measures.

The patient's family has been informed about the severity of the illness and the prognosis, with a high mortality rate. The plan is to continue current care and reassess daily. The possibility of advancing to tracheotomy/peg tube or changing goals of care to focus on comfort will be decided by Monday.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to bronchospasm or pneumonia.
2. Sepsis or infection due to immunocompromised state.
3. Hypotension"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and ARDS likely due to aspiration. He has been intubated for 5 days and meets ARDS criteria. The patient failed spontaneous breathing tests (SBTs) and will continue daily SBTs to assess his status. The plan is to wean FiO2 and PEEP to optimize oxygenation, perform daily chest X-rays, and titrate RR and TV to optimize acid/base status with permissive hypercapnia of pH >7.25.

The patient is also experiencing septic shock/hypotension, and efforts will be made to wean levophed while maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60. IV fluids will be given to achieve a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10-12, and the patient's I&O will be followed to maintain urine output >30cc/hr. The sputum culture is positive for Staph aureus, so broad-spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin and Cefepime will be administered to cover pulmonary and GU sources, with narrow antibiotics pending sensitivities.

Other issues include sacral decubitus ulcers, which will be treated with wound care using duoderm with allevin foam and changed every three days. The patient has not had a bowel movement since Sunday, so bowel regimen will be started, and abdominal films will be taken. His Parkinson's disease"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure. They are intubated and mechanically ventilated, indicating severe respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs show hypotension (BP: 88/44 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR: 87 bpm). The patient has a history of supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation (A-fib), and requires vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.1 mmol/L. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.35 and a PaCO2 of 39 mmHg.

The patient's condition is complicated by possible pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), congestive heart failure (CHF), and bronchospasm. They are being treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and steroids for wheezing, which could be due to cardiac or bronchospasm causes. The patient also has sepsis, and the source of infection is uncertain between pulmonary or urinary.

Overall, the potential medical complications for this patient include respiratory failure, pneumonia, ARDS, CH"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure and a history of sepsis. They have experienced episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, both of which have been resolved. The patient is unable to provide a history due to being sedated and intubated. They have a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which is a critical condition requiring immediate medical intervention. If not properly managed, it can lead to further respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and even cardiac arrest.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, indicating a severe systemic infection. Sepsis can progress to septic shock, organ dysfunction, and multiple organ failure if not promptly treated.

3. Arrhythmias: The patient has had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. These arrhythmias can potentially worsen and lead to hemodynamic instability, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of thromboembolic events.

4. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, indicating anemia. Severe anemia can cause tissue hypoxia, fatigue, and decreased oxygen delivery to vital organs.

5. Renal Function: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. Acute kidney injury or chronic kidney"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and ARDS likely due to an aspiration event. The patient is currently on day 6 of intubation and meets ARDS criteria. The plan includes continuing daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs), RSBI assessment, and daily wake-ups to evaluate the patient's status. Additionally, optimizing oxygenation by weaning FiO2 and PEEP, performing daily chest X-rays, titrating RR and TV to optimize acid/base status with permissive hypercapnia of pH >7.25, addressing vent weaning, considering tracheostomy, and discussing goals of care on Monday are all part of the plan. 

The patient also has tachycardia with negative cardiac enzymes, and it is planned to complete a dig load today and start a daily dose of dig tomorrow. Daily EKGs will be followed, and electrolytes will be repleted. 

In terms of septic shock/hypotension, the patient will try to wean levophed but maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Propofol will be considered on day 3, along with Fentanyl/Versed. IV fluids will be given to achieve a central venous pressure (CVP) between 10-12, and the CVP tracing will be printed for assessment. The patient's urine output will be maintained above 30cc/hr"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and ARDS likely due to an aspiration event. He is currently on day 7 of intubation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has thick yellow secretions and requires levophed for MAP 55-70. He is also on various medications including furosemide, propofol, digoxin, and antibiotics. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin and platelet count, and abnormal kidney function. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, septic shock/hypotension, tachycardia, sacral decubitus ulcer, gastrointestinal issues, thrombocytopenia, anemia, GERD, and poor nutritional intake.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated for 7 days and meets ARDS criteria due to an aspiration event. He requires ongoing respiratory support with mechanical ventilation.
2. Septic shock/hypotension: The patient is on day 6 of broad-spectrum antibiotics for a positive sputum culture for Staphylococcus aureus. He requires careful monitoring and management of blood pressure to maintain adequate organ perfusion.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate remains elevated, and he is started on digoxin to help control it. Close monitoring of the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent.  Limited progress.  RSBI unfavorable
   for SBT.  ABG --> would decrease Ve to allow pH= 7.35-7.40.  Suspect
   would benefit from tracheotomy if acceptable to patient and family.
   Probable ARDS and underlying COPD.  Check for intrinsic peak.
   SEPSIS -- persistent.  Continue empirical antimicrobials for 10 day
   course.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis.  Continue vasopressor to maintain
   MAP >60 mmHg.
   A-FIB -- continue po Digoxin.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- preserved.  Monitor uo, BUN, creat.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPORT -- TF @ goal.
   PARKINSON'S DISEASE -- continue usual meds.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They have been diagnosed with respiratory failure, sepsis, and are suspected to have ARDS and underlying COPD. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/47 to 108/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is on vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. They have a history of atrial fibrillation, for which they are being treated with digoxin. The patient's renal function is preserved, and their nutritional support is being provided through tube feeding. Parkinson's disease medications are continued, and fluid balance is monitored closely. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure persists, limiting their progress. They have an unfavorable respiratory system compliance (RSBI) for spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), suggesting that extubation may not be feasible at this time. Tracheotomy is considered as a potential intervention.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is ongoing, with persistent infection indicated by the ongoing need for empirical antimicrobials. Monitoring of inflammatory markers and source control measures should be continued to manage"

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent.  Limited progress.  RSBI unfavorable
   for SBT.  ABG --> would decrease Ve to allow pH= 7.35-7.40.  Suspect
   would benefit from tracheotomy if acceptable to patient and family.
   Probable ARDS and underlying COPD.  Check for intrinsic peak.
   SEPSIS -- persistent.  Continue empirical antimicrobials for 10 day
   course.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis.  Continue vasopressor to maintain
   MAP >60 mmHg.
   A-FIB -- continue po Digoxin.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- preserved.  Monitor uo, BUN, creat.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPORT -- TF @ goal.
   PARKINSON'S DISEASE -- continue usual meds.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They remain intubated and mechanically ventilated, and their condition remains unchanged with persistent respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they are on vasopressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. 

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which they are taking digoxin. They also have a background of COPD and possible ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). They are being treated empirically for sepsis with a 10-day course of antibiotics.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and renal function. However, their troponin T levels are elevated, indicating potential cardiac damage. Other lab values such as blood glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range.

Imaging shows no significant interval change in the chest X-ray, with the endotracheal tube remaining somewhat elevated.

The patient's assessment includes sepsis, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The plan is to continue empirical antimicrobials for 10 days, maintain vasopressor support to keep MAP above 60 mmHg, continue digoxin for atrial fibrillation, monitor renal function, and provide nutritional support.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and likely acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to an aspiration event. The patient has been intubated for 8 days and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/54 mmHg to 68/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 60 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's rhythm is sinus.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, normal electrolytes, and low platelet count. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 54 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 253 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's physical examination reveals intubation, sedation, no response to verbal commands, rhonchi throughout anterior lung fields, moderate abdominal distension, and 3+ edema in all four extremities.

The patient's plan includes daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) to assess readiness for extubation,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and likely ARDS due to an aspiration event. The patient has been intubated for 7 days and meets the criteria for ARDS. He has a poor RSBI today and will continue with daily SBT, RSBI, and wake-ups to assess his status. The plan includes reducing the respiratory rate to 20, weaning FiO2 and PEEP to optimize oxygenation, daily chest X-ray, and titrating RR and TV to optimize acid/base status with permissive hypercapnia of pH >7.25. The patient is scheduled for a tracheostomy on Tuesday, and goals for care will be discussed on Monday. The patient also has septic shock/hypotension, for which IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered. Other issues include tachycardia, sacral decubitus ulcer, gastrointestinal care, thrombocytopenia, anemia, GERD, FEN (feeding), access, PPx (pre-procedural), and code status. The patient's current vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 37.2°C, HR: 82 bpm, BP: 100/54 mmHg, RR: 60 breaths per minute, SpO2: 97%. The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 9.8 K/uL, Hct of 25.8%, Plt of 137 K/uL, Cr of 0.8 mg/dL, TropT of 0.02 ng/mL, TCO2 of 24 mmHg, Glucose of 88 mg/dL, and other labs within normal ranges. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS and poor RSBI indicate a high risk of respiratory failure. Continued weaning of FiO2 and PEEP along with daily SBT and wake-ups will help assess his status and prevent further complications.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive sputum culture for Staph aureus, indicating a potential bacterial infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but it is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or antibiotic resistance.
3. Hypotension: The patient's septic shock/hypotension requires careful management of IV fluids and blood pressure. Maintaining a MAP >60 and monitoring for any signs of organ perfusion abnormalities is crucial.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been trending down since admission, which could lead to bleeding complications. Monitoring the platelet count and addressing the cause of thrombocytopenia is essential.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped critically, indicating a need for further evaluation and management. Monitoring the patient's hemoglobin levels and considering transfusions if necessary is important.
6. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which requires regular wound care and prevention of further pressure damage. Monitoring for any worsening of the ulcer or signs of infection is important.
7. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient's bowel movements have been absent since Sunday, indicating a possible gastrointestinal issue. Continuing the bowel regimen and monitoring for any signs of ileus or obstruction is crucial.
8. Parkinson's Disease: The patient's Parkinson's disease management should continue, including Sinemet administration. Monitoring for any changes in motor symptoms is important.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's progress note, and further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate medical decision-making."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely due to an aspiration event. He is currently on day 8 of intubation and has poor respiratory system compliance (RSBI) with failed spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The patient's condition is complicated by fever, septic shock, decubitus ulcer, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and Parkinson's disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and is intubated for ARDS. Daily SBT, RSBI, and wake-ups will be performed to assess his status. Tracheostomy may be considered.
2. Infection: The patient has a fever and positive sputum culture for MRSA. He is at risk for pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin and Cefepime have been initiated.
3. Septic Shock: The patient has septic shock and requires careful fluid management to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Pressors may be required.
4. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer that requires regular wound care.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute thrombocytopenia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely due to aspiration. He is currently on day 8 of intubation and meets ARDS criteria. The patient's fever is being treated with antibiotics, but sputum cultures still show GPC in clusters. There are concerns about septic shock, metabolic alkalosis, sacral decubitus ulcer, tachycardia, gastrointestinal care, Parkinson's disease, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure and has been intubated. Continued efforts will be made to wean him off mechanical ventilation and perform daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT).
2. Aspiration Events: Given the patient's dysphagia and Parkinson's disease, there is a risk of recurrent aspiration events, which could worsen his ARDS.
3. Sepsis: Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient remains febrile, indicating a possible ongoing infection. There is a risk of sepsis and septic shock, especially considering his current hypotension and the presence of MRSA in sputum cultures.
4. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism ("

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely due to aspiration. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of fever, septic shock, decubitus ulcer, tachycardia, Parkinson's disease, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on day 8 of intubation and meets ARDS criteria due to an aspiration event. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure if the patient does not improve or if there are further complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient has had fevers and positive sputum cultures for gram-positive cocci in clusters, indicating a possible bacterial infection. There is a risk of sepsis or septic shock if the infection spreads or if the antibiotics are not effective.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has risk factors for DVT and PE, such as immobility and central venous catheters. There is a potential risk of developing DVT or PE if preventive measures are not taken.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding, especially with invasive procedures or surgeries.
5. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which can worsen if proper wound care and pressure relief measures are not implemented.
6. Parkinson's disease exacerbation: The patient has Parkinson's disease, and the stress of the current illness and treatment may exacerbate his Parkinsonian symptoms.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of GERD, which can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially with the use of anticoagulants or if the patient develops stress ulcers.
8. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can worsen if there is ongoing blood loss or if the body's ability to produce red blood cells is compromised.
9. Infection control: The patient has been colonized with MRSA and GPC, which increases the risk of healthcare-associated infections.

These are potential medical complications that may arise based on the patient's current condition and medical history."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has a history of dementia and is unable to provide a detailed medical history. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate ranging from 73-90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 58-105 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 19-70 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is sedated and unable to follow commands.

The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place and is receiving nutrition through tube feeds. The patient is also receiving medications for sepsis, including antibiotics and vasopressors. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and troponin levels, indicating potential infection or cardiac damage. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has a long-term care plan in place, including tracheotomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), due to the anticipated continued need for mechanical ventilation. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been mechanically ventilated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Preventive measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing oral care, and assessing"

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis, respiratory failure (ARDS)
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name **]) --
   limited progress.  Will discuss direction of care with HCP daughter to
   determine whether to proceed with tracheotomy tube & PEG.  ABG suggests
   underlying COPD (resp. acidosis, corrected)
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   low-grade temperature elevation.  Concern for evolving infection.
   Currently receiving treatment for pneumonia and UTI.
 SHOCK, SEPTIC -- gradual improvement.  Monitor MAP, maintain MAP >60.
 DECUBITUS ULCER (PRESENT AT ADMISSION) -- stable.  Continue local
   care.
 TACHYCARDIA -- A-fib; good control.  Continue Digoxin.
 PARKINSON'S DISEASE -- continue usual meds.
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE -- monitor.  No active bleeding.  HIT
   antibody negative.
 ANEMIA -- suspect predominately from phlebotomy;  monitor Hct.
 GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) -- continue TF.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 89-year-old male with endstage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and ARDS likely due to aspiration event. The patient is currently on day 9 of intubation and meets ARDS criteria. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 87/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals that he is intubated, sedated, and unresponsive to verbal commands. The patient has yellow sputum suctioned and rhonchi throughout anterior upper and lower lung fields. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and normal kidney function. The patient's blood cultures are positive for MRSA on 9-21 and repeat sputum culture shows SA, yeast, and GNR on 9-27. The patient's current medications include propofol, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and various other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms of ARDS include respiratory failure, difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation, and the presence of yellow sputum suctioned.
2. Sepsis and Septic Shock: The patient's elevated white blood cell count"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely due to an aspiration event. The patient has been intubated for 8 days and meets ARDS criteria. The main issues include deciding on tracheostomy and PEG tube placement for aggressive care or scaling back care, managing fever, septic shock/hypotension, metabolic alkalosis, sacral decubitus ulcer, tachycardia, gastrointestinal care, Parkinson's disease, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS and prolonged intubation increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, positive sputum cultures for GPC and MRSA, and septic shock/hypotension indicate a high risk of sepsis.
3. Thromboembolic Events: Immobility, decreased venous return, and coagulation abnormalities may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Decubitus Ulcer Complications: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer can lead to infection,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely due to an aspiration event. The patient has been intubated for 8 days and meets ARDS criteria. The plan is to continue daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) assessments to evaluate the patient's status. The patient's fever reached 100.3 on September 26th, and sputum culture showed gram-positive cocci in clusters despite vancomycin treatment. C. difficile toxin was negative, and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) for possible pulmonary embolism (PE) will be considered if the family wants aggressive care. The patient remains on norepinephrine and propofol. Metabolic alkalosis is present, and potassium levels need to be repleted. Sacral decubitus ulcer care is recommended, and wound dressing changes will be made every three days. The patient's tachycardia remains stable, and gastrointestinal care is ongoing. Thrombocytopenia and anemia are also noted, with plans to monitor platelet levels and hemoglobin concentrations. The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and a confirmed do not resuscitate (DNR) status. Disposition is to continue ICU care."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely due to an aspiration event. The patient has been intubated for 8 days and meets ARDS criteria. The plan is to perform a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today.

The patient is also diagnosed with septic shock/hypotension, metabolic alkalosis, sacral decubitus ulcer, tachycardia, gastrointestinal care, Parkinson's disease, thrombocytopenia, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and has a confirmed do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current condition of ARDS puts him at risk for continued respiratory failure, especially after tracheostomy and weaning sedation.

2. Sepsis: The presence of septic shock/hypotension suggests ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but continuous monitoring and assessment are necessary.

3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate level of 32 indicates metabolic alkalosis, which may be due to diuresis. Close monitoring of electrolytes and acid-base balance is required.

4. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. A tracheotomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were performed without complications. The patient has received extra doses of Fentanyl, Propofol, and Vecuronium. He is off vasopressors.

The patient has a history of allergies, specifically a rash from an unknown allergen. He has been receiving antibiotics for an infection, including Vancomycin and Cefepime. His current vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 109/55 mmHg to 121/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient's review of systems is largely unremarkable except for mechanical ventilation. He has no complaints of fatigue, fever, weight loss, blurry vision, conjunctival edema, dry mouth, epistaxis, or orthopnea. His cardiovascular, nutritional support, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, integumentary, endocrine, heme/lymphatic, neurologic, psychiatric/sleep, and allergy/immunology systems are all within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished male who appears comfortable without signs of acute distress. His eyes are"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely due to aspiration. The patient has undergone percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion without complications. Propofol was discontinued mid-day yesterday, but the patient remains unresponsive with preserved pupillary reflex. The patient's respiratory status is stable with a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 93 today. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for 10 days and meets the criteria for ARDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a low suspicion for VAP due to fever and resolving right upper lobe opacity. However, if the patient spikes a fever or shows an increased white blood cell count, antibiotics and further investigation will be initiated.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has a bicarbonate level of 31, which is likely due to diuresis. The patient needs to be repleted with potassium and electrolytes as needed.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit continues to decline slowly. Further evaluation and potential transfusion may be necessary if the hematocrit falls below 21.
4. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing sacral decubitus ulcer that requires wound care management.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's"

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely due to an aspiration event. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a tracheostomy placed today.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated for more than 48 hours. The plan includes performing a mini bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) tomorrow for possible new infiltrate or VAP.

2. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing sacral decubitus ulcer, which requires regular wound care and dressing changes.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 116,000/mm3. It is important to monitor the platelet count and rule out other causes such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin levels is recommended.

5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): The patient has a history of GERD, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) should be continued to manage symptoms.

   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Tolerating trach.  Improved patient
   comfort.  Hope to continue to work towards trach collar trial.
   SOMNULANT -- possible slow clearance of sedtives. Monitor.
   SPUTUM -- may represent tracheobronchitis, discoloration may be related
   to bleeding associted with trach placement.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with ongoing respiratory failure. They have undergone several procedures including PEG insertion, percutaneous tracheostomy, and EKG. The patient remains mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy and is sedated but responds to verbal stimuli. They have completed antimicrobials and have brown-colored sputum via tracheostomy. The patient is unable to provide a history due to encephalopathy.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 108/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's CVP is 7 mmHg, total input is 1,704 mL, total output is 2,565 mL, and urine output is 2,560 mL. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress or signs of pain. The patient has bilateral breath sounds with crackles in both lungs. They also have warm extremities and no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination shows no cogwheeling or tremors.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 183 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 116, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

Imaging shows bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, which have"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE --  persistent.  Good response with tracheotomy
   tube placement, now much more calm without sedation.  Limited progress
   with weaning, however.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES  -- attributed to Pulmonary edema, possible ARDS
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 gradual improvement, but progress slow (suspect
   reflects slow clearance of sedatives).  Consider head CT if no further
   clinical improvement.
   FEVER
 resolved.  Monitor off antimicrobials.
   SHOCK, SEPTIC -- improved.  Monitor BP, P.
   DECUBITUS ULCER (PRESENT AT ADMISSION) -- local care.
   TACHYCARDIA
 a-fib.  Contolled on Digoxin.  Check level.
   PARKINSON'S DISEASE -- flaccid exam.  Receiving anti-Parkinsonian
   meds.  Possible due to slow clearance of meds.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA, -- stable.
   ANEMIA
 stable.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease and dysphagia. He is currently in the ICU and has been intubated for the past 10 days with a tracheostomy. The patient meets the criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to an aspiration event. 

The plan includes holding morphine or other sedatives, continuing daily respiratory system assessment and spontaneous breathing trials, performing daily chest X-rays, and following up with mini bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and tracheal aspirate cultures. If the patient shows signs of worsening or an increased white blood cell count, antibiotics will be started for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Other medical issues include metabolic alkalosis, anemia, sacral decubitus ulcer, tachycardia, gastrointestinal care, Parkinson's disease, thrombocytopenia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and poor nutritional status. 

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and he will be discharged to a rehabilitation facility tomorrow."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with end-stage Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely due to aspiration. The patient has been intubated for 10 days and has a tracheostomy in place. The patient's extremity exam is very loose, indicating that his Parkinson's disease is not causing his immobility. The patient has a fever, shock, sepsis, decubitus ulcer, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ARDS: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory failure and may require prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's dysphagia and aspiration event put him at risk for developing aspiration pneumonia. This condition can cause further respiratory distress and may require antibiotic treatment.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute thrombocytopenia, which is a low platelet count. This can increase the risk of bleeding and bruising.

4. Sepsis: The patient has septic shock, indicating a systemic infection that could lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly and effectively.

5. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which is a pressure sore. This can worsen if not properly managed"
