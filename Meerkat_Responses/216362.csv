","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with tracheobronchomalacia who has been admitted for consideration of Y stent placement. The patient has been on invasive ventilation for the past 6 weeks and has a history of chronic conditions such as COPD, presumed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), hypertension (HTN), chronic pain, depression, and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The patient is currently on various medications including albuterol and ipratroprium MDI, metoprolol, valsartan, alprazolam, citalopram, duloxetine, gabapentin, HCTZ, lansoprazole, oxycodone, and SC heparin.

24-hour events include the initiation of invasive ventilation and PICC line placement. The patient was NPO after midnight for planned bronchoscopy today.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/55 mmHg to 158/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 24 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old female with tracheobronchomalacia who was transferred for consideration of Y stent placement.
- During bronchoscopy, a partially healing posterior tracheal membrane tear was found, which prevents the placement of a Y stent.
- The patient has respiratory failure due to multiple factors including COPD, presumed OSA, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She has been ventilated for the past 6 weeks.
- Leukocytosis is present but the patient is afebrile.
- Other medical conditions include hypertension, chronic pain, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue or worsen due to underlying conditions such as COPD, OSA, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Ventilation support may be required for an extended period.
2. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient's tracheobronchomalacia may lead to further airway complications, including recurrent episodes of airway obstruction or collapse.
3. Infection: Despite being afebrile, the patient's leukocytosis indicates an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a possible infection. Appropriate cultures and antibiotic therapy should be considered.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and prolonged ICU stay. Prophylactic measures, such as he"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with tracheobronchomalacia who was transferred to the ICU for consideration of Y stent placement. However, bronchoscopy revealed a persistent posterior tracheal membrane tear that precludes the placement of a Y stent. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, involving COPD, presumed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient has been ventilated for the past 6 weeks at OSH.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient's condition of tracheobronchomalacia can lead to airway collapse, which may result in respiratory distress and difficulty breathing.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is complex and involves multiple factors such as COPD, OSA, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. This increases the risk of further respiratory complications, including pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been ventilated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of pneumonia that occurs in patients who are receiving mechanical ventilation.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots, particularly in the legs ("

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy at 01:30 PM on [**2122-9-3**], which revealed a partially healing posterior tracheal membrane tear. The patient has no known drug allergies, and their last dose of antibiotics was on [**2122-9-4**]. They are currently receiving heparin sodium (prophylaxis) and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. 

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), current temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 81 bpm (range 63-97 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 135/72 mmHg to 169/134 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (range 11-26), and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,069 mL, including 386 mL of intravenous fluids, and an output of 950 mL, primarily through the urinary catheter. The patient's weight is currently 96.7 kg, up from their admission weight of 93.6 kg. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values, including creatinine, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, are also provided. 

The patient's physical examination is largely incomplete due to their unstable airway.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring chronic ventilation. She has a history of tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, presumed OSA, obesity hypoventilation, hypertension, depression, fibromyalgia, and is currently receiving tube feeds for nutrition. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has a healing tear in the posterior trachea as seen on bronchoscopy. The patient is being managed with various medications, including heparin for DVT prophylaxis, a PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and insulin for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient's trachea has not yet healed, which may indicate a risk of recurrent airway collapse or worsening respiratory function if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing multifactorial respiratory failure due to COPD, presumed OSA, and obesity hypoventilation. Proper ventilation settings and ongoing respiratory support are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be managed with appropriate home medications to control blood pressure levels and reduce the risk of complications associated with high blood pressure.
4. Depression: The patient is being treated for depression with home medications. It is important to monitor her mental health and provide appropriate support and counseling as needed.
5. Fibromyalgia: The patient's fibrom"

The patient is a 64-year-old female with hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring chronic ventilation for possible Y stent placement. She has a history of tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, presumed OSA with obesity hypoventilation, hypertension, depression, fibromyalgia, and tube feeds for nutrition. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/51 mmHg to 143/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) deferred due to an unstable airway. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, symmetric chest expansion, and diminished breath sounds diffusely. Her laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. The patient's assessment includes tracheobronchomalacia, respiratory failure, hypertension, depression, fibromyalgia, and the need for tube feeds and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with tracheobronchomalacia who was transferred for a bronchoscopy. The bronchoscopy revealed a persistent tracheal tear, which cannot be treated with a Y stent. The patient also has a recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and is currently being treated with metronidazole. She is experiencing increased diarrhea overnight and will continue to be monitored for improvement. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for the past 6 weeks and has multiple comorbidities including COPD, presumed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, leukocytosis, hypertension, chronic pain, and depression. Her current medications include albuterol and ipratropium MDI, metoprolol, valsartan, alprazolam, citalopram, duloxetine, gabapentin, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), lansoprazole, and oxycodone as needed. The patient's vital signs are stable, and her lab results are mostly within normal range. She is expected to remain in the ICU over the weekend and will be transferred to another hospital as soon as a bed becomes available.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheal tear: The persistent tracheal tear increases the risk of air leakage, respiratory distress, and potential need for surgical intervention.
2. Recurrent C"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with tracheobronchomalacia who was transferred for consideration of Y stent placement. She has persistent (though healing) posterior tracheal membrane tear, which precludes placement of Y stent. The patient is currently on suction with a 10Fr catheter to minimize further damage and will have outpatient follow-up with IP in several weeks/months.

The patient had a previous episode of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection at OSH and was treated with flagyl. However, she is now experiencing increased diarrhea overnight, so she has been restarted on IV flagyl and will follow bowel movements. If the diarrhea does not improve, she may be considered for a change to PO vancomycin, but she is unable to take oral medications at the moment.

The patient has been ventilated for the last 6 weeks at OSH due to respiratory failure, which is multifactorial with COPD, presumed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation. She will continue with CPAP + PS for now.

The patient has leukocytosis, likely secondary to the recurrent C. diff infection. She is currently being treated with flagyl, and a urine analysis has been sent.

The patient's hypertension, chronic pain, and depression will continue to be managed with her home medications.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving ProBalance nutrition at 30 mL"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with hypercarbic respiratory failure who requires chronic ventilation. She is being treated for a possible Y stent placement but cannot proceed due to a persistent tracheal tear. The patient has a history of worsening diarrhea, which is now positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) toxin. She has been previously treated for C. diff in the past and will restart Flagyl. If her symptoms worsen, she may switch to oral vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 163/83 mmHg to 102/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. Her recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine and glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has several medical conditions, including tracheobronchomalacia, respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and presumed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, hypertension, depression, and leukocytosis with diarrhea caused by C. diff infection.

Plan:
1. Continue current ventilator settings for respiratory failure.
2. Restart Flag"

   Total time spent:
","The patient is a 64-year-old female with hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring chronic ventilation. She is unable to undergo Y stent placement due to a persistent tracheal tear. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and presumed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), contributing to her respiratory failure. Her current ventilator settings will be continued.

She also has hypertension (HTN) and is being treated with home medications. The patient has depression and is on home medications for it as well. She presents with leukocytosis and diarrhea, which was previously treated for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection but the treatment status is unclear. Worsening diarrhea and leukocytosis were noted, so Flagyl has been restarted. If symptoms worsen, the patient may be switched to oral vancomycin.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving ProBalance nutrition at 45 mL/hour and her blood sugar levels are well-controlled with regular insulin sliding scale. She has a PICC line inserted for medication administration. Prophylaxis measures include subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and elevation of head of bed (HOB) and mouth care to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with tracheobronchomalacia who has been transferred for a bronchoscopy. She was found to have a persistent tracheal tear, which cannot be treated with a Y stent, and is currently on suction with a 10Fr catheter. The patient also has recurrent Clostridium difficile (CDiff) infection and is being treated with Flagyl. She has a history of respiratory failure due to COPD, presumed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient has been mechanically ventilated for the past six weeks. Other medical issues include leukocytosis, hypertension, chronic pain, and depression. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheal Tear: The persistent tracheal tear poses a risk of continued air leakage and potential infection. Close monitoring and appropriate suctioning techniques are necessary to minimize further damage.
2. Recurrent CDiff Infection: The patient's recurrent CDiff infection increases the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. It is crucial to monitor the patient's bowel movements and adjust treatment accordingly.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure may lead to worsening hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and ventilatory support is essential.
4. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection. Regular follow-up of the WBC levels is necessary to assess"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring chronic ventilation. She was transferred to the ICU for possible Y stent placement, but this was not performed due to a persistent tear in her trachea. The patient's medical history includes tracheobronchomalacia, respiratory failure (multifactorial, including COPD and presumed OSA with obesity hypoventilation), hypertension, depression, leukocytosis, diarrhea (previously had C. diff in VT, treatment unclear), and hypernatremia (likely due to volume loss from diarrhea).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Tracheostomy site infection: The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place, which can increase the risk of infection.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the ventilator can lead to the development of pressure ulcers.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins.
5. Nosocomial infections: The patient's compromised immune system due to chronic ventilation and previous C. diff infection puts her at risk for other nosocomial infections.
6. Tracheal stenosis: The persistent tear in the trachea and chronic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring chronic ventilation. She was transferred to the ICU for possible Y stent placement but was unable to undergo the procedure due to a persistent tear in her trachea.

The patient's medical history includes tracheobronchomalacia, respiratory failure (multifactorial with COPD and presumed OSA with obesity hypoventilation), hypertension, depression, leukocytosis, diarrhea (previously had C.diff in VT, treatment unclear), and hypernatremia (likely volume loss from diarrhea). The patient is currently on chronic ventilation and has not yet healed from the tracheal tear. 

The vital signs show that the patient's temperature is within normal range, heart rate is stable, blood pressure is slightly low, respiratory rate is low and assisted, and oxygen saturation is good. The patient's weight has decreased slightly since admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,911 mL and output of 1,081 mL, indicating a positive balance of 1,206 mL.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are well-controlled. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, sodium, magnesium, and phosphate are within normal limits.

The plan includes continuing current ventilator settings, monitoring for worsening of diarrhea and switching to oral vancomycin if necessary, increasing free water boluses to address"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with tracheobronchomalacia who was transferred for a bronchoscopy. The bronchoscopy revealed a persistent tracheal tear, which cannot be treated with a Y stent. The patient also has recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and has been treated with metronidazole. She is currently on Flagyl 500mg PO Q8h and her bowel movements will be monitored. If diarrhea increases, she may be switched to PO vancomycin.

The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to COPD, presumed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and has been ventilated for the last 6 weeks. She is currently on CPAP + PSV mode of ventilation.

Her leukocyte count is elevated, possibly due to the recurrent C. diff infection, for which she is receiving treatment with Flagyl. She also has hypertension, chronic pain, and depression, for which she will continue her home medications.

ICU care includes nutrition with ProBalance (full) at 45 mL/hour and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. She has a PICC line in place for medication administration. Prophylactic measures include DVT prophylaxis with heparin subcutaneously, stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis since she is not"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with tracheobronchomalacia who was transferred for a bronchoscopy. During the procedure, a persistent tracheal tear was discovered. The patient also has a recurrent Clostridium difficile (CDiff) infection. There have been no acute events overnight, and the patient's stool output has improved with the use of Flagyl.

Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has a persistent (though healing) posterior tracheal membrane tear, which prevents the placement of a Y stent. Suction with a 10Fr catheter will be used to minimize further damage, and outpatient follow-up is scheduled in 2 months.
2. Recurrent C Diff: The patient had a previous episode of CDiff at another hospital and completed treatment with Flagyl. She will continue taking Flagyl 500mg PO Q8h, and her bowel movements will be monitored. If diarrhea increases, switching to PO vancomycin may be considered.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including COPD, presumed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She has been ventilated for the last 6 weeks. It is recommended to continue CPAP + PSV for now.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient likely has leukocytosis due to recurrent CDiff. Her white"

   Total time spent:
","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring chronic ventilation. She was transferred to the ICU for possible Y stent placement, but a persistent tear in her trachea prevented this procedure from being performed. The patient has several medical conditions including tracheobronchomalacia, respiratory failure, hypertension, depression, leukocytosis, diarrhea (previously treated for C.diff infection), and hypernatremia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia: Without Y stent placement, the patient's tracheal tear may not heal properly, leading to ongoing respiratory issues.
2. Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial in nature, the patient's respiratory failure is caused by COPD, presumed OSA with obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Continuing current ventilator settings may pose risks if not appropriately adjusted.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be managed with home medications. If not controlled, it can lead to complications such as heart disease or stroke.
4. Depression: The patient is on home medications for depression, and untreated depression can have various negative effects on physical health.
5. Leukocytosis and Diarrhea: The patient had a previous C.diff infection in the ventricles, and current treatment with flagyl will be continued for a 14-day course. If symptoms worsen, switching to oral vancomycin may be necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   64F with tracheobronchomalacia transferred for bronchoscopy and found
   to have persistent tracheal tear, also with recurrent cdiff infection
   stable for transfer back to OSH/rehab facility for continued care.
   #. Tracheobronchomaliacia: Bronchoscopy on [**9-3**] revealed persistent
   (though healing) posterior tracheal membrane tear which precludes
   placement of Y stent.
   - Suction with 10Fr catheter only to minimize further damage
   - Outpatient follow up with IP in [**2-1**] months
   .
   #. Recurrent C Diff
 Patient had episode of cdiff at OSH, finished
   treatment of flagyl x 6 days on  [**2122-8-31**]. Day one of flagyl [**2122-9-5**].
   Bowel movements decreased on continued flagyl.
   - continue Flagyl 500mg PO Q8h
   - follow BMs, and if diarrhea increases consider switching to PO vanco
   .
   #.Respiratory failure: multifactorial with COPD, presumed OSA, obesity
   hypoventilation.  Patient has been ventilated for the last 6 weeks at
   OSH
   -continue CPAP +PS for now
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely [**1-31**] recurrent cdiff. On treatment with flagyl
   now.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with tracheobronchomalacia, recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, hypertension, chronic pain, and depression. The patient has been in the ICU for the past six weeks.

The patient has a persistent tracheal tear that was confirmed during bronchoscopy. Due to this condition, placement of a Y stent is not possible. The patient is being managed with suction using a 10Fr catheter to minimize further damage, and outpatient follow-up is planned in two months.

The patient had an episode of C. diff infection at the previous hospital, which was treated with metronidazole. However, the patient continues to experience decreased bowel movements, so the treatment will be continued, and the patient's bowel movements will be monitored. If diarrhea increases, the patient may be switched to oral vancomycin.

The patient has been ventilated for the last six weeks and is currently on CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) and PSV (pressure support ventilation). The respiratory failure is multifactorial, involving COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), presumed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and other underlying conditions. The current management plan includes continuing with CPAP and PSV.

The patient also has leukocytosis, which is likely related to the recurrent C. diff"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring chronic ventilation. She was transferred to the ICU for possible Y stent placement, but it was not performed due to a persistent tear in her trachea. The patient has a history of COPD, presumed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, hypertension, depression, leukocytosis, and diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 115/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is well-nourished, overweight, and has symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds. Her abdominal examination is unremarkable, and she has trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurological examination shows that she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, creatinine, glucose levels, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's blood gases show respiratory acidosis. The plan includes continuing current ventilator settings, monitoring for tracheal healing, managing hypertension, depression, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and C. diff infection. The patient's disposition is transfer to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, hypertension, chronic pain, and depression. She was admitted to the ICU due to persistent tracheal tear and ongoing management of her conditions. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including changes in antibiotics for better control of C. diff, CPAP/PSV ventilation, and monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia: The persistent tracheal tear poses a risk for further damage to the tracheal structures and may require ongoing suctioning to minimize trauma.
2. Recurrent C. diff infection: The patient's recent switch from Flagyl to PO vancomycin is aimed at better controlling the C. diff infection. However, monitoring for any signs of relapse or complications related to antibiotic use is necessary.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's multifactorial respiratory failure, including COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, has necessitated prolonged ventilation support. Continuing CPAP + PSV for now is recommended. Monitoring for any deterioration in respiratory function and adjusting the ventilation strategy accordingly is essential.
4. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Regular monitoring of WBC levels and evaluating"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, respiratory failure due to COPD, presumed obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She has been intubated and ventilated for the past 6 weeks. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/77 mmHg to 115/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 50%. The patient is expected to be transferred back to the rehabilitation facility for continued care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has persistent tracheal tear which may lead to further damage and respiratory complications if not managed appropriately.
2. Recurrent C Diff Infection: The patient had a previous episode of Clostridium difficile infection, and there is a risk of recurrence if appropriate measures are not taken.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and may continue to be a challenge, especially if the underlying conditions such as COPD and obesity hypoventilation syndrome are not adequately managed.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and it needs to be closely monitored and managed according to her"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring chronic ventilation. She was transferred to the ICU for possible Y stent placement but was unable to undergo the procedure due to a persistent tear in her trachea. The patient has multiple medical conditions including tracheobronchomalacia, respiratory failure (multifactorial, including COPD and presumed OSA with obesity hypoventilation), hypertension, depression, leukocytosis, and diarrhea (previously had C. diff in VT, treatment unclear).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has not yet healed, making it difficult to perform a Y stent placement. This could lead to ongoing respiratory difficulties.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including COPD and presumed OSA with obesity hypoventilation. If not properly managed, this can result in further deterioration of respiratory function.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be managed to prevent complications such as stroke or heart attack.
4. Depression: Untreated depression can lead to worsening mental health and may affect the patient's adherence to medical treatment.
5. Leukocytosis and Diarrhea: The patient's leukocytosis and diarrhea may be indicative of an ongoing infection. If not appropriately treated, it can lead to sepsis or other systemic infections.
6. Hypernat"
