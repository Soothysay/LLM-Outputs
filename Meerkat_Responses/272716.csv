","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, presenting with blood loss anemia. He has been experiencing bloody stool and hematemesis at home. In the ER, he received a transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and lactulose. His hemoglobin (Hct) has improved from 10 to 16. He has been given octreotide and pantoprazole through IV infusions. Despite NG lavage being negative, he is still passing bloody stool. He received a total of 5 units and 2 U fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient is currently on multiple medications, including pantoprazole and octreotide.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal impairment. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and severity of acute renal failure.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and INR suggest a bleeding disorder, which could contribute to gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, likely related to liver disease. Close monitoring and management of his hepatic encephalopathy are necessary.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's symptoms of bloody stool and hematemesis indicate ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. Further diagnostic procedures, such as an esophagogastrodu"

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis presenting with blood loss anemia. He was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received a total of 5 units and 2 U fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for blood transfusion. He has been started on octreotide and pantoprazole for gastrointestinal bleeding, but continues to pass bloody stool. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has improved from 10% to 16% after receiving PRBCs and lactulose. His vital signs are stable with a heart rate (HR) of 71 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 136/61 mmHg to 80 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100%. The patient has a history of valve replacement (porcine mitral valve) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD). Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. This could be due to hypoperfusion or direct injury to the kidneys from the gastrointestinal bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7904**] is a 64 year old male with cirrhosis transferred from [**Hospital 2653**]
   Hospital with GI bleed and altered mental status.
   # GI bleed: Patient reports maroon stools x3 days with a hct of 10 at
   OSH.  Has now received 9 units PRBC (2 OSH + 7) with AM hct of 26.2.
   EGD yesterday demonstrated 1 cord grade one varices and portal
   gastropathy, but no signs of active bleeding. Plan per GI for [**Last Name (un) **]
   today with prep completed.  Given elevated cardiac biomarkers and
   abnormal ECG, transfusion threshold increased to hct<28.
   - Transfuse additional 2 units PRBC
   - Transfuse 1 unit FFP for dilutional effect.
   - Q6H hct and coags, transfuse for hct<28, plt<50, INR>1.5
   - Discontinue PPI and octreotide
   - Active T+S, crossmatch for 2 units
   - Discuss with GI timing for colonoscopy
   # Liver disease: Evidence of portal hypertension given varices on EGD
   suggestive of likely EtOH related cirrhosis.
   - GIB as above
   - Abdominal u/s with dopplers as above
   - f/u liver recs
   - Obtain OSH records, discuss with PCP
   # Altered mental status: Could be due to hepatic encephalopathy if
   patient does indeed have liver disease. Head CT unremarkable.
   - hold lactulose in the setting of GI bleed; likely ok to restart once
   [**Last Name (un) **] is performed and hemostasis is achieved.
   # Renal failure: Creatinine trending down today to 2.4 from peak of
   3.3.  Unknown baseline creatinine.
   - Trend creatinine and lytes
   - Volume rescucitation as above.
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   # CV: STD anterolaterally with elevated TnT and MBI suggestive of
   demand ischemia in setting of hct of 10 at OSH.  Given GIB, hold of on
   ASA, plavix, BB. Given ARF, hold off on ACE-I. Given liver disease,
   hold off on statin.
   - TTE when stable
   - Obtain OSH CV records
   FEN: NPO for now, replete electrolytes

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with cirrhosis and a history of alcohol abuse, admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding and altered mental status. He has received 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and his hematocrit (Hct) level has improved from 10 to 26.2. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed grade 1 varices and portal gastropathy, but no active bleeding. The patient's cardiac biomarkers are elevated, and his ECG shows changes suggestive of ischemia. His kidney function is improving, with a decreasing creatinine level from 3.3 to 2.4. The patient is currently being prepared for a colonoscopy. He is on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines in place for fluid resuscitation. His electrolytes are being monitored and managed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Although the bleeding has stopped, there is still a risk of re-bleeding, especially with the presence of grade 1 varices.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: The elevated cardiac biomarkers and abnormal ECG suggest demand ischemia, which may require further evaluation and management.
4. Acute Kidney"

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent an endoscopy, which revealed grade 1 varices and portal gastropathy, both stable without bleeding. The patient's cardiac biomarkers are within normal limits, but there is evidence of ischemia on the ECG. The patient has been transfused with 3 units of packed red blood cells. The patient is receiving pantoprazole, octreotide, midazolam, and fentanyl infusions. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 95/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight remains unchanged. Fluid balance shows a total input of 7,451 mL and total output of 1,410 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 6,041 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. ABG results are pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU for a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and altered mental status. He has received a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and has an increased hemoglobin concentration (hct) of 26.2%. Endoscopy revealed one cord grade 1 varices and portal gastropathy without signs of active bleeding. The patient completed preparation for a procedure but still has brown stools. Due to elevated liver enzymes and abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), the transfusion threshold has been increased to hct<28.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient initially presented with maroon stools and required multiple units of PRBCs. Although EGD did not show active bleeding, the patient still has brown stools, indicating ongoing bleeding or slow continuous bleeding. Continuous monitoring and close observation are necessary to detect any signs of re-bleeding.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's altered mental status and evidence of liver disease, hepatic encephalopathy should be considered. Lactulose, a medication used to treat hepatic encephalopathy, should be started once the bleeding has resolved.
3. Portal hypertension: The presence of varices on EGD suggests portal hypertension, which is commonly seen in cirrhosis patients. This increases the risk of GI bleeding recurrence and potential complications such"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7904**] is a 64 year old male with cirrhosis transferred from [**Hospital 2653**]
   Hospital with GI bleed and altered mental status.
   # GI bleed: Patient reports maroon stools x3 days with a hct of 10 at
   OSH.  Has now received 9 units PRBC (2 OSH + 7) with AM hct of 26.2.
   EGD yesterday demonstrated 1 cord grade one varices and portal
   gastropathy, but no signs of active bleeding. Plan per GI for [**Last Name (un) **]
   today with prep completed.  Given elevated cardiac biomarkers and
   abnormal ECG, transfusion threshold increased to hct<28.
   - Transfuse additional 2 units PRBC
   - Transfuse 1 unit FFP for dilutional effect.
   - Q6H hct and coags, transfuse for hct<28, plt<50, INR>1.5
   - Discontinue PPI and octreotide
   - Active T+S, crossmatch for 2 units
   - Discuss with GI timing for colonoscopy
   # Liver disease: Evidence of portal hypertension given varices on EGD
   suggestive of likely EtOH related cirrhosis.
   - GIB as above
   - Abdominal u/s with dopplers as above
   - f/u liver recs
   - Obtain OSH records, discuss with PCP
   # Altered mental status: Could be due to hepatic encephalopathy if
   patient does indeed have liver disease. Head CT unremarkable.
   - hold lactulose in the setting of GI bleed; likely ok to restart once
   [**Last Name (un) **] is performed and hemostasis is achieved.
   # Renal failure: Creatinine trending down today to 2.4 from peak of
   3.3.  Unknown baseline creatinine.
   - Trend creatinine and lytes
   - Volume rescucitation as above.
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   # CV: STD anterolaterally with elevated TnT and MBI suggestive of
   demand ischemia in setting of hct of 10 at OSH.  Given GIB, hold of on
   ASA, plavix, BB. Given ARF, hold off on ACE-I. Given liver disease,
   hold off on statin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, who was transferred to the ICU for a gastrointestinal bleed and altered mental status. The patient has received a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with a current hematocrit (Hct) level of 26.2. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed one cord grade 1 varices and portal gastropathy but no signs of active bleeding. The patient's cardiac biomarkers are elevated, and the ECG shows changes suggestive of ischemia. The transfusion threshold has been increased to maintain a Hct < 28. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia and elevated liver enzymes, with a creatinine level trending down from a peak of 3.3. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is receiving supportive care in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and altered mental status, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can be exacerbated by factors such as infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, or electrolyte imbalances.
2. Re-bleeding: Although the EGD did not show active bleeding at the time of the procedure, there is still a risk of re-bleeding from the esophageal varices.
3. Cardiac complications: The elevated cardiac biomarkers"

   # GB polyp vs sludge: Unlikely to have contributed to
   hyperbilirubinemia given mostly indirect bili.
   -Consider MRCP/ERCP for further characterization of GB polyp when more
   medically stable.
   # Altered mental status: oriented x 1 with no asterixis. Could be due

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease, who was transferred from another hospital due to gastrointestinal bleeding and altered mental status. The patient has undergone several procedures including EGD, colonoscopy, and echocardiogram. He has been receiving blood transfusions and other medical interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient had a grade 1 variceal bleed, which has been managed with pantoprazole and blood transfusions. However, there is a risk of re-bleeding or further complications related to the varices.
2. Possible liver disease: The patient's INR and bilirubin levels suggest possible liver dysfunction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of liver disease and its impact on the patient's overall condition.
3. GB polyp vs sludge: The patient has a 1.2-cm echogenic focus within the gallbladder, which could be a sludge ball or a small polyp. Further characterization of the gallbladder lesion may be necessary when the patient is more stable.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, but further investigation is required to confirm this diagnosis.
5. Hypovolemic hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating a potential electrolyte imbalance. This could be due to renal losses or other underlying causes.
6. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is a concern, and there is a possibility of hepatorenal syndrome. Close monitoring of renal labs is necessary.
7. ST depressions: The patient has ST depressions on the ECG, which could indicate myocardial ischemia. Given the patient's history of valvular replacement surgery and ICD placement, this is a significant concern.
8. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient's history of CABG and the recent trend of increasing troponin levels suggest ongoing CAD. The patient's condition may require medical management for CAD, especially considering the current inability to perform interventions due to the GI bleed.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical progress in order to promptly address any potential complications that may arise."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient underwent an EGD at OSH and was found to have erosive gastropathy, erosive duodenopathy, non-bleeding grade 1 varices, and possible portal gastropathy.
- A colonoscopy at OSH revealed two polyps in the transverse colon, two polyps in the mid sigmoid, and one large polyp in the cecum. Only the cecum polyp was not fully excised.
- An ECHO at OSH showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35%.
- The patient had a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery with four grafts and a permanent pacemaker (PPM) placed due to third-degree atrioventricular block (AVB).
- The patient's serum creatinine level was elevated at 2.1 and rising.
- The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM).
- Hepatology: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is being monitored for now, and no endoscopy was performed.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with end-stage liver disease, who was admitted to the ICU due to gastrointestinal bleeding and altered mental status. He has a history of coronary artery disease, for which he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in the past. The patient also has diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease.

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were stable, but he required blood transfusions for the GI bleed. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed erosive gastropathy, erosive duodenopathy, and non-bleeding grade 1 varices. A colonoscopy showed multiple polyps in the colon, with one large polyp (25 mm) in the cecum that was only partially excised.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated creatinine levels and rising trends, suggesting renal dysfunction. His liver function tests show elevated bilirubin levels, and an ultrasound revealed diffusely increased hepatic echogenicity consistent with fatty liver disease. There are also signs of right heart dysfunction, likely secondary to his end-stage liver disease.

The patient's altered mental status is concerning for hepatic encephalopathy. He has been held on lactulose due to the recent GI bleed, but it will be started once the bleeding resolves. The patient is also experiencing hypovolemic hypernatremia, which may be related to renal losses. Additionally, there are concerns for hepatorenal syndrome, and the patient's cardiac"

   1. Diffusely increased hepatic echogenicity, consistent with fatty
   liver.
   Other, more serious forms of disease including cirrhosis and advanced
   fibrosis
   cannot be excluded.
   2. Patent portal vein. Dilated hepatic veins, suggesting right heart
   dysfunction.
   3. 1.2-cm echogenic focus within the gallbladder with no Doppler flow
   and no
   shadowing, likely a small sludge ball versus less likely a small polyp.
   Assessment and Plan
   64-year-old man with end-stage liver disease was transferred from [**Hospital 2653**]
   Hospital with GI bleed and altered mental status.
   # GI bleed: Received total of 11 units pRBCS including 2units at OSH
   and 4units FFP. EGD with varices (grade 1) and portal gastropathy.
   - transfuse 1 unit pRBCs
   - pantoprazole gtt
   - keep type & cross active
   - maintain good IV access
   - serial Hcts
   - repeat coags
   - colonoscopy urgently if becomes unstable
   # Possible liver disease: with INR 1.8 and  and bili 2.2. No evidence
   of ascites on exam. RUQ suggestive of cirrhosis vs fatty liver disease.
   - f/u liver recs
   - obtain OSH records before ordering liver w/u labs
   -CTX for SBP PPx
   # GB polyp vs sludge: Unlikely to have contributed to
   hyperbilirubinemia given mostly indirect bili.
   -Consider MRCP/ERCP for further characterization of GB polyp when more
   medically stable.
   # Altered mental status: oriented x 1 with no asterixis. Could be due
   to hepatic encephalopathy if patient does indeed have liver disease.
   Head CT unremarkable.
   - hold lactulose in the setting of GI bleed; will start once bleeding
   resolves
   .
   # Hypovolemic Hypernatremia: Suspect renal losses however creatinine
   improving and hypernatremia continues.
   - Continue volume resuscitation and check urine lytes if does not
   improve
   .
   # Renal failure: concerning for hepatorenal syndrome. Improving with
   blood and hydration. Baseline unclear.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] dose meds
   - trend renal labs
   .
   # ST depressions: in I, V2-V5. Baseline ECG not available. Trops have
   trended up over last day (0.08->0.32). Likely demand ischemia from
   blood loss. Per HCP, s/p valvular replacement surgery and ICD. TTE with
   LVEF 35% from OSH.
   - Would volume resuscitate and medically manage CAD for now as cannot
   have intervention with GIB anyway

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with end-stage liver disease, who was transferred from another hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding and altered mental status. He has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in the past. The patient also has diabetes mellitus. The patient's current condition includes multiple medical complications such as erosive gastropathy, erosive duodenopathy, non-bleeding grade 1 varices, two polyps in the transverse colon, two polyps in the mid-sigmoid, one polyp (25 mm) in the cecum, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35%, and a previous third-degree atrioventricular block for which an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was placed post-operatively. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient has received a total of 11 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), including 2 units at the current hospital and 4 units fresh frozen plasma (FFP). He has grade 1 varices and portal gastropathy, which are risk factors for further gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hemodynamic status should be closely monitored, and he should continue to receive pantoprazole and maintain good IV access. Serial hematocrit (Hct) checks and repeat coagulation tests are recommended. If the patient becomes unstable, urgent colon"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement post-op due to third-degree atrioventricular block (AVB), diabetes mellitus (DM), and renal failure. The patient has undergone several procedures including esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), colonoscopy, and echocardiogram (ECHO). 

During the 24-hour period, the patient's vital signs remained relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 66-88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 123/60-136/76 mmHg, respiratory rate between 18-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's weight has remained unchanged at 114.3 kg. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,802 mL and output of 3,840 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 38 mL. The patient has received 1,061 mL of intravenous fluids, with a total blood product transfusion of 1,301 mL. Urine output has been good at 3,840 mL. 

The patient is currently on respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and is maintaining a SpO2 of 94%. The arterial blood gas (ABG)"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus (DM), history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) due to third-degree atrioventricular block (AVB), chronic kidney disease (Cr 2.1 and rising), and hepatology with a history of erosive gastropathy, erosive duodenopathy, non-bleeding grade 1 varices, and possible portal gastropathy.

On admission, the patient presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed erosive gastropathy, erosive duodenopathy, non-bleeding grade 1 varices, and possible portal gastropathy. Colonoscopy showed two polyps in the transverse colon, two polyps in the mid-sigmoid colon, and one large polyp (25 mm) in the cecum. All polyps were excised except for the cecal polyp, which was only partially excised.

The patient also underwent an echocardiogram (ECHO) which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35%. He is currently receiving various medications including antibiotics, cardiovascular drugs, and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of"

   2. Patent portal vein. Dilated hepatic veins, suggesting right heart
   dysfunction.
   3. 1.2-cm echogenic focus within the gallbladder with no Doppler flow
   and no
   shadowing, likely a small sludge ball versus less likely a small polyp.
   Assessment and Plan
   64-year-old man with end-stage liver disease was transferred from [**Hospital 2653**]
   Hospital with GI bleed and altered mental status.
   # GI bleed: Received total of 11 units pRBCS including 2units at OSH
   and 4units FFP. EGD with varices (grade 1) and portal gastropathy.
   - transfuse 1 unit pRBCs
   - pantoprazole gtt
   - keep type & cross active
   - maintain good IV access
   - serial Hcts
   - repeat coags
   - colonoscopy urgently if becomes unstable
   # Possible liver disease: with INR 1.8 and  and bili 2.2. No evidence
   of ascites on exam. RUQ suggestive of cirrhosis vs fatty liver disease.
   - f/u liver recs
   - obtain OSH records before ordering liver w/u labs
   -CTX for SBP PPx
   # GB polyp vs sludge: Unlikely to have contributed to
   hyperbilirubinemia given mostly indirect bili.
   -Consider MRCP/ERCP for further characterization of GB polyp when more
   medically stable.
   # Altered mental status: oriented x 1 with no asterixis. Could be due
   to hepatic encephalopathy if patient does indeed have liver disease.
   Head CT unremarkable.
   - hold lactulose in the setting of GI bleed; will start once bleeding
   resolves
   .
   # Hypovolemic Hypernatremia: Suspect renal losses however creatinine
   improving and hypernatremia continues.
   - Continue volume resuscitation and check urine lytes if does not
   improve
   .
   # Renal failure: concerning for hepatorenal syndrome. Improving with
   blood and hydration. Baseline unclear.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] dose meds
   - trend renal labs
   .
   # ST depressions: in I, V2-V5. Baseline ECG not available. Trops have
   trended up over last day (0.08->0.32). Likely demand ischemia from
   blood loss. Per HCP, s/p valvular replacement surgery and ICD. TTE with
   LVEF 35% from OSH.
   - Would volume resuscitate and medically manage CAD for now as cannot
   have intervention with GIB anyway
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete electrolytes
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPI
   # Access: peripherals X3
   # Code: presumed full
   # Comm: [**Name (NI) 27**] [**Name (NI) **] (significant other, HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7883**]

","The patient is a 64-year-old man with end-stage liver disease who was transferred from another hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding and altered mental status. He has a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery with the placement of a pacemaker with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) due to third-degree atrioventricular block. His current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 123/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's medical history includes multiple polyps in the colon, including one large polyp in the cecum that was only partially excised. He also has evidence of erosive gastropathy, erosive duodenopathy, and non-bleeding grade 1 varices on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). His liver function tests show elevated bilirubin levels and an increased hepatic echogenicity on ultrasound, which is consistent with fatty liver disease, although more serious forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis cannot be excluded. His cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating possible myocardial injury.

The patient has received a total of 11 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with end-stage liver disease who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and altered mental status. He received a total of 12 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), including 2 units at the outpatient surgery hospital (OSH) and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed grade 1 varices and portal gastropathy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 135/74 mmHg, heart rate of 78 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, as well as elevated creatinine, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and bilirubin levels. Troponin-T is within normal range. The patient's mental status is described as paranoid and hallucinating at night, and he is on CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment) for concern of alcohol withdrawal. He also has a history of valvular replacement surgery and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by the decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. It is concerning for hepatorenal syndrome due to his end-stage liver disease. The patient's renal function needs close monitoring.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient presented with GI bleed, which has been managed with blood and fluid resuscitation. There is a concern for ongoing bleeding, and further interventions may be necessary.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, and he exhibits paranoid behavior and hallucinations at night. It could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, alcohol withdrawal, or psychosis. Close monitoring and appropriate management are required.
4. Hypovolemic Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is suspected to be due to renal losses. His sodium levels need to be closely monitored, and appropriate management should be considered.
5. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of valvular replacement surgery and ICD. He shows ST depressions in leads I, V2-V5 on the ECG, indicating possible ischemia. Considering his history of valvular disease and recent blood loss, cardiac issues should be closely monitored.
6. Liver Disease: The patient's history of end-stage liver disease and the presence of varices and portal gastropathy suggest underlying liver pathology. Further evaluation and management are necessary.
7. Infection: Although not explicitly stated, the elevated white blood cell count could indicate an infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate management should be considered.

Overall, the patient presents with multiple medical complications requiring close monitoring and management in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   64-year-old man with end-stage liver disease was transferred from [**Hospital 2653**]
   Hospital with GI bleed and altered mental status.
   # GI bleed: Received total of 12 units pRBCS (last yesterday PM)
   including 2units at OSH and 4units FFP. EGD with varices (grade 1) and
   portal gastropathy.
   - pantoprazole IV
   - keep type & cross active
   - maintain good IV access
   - serial Hcts
   - repeat coags
   - Hepatology stated they would only do scope if Hct and trops were
   decreasing today
   # Possible liver disease: with INR 1.8 and  and bili 2.2. No evidence
   of ascites on exam. RUQ suggestive of cirrhosis vs fatty liver disease.
   - f/u liver recs
   - obtain OSH records before ordering liver w/u labs
   - CTX for SBP PPx
   # GB polyp vs sludge: Unlikely to have contributed to
   hyperbilirubinemia given mostly indirect bili.
   -Consider MRCP/ERCP for further characterization of GB polyp when more
   medically stable.
   # Altered mental status: Patient was very agitated and paranoid early
   AM, but oriented x 3 with no asterixis. Could be due to hepatic
   encephalopathy if patient does indeed have liver disease or may also be
   pyschosis or withdrawal. Head CT unremarkable.
   - hold lactulose in the setting of GI bleed; will start once bleeding
   resolves
   - Started CIWA scale
   - consider haldol if symptoms persist
   .
   # Hypovolemic Hypernatremia: Suspect renal losses however creatinine
   improving and hypernatremia continues.
   - Continue volume resuscitation and check urine lytes if does not
   improve
   .
   # Renal failure: concerning for hepatorenal syndrome. Improving with
   blood and hydration. Baseline unclear.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] dose meds
   - trend renal labs
   .
   # ST depressions: in I, V2-V5. Baseline ECG not available. Trops have
   trended up over last day (0.08->0.32). Likely demand ischemia from
   blood loss. Per HCP, s/p valvular replacement surgery and ICD. TTE with
   LVEF 35% from OSH.
   - Would volume resuscitate and medically manage CAD for now as cannot
   have intervention with GIB anyway
   - CKs not consistent with ACS and no chest pain
   # FEN: Clears for now, replete electrolytes
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPI
   # Access: peripherals X3
   # Code: presumed full
   # Comm: [**Name (NI) 27**] [**Name (NI) **] (significant other, HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7883**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with end-stage liver disease who was transferred from another hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding and altered mental status. The patient received a total of 12 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), including 2 units at outside hospital (OSH) and 4 units fresh frozen plasma (FFP). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed grade 1 esophageal varices and portal gastropathy.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
- Heart rate: 78 beats per minute
- Blood pressure: 135/74 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 96%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.1 g/dL
- Hematocrit (Hct): 23.3%
- White blood cell (WBC) count: 8.1 K/uL
- Platelet count: 111 K/uL
- Creatinine: 2.4 mg/dL
- Troponin-T: 0.27 ng/mL
- Glucose: 165 mg/dL
- Liver function tests (LFTs) including aspartate aminotransferase (AST),"
