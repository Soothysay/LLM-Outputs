   Assessment and Plan
   69 M with HL, HTN, IPF, CRI, Hep C, and psoriatic arthritis presenting
   with bacterial endocarditis and CHF exacerbation.
   BACTERIAL ENDOCARDITIS - History of nightsweats for months and
   progressive dyspnea argues against acute endocarditis, as does
   appearence of vegitations and regurgitation on multiple valves.  CT
   scan shows one possible septic embolism, raising concern for other
   embolic disease.  Source of endocarditis unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] denies drug
   use, making S. viridans, S. aureus, Enterococcus, other abdominal flora
   the most likely causal agents.  Heart failure in setting of
   endocarditis woudl be a surgical indication.
   - Vanc and [**Last Name (LF) 2306**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] dose with levels
   - Cardiac [**Doctor First Name 91**] to consider operative repair.  If stable, this should be
   delayed until 5 days of antibiotic therapy given.  Will do pre-op
   carotid ultrasound, head CT.
   - Cardiac cath likely on monday to eval for CABG indications
   - Imaging of pelvis given lower abdominal tenderness to look for
   abdominal source.
   - Given effusions on CT, would consider tapping to look for evidence of
   infection.  Will hold off for now.
   - Daily cultures, [**Hospital1 **] tomorrow
   - Daily EKGs
   - Dental consult, panorex
   - ID consult for further recommendations
   .
   CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE - Has been agressively diureses at OSH and in
   the setting of infection and contrast.
   - Fluid goal -500 cc.  Will give 20 mg Lasix
   - Monitor respiratory status
   .
   NECK PAIN - Has neck pain that he was told was related to canal
   narrowing, but there is concern for abscess given endocarditis.  Per
   patient report, he had recent MRI imaging showing canal narrowing.
   - Obtain MRI report from [**Hospital3 57**] Hospital to verify
   .
   ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS - Does not complain of abdominal pain, but RLQ
   tenderness and h/o BRBPR.  CT showed mild appendiceal inflammation.
   Abdomen is non-surgical.
   - Guiac stools
   - Serial abdominal exams.
   - CT Pelvis to evaluate area of tenderness not seen on OSH imaging.
   PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS
   Pain control with tylenol
   INTERSTITIAL PULMONARY FIBROSIS - Normal PFTs in [**2171**] and not on O2 at
   home.  This likely does not explain his hypoxia but may be a
   contributor.
   - continue to monitor
   RENAL INSUFFICIENCY - at baseline.  Will d/c NSAID
   PSYCH: Has anxiety and baseline depression.  Will increase trazodone to
   100 mg QHS as this is his home med.
   - S/W c/s for patient coping
   - consider psych involvement if worsening.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypertension (HL), heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), hepatitis C (Hep C), and psoriatic arthritis. He was admitted to the ICU for exacerbation of CHF and bacterial endocarditis.

The patient's current complaints include dyspnea with repositioning, thirst, and tearfulness. He also has a history of nightsweats for months, progressive dyspnea, and possible septic embolism seen on CT scan. The source of endocarditis is unclear, and the patient denies drug use. Possible causal agents include Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, or other abdominal flora.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 118/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. His physical examination reveals a dry mouth, sclera with possible icterus, and a systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border. The patient has trace left basilar crackles in his chest and reproducible right lower quadrant (RLQ) focal tenderness to palpation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, psoriatic arthritis, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). He presented with bacterial endocarditis and an exacerbation of CHF. He is currently being treated with vancomycin, gentamicin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient is also receiving diuretics to manage his CHF symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial endocarditis: The patient is already being treated with antibiotics for this condition. Close monitoring of the patient's response to treatment is essential to prevent complications such as septic emboli or further spread of infection.

2. Congestive heart failure exacerbation: The patient's CHF symptoms are being managed with diuretics. It is important to monitor his fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and respiratory status to ensure adequate management of his CHF and prevent further exacerbation.

3. Kidney function: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, especially considering his history of CRI. Adjustments to his antibiotic dosages may be necessary based on renal function tests.

4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels should be monitored regularly to ensure they remain within normal limits. Imbalances can occur due to diuretic use or changes in renal function.

5. Anxiety and depression: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, chronic renal insufficiency, and psoriatic arthritis. He is currently admitted to the ICU for bacterial endocarditis and congestive heart failure exacerbation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in temperature. He has received antibiotic treatment for the bacterial endocarditis and diuretics for the congestive heart failure. Other medical issues such as psoriatic arthritis, anxiety, and depression are also being addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial Endocarditis: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis affecting both the tricuspid and aortic valves. This condition can lead to further complications such as septic emboli, heart valve damage, or spread of infection to other parts of the body.
2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's congestive heart failure may worsen if not properly managed. This could result in fluid overload, decreased cardiac output, and respiratory distress.
3. Renal Protection: The patient is undergoing renal protection measures due to his pre-existing chronic renal insufficiency. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly will be necessary to prevent any further deterioration of renal function.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored, especially considering his renal insufficiency. Imbalances in sodium, potassium, or other electrolytes can"
