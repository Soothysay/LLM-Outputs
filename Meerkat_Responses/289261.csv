   This is a 89 year-old female with a history of MDS, hip fracuture [**2-16**],
   living at rehab who presents with shortness of breath, hypoxia,
   leukocytosis and ? R pleura effusion/infiltrate.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypoxia - Patient c/o SOB and sating only 90 on NRB so transitioned
   to BiPAP.  Differential includes pneumonia, influenza, hyperviscousity
   syndrome with polycythemia. Patient appears hemoconcentrated on labs.
   Given the fact that she is 1 of 10 sick patients at her Rehab center,
   influenza is a possibility.
   - IV fluids conservatively.
   - Repeat CXR
   - Wean BiPAP as tolerated to maintain sats >90%.
   - Continue Vanc, cefipime from ED as patient has been at nursing home
   since [**2-16**] and recent hospitalization in [**8-17**].
   - Send nasal aspirate for influenza A/B
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - ? need for CTA given acute hypoxia -> low likelyhood at this point.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely [**2-10**] to dehdration with metoprolol and morphine.
   Patient recieved 0.5mg  of morphine prior to foley attempt.  Patient
   given bolusses with appropriate elevation in BP.  Somnolence most
   likely due to hypercarbia and morphine
   - IVF conservatively as patient is DNR/DNI
   - Try to avoid morphine unless SOB and uncomfortable
   .
   # Hypercarbia/Acidemia:  Possible  etiologies include CO2 retention
   from undiagnosed COPD.  Patient with wheezing on exam last PM.
   - Albuterol/Ibratroprium nebs PRN
   - Would hold off on steriods given active infection
   - Consider steriods if continues to be hypercarbic
   .
   # ARF - Cr to 1.6 with baseline of 1.0.  Likely pre-renal.  DDx
   includes post-obstructive given resistance found when attempting to
   place foley hyperviscousity syndrome given elevated Hct. Patient also
   had amorphous crystals on UA from [**2123**], so may be crystaluria.
   - IVF as above
   - Unable to place foley yesterday [**2-10**] to resistance met,  Patient
   incontinent of large volume of urine
   - U/A with urine cx
   - Urine lytes, osms
   - check serum viscosity
   .
   # Elevated CE - Trop elevated to 0.28, but CK normal and is in the
   setting of renal insufficiency. ECG unchanged from prior.
   - repeat ECG in AM
   - Cycle CE
   - Give aspirin 325 now
   .
   # Myeloproliferative syndrome - with baseline leukocytosis and
   thrombocytosis.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 230**].  Unclear when her last
   phlebotomy was.
   - Will contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 230**].

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including MDS, hip fracture, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diverticulitis, and renal failure. She presented with shortness of breath, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and possible pleural effusion/infiltrate.

The patient's current condition indicates hypoxia, possibly due to pneumonia, influenza, or hyperviscosity syndrome with polycythemia. Her labs show hemoconcentration, suggesting dehydration. She also has an elevated creatinine level, indicating renal failure.

The plan for the patient includes:

1. Hypoxia: Transitioned to BiPAP to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. Repeat chest X-ray, wean BiPAP as tolerated, and continue with current antibiotics.

2. Hypotension: Likely due to dehydration and possibly exacerbated by metoprolol and morphine. IV fluids will be given conservatively as the patient is DNR/DNI.

3. Hypercarbia/Acidemia: Possible etiologies include CO2 retention from undiagnosed COPD. Nebulization with albuterol/ibratroprium PRN, and consideration of steroids if hypercarbia persists.

4. Acute Renal Failure: Cr level increased to 1.6 with a baseline of 1.0. Likely pre-renal. Differential diagnosis includes post-obstructive due to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions including MDS, hip fracture, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diverticulitis, and myeloproliferative syndrome. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and a possible pleural effusion/infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient was initially on NRB (nasal respiratory bipap) but transitioned to BiPAP due to persistent hypoxia. She is currently on IV fluids, antibiotics (Vanc and cefipime), and being weaned off BiPAP to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. Repeat CXR, nasal aspirate for influenza A/B, and follow-up blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been ordered. The patient's WBC count is trending upward, and her creatinine level has risen to 1.6 from a baseline of 1.0, suggesting acute renal failure, likely pre-renal in origin. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation requires close monitoring and adjustment of BiPAP settings. Influenza is a possibility given her exposure at the nursing home, so sending a nasal aspirate for influenza A/B is important.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has rhonchorous sounds throughout her lung fields, crackles at the bases, and an infiltr"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions, including MDS, hip fracture, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diverticulitis, and myeloproliferative syndrome. She was admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and a possible pleural effusion/infiltrate. The patient required BiPAP initially for hypoxia and then for hypercarbia. She also had hypotension that responded to fluid boluses.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient initially required BiPAP for hypoxia and later for hypercarbia. Differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, influenza, underlying COPD, hyperviscosity syndrome with polycythemia. The patient's HCT improved with IV hydration.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure was likely due to dehydration and the use of metoprolol and morphine. She received fluid boluses that resulted in an appropriate elevation in blood pressure.

3. Hypercarbia/Acidemia: Possible etiologies include CO2 retention from undiagnosed COPD. The patient had wheezing on exam, suggesting underlying respiratory issues.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels increased from 1.0 to 1.6. The likely cause is pre-renal, possibly due to dehydration or post-obstruct"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), hip fracture, living at a rehab facility. She presented with shortness of breath, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and a possible right pleural effusion/infiltrate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient required BiPAP initially for hypoxia, then for hypercarbia. Differential includes pneumonia, influenza, underlying COPD, hyperviscousity syndrome with polycythemia.
2. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension likely due to dehydration and medications such as metoprolol and morphine. IV fluids were given to improve blood pressure.
3. Hypercarbia/Acidemia: Possible etiologies include CO2 retention from undiagnosed COPD. The patient had wheezing on exam last PM.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level increased from 1.0 to 1.6, suggesting pre-renal azotemia. Differential diagnoses include post-obstructive, hyperviscousity syndrome, and crystaluria.
5. Elevated Cardiac Enzymes: Trop T elevated to 0.28, and CK within normal limits, in the setting of renal insufficiency.

   leukocytosis and ? R pleura effusion/infiltrate.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypoxia - Patient required BiPAP initially for hypoxia, then for
   hypercarbia.  Differential includes pneumonia, influenza, underlying
   COPD, hyperviscousity syndrome with polycythemia. HCT much improved
   with IV hydration.
   - IV fluids conservatively.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated to maintain sats 88-93%.
   - Continue Vanc, cefipime
   - start Levaquin for extra pseudomonas coverage
   - Send nasal aspirate for influenza A/B
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - F/u Legionella antigen if can get urine sample (see below)
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely [**2-10**] to dehydration with metoprolol and morphine.
   Patient recieved 0.5mg  of morphine prior to foley attempt.  Patient
   given bolusses with appropriate elevation in BP.  Somnolence most
   likely due to hypercarbia and morphine
   - IVF conservatively as patient is DNR/DNI
   - Try to avoid morphine unless SOB and uncomfortable
   .
   # Hypercarbia/Acidemia:  Possible  etiologies include CO2 retention
   from undiagnosed COPD.  Patient with wheezing on exam last PM.
   - Albuterol/Ibratroprium nebs PRN
   - Would hold off on steroids given active infection
   - Consider steroids if continues to be hypercarbic
   .
   # ARF - Cr to 1.6 with baseline of 1.0.  Likely pre-renal.  DDx
   includes post-obstructive given resistance found when attempting to
   place foley hyperviscousity syndrome given elevated Hct. Patient also
   had amorphous crystals on UA from [**2123**], so may be crystaluria.
   - IVF as above
   - Unable to place foley yesterday [**2-10**] to resistance met,  Patient
   incontinent of large volume of urine
   - When able to get sample: U/A with urine cx Urine lytes, osms
   - check serum viscosity
   .
   # Elevated CE - Trop elevated to 0.28 flat, and CK within normal limits
   and is in the setting of renal insufficiency. ECG unchanged from prior.
   - repeat ECG in AM
   - Cycle CE
   - Give aspirin 325 now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), hip fracture, pneumonia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diverticulitis, renal failure, and leukemia. The patient presents with shortness of breath, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and a possible pleural effusion/infiltrate.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including acute myocardial infarction, hypotension, respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, hypothyroidism, benign hypertension, femoral neck fracture, atrial fibrillation, diverticulitis, acute renal failure, pneumonia, and myelodysplastic syndrome.

The plan includes managing hypoxia, hypotension, hypercarbia, acute renal failure, elevated cardiac enzymes, and myeloproliferative syndrome. The patient is also on various medications and has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) code status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, worsening renal failure, further cardiac complications, development of infections due to immunocompromised state, and bleeding events due to anticoagulation therapy.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygen saturation levels, renal function, electrolyte levels, and cardiac enzymes. Frequent reassessment of the patient's condition and prompt intervention are necessary to prevent complications and provide appropriate care."

The plan includes weaning off oxygen, continuing antibiotics, sending nasal aspirate for influenza A/B, following up with blood and sputum cultures, and trending WBC count fever curve.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and requires supplemental oxygen. There is a possibility of pneumonia, and the patient is already on appropriate antibiotics. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels is necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension but has improved overnight. It is important to maintain adequate fluid balance and avoid hypotension, especially considering the patient's DNR/DNI status.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 1.6, indicating possible acute renal failure. Conservative management with IV fluids is recommended, and further evaluation of urine output and renal function is needed.
4. Hypercarbia/acidemia: The patient may have hyper"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome, hip fracture, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diverticulitis, and acute renal failure. She presents with shortness of breath, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and a possible pleural effusion/infiltrate. The patient is currently on BiPAP for hypoxia and receiving IV fluids, antibiotics (Vanc, cefipime, levofloxacin), and being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a risk of inadequate oxygen supply to vital organs.
2. Respiratory Failure: The presence of crackles at the bases and rhonchi throughout the lung fields suggests the possibility of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Renal Failure: The elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, which may worsen without appropriate management.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath and leukocytosis, along with the chest X-ray findings, suggest a possible pneumonia.
5. Myocardial Infarction: Although the patient is already diagnosed with a myocardial infarction, it is essential to monitor for any changes in cardiac function or additional complications.
6. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count indicates an immune response or infection, which needs to be managed accordingly.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), hip fracture, living at a rehabilitation center. She presented with shortness of breath, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and a possible right pleural effusion/infiltrate. The patient required BiPAP initially for hypoxia but needed it overnight. She is now on vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin for pneumonia. Her hematocrit (HCT) improved with intravenous (IV) hydration. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient initially required BiPAP for hypoxia and needed it overnight. Oxygen should be weaned as tolerated to maintain oxygen saturation levels between 88-93%.
2. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient has crackles at the right base and rare wheezes, which could indicate pneumonia or COPD exacerbation. Nebulizations of albuterol and ipratropium should be administered as needed. Steroids may be considered if the patient continues to be hypercarbic.
3. Renal Failure, Acute: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 1.6, indicating acute renal failure. Pre-renal azotemia is likely due to dehydration, which improved with IV hydration. Further evaluation of urine output and serum electrolytes is necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   89-year-old woman with respiratory distress/respiratory failure
   requiring intermittent non-invasive ventilation.  Her problems include:
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]) -- hypercarbic
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROME
 LEUKOCYTOSIS - improving
 Inability to place Foley catheter
 ACUTE MI (troponin > 0.2, but stable
 Probable aspiration
   Pneumonia appears to the main actor here.  We will continue current
   broad-spectrum antibiotics while awaiting cultures.  We will also try
   to limit ins as possible.  Given overall request to not have invasive
   procedures, and inability to place Foley with usual techniques, will
   not pursue urologic eval at this time.  Acute renal failure is
   improving.  Acute MI is likely due to demand, not unstable plaque.
   Will hold off on POs for now except under close supervision

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 89-year-old woman with multiple health issues, including acute respiratory distress, acute renal failure, pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), myelodysplastic syndrome, and leukocytosis. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has a history of allergies to enalapril and amlodipine. She was started on non-invasive ventilation in the emergency department and then transferred to the ICU.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 131/60 to 134/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,464 mL, output of 440 mL through the mouth, and an IV fluid input of 1,024 mL. Urine output could not be measured. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device, and her ABG (arterial blood gas) results show a pH of 7.27.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, absent pulses in both lower extremities, and unassessed skin and neurologic status. Her lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and lactate levels. Other lab values"

","The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions, including myelodysplastic syndrome, hip fracture, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diverticulitis, and acute renal failure. She presented with shortness of breath, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and a possible right pleural effusion/infiltrate. 

The patient was initially on BiPAP for hypoxia but required more aggressive support overnight. Influenza was negative, and she is now on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and cefepime for pneumonia. The sputum culture showed moderate growth of opportunistic pathogens. 

Conservative IV fluids were given, and oxygen was weaned as tolerated to maintain saturation levels between 88-93%. Levofloxacin was continued, and consideration was given to discontinuing vancomycin or cefepime. Blood and sputum cultures were to be followed up, and the WBC count fever curve was trended. A Legionella antigen and urine culture were also considered if a urine sample could be obtained. 

The patient developed new-onset atrial fibrillation, which was not well tolerated, so metoprolol was started via IV due to her inability to take oral medication. 

Acute renal failure was evident with a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 1.6. It was believed to be pre-renal in nature and improved with hydration"
