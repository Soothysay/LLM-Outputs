   42 year old lady with a history of ESRD on HD from Type 1 DM presented
   to the ED with hyperglycemia in the 500s and confusion since earlier
   that morning.  The patient was found to have a K in the 7-8 range,
   peaked T waves and a RLL consolidation on CXR.
   The patient's sister reports that the patient was experiencing lethargy
   and weakness with worsening severe headaches and photophobia in the
   past few days, on a background of [**12-29**] months of headache.  Per her
   nephrologist, the patient learned 2 nights prior that she is
   temporarily de-listed for transplant.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 42 year old lady with ESRD from Type 1 diabetes presents with
   confusion/altered mental status with a recent headache and worsening
   lethargy in the setting of hyperglycemia.  She is responsive to
   sedative medications.
   1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be
   due to infectious (meningitis/PNA), hyperglycemia/hypertensive
   derrangements, possible ingestion in the light of the recent de-listing
   news, or a reaction to prescribed meds such as reglan.  All tox screens
   are negative this far and the patient is not showing objective signs of
   infection (no fever or white count).  She has received haldol and
   ativan for agitation thus far.  LP was unsuccessful yesterday.  Urine
   Tox, Serum Tox were negative.
   - LP for menigitis this morning
   - Blood Cx, Urine Cx, Urine Legionella antigen, sputum Cx need to be
   followed up
   - Vanc/CTX/Amp/Acyclovir for Meningitis and mediocre
   - Ativan/haldol PRN; Restraints PRN
   - BNP to determine fluid overload vs. PNA
   2. Hyperglycemia: The patient is having hyperglycemia with alterations
   in mental status but no evidence of ketones.  Her anion gap is
   difficult to interpret given her underlying renal disease.
   - Continue sliding scale
   - No IVF given renal disease
   3. Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive to the 200s, with baseline
   150s.  We are unable to administer her home meds because of altered
   mental status.
   - Lopressor 5mg IV Q6
   - Hydralazine PRN
   4. ESRD: The patient was admitted to dialyze off an elevated potassium.

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to Type 1 diabetes mellitus. She presented to the emergency department with hyperglycemia in the 500s and confusion. The patient has a potassium level of 7-8 range, peaked T waves, and right lower lobe consolidation on chest X-ray. She also has a history of severe headaches and photophobia for the past few days, and recently learned that she is temporarily de-listed for a transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various causes such as infectious (meningitis/PNA), hyperglycemia/hypertensive derangements, possible ingestion in light of recent delisting news, or a reaction to prescribed medications. Further evaluation and management are needed, including performing a lumbar puncture for meningitis, obtaining cultures, and adjusting antibiotic coverage.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient is experiencing hyperglycemia with alterations in mental status but no evidence of ketones. Her anion gap is difficult to interpret due to underlying renal disease. Continuous sliding scale insulin therapy should be continued, and intravenous fluids should be avoided due to renal disease.
3. Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive in the 200s, with a baseline of 150s. Administration of home medications is not possible due to altered mental status."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old lady with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) due to Type 1 diabetes mellitus. She presented to the emergency department with hyperglycemia in the 500s and confusion since earlier that morning. The patient has a potassium level in the 7-8 range, peaked T waves, and right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation on chest X-ray. 

The patient's sister reports that she has been experiencing lethargy and weakness with worsening severe headaches and photophobia over the past few days. This is on a background of 12 months of headache. The patient's nephrologist informed her two nights prior that she is temporarily de-listed for transplant.

   peaked T waves and a RLL consolidation on CXR.
   The patient's sister reports that the patient was experiencing lethargy
   and weakness with worsening severe headaches and photophobia in the
   past few days, on a background of [**12-29**] months of headache.  Per her
   nephrologist, the patient learned 2 nights prior that she is
   temporarily de-listed for transplant.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 42 year old lady with ESRD from Type 1 diabetes presents with
   confusion/altered mental status with a recent headache and worsening
   lethargy in the setting of hyperglycemia.  She is responsive to
   sedative medications.
   1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be
   due to infectious (meningitis/PNA), hyperglycemia/hypertensive
   derrangements, possible ingestion in the light of the recent de-listing
   news, psychiatric reaction to finding out de-listing news, or a
   reaction to prescribed meds such as reglan.  All tox screens are
   negative this far and the patient is not showing objective signs of
   infection (no fever or white count).  She has received haldol and
   ativan for agitation thus far.  LP was unsuccessful yesterday.  Urine
   Tox, Serum Tox were negative. Patient
s mental status today is A&O x3.
   - LP today; request IR to attempt please
   - Blood Cx, Urine Cx, Urine Legionella antigen, sputum Cx need to be
   followed up
   - Vanc/CTX/Amp/Acyclovir for meningitis
   - Ativan/haldol PRN
   - Restraints PRN
   2. Hyperglycemia: The patient is having hyperglycemia with alterations
   in mental status but no evidence of ketones.  Her anion gap is
   difficult to interpret given her underlying renal disease.
   - Continue sliding scale
   - No IVF given renal disease
   3. Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive to the 200s, with baseline
   150s.  We were previously unable to administer her home meds because of
   altered mental status.
   - Restart home antihypertensives (valsartan)
   - HD today
   4. ESRD: The patient was admitted to for dialysis given hyperkalemia. K
   has now normalized.
   - Nephrocaps, hold Renagel (Phos 2.7)
   - HD today
   5. CXR findings: Concerning for fluid overload. BNP points to fluid
   overload. Also covering for pneumonia with antibiotics.
   - Abx as above
   - HD today
   - Repeat CXR post-dialysis to look for volume clearing
   6. Hypothyroidism: Normal dose 200-250mcg PO of levothyroxine.
   - 100mcg IV
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO until LP then renal diet
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   Access: Peripherals

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to diabetes mellitus (DM) who is on hemodialysis (HD). She presented with delirium, agitation, and hyperglycemia. She has experienced two days of weakness and lethargy. The patient was recently notified that she was temporarily removed from the kidney transplant list. She is currently calm and improving after being given haldol and ativan.

Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient initially presented with delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, metabolic imbalances, or medication side effects. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. This could contribute to her current symptoms and increase the risk of other complications.

3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has suspected sepsis based on the presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count. However, the absence of organ dysfunction suggests a mild or early-stage infection.

4. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient has chronic kidney disease that has progressed to end-stage renal disease. This condition requires ongoing management with hemodialysis and may contribute to the patient's overall vulnerability to infections and other complications.

5. Emotional distress: The patient recently received news about being temporarily removed from the kidney transplant list, which may have caused"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 42 year old lady with ESRD from Type 1 diabetes presents with
   confusion/altered mental status with a recent headache and worsening
   lethargy in the setting of hyperglycemia.  She is responsive to
   sedative medications.
   .
   1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be
   due to infectious (meningitis/PNA), hyperglycemia/hypertensive
   derrangements, possible ingestion in the light of the recent de-listing
   news, psychiatric reaction to finding out de-listing news, or a
   reaction to prescribed meds such as reglan.  All tox screens are
   negative this far and the patient is not showing objective signs of
   infection (no fever or white count).  She has received haldol and
   ativan for agitation thus far.  LP was unsuccessful yesterday.  Urine
   Tox, Serum Tox were negative. Patient
s mental status today is A&O x3.
   - LP yesterday not suggestive of infection
   - Blood Cx, Urine Cx, Urine Legionella antigen, sputum Cx need to be
   followed up (all NTD)
   - Vanc/CTX/Amp/Acyclovir for meningitis
   - Ativan/haldol PRN
   - Restraints PRN
   - MRV for venous thrombosis
   .
   2. Hyperglycemia: The patient is having hyperglycemia with alterations
   in mental status but no evidence of ketones.  Her anion gap is
   difficult to interpret given her underlying renal disease.
   - Continue sliding scale
   - No IVF given renal disease
   .
   3. Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive to the 200s, with baseline
   150s.  We were previously unable to administer her home meds because of
   altered mental status.
   - Restarted home antihypertensives (valsartan)
   - HD today
   .
   4. ESRD: The patient was admitted to for dialysis given hyperkalemia. K
   has now normalized.
   - Nephrocaps, hold Renagel (Phos 2.7)
   - HD yesterday
   5. CXR findings: Concerning for fluid overload. BNP points to fluid
   overload. Also covering for pneumonia with antibiotics.
   - Abx as above

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old lady with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) from Type 1 diabetes. She presents with confusion/altered mental status, recent headache, worsening lethargy, and hyperglycemia. The patient's altered mental status may be due to infectious causes such as meningitis or pneumonia, hyperglycemia/hypertensive disturbances, possible ingestion, psychiatric reaction, or adverse reaction to medications.

The patient has received haloperidol (Haldol) and lorazepam (Ativan) for agitation. A lumbar puncture (LP) was unsuccessful yesterday, and toxicology screens were negative. The patient's mental status has improved to alert and oriented x3 today. Blood cultures, urine cultures, urine Legionella antigen, and sputum cultures need to be followed up as they are pending.

The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir for meningitis. She is also on a sliding scale insulin for hyperglycemia. Her blood pressure is significantly elevated, ranging from 174/81 to 206/96 mmHg. The patient's hypertension was previously uncontrolled, and she was unable to take her home medications due to altered mental status. Valsartan has been restarted, and hemodialysis (HD) is planned today.

The patient has a history of ESRD and was"

- She presents with confusion, altered mental status, recent headache, and worsening lethargy.
- The patient is responsive to sedative medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to infectious causes such as meningitis or pneumonia, hyperglycemia/hypertensive disturbances, possible ingestion, psychiatric reaction to news, or a reaction to prescribed medications. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient is experiencing hyperglycemia with alterations in mental status but no evidence of ketones. The anion gap is difficult to interpret due to her underlying renal disease. Continuous monitoring and management of blood glucose levels are essential.
3. Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive"
