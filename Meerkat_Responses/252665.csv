","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type II, presenting with diabetic foot infection and deep tissue infection of the left foot. She was admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and now shows signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with fever spikes to 102 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient has been receiving antibiotic treatment with Unasyn and Vancomycin for less than 24 hours. Her vital signs indicate tachycardia, and she is currently being prepared for toe amputation and exploration in the operating room. Her DKA has resolved, but she now exhibits hyperchloremia. There is uncertainty regarding the presence of a right bundle branch block (RBBB), which was not associated with chest pain, and her troponin levels were negative. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is NPO (nothing by mouth) for surgery. She will receive subcutaneous heparin as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has peripheral access for IV lines. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be admitted to the ICU before surgery. If stable post-surgery, she will be transferred to the floor."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, presenting with diabetic foot infection and deep tissue infection of the left foot. She was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and now shows signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), fever, tachycardia, and good urine output. The patient is scheduled for toe amputation and exploration in the operating room soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a diabetic foot infection and deep tissue infection, which increases the risk of further complications such as sepsis or wound dehiscence.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the patient's DKA seems to be resolved, there is a possibility of recurrence if her blood glucose levels become poorly controlled again.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but there is a potential risk of hypotension during or after surgery due to fluid shifts or anesthesia effects.
4. Arrhythmias: Tachycardia is present, and the patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. This could potentially lead to arrhythmias during surgery or due to electrolyte imbalances.
5. Hyperglycemia: Despite being on insulin, the patient's glucose levels remain elevated. Proper glycemic control is crucial to prevent hyperglycemic crises.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 who presented with left foot pain and swelling, along with fevers at home. She underwent an operation for debridement of her left foot, which revealed a pus pocket extending into the sole of her foot. The patient's vital signs upon return from the operating room showed a high blood pressure in the 220s and a high heart rate in the 160s, accompanied by rigors and fever. She was given demoral and labetalol intravenously, which resulted in a moderate response with blood pressure in the 160s-180s and heart rate in the 120s.

The patient has no known drug allergies and received ampicillin/sulbactam and vancomycin previously. She is currently receiving various medications including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), morphine sulfate, labetalol, and other ICU medications.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. Flowsheet data indicates elevated temperatures, increased heart rate, and fluctuating blood pressure readings. The patient's respiratory support consists of an oxygen delivery device via nasal cannula, and her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 33 mmHg, PaO2 of 135 mmHg, HCO3 of 18 mEq/L, and base excess of -4.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears anxious and is experiencing rigors. Her eyes and conjunctiva are pink without abnormalities, and her head, ears, nose, and throat examination shows no significant findings. The patient has no cervical lymphadenopathy, and her cardiovascular examination is unremarkable. Peripheral vascular examination shows diminished pulses in both right and left dorsal pedis (DP) pulses. Respiratory/chest examination shows clear breath sounds bilaterally with a few scattered crackles at the bases. Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds. Extremities reveal the absence of edema in both lower extremities, and the left foot is bandaged with erythema on the dorsum. Neurologic examination indicates that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and movement, tone, and strength assessments have not been performed yet.

Laboratory results include elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels, and decreased platelet count (Plt). Renal function tests show normal creatinine (Cr) levels, while cardiac markers such as troponin-T are within normal limits. Liver function tests, electrolyte levels, and other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's assessment and plan include cellulitis/osteomyelitis, sepsis, tachycardia, hypertension, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient is currently receiving empirical antibiotics and is scheduled for repeat debridement and possible transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) of the left foot on Monday. Blood and wound cultures are pending, and the patient will continue to receive pain management with morphine and NSAIDs. Sepsis management involves monitoring blood pressure and heart rate closely, providing fluid boluses"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type II presenting with deep tissue infection of the left foot. She was admitted for amputation and subsequently developed septic shock. The patient experienced intermittent fevers with hypotension post-operation and required aggressive intravenous fluids (IVF) to stabilize blood pressure. Cultures from the foot showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible bacterial infection. The patient will undergo further debridement on Monday and will continue receiving antibiotics (Unasyn and Vancomycin). She is also scheduled for frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels, insulin gtt, IVF as needed, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin.

Potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The presence of gram-positive cocci in the foot culture suggests a bacterial infection, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and was initially admitted for DKA. While her condition appears to be resolved, it is important to monitor her blood glucose levels and electrolyte balance closely.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of low blood pressure, particularly post-operation. This may be due to septic shock or other factors, and it requires close monitoring and appropriate management with IVF.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As a precautionary measure, the patient is receiving prophylactic"

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II presenting with deep tissue infection of the left foot and septic shock. The patient underwent an amputation of the 4th toe and subsequently developed intermittent fevers with hypotension, which were treated with aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation. The patient's blood cultures showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible Staphylococcus aureus infection. The patient is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and will require further debridement and possible additional amputation in the upcoming days.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Persistent or worsening infection: The patient's condition can deteriorate if the infection spreads or does not respond to the current antibiotic therapy. Close monitoring of vital signs, wound healing, and repeat cultures will be necessary to assess the progress.

2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's kidneys and liver should be closely monitored due to the potential impact of sepsis and the administration of antibiotics. Abnormalities in kidney function tests (such as increased serum creatinine) or liver function tests (such as elevated liver enzymes) may indicate organ dysfunction.

3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which may be due to septic shock. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management with intravenous fluids and vasopressors may be required to maintain hemodynamic stability.

4. Pulmonary complications: The patient's shortness"

","The patient has a chief complaint of cellulitis and is currently in the ICU. The patient's postoperative hypertension has resolved, but they experienced a fever spike to 103.7 degrees Celsius and had recurrent hypotension overnight, which responded to intravenous fluids (IVF). The respiratory status is stable with an arterial line placed. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was ampicillin/sulbactam, followed by ampicillin, and then vancomycin. 

In terms of infusions, the patient is receiving labetalol, meperidine (Demerol), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and morphine sulfate. Other medications include colace, Tylenol standing q8hours, and morphine. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted changes above. 

The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 103.7 degrees Celsius, current temperature of 36 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 97 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 80s systolic to 200 systolic, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

The patient has received a total of 10,677 mL of IV fluids, with an output of 2,010 mL of urine. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 33 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 135 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 15%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 15 mmol/L.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. The patient has periorbital edema, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, normal heart sounds, and symmetric chest expansion with scattered crackles and diminished breath sounds at the bases. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, and there is no edema in either lower extremity. The patient's skin is warm, and neurological examination reveals that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movement with normal tone.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 16.1 to 19.6 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 28.4% to 31.0%, platelet (Plt) count ranging from 424 to 551 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 mg/dL, troponin T level below 0.01 ng/mL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 61 to 186 mg/dL.

Hypoxemia: atelectasis vs volume overload, will check CXR, OOB in
   chair, incentive spirometry.
 CELLULITIS:
   To OR again for debridment in am, continue with wound care and pain
   management with iv morphine prn. Check Arterial LENI.
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA):

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of cellulitis. He has a history of diabetes and presented with signs of infection, including fever and hypotension. The patient underwent surgical debridement and was admitted to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure responded to intravenous fluids (IVF) and is being monitored closely. It is important to maintain adequate perfusion and consider adjusting medication dosages accordingly.
2. Infection: The presence of cellulitis and wound culture positive for gram-positive cocci indicates an ongoing infection. Antibiotics (Vanco/unasyn) have been started, and cultures are being followed up. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis or worsening infection is necessary.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient has an increased respiratory rate, but oxygen saturation is within normal limits. Atelectasis may be contributing to hypoxemia, and a chest X-ray will be checked. Incentive spirometry and positioning are recommended to prevent further respiratory complications.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient had resolved DKA, but close monitoring of blood sugars and insulin administration is crucial to prevent recurrence.
5. Fluid balance: The patient received a significant amount of IV fluids, and fluid balance needs to be closely monitored to avoid fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prophylaxis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, presenting with deep tissue infection of the left foot, diabetic foot infection, and septic shock. She was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management. The patient has been improving on Unasyn, an antibiotic, and is scheduled for further debridement in the operating room on Monday. Cultures and pathology will be followed up. The patient also had diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) which has resolved, and now presents with hyperchloremia. She was on insulin but is now off. Hypertension, shortness of breath, and right bundle branch block (RBBB) are also noted. The patient's electrolytes are being monitored, and she is NPO for surgery. Prophylactic subcutaneous heparin is being administered. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobilization and central venous catheter use.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of deep tissue infection and is currently on antibiotics. There is a risk of developing new infections, especially if the patient's immune system is compromised.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and if not managed properly, it can lead to further complications such as heart failure or stroke.

The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). The patient underwent a vascular procedure and is scheduled for another procedure tomorrow. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 165/67 mmHg, heart rate of 100 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals no signs of distress, with clear lungs and a supple neck. However, the patient has a tachycardic heart rate, and there is evidence of peripheral edema. The patient's left fourth toe is necrotic, and there is diffuse erythema of the left foot to ankle with a large blood-filled blister on the plantar aspect. Neurologically, the patient has no focal deficits, and all cranial nerves are intact.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low magnesium level. Imaging studies reveal no significant abnormalities.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current diagnoses include hypertension, acute pain, wound infection, hypotension (not in shock), hyperglycemia, cellulitis, and peripheral arterial disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, presenting with diabetic foot infection and septic shock. She was admitted with deep tissue infection of the left foot and diagnosed with septic shock. The patient's initial management included administration of antibiotics, aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, and surgical debridement. Her blood glucose levels were also monitored and managed appropriately.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic foot infection: The patient has a deep tissue infection in her left foot, which can potentially lead to further complications such as cellulitis, abscess formation, or osteomyelitis. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent the progression of the infection.
2. Septic shock: The patient's initial presentation included septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation, hypotension, and organ dysfunction. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and organ function is crucial to ensure adequate response to treatment and prevent further complications.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, ranging from 150-180 mmHg. If left uncontrolled, hypertension can increase the risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Antihypertensive therapy, such as beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors, should be initiated to maintain blood pressure within target range.
4. Hyperglycemia: Given the patient's history of diabetes mellitus type II"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual without acute distress. They have been on diuretics and are currently stable. The patient has a history of hypertension, benign; respiratory status with volume overload; acute pain; hypotension (not in shock); hyperglycemia; and cellulitis. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, and their ABG results indicate adequate oxygenation. Physical examination reveals crackles and wheezes in the chest, along with edema in the lower extremities. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function. The patient's imaging shows stable hilar opacities on CXR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory dysfunction: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to volume overload. If not managed properly, this can lead to pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's elevated blood glucose levels may indicate uncontrolled diabetes. If left untreated, it can progress to DKA, a life-threatening condition characterized by hyperglycemia, ketone production, and metabolic acidosis.
3. Infection: The presence of cellulitis and the growing Group B Streptococcus (GBS) indicate a potential bacterial infection. If not appropriately treated, it can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI"

   with septic shock
   .
   #  Diabetic foot infection/Septic shock: met SIRS criteria originally
   but now has defervesed and has been hemodynamically stable for 24 hours
   with good UOP.  Definitive management in OR today. Cultures show GPC
   from foot that is strep, should be sensitive to ampicillin
   - Unasyn continues
   - vanc to  be discontinued
   - to OR after ABIs
   - will f/u cultues and pathology
   - tylenol scheduled
   - Motrin PRN for pain
   - morphine PRN for pain (if BP is stable)
   - cont [**Hospital1 7**] dry dressings
   #  DKA: resolved, anion gap closed, now w/ hyperchloremia. Was on
   insulin gtt, now off. On SSI.
   - QIDACHS FS
   - NPH 5 units [**Hospital1 7**]
   - hold IVF now as volume overloaded
   # Hypertension: SBP in 150-180s
   - started metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] which can be uptitrate for improved
   control
   - monitor BPs, noninvasives seem to be more accurate
   # Shortness of breath: brief hypoxia likely [**3-6**] volume overload. Could
   be component of COPD. Put out well to 20mg Iv lasix
   - 20mg Iv lasix prior to OR
   - IS
   - OOB
   - CXR
   - O2 88-94%
   # RBBB: unclear if old or new, no chest pain
   - trop was negative x 1
   # FEN: hold IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for surgery
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
