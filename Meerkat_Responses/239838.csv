","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old male with a history of asthma and Crohn's disease, who underwent an ileocecectomy and was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia. The patient's breathing has significantly improved since the diuresis and treatment for pneumonia (PNA). The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), as well as medications for asthma, pain management, and prophylaxis for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/77 to 145/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. However, the troponin T level is elevated at 10.0 ng/mL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient may require prolonged mechanical ventilation due to his respiratory distress and hypoxia.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections, particularly due to the prolonged use of indwelling lines and tubes.
3. Organ dysfunction: There is a risk of organ dysfunction, particularly in the kidneys and liver, as indicated by the elevated creatinine and liver"

   24 Hour Events:
   .
   HPI: This is a 26 year old male with hx Asthma with Crohn's Disease now
   s/p ileocecectomy being admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for hypoxia. He was
   originally admitted on [**11-29**] for ileocecectomy after pt was diagnosed
   with severe inflammation/phlegmon about the distal ileum
   and cecum and a small fistula in the terminal ileum.  He started
   Remicade for 8 weeks, [**2186-9-21**] and had been on Cipro/Flagyl prior to
   surgery. On the day after ileocecectomy he was found to have HCT drop
   from 41-> 28 -> 22. Patient was taken back to OR on [**11-30**] for ex-lap
   when a large amount of clot was removed from the abdomen. Overnight, he
   then became tachycardic to 140's, desat'ed to 80's on 4L NC, but
   recovered until this morning. At around 11am, he once again became
   hypoxic to mid 80's on NC requiring NRB, BP 130's/80's, febrile to
   103.0. ABG 7.42/49/68 EKG showed sinsus tachycardia with TWI laterally.
   CXR with ? volume overload, gave lasix 10 IV to which he put out
   2500cc.  He received nebs w/o improvement and was not wheezing on exam.
   It was noted by surgery nursing staff that his family had been pressing
   his diluaded PCA for while he was sleeping. He was drowsy but easily
   arousable and RR 16. He then went for CTA, which was negative for PE
   but showed new consolidation and lobar colapse. He was then transfered
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]. Of note, he is 14L positive over his LOS.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 26-year-old male with a history of asthma and Crohn's disease who underwent an ileocecectomy surgery. He was admitted to the hospital for hypoxia and has experienced several complications since his admission.

1. Hypoxia: The patient is currently experiencing hypoxia, as indicated by a saturation level of 94% on the nasal cannula. The large arterial-to-alveolar (A-a) gradient suggests a possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and mucus plugging. The patient's fever and CT findings support this diagnosis. Immunosuppression due to Remicade use should also be considered when treating the pneumonia. Additionally, there is a component of volume overload, but further diuresis may be necessary tomorrow.

2. S/p ileocecectomy c/b intrabdominal bleeding: The patient had a post-operative bleeding after his ileocecectomy, which required exploration in the operating room. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and wound care is important in this case.

3. TWI: The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) showed T-wave inversion (TWI), which is unusual for a 26-year-old with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute (bpm). Further evaluation with a repeat EKG and additional tests, such as a cardiac enzyme panel, may be necessary.

4. Hx asthma: The patient has a history of asthma,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old man with a history of Crohn's disease who was transferred to the ICU with acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. He has been receiving antibiotics, chest physical therapy, and is ambulating with assistance. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 133/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. His ABG results show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 188, and oxygen delivery device as a nasal cannula. The patient is well-nourished, with no signs of edema or abnormal findings on examination. His neurological assessment is also unremarkable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia, there is a risk of developing VAP if he requires prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of DVT. The patient should be monitored for signs of DVT, such as unilateral leg swelling or pain.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to his critical illness and the use of corticosteroids. Prophylaxis with a"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old male with a history of asthma and Crohn's disease who underwent an ileocecectomy. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia, which has since improved after diuresis and treatment for pneumonia (PNA). The patient's current medical complications include hypoxia, post-operative ileocecectomy with intrabdominal bleeding, and a suspected myocardial infarction (MI) based on troponin-T levels.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, mild respiratory distress, and tachypnea. He has a fever with a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F). His blood pressure is within normal range, and oxygen saturation is maintained at 95% with the use of a nasal cannula. The patient's weight has decreased from 90.5 kg to 85 kg since admission.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 106 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 91 to 98 mg/dL, and normal kidney function with creatinine levels at 0.8 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels are elevated, indicating potential cardiac damage.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress with tachypnea, tachycardia, and no jugular venous distention (JVD). His abdomen is soft but tender with hypo"

","The patient is a 26-year-old male with a history of asthma and Crohn's disease who was admitted to the hospital for hypoxia. He underwent an ileocecectomy and developed post-operative aspiration pneumonia. His oxygenation improved with diuresis and treatment for pneumonia, but he is still requiring 6 liters of oxygen through a nasal cannula. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 135/72 to 149/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 95%. 

On physical examination, the patient appears drowsy but is easily arousable, pleasant, and in pain from coughing. He has no lesions noted in his head, eyes, ears, nose, or throat (HEENT), and his heart rhythm is sinus regular. His lung sounds are diminished bibasilar, and he has tachycardia but regular heart sounds with no murmurs or gallop. His abdomen is soft and non-distended with normo-active bowel sounds, but there is a significant tension pneumothorax (TTP) over his midline abdominal incision. His extremities are without changes, and his skin is without rashes or lesions.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 6.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9."

   - Surgery wants bronch for pt to clear secretions
   - [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] team & IP agree that pt is getting better on his own; needs
   aggressive chest PT and ability to clear secretions is limited by pain.
   CXR today much improved from prior. Bronch is invasive and can worsen
   pts underlying pulmn process (asp PNA post-operative)
   - ct abx
   - adv diet to clears->fulls as tolerated
   - MRSA positive nasal swab, put on contact precautions
   - got paged from surgery at [**2124**] saying ""FYI [**Doctor Last Name 253**] wants [**Hospital **]
   transferred to SICU [**Hospital Ward Name 742**]. He may go to OR tomorrow for bronch. I
   know there is a lot of contention on this point. If your attending has
   issues, she can speak directly to [**Doctor Last Name 253**].""

The patient has shown significant improvement in oxygenation and decreased O2 requirement after diuresis and treatment for PNA. However, he is still on 6L nasal cannula.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109-156/70-94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals diffuse rhonchi at apices, decreased breath sounds and rales at bases, especially on the right side. The patient also has a tachycardic but regular heart rate with normal S1S2 and no murmurs, a soft and non-distended abdomen with appropriate post-surgical tenderness over the midline abdominal incision, and no extremity complications.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 115 K/uL, blood glucose level of 92 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. Other labs include elevated troponin-T levels, slightly low potassium and magnesium levels, and normal calcium and phosphorus levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.28.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Hypoxia due to post-operative aspiration pneumonia. The patient's oxygenation has improved, and he is expected to continue weaning off supplemental oxygen. Conservative management will be continued, including chest physiotherapy, chest X-ray, and discontinuation of mucomyst due to airway irritation.
2. Surgical care for ileocecectomy, including pain management and wound care.
3. Urinary retention/constipation likely caused by opioids. Foley catheterization and bowel regimen will be implemented.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the underlying pulmonary process, increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, and possible infection or bleeding at the surgical site."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Surgery wants bronch for pt to clear secretions
   - [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] team & IP agree that pt is getting better on his own; needs
   aggressive chest PT and ability to clear secretions is limited by pain.
   CXR today much improved from prior. Bronch is invasive and can worsen
   pts underlying pulmn process (asp PNA post-operative)
   - ct abx
   - adv diet to clears->fulls as tolerated
   - MRSA positive nasal swab, put on contact precautions
   - got paged from surgery at [**2124**] saying ""FYI [**Doctor Last Name 253**] wants [**Hospital **]
   transferred to SICU [**Hospital Ward Name 742**]. He may go to OR tomorrow for bronch. I
   know there is a lot of contention on this point. If your attending has
   issues, she can speak directly to [**Doctor Last Name 253**].""

","The patient is a 26-year-old male with asthma and Crohn's disease who underwent an ileocecectomy and was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia. The patient's oxygenation has improved and his pneumonia is significantly better, but he still requires supplemental oxygen. The plan is to continue the current antibiotic regimen, perform chest physical therapy, obtain a chest X-ray, administer mucolytics, provide bronchodilators, and gradually wean off oxygen as tolerated. The patient's pain from the surgical incision is well-controlled, and he is passing flatus. He will be encouraged to ambulate and use incentive spirometry. The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count and troponin T level, but other values are within normal range.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing postoperative respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, which is not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's low-grade temperatures may be related to persistent atelectasis. Mobilizing secretions with chest physiotherapy (PT) and coughing has been advised. The patient's chest X-ray shows improvement in infiltrates and is more consistent with atelectasis. The patient's underlying atelectasis and postoperative aspiration pneumonia are contributing to their respiratory status. The patient is completing their antibiotic course and there is no indication for bronchoscopy with conservative management showing improvement. The patient will continue to be monitored in the ICU due to persistent high FiO2 requirements.

Additionally, the patient has Crohn's disease (regional enteritis) and is experiencing postoperative pain. Pain management using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) has been initiated, but the patient may benefit from a pain consult for guidance on pain management. The patient's pain continues to limit their respiratory function.

The patient also has anemia, which is stable overnight. Urinary retention has been observed in the postoperative setting, and it may improve once the patient becomes more ambulatory. A Foley catheter has been placed for now.

In terms of ICU care, the patient requires nutrition support, glycemic control, and ongoing monitoring. Prophylaxis measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old male with a history of asthma and Crohn's disease who underwent an ileocecectomy. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia, which was determined to be post-operative aspiration pneumonia. The patient has shown significant improvement in oxygenation and decreased O2 requirement after diuresis and treatment for PNA. However, he still requires 6L of NC oxygen. The chest X-ray has improved from yesterday, and a bronchoscopy was not performed due to conservative management showing improvement in the patient's ability to clear secretions, limited by pain. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/65 to 147/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's current weight is 85 kg, and his height is 69 inches. His fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,063 mL, with 120 mL given orally, 943 mL administered intravenously, and 77 mL transfused. The total output includes 1,775 mL of urine, 440 mL of blood products, and 712 mL of negative balance. The patient's respiratory support consists of an O2 delivery device with 4L of oxygen via a nasal cannula, and his ABG results are within normal limits. Physical examination"

   Disposition: [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old male with a history of asthma and Crohn's disease who underwent an ileocecectomy. He was admitted to the hospital unit for hypoxia, specifically post-operative aspiration pneumonia. The patient's oxygenation has significantly improved, and he has decreased O2 requirements after diuresis and treatment for pneumonia. However, he is still on 4L NC and his chest X-ray has shown improvement from yesterday.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's ability to clear secretions is limited by pain. He is currently being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin. Chest physiotherapy, chest X-ray, and weaning off oxygen as tolerated are recommended. Encouraging ambulation and incentive spirometry are also part of the treatment plan.
2. Intrabdominal bleeding: The patient's pain is well-controlled, and he is passing flatus. Trend Hct daily, wound care, and post-operative care as recommended by surgery are advised. The patient should continue with dilauded PCA with dose adjustments per surgery recommendations.
3. Urinary retention/constipation: The patient likely experienced this due to opioids given post-operatively. Foley catheter should be discontinued today, a voiding trial should be conducted, and bowel regimen should be followed. 

Other assessments and plans include:
- The patient is on regular diet and ICU care.
- Lines: The patient has [**3-8**] gauge PIV lines.
- Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with venodynes and stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI are being given.
- Code status: The patient is full code.
- Disposition: The patient will remain in the ICU for now.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hypoxia if oxygenation is not properly managed, development of new infections due to prolonged hospital stay and use of invasive lines, and potential complications related to the ileocecectomy such as wound infection or intra-abdominal abscess formation."

","The patient's chief complaint is postoperative respiratory failure. The patient is currently on oral oxycodone and has a FiO2 down to 4 L NC. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin, cefipime, and levofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 C (100.5 F), blood pressure ranging from 130/65 to 147/100 mmHg, heart rate between 92-112 bpm, respiratory rate of 10-19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and their weight is currently 85 kg.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,063 mL of IV fluids and an output of 1,775 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 712 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of /29/. 

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, PERRL eyes/conjunctiva, normal lymph nodes, cardiovascular system with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and peripheral pulses present in all extremities. The patient also has bibasilar crackles in their chest, mild tenderness around the incision site, and no lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, leukocyte count of 180 K/uL, sodium level of 108 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes Crohn's disease, for which they had surgery, and postoperative respiratory failure due to atelectasis secondary to abdominal incisional pain and aspiration. The patient is completing a 7-day course of antibiotics and is now on oral medications. The patient's pain has improved, and their oxygen requirements are low. They are stable for transfer to the floor from a respiratory standpoint.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if they are unable to maintain adequate oxygenation or ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics, indicating a potential infection. If the infection is not properly managed, it could lead to sepsis and other complications.

3. Bleeding: The patient has had blood mixed with their bowel movement, and their hemoglobin level is slightly decreased. This could indicate bleeding, either from the surgical site or elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract.

4. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a negative fluid balance, which could indicate dehydration or inadequate fluid resuscitation.

5. Organ dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, which may indicate kidney dysfunction. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting fluid and medication administration accordingly is important.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and surgery. Prophylactic measures such as wearing compression stockings should be continued.

7. Stress ulcer: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis, which indicates a risk for stress ulcers. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding is important.

8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient"
