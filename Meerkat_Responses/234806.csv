","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and depression. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock secondary to community-acquired pneumonia.

24-hour events:
- EKG and ultrasound were performed.
- Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of hydronephrosis or deep vein thrombosis.
- The patient's hyponatremia persisted despite increasing lasix boluses.
- A CT scan of the head revealed a new facial droop, which was not previously noted.
- A KUB (kidneys, ureters, and bladder) study showed no bowel dilation and no clear air-fluid levels.
- Pain medications were changed to Vicodin with a restriction of 2g tylenol per day.
- Allergies include hydrochlorothiazide, hyponatremia/na, and Zoloft (Oral) (Sertraline Hcl).
- Infusions include furosemide (Lasix) at 4 mg/hour.
- Other ICU medications were administered.
- Changes to medical and family history are unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow Sheet Data:

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hyponatremia, nausea, and vomiting. She has a history of allergies to hydrochlorothiazide and Zoloft. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 168/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. She is receiving IV fluids and lasix infusion. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,313 mL, with an output of 1,180 mL through urine. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.54, PaCO2 of 29 mmHg, and HCO3- of 69 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin appearance, PERRL eyes, normocephalic head, and clear breath sounds bilaterally. The cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds without murmurs, and peripheral pulses are present in all extremities. The abdominal examination is soft and non-tender without bowel sounds. Extremities are edematous with no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to patient's unresponsiveness.

Lab results show hyponatremia (Na+ of 118 mg/dL), low potassium (K+ of 3.7 mEq/L), elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN of "

   Assessment and Plan
   72F with metastatic ovarian and pancreatic cancer with lung involvement
   with recent admission for CAP, who is brought in by family for concerns
   of confusion, lethargy, DOE, poor PO intake and found to have
   hyponatremia.
   Hyponatremia: Likely due to free water retention from pre-renal state.
   Difficult to assess volume status in this patient, but patient with CXR
   c/w edema, elevated BNP, b/l LE Edema and difficulty lying flat due to
   SOB suggesting hypervolemic state and warrants diuresis.  However, JVP
   not impressive, and skin dry with collapsed veins.  Made urine w/ lasix
   yesterday but with no improvement in serum sodium yesterday after 2
   doses of IV bolus lasix.  Started lasix gtt overnight with
   improvement.  ? component of SIADH in this patient with malignancy.
   -          continue lasix gtt with goal of increase in serum sodium of
   approximately 0.5 meq/hr.  Target Serum Sodium of about 130-135 meq,
   fluid restriction.
   -          Repeat urine lytes today.
   -          Q4-6 hour sodiums while correcting.
   .
   ARF: Picture consistent with pre-renal picture.  Improving with lasix
   suggesting severe edema/poor forward flow from CHF.
   1.        Continue to follow Creatinine.
   2.        Renal USD: No hydro.
   .
   .
   CAD: will start ASA and will continue Statin.  Patient with new q waves
   in V1-V3 and TWI in V1-3 when compared to old, suggesting that she may
   have had a silent infarct.  Will continue to cycle enzymes and obtain
   another ECHO in the am.
   - Enzymes flat, awaiting TTE.
   .
   HTN: Patient on valsartan, nifedipine, lopressor. Patient currently
   normotensive and will hold BB, [**Last Name (un) 239**] & CCB given pulmonary overload. BNP
   > 5000, EF 75% on recent ECHO.  Perhaps there are new wall motion
   abnormalities that aren't allowing optimal cardiac output, thus causing
   a pre-renal picture.  Will repeat ECHO. CXR in am.  Patient may have
   new diastolic dysfunction requiring lasix.  If patient does require
   lasix, she may benefit from a lasix gtt.
   - At this time would not restart at home BP regimen given ARF,
   impression of decompensated CHF.  Would add back afterload reducing
   [**Doctor Last Name **] first if possible (nifedipine or [**Last Name (un) 239**]).
   .
   RHYTHM: will maintain on telemetry, otherwise no issues
   Oncology: Hx of metastatic ovarian and pancreatic cancer metastatic to
   liver and lung.  This may be contributing to dyspnea.
   1.        Pain control as needed
   2.        Will talk to Social Work regarding goals of care
   3.        Pallative care consult regarding Hospice options -> patient
   and family may be indicating they want hospice, but unclear whether
   entire family is in agreement.
   .
   Leuckocytosis/CXR infiltrate: Unclear etiology at this time.  Patient
   without documented fevers and she was recently treated with abx for
   CAP.  Will trend temperature curve and will treat empirically for CAP
   if warranted.
   1.        Repeat CXR inam
   2.        CIS
   Constipation: [**Month (only) 60**] be due to narcotics that the patinet is taking for
   pain control.  Patient without nausea or vomiting, but if this ensues,
   would quickly entertain diagnosis of obstruction due to underlying
   disease.  Had nausea overnight -> KUB unrevealing.  Still no BM.
   1.        Aggressive bowel regimen, if becomes distended would drop NG
   tube, and consider surgery consult.
   Depression: Will hold Paxil at this time.
   FEN: Fluid restriction of 1200ml per day
   Access: PIVx1, art sticks for labs, would consider A-line.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with metastatic ovarian and pancreatic cancer, as well as lung involvement. She was admitted for pneumonia and is now experiencing confusion, lethargy, difficulty breathing, and poor oral intake. The patient has hyponatremia, which is likely due to free water retention from a pre-renal state. There are concerns about volume status, but the patient exhibits signs of hypervolemia, including edema, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), bilateral lower extremity edema, and shortness of breath when lying flat. The patient's JVP is not impressive, and her skin is dry with collapsed veins. She was previously treated with lasix, but there was no improvement in serum sodium levels. The patient is currently on a lasix drip to correct hyponatremia and fluid restriction. Renal ultrasound shows no hydro. 

The patient has new Q waves in V1-V3 and TWI in V1-3 on an ECG, indicating a possible silent myocardial infarction. She will start on aspirin and statins. The patient's hypertension medications will be held due to pulmonary overload. 

The patient's oncology history includes metastatic ovarian and pancreatic cancer with involvement of the liver and lung. This may be contributing to her dyspnea. Pain control, social work consultation, and palliative care consultation regarding hospice options are planned. 

Leukocytosis and chest X-ray infiltrate are unresolved, and the patient will be treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia if warranted. Constipation may be due to narcotics for pain control. A bowel regimen will be initiated, and if the patient becomes distended, an NG tube may be considered. Depression will be managed by holding Paxil. Fluid restriction is in place. The patient requires aggressive care in the ICU, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian and pancreatic cancer, presenting with confusion, lethargy, difficulty breathing, poor oral intake, and hyponatremia. She has a pre-renal azotemia picture, suggesting severe edema or poor forward flow from congestive heart failure (CHF). There are signs of fluid overload, including bilateral lower extremity edema, elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and difficulty lying flat due to shortness of breath (SOB). The patient's serum sodium is low, and she is on diuretics to correct this. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening hyponatremia: The patient's serum sodium levels are low, and if not managed properly, it can lead to severe complications such as seizures or even death.
2. Cardiovascular collapse: Given the signs of fluid overload and the patient's history of heart disease, there is a risk of cardiovascular collapse if not adequately managed.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's difficulty breathing and blunted costophrenic sulci on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema, which can worsen and lead to respiratory distress.
4. Renal failure: The patient's pre-renal azotemia and oliguria indicate compromised renal function, which can deteriorate further if not appropriately managed.
5. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis and"

","The patient has multiple medical conditions and complications. Based on the progress note, the patient is experiencing hyponatremia, volume overload, acute renal failure, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, metastatic pancreatic cancer, and lower extremity swelling. 

The hyponatremia is likely due to heart failure, as indicated by the presence of lower extremity edema, crackles on examination, and high B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. The patient is being diuresed with Lasix to manage the hyponatremia.

The acute renal failure is thought to be caused by decompensated heart failure. The patient's creatinine levels have improved with diuresis.

The patient also has acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, for which diuresis is being used as a treatment. An echocardiogram will be performed to assess for any new wall motion abnormalities.

Metastatic pancreatic cancer is present, but no therapeutic options are mentioned in the progress note.

Lower extremity swelling is noted, with the left lower extremity being warmer than the right. Bilateral lower extremity examinations are recommended.

Constipation is also mentioned, and reassurance is given after bowel regularity and serial abdominal exams.

Palliative care consult is planned for the patient.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is being encouraged to have oral food and fluids are restricted to 1.5 liters. Glycemic control is being managed"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.       Pericardial effusion: new finding on Echo this AM, 1.5-2cm
   with RV collapse consistent with tamponade. Pulsus is 10 mmHg. Stat
   cardiolgy consultatin called and plan for possibel cath lab for drainge
   in next few hours. This will be complicated by the fact that she may
   not be able to lie flat for RHC so options are sitting upright for
   pericadial drain without getting RHC versus intubation (which itself
   could have sig. deliterious effect on hemodynamics requiring urgent
   CVL, pressors, etc.)
   2.       Hyponatremia:  Likely due to heart failure
 had been on lasix
   gtts previously but d/c after tamponade seen on Echo this was held.
   Will need repeat level this afternoon.
   3. Acute Renal Failure:  [**Month (only) 60**] be due to decompensated heart failure.
   Cr had improved with diuresis
 now will need to monitor after
   intervention on pericardial effussion.
   4. Metastatic Pancreatic CA:  No therapeutic options
   5. LE swelling:  Needs bilat LENIs
 done awiating final read
   6. Constipation: bowel reg, serial exams, KUB reassuring
   7. Will get palliative care consult.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a chief complaint of hyponatremia, volume overload, and acute renal failure. She has a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar rales and no wheezes. Laboratory results show hyponatremia with a sodium level of 22 mEq/L, acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and elevated white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion with tamponade: The patient has a significant pericardial effusion of 1.5-2cm with right ventricular collapse, which is consistent with cardiac tamponade. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. The patient will likely require a pericardial drain, which may need to be done in the catheterization lab.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is likely due to heart failure. It is important to monitor her sodium levels closely, especially after the intervention on her pericardial effusion.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely secondary to decompensated heart failure. Close"
