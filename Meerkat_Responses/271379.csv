","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with diabetes who presented with a STEMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is currently in the ICU.

The patient has been started on several medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, and metoprolol. She has completed 18 hours of Integrillin and is currently on a heparin drip. Biomarkers are being trended, and serial ECGs and telemetry are being monitored.

An echocardiogram was performed, which showed moderate focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with a large LAD infarction. There is also diastolic dysfunction, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery hypertension with an estimated ejection fraction of 30-35%.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 75/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 6 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 34/13 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) of 6.5 L/min, and mixed venous oxygen"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old female with diabetes who presented with STEMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). She has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

Summary:
- The patient has persistent hypotension but is essentially asymptomatic with low urine output.
- Echocardiogram shows moderate focal left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction consistent with a large LAD infarction, diastolic dysfunction, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery hypertension with an ejection fraction of 30-35%.
- She is on several medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, metoprolol, and heparin drip.
- The patient has peripheral edema, which may be due to volume overload or venous insufficiency.
- She requires longer-term anticoagulation due to LV apical hypokinesis, which increases the risk of LV thrombus formation.
- Swan-Ganz catheter placement reveals a low volume state without evidence of elevated left-sided filling pressures.
- The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) after PA catheter placement while on heparin drip.
- There are no signs of active bleeding from any needle insertion site.
- She has a history of diabetes and chronic pain, for which she will continue her outpatient regimen.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   All events reviewed;
   Feeling much better today after volume and transfusion. Some pleuritic
   chest pain;
   Of note: creatinine increased to 1.9 (from 0.9); Hct now 29 after 2
   units;
   hemodynamics: PA sat 60-64%; PAD 16-20; CVP 7-10
   Physical Examination
   Resting comfortably;
   Soft intermittent pericardial rub - varies with inspiration; +S4; ? S3;
   No murmur;
   Groin without mass or tenderness and no evidence of bleeding source.
   Medical Decision Making
   Hemodynamically improved; Has developed contrast nephropathy so will
   need to be careful with volumes and follow closely.
   Anemia improved;
   Reelevation of total CK without increased MB or troponin so unlikely
   myocardial.
   Plan for today: Begin low dose lisinopril; Maintain  current volume;
   [**Month (only) 8**] need gentle diuresis if PCWP increases >20; continue heparin given
   apical akinesis and low EF; Will hope to start coumadin tomorrow if
   bleeding concerns less.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 23**] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Hemodynamic monitoriing, instability. Large acute MI;

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of diabetes who presented with a STEMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient has been diagnosed with moderate focal left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction consistent with a large LAD infarction, diastolic dysfunction, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery hypertension. Her ejection fraction (EF) is estimated to be 30-35%.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 75/36 mmHg, heart rate of 81 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving heparin, metoprolol, aspirin, clopidogrel, pantoprazole, and a statin.

The patient has been started on an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) at a low dose. Anticoagulation therapy with coumadin has been held temporarily due to the presence of apical hypokinesis and the risk of LV thrombus formation. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows low volume state without evidence of elevated left-sided filling pressures.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of troponin-T and CK-MB, consistent with myocardial injury. The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.9 mg"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute pleural effusion, hypotension, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The patient's vitals have been unstable, with tachycardia in the morning and low-mid 90s oxygen saturation on 5.5 liters of oxygen. The EKG was stable after administration of Oxycodone. The patient reported shortness of breath while talking on the phone and had low-mid 90s oxygen saturation on 4 liters of oxygen. CVP was 12 and PCWP was 19. Lasix was given, resulting in improvement of symptoms. The patient's creatinine level increased from 0.9 to 1.9 due to ACE inhibitor discontinuation. A chest X-ray showed increased density in the left upper lobe, potentially indicating atelectasis or pulmonary edema. There was concern for right pleural bleed, resulting in a decrease in hematocrit from 25.6 to 25.2. The patient received an additional unit of blood.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and low oxygen saturation, along with the chest X-ray findings, suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and may require interventions such as diuretics or fluid restriction.

2. Pleural Effusion: The patient's pleural"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of obesity and an unknown medical history. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable, with a heart rate ranging from 88-117 bpm and a blood pressure between 104/51-130/64 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is around 93%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is 55/22 mmHg, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is 19 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels. The patient's sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels are within normal range. The patient's liver enzymes and bilirubin levels are also within normal range. The troponin-T level is elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage.

The patient's physical examination reveals right-sided murmurs and no signs of jugular venous distention (JVD). She has bilateral lower extremity edema and no chest wall deformities. The patient's skin examination shows no stasis dermatitis or ulcers.

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes, presenting with a STEMI and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement.

The assessment includes ongoing management of coronary artery disease, with continued use of aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, metoprolol, and heparin drip. An echocardiogram has shown moderate focal left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction consistent with a large LAD infarction, diastolic dysfunction, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery hypertension. The ejection fraction (EF) is estimated to be 30-35%.

Given the presence of LV apical hypokinesis, there is a risk for LV thrombus, so anticoagulation will be required for the long term. Coumadin has been held while a Swan-Ganz catheter is in place, with continued heparin infusion. The patient's hemodynamics are consistent with a low volume state, without evidence of elevated left-sided filling pressures.

Fluid balance and renal function should be closely monitored, with IV fluids and packed red blood cells (PRBCs) being given for tailored therapy. A low dose ACE inhibitor has also been started.

The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm, but some atrial ectopy is present. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes who presented with a STEMI and underwent PCI to the LAD. She has been experiencing tachycardia, shortness of breath, and an increasing opacity in the left lower lung field on chest X-ray. A CT scan revealed a hemothorax, and thoracic surgery was consulted. The patient's hematocrit levels have been dropping, which is likely due to an ooze from subclavian vein access rather than pulmonary artery rupture. The patient is currently on the following medications: ASA, clopidogrel, statin, metoprolol, and heparin (on hold due to bleeding). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemothorax: The presence of hemothorax indicates bleeding in the space between the lung and the chest wall. This can cause respiratory distress and may require intervention such as chest tube placement.
2. Decreasing Hematocrit: The patient's hematocrit levels have been dropping, indicating potential blood loss. This could be due to ongoing bleeding from the subclavian vein access site or other sources. Close monitoring and transfusion of blood products may be necessary.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The increasing opacity in the left lower lung field on chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pulmonary edema. This can occur due to fluid overload or cardiac dysfunction. Further evaluation and management, including diuretics and fluid"

   clinically unchanged. EKG stable. Improved after Oxycodone.
   - Started standing Tylenol
   - In pm, was paged that pt was more SOB while talking on phone. Was
   satting low-mid 90s on 4L. CVP 12, PCWP 19. Lytes sent were wnl. By
   arrival to eval, pt reported that SOB had resolved. Gave Lasix 40mg IV

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Increased hypoxia and fillling pressures.
   Increasing atelectasis and L pleural effusion consistent with
   hemothorax.
   CT consistent with hemothorax. No subclavian mass.
   Physical Examination
   Comfortable, pale.
   HR 90-100; SBP 110-120
   Decreased BS L side.
   Medical Decision Making
   Acute hemothorax related to L subclavian puncture and anticoagulants.
   Cardiac status relatively stable although increasing filling pressures
   in response to transfusion and volume. Responding to diuresis.
   Acute renal insufficiency secondary to  contrast, hypotension.
   PLan for today: Chest tube drainage, monitor Hct to 27-28 range with
   RBC transfusion as needed, hold anticoagulants with continued aspirin
   and Plavix. Hold beta blocker and ACE inhibitor for now.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 72-year-old female with diabetes who presented with STEMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.
- She has experienced several medical complications, including dropping hematocrit (Hct), tachycardia, shortness of breath (SOB), increasing opacity in the left lower lobe (LLL) on chest X-ray, and evidence of hemothorax on computed tomography (CT).
- These complications are likely due to an ooze from subclavian vein access, not a pulmonary artery (PA) rupture.
- The patient has also shown signs of focal left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction, with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 30-35%.
- There is moderate mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, and she requires anticoagulation for longer-term management, especially with LV apical hypokinesis at risk for LV thrombus.
- Her renal function has worsened, with increased creatinine levels.
- The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are relatively stable.
- The plan for today includes chest tube drainage, monitoring Hct to the 27-28 range with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion as needed, holding antico"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female with diabetes presenting with STEMI, s/p PCI to LAD.
   Course complicated after Swan placement with hemothorax requiring chest
   tube placement.
   # Dropping Hct: Pt tachycardic, SOB, CXR with increasing LLL opacity,
   CT with evidence hemothorax.  This is likely due to ooze from
   subclavian vein access, not PA rupture. THoracic surgery consulted and
   placed chest tube to scution.
   -Tx prn, goal Hct >27-28
   -f/u serial CXRs
   -Continue to monitor
   -PM hct
   # CORONARIES: STEMI culprit lesion in LAD, S/P BMS.  Cardiac enzymes
   trending down.
   - Continue ASA, clopidogrel, Statin, metoprolol, hold [**Last Name (un) **] for inc
   creatinine
   - Holding heparin in setting of bleed, restart anticoagulation when
   bleeding stabilized.
   - PT once acute issues resolved
   - Serial ECGs, telemetry
   # PUMP - Last known LVEF normal.  However, does have peripheral edema
   which may be due to volume overload versus venous insufficiency.
   Echocardiogram showed moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent
   with large LAD infarction. Diastolic dysfunction. At least mild to
   moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery hypertension. EF
   30-35%.
   - Will need anticoagulation for longer term in setting of LV apical
   hypokinesis, at risk for LV thrombus. Hold starting coumadin while swan
   in place.  Continue heparin gtt.
   - s/p PA catheter placement, hemodynamics c/w low volume state, no
   evidence of elevated left sided filling pressures.
   -IVF/PRBCs for tailored therapy.
   - d/c PA catheter once CT placed, pt stabilized. Will aim for tomorrow
   ([**3-16**])
   -Holding [**Last Name (un) **] as above for inc creatinine
   # Increased Cr increased to 2.3
   -hold [**Last Name (un) **] for now, continue to monitor, continue with blood/IVF
    #. Rhythm: NS for now with some atrial ectopy
    # Diabetes - Continue glargine, sliding scale, diabetic diet
    # Chronic pain and acute pain - continue outpatient regimen, added
   fentayl IV boluses for pain from chest tube site
    FEN:  Heart-healthy, low-sodium diabetic diet
   ACCESS: PIV's , L SC PA catheter (inserted [**3-13**])

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with diabetes who presented with a STEMI and underwent PCI to the LAD. The patient's course was complicated by a hemothorax requiring chest tube placement after Swan placement. The hemothorax is believed to be due to an ooze from subclavian vein access, rather than a PA rupture. Thoracic surgery was consulted and placed a chest tube to suction.

The patient's current assessment includes several medical complications that can arise:

1. Dropping Hct: The patient's hematocrit levels are decreasing, indicating potential ongoing bleeding or fluid shifts.

2. Tachycardia and SOB: The patient is experiencing rapid heart rate and shortness of breath, which may indicate cardiovascular instability or respiratory distress.

3. CXR with increasing LLL opacity: The chest X-ray shows increasing opacity in the left lower lung field, indicating a possible worsening of the hemothorax or development of a new lung condition.

4. Hemothorax: The presence of hemothorax suggests ongoing bleeding into the pleural space, which requires monitoring and management.

5. Cardiac enzymes trending down: This indicates improvement in myocardial damage following the STEMI.

6. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of STEMI and underwent PCI to the LAD. Long-term management of coronary artery disease will be necessary.

7. LV systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction:"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female with diabetes presenting with STEMI, s/p PCI to LAD.
   Course complicated after Swan placement with hemothorax requiring chest
   tube placement.
   # Dropping Hct: Pt tachycardic, SOB, CXR with increasing LLL opacity,
   CT with evidence of hemothorax.  This is likely due to ooze from
   subclavian vein access, not PA rupture. Thoracic surgery consulted and
   placed chest tube [**3-15**] with >1.5L drained.  Transfused additional unit
   yesterday with appropriate bump in Hct.
   - Thoracics following, appreciate their recs
   -Tx prn, goal Hct >27-28
   -f/u serial CXRs
   -Continue to monitor
   -serial Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   # CORONARIES: Presented with STEMI, found to have culprit lesion in LAD
   on cath, S/P BMS.  Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   - Continue ASA, clopidogrel, Statin, BB on hold for hypotension and
   hold [**Last Name (un) **] for inc creatinine
   - restart BB today, metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] and uptitrate as needed
   - Holding heparin in setting of bleed, restart anticoagulation when
   bleeding stabilized.
   - PT once acute issues resolved
   - Serial ECGs, telemetry
   # PUMP - Last known LVEF normal.  However, does have peripheral edema
   which may be due to volume overload versus venous insufficiency.
   Echocardiogram showed moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent
   with large LAD infarction. Diastolic dysfunction. At least mild to
   moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery hypertension. EF
   30-35%.
   - Will need anticoagulation for longer term in setting of LV apical
   hypokinesis, at risk for LV thrombus. Hold starting coumadin while swan
   in place.  restart heparin gtt once bleeding stabilized.
   - s/p PA catheter placement, hemodynamics c/w low volume state, no
   evidence of elevated left sided filling pressures.
   -IVF/PRBCs for tailored therapy.
   - d/c PA catheter once CT placed, pt stabilized, likely today
   -Holding [**Last Name (un) **] as above for inc Creatinine
   - Plan to restart anticoagulation for apical thrombus PPx once
   hemothorax stabilized
   # ARF: Cr increased since admission from 0.9 to 2.3.  Etiology could be
   [**3-8**] hypotension vs. constrast induced.  Cr now 2.2.  UOP good.
   -hold [**Last Name (un) **] for now, continue to monitor, continue with blood/IVF
    #. Rhythm: NS for now with some atrial ectopy.  Starting BB today
    # Diabetes - Continue glargine, sliding scale, diabetic diet

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes who presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's course was complicated by a hemothorax requiring chest tube placement. She also developed acute kidney injury (AKI), likely due to hypotension or contrast-induced nephropathy. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improving myocardial injury. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged hemothorax and pleural effusion: The patient's hemothorax has been managed with chest tube placement. However, there is a risk of recurrent pleural effusion or persistent hemothorax, which may require further intervention.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 0.9 to 2.3. The etiology of AKI could be hypotension or contrast-induced nephropathy. Close monitoring of renal function and aggressive fluid management are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

3. Arrhythmias: The patient has experienced some atrial ectopy and requires continuous cardiac monitoring to detect any arrhythmias promptly.

4. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has mild pulmonary artery hypertension, which may progress if left untreated. Monitoring and treatment options, such as medications like tadalafil, should be considered"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 72-year-old female with diabetes who presented with a STEMI and underwent PCI to the LAD.
- She developed a hemothorax after Swan placement, which required chest tube placement.
- The patient has been transfused with blood products and has a dropping hematocrit (Hct).
- She has a history of acute myocardial infarction, hypotension, and acute pulmonary edema.
- The patient's echocardiogram showed moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery hypertension with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30-35%.
- She has renal failure with an increased creatinine level from 0.9 to 2.3.
- The patient is currently on various medications, including anticoagulants, beta-blockers, statins, and antiplatelet agents.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, including hemothorax and the need for chest tube placement. Continued monitoring for signs of bleeding is essential, especially considering the holding of heparin due to the recent bleed.
2. Thrombosis: Given the patient's history of acute myocardial infarction and evidence of LV systolic dysfunction,"

   Course complicated after Swan placement with hemothorax requiring chest
   tube placement.
   # Dropping Hct: Pt tachycardic, SOB, CXR with increasing LLL opacity,
   CT with evidence hemothorax.  This is likely due to ooze from
   subclavian vein access, not PA rupture. THoracic surgery consulted and
   placed chest tube to scution.
   -Tx prn, goal Hct >27-28
   -f/u serial CXRs
   -Continue to monitor
   -PM hct
   # CORONARIES: STEMI culprit lesion in LAD, S/P BMS.  Cardiac enzymes
   trending down.
   - Continue ASA, clopidogrel, Statin, metoprolol, hold [**Last Name (un) **] for inc
   creatinine
   - Holding heparin in setting of bleed, restart anticoagulation when
   bleeding stabilized.
   - PT once acute issues resolved
   - Serial ECGs, telemetry
   # PUMP - Last known LVEF normal.  However, does have peripheral edema
   which may be due to volume overload versus venous insufficiency.
   Echocardiogram showed moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent
   with large LAD infarction. Diastolic dysfunction. At least mild to
   moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery hypertension. EF
   30-35%.
   - Will need anticoagulation for longer term in setting of LV apical
   hypokinesis, at risk for LV thrombus. Hold starting coumadin while swan
   in place.  Continue heparin gtt.
   - s/p PA catheter placement, hemodynamics c/w low volume state, no
   evidence of elevated left sided filling pressures.
   -IVF/PRBCs for tailored therapy.
   - d/c PA catheter once CT placed, pt stabilized. Will aim for tomorrow
   ([**3-16**])
   -Holding [**Last Name (un) **] as above for inc Creatinine
   - Plan to restart anticoagulation for apical thrombus PPx once
   hemothorax stabilized

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 72-year-old female with diabetes who presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD).
- After Swan-Ganz catheter placement, the patient developed hemothorax, which required chest tube placement. This is likely due to oozing from subclavian vein access, not pulmonary artery rupture.
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been dropping, leading to tachycardia, shortness of breath, and increasing left lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray. Thoracic surgery was consulted, and a chest tube was placed to suction.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement from the heart attack.
- The patient has moderate focal left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction, as well as mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. The ejection fraction (EF) is estimated to be 30-35%.
- The patient requires long-term anticoagulation due to LV apical hypokinesis, which increases the risk of LV thrombus formation. Heparin has been restarted, and coumadin will be started once the Swan-Ganz catheter is removed.
- The patient's serum creatinine (Cr) level has increased to 2.3, potentially due to contrast-induced nephropathy or pre-renal state. [Last Name (un)] has been held for now, and the patient will continue to be monitored.
- The patient's rhythm is currently nonspecific, with some atrial ectopy.
- The patient's diabetes management includes glargine, sliding scale insulin, and a diabetic diet.
- The patient's chronic pain and acute pain will be managed with outpatient regimen, along with fentanyl IV boluses for pain at the chest tube site.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Prolonged hemothorax or chest tube-related complications.
2. Development of LV thrombus due to apical hypokinesis.
3. Contrast-induced nephropathy.
4. Pre-renal azotemia.
5. Diabetic complications such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
6. Ventricular arrhythmias or cardiac conduction abnormalities.
7. Pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
9. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and promptly address any potential complications that may arise."

   72 yo female with diabetes presenting with STEMI, s/p PCI to LAD.
   Course complicated after Swan placement with hemothorax requiring chest
   tube placement.
   # Dropping Hct: Pt tachycardic, SOB, CXR with increasing LLL opacity,
   CT with evidence of hemothorax.  This is likely due to ooze from
   subclavian vein access, not PA rupture. Thoracic surgery consulted and
   placed chest tube [**3-15**] with >1.5L drained.  Transfused additional unit
   yesterday with appropriate bump in Hct.
   - Thoracics following, appreciate their recs
   -Tx prn, goal Hct >27-28
   -f/u serial CXRs
   -Continue to monitor
   -serial Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Now stabilized
   # CORONARIES: Presented with STEMI, found to have culprit lesion in LAD
   on cath, S/P BMS.  Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   - Continue ASA, clopidogrel, Statin, BB on hold for hypotension and
   hold [**Last Name (un) **] for inc creatinine
   - restart BB today, metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] and uptitrate as needed
   - Holding heparin in setting of bleed, restart anticoagulation when
   bleeding stabilized.
   - PT once acute issues resolved
   - Serial ECGs, telemetry
   # PUMP - Last known LVEF normal.  However, does have peripheral edema
   which may be due to volume overload versus venous insufficiency.
   Echocardiogram showed moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent
   with large LAD infarction. Diastolic dysfunction. At least mild to
   moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery hypertension. EF
   30-35%.
   - Will need anticoagulation for longer term in setting of LV apical
   hypokinesis, at risk for LV thrombus. Hold starting coumadin while swan
   in place.  restart heparin gtt once bleeding stabilized.
   - s/p PA catheter placement, hemodynamics c/w low volume state, no
   evidence of elevated left sided filling pressures.
   -IVF/PRBCs for tailored therapy.
   - d/c PA catheter once CT placed, pt stabilized, likely today
   -Holding [**Last Name (un) **] as above for inc Creatinine
   - Plan to restart anticoagulation for apical thrombus PPx once
   hemothorax stabilized
   # ARF: Cr increased since admission from 0.9 to 2.3.  Etiology could be
   [**3-8**] hypotension vs. constrast induced.  Cr now 2.2.  UOP good.
   -hold [**Last Name (un) **] for now, continue to monitor, continue with blood/IVF

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old female with diabetes presenting with STEMI, who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. She experienced complications after the placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter, leading to hemothorax requiring chest tube placement. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been dropping, likely due to ongoing bleeding from the subclavian vein access. Thoracic surgery was consulted and placed a chest tube, which drained over 1.5 liters of fluid. The patient received a blood transfusion to increase her Hct level.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Thoracic surgery consultation for ongoing hemothorax management.
2. Close monitoring of Hct levels, aiming for a target of >27-28.
3. Serial chest X-rays to evaluate the progress of the hemothorax resolution.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's condition.
5. Serial Hct measurements will be taken at Hospital1.

Other medical issues include:

1. Coronary artery disease: The patient presented with STEMI and had a culprit lesion in the LAD artery. She underwent bare-metal stent (BMS) placement and cardiac enzymes are trending down. She will continue to receive aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel, statin, and beta-blocker (BB) therapy. Metoprolol 12.5 mg will be restarted and titrated as needed. H"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Feels much better. Mild left sided chest pain related to chest tube.
   creatinine decreased to 1.6
   Physical Examination
   Comfortable;
   No respiratory distress;
   Lungs: clear anterior;
   Heart: RRR; Normal S1 and 2; No murmur or S3.
   Medical Decision Making
   Good recovery after large anterior MI complicated by hypotension due to
   low volumes and then hemothorax as complication of left subclavian
   line.
   Hemodynamics stable; renal function improving; less chest tube
   drainage.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 23**] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

- The hemothorax is likely due to ooze from subclavian vein access, not PA rupture.
- The patient received 4 units of transfused blood and the hematocrit has stabilized.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement.
- The patient has ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30-35% and mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
- Anticoagulation will be continued until September 10th for LV apical hypokinesis and risk for LV thrombus. Heparin will be restarted when bleeding is stabilized.
- The patient's renal function has improved, with a decreasing creatinine level.
- The patient's chest tube drainage has decreased.
- The patient is comfortable and free of respiratory distress.
- The patient's lungs are clear anteriorly, and the heart examination shows no murmurs or S3.
- The patient's medical decision-making involves monitoring renal function, continuing anticoagulation, and evaluating the need for ACE-I or another medication.

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   As recorded; I/Os negative with probable diuretic phase ATN;

   No change
   Medical Decision Making
   Hemodyamics stable;
   Still requiring chest tube due to + drainage and ? apical pneumothorax
   Renal failure improving;
   Will consult with ophthalmology re risk of coumadin.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes and ischemic cardiomyopathy. She presented with a STEMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Post-procedure, she developed hemothorax requiring chest tube placement.

The patient's current condition includes ongoing drainage from the chest tube, which has been decreasing. She has a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30-35% and mild pulmonary artery hypertension. The patient also has chronic kidney disease with an elevated creatinine level.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has a chest tube in place, which increases the risk of developing a hospital-acquired pneumonia or empyema. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and local signs of infection at the chest tube insertion site, is crucial.

2. Bleeding: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters, such as PT/INR, and careful management of the chest tube output are important to prevent excessive bleeding.

3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is crucial to manage due to her cardiac condition and ongoing drainage from the chest tube. Monitoring intake and output closely will help prevent fluid overload or dehydration.

4. Renal function deterioration: The patient"

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes who presented with a STEMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). She then developed hemothorax requiring chest tube placement. The chest tube was placed to wall suction after draining more than 1.5 liters, and her hematocrit stabilized after transfusing 4 units. The output has been decreasing, likely due to oozing from subclavian vein access, not pulmonary artery rupture.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 107/48 mmHg to 137/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and sinus rhythm. Her weight is currently 108.3 kg.

The patient has ongoing discomfort at the site of the chest tube, denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. She has 3+ pitting edema bilaterally.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.9-8.2 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin ranging from 29-30.3 g/dL, hematocrit ranging from 25.3-33%, platelet count of 133-165 thousand/mm³, creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from "

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with diabetes who presented with a STEMI and underwent PCI to the LAD. She developed hemothorax requiring chest tube placement after Swan placement. The hemothorax was likely due to oozing from subclavian vein access, not PA rupture. The patient received 4 units of transfused blood and her hematocrit stabilized. She also has ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF 30-35% and mild pulmonary artery hypertension. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to the presence of a chest tube and potential breach in skin integrity.
2. Bleeding: The patient has already experienced significant bleeding leading to hemothorax. There is a risk of further bleeding, especially with the continued use of anticoagulation therapy.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient may have impaired lung function due to the hemothorax and chest tube placement, which can lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient has acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine level. This could be due to hypotension or contrast-induced nephropathy. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
5. Cardiac events: Although the patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, there is still a risk of recurrent cardiac events such as arrhythmias"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female with diabetes presenting with STEMI, s/p PCI to LAD.
   Course complicated after Swan placement with hemothorax requiring chest
   tube placement.
   # Hemothorax: Appreciate thoracics involvement.  Chest tube placed to
   wall suction after having drained >1.5 litres, and hematocrit has
   stabilized after 4 units transfused.  This is likely due to ooze from
   subclavian vein access, not PA rupture. -
   -Tx prn, goal Hct >27-28
   -f/u serial CXRs
   -Continue to monitor
   -serial Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Now stabilized
   # CORONARIES: Presented with STEMI, found to have culprit lesion in LAD
   on cath, S/P BMS.  Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   - Continue ASA, clopidogrel, Statin, BB restarted at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **],
   uptitrate as tolerated
   - restart ACE-I on [**2156-3-18**] if renal function improving
   - Holding heparin in setting of bleed, restart anticoagulation when
   bleeding stabilized.
   - PT once acute issues resolved
   - Serial ECGs, telemetry
   # PUMP
 Ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF 30-35%.  Mild pulmonary
   artery hypertension.
   - Will need anticoagulation until [**2156-9-10**] (6 months) for LV apical
   hypokinesis and risk for LV thrombus. Hold starting coumadin until
   chest tube pulled.
   - PA catheter readings suggest low-volume state, so this was
   discontinued yesterday
   - IVF/PRBCs PRN
   - Holding [**Last Name (un) **] until [**2156-3-17**], consider ACE-I instead if no absolute
   contraindication
   # ARF: Cr increased since admission from 0.9 to 2.3, now trending
   down.  Etiology could be [**3-8**] hypotension vs. constrast induced.  UOP
   good.
   - continue to monitor, restart ACE-I vs. [**Last Name (un) **] when able
   # Rhythm: NS for now with some atrial ectopy.  Starting BB today
   # Diabetes - Continue glargine, sliding scale, diabetic diet
   # Chronic pain and acute pain - continue outpatient regimen, added
   fentayl IV boluses for pain from chest tube site
    FEN:  Heart-healthy, low-sodium diabetic diet

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 72-year-old female with diabetes who presented with a STEMI and underwent PCI to the LAD.
- She developed hemothorax after Swan placement and required chest tube placement due to an ooze from subclavian vein access.
- The patient's hematocrit has stabilized after transfusing 4 units, and she continues to be monitored.
- She has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an LVEF of 30-35% and mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
- The patient is at risk for LV thrombus due to LV apical hypokinesis and will need anticoagulation until 09/10/2156.
- Her renal function is compromised, with an increase in creatinine from 0.9 to 2.3, which is now trending down.
- She has been started on a low-sodium, heart-healthy diabetic diet, and her pain management regimen has been adjusted.
- The patient's vital signs and lab results are provided in the attached image.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged bleeding due to heparin administration and chest tube drainage.
2. Development of acute kidney injury or further deterioration of renal function.
3. Potential thrombus formation in the left ventricle due to reduced ejection fraction and apical hypokinesis.
4. Ventricular arrhythmias due to ischemic cardiomyopathy and ongoing myocardial damage.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes who presented with a STEMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's course was complicated by the placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter, resulting in hemothorax that required chest tube placement. The hemothorax was likely due to bleeding from subclavian vein access. The patient received 4 units of transfused blood and the hematocrit has stabilized. 

The patient's current condition includes ongoing management of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30-35%, and mild pulmonary artery hypertension. The patient is at risk for left ventricular thrombus formation due to apical hypokinesis and requires anticoagulation for 6 months. However, anticoagulation should be held until the chest tube is pulled. 

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) with an increase in creatinine from 0.9 to 2.3, which is now trending down. The etiology could be hypotension or contrast-induced nephropathy. The patient's urine output is good, and ACE inhibitors may be considered once renal function improves. 

Other conditions being managed include diabetes, chronic and acute pain, rhythm disturbances, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes, who presented with a STEMI and underwent PCI to the LAD. Post-procedure, she developed hemothorax requiring chest tube placement. The hemothorax is likely due to oozing from subclavian vein access, not PA rupture. The patient has received 4 units of transfused blood and the hematocrit has stabilized. 

The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement after the STEMI. She has been started on ASA, clopidogrel, statin, and her blood pressure medication was restarted at 12.5mg. Heparin was resumed after the removal of the central line. The patient is likely to require rehabilitation on discharge.

The patient has ischemic cardiomyopathy with an LVEF of 30-35% and mild pulmonary artery hypertension. Anticoagulation will be needed until September 10th (6 months) for LV apical hypokinesis and risk for LV thrombus. Coumadin will be held until the chest tube is pulled.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated since admission, with an increase in creatinine from 0.9 to 2.3, now trending down to 1.2 (baseline 0.9). The etiology could be hypotension or contrast-induced nephropathy. The patient's urine output is good.
