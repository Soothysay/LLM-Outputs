   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, admitted for the ORIF of a fracture. She has been experiencing hyponatremia, pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and now suspected acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient initially declined intubation but later consented after discussing with her husband and doctor. Repeat ABG improved, and the patient feels more comfortable after receiving Lasix.

The plan is to continue high-flow mask therapy and have a low threshold for intubation if there is no improvement. Current medications include vancomycin, levofloxacin, aztreonam, and tamiflu as per Infectious Disease (ID) recommendations. Nebulizations of albuterol and atrovent are given every 2 hours as needed. An induced sputum culture has been ordered, and consideration is being given to a computed tomography angiography (CTA) or bronchoscopy if there is no improvement.

In terms of cardiac evaluation, there is no evidence of ischemia at present. The patient's rhythm is sinus, and the pump function is clinically euvolemic with a normal ejection fraction. Diuretic therapy will be administered gently with a goal of negative 500cc due to hypoxia. The patient's brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels have decreased from 1037 on 2/4 to 409 on 2/7.

Anemia has developed with a hemoglobin concentration of 29 on arrival now at 24. There is no evidence of bleeding, although the patient underwent an orthopedic procedure. A guaiac stool test has been ordered, along with rechecking the INR to rule out disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Fibrinogen and D-dimer levels will also be monitored, as well as a peripheral blood smear. A heme-oncology consult has been requested, and the patient's peripheral smear will be sent.

Hyponatremia has not improved with fluid restriction and fluid boluses. However, gentle diuresis will be initiated given the presence of ARDS. Electrolyte levels will be monitored, and urine/serum osmolarity will be checked. A head CT scan has been ordered, along with checking TSH and serum cortisol levels.

Regarding the ankle fracture, the plan is for revision once the patient is medically stable. Pain control will be provided as needed, and follow-up with orthopedic recommendations will be made.

The patient has a history of cerebral aneurysm with a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, which is currently stable.

The patient's history of fibrinolysis has been noted, and recommendations from hematology will be followed.

The patient's advance directives include a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status with the option of intubation for 7"

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 116/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her ABG results show a pH level of 7.49, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, PaO2 of 123, and an FiO2 of 0.28.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the lungs but no other significant abnormalities. Her laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.5 K/uL, slightly elevated platelet count of 585 K/uL, and normal levels of creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus.

The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has been treated for pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The concern for ARDS is evident from the CXR findings. Intubation has been considered due to the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) status post clipping with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, admitted with ankle fracture status post open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), course complicated by hyponatremia and pneumonia (pna). She is currently experiencing progressive hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on imaging consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as a progressive infectious process.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate a compromised respiratory function. This can lead to tissue damage and organ failure if not managed promptly.
2. ARDS: The presence of bilateral infiltrates and progressive hypoxemia suggests the development of ARDS. This condition can worsen over time and may require advanced respiratory support, such as mechanical ventilation.
3. Infection: The patient has a progressive infectious process, which could be bacterial, viral, or atypical in nature. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but there is a concern for possible aspiration during surgery leading to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). Other potential infections to consider include pneumonia caused by atypical pathogens or viral etiology.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a negative fluid balance, likely due to capillary leak syndrome secondary to ARDS. This can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not carefully managed.

She was admitted with hyponatremia and pneumonia (pna), and now presents with progressive hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on imaging consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as a progressive infectious process. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is requiring high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) for oxygenation. 

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, levofoxacin, aztreonam, and oseltamivir for suspected viral pneumonia, although the exact causative organism is still pending. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, elevated D-dimer, elevated fibrinogen, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which may suggest an ongoing inflammatory response or infection.

The patient's imaging shows diffuse bilateral infiltrates, which are slightly worse compared to yesterday. The microbiology results are negative for flu, and the rapid viral test is negative as well. The sputum culture is pending, and there are concerns about possible anaerobic infection due to recent surgery (ORIF).

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing diuresis with the aim"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who was admitted for ORIF of a fracture. She has been experiencing hyponatremia, pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and possible ARDS. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, leading to respiratory distress and the need for intubation. She initially declined intubation but later consented after discussing it with her husband and doctor. The patient's ABG improved after receiving Lasix and being placed on a non-rebreather mask.

The patient's cardiac status is stable with no evidence of ischemia. However, her anemia has worsened from a HCT of 29 on arrival to 24 currently. There is no evidence of bleeding, although she underwent an orthopedic procedure. The patient's hyponatremia is not improving with fluid restriction and fluid boluses, so gentle diuresis will be continued.

The patient has chronic DIC, as indicated by her elevated D-dimer levels and other laboratory findings. She also has an ankle fracture that will require revision once she is medically stable. The patient has a history of cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt, which is currently stable.

The patient's code status is DNR, but she is willing to be intubated for 7 days, after which she would like to continue extubation and make a do-not-resuscitate decision if she is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) status post clipping with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, ankle fracture status post open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and now presenting with progressive hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on imaging consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has hyponatremia and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's bilateral infiltrates on imaging and progressive hypoxemia are consistent with ARDS. This condition can lead to respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including fever and productive cough, along with the presence of white blood cells (WBC) in the sputum, suggest a possible bacterial infection. Antibiotics have been initiated, but the patient's clinical improvement should be closely monitored.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels can potentially lead to neurological complications if not managed properly.
4. Hyperfibrinolysis syndrome: This condition increases the risk of bleeding and should be closely monitored, especially considering the patient's recent surgery.
5. Cerebral aneurysm: Although the head CT is currently unchanged, the patient's history of cerebral aneurysm and VP shunt increases the risk of neurological complications.
6. Deep vein thrombosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) post-clipping with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, ankle fracture post-operative repair, and now presenting with progressive hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on imaging consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has hyponatremia and pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia - ARDS from pneumonia is the most likely cause, possibly viral pneumonia, or aspiration during surgery. There is a low suspicion for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) although LDH is increased. Versus Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). There is also a possibility of alveolar hemorrhage, neurogenic component, or congestive heart failure (CHF), but CHF seems less likely given the B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 400.

2. Pulmonary effusions - seen on CT and chest X-ray, considering thoracentesis if there are spikes in temperature on antibiotics, but suspect from inflammatory process.

3. Hyponatremia - likely syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion due to ongoing lung process, check thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), cortisol, and CT head given the patient's prior history of bleed, possibly post-anesthesia with development of hypon"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a fracture. She has been experiencing hyponatremia, pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, and possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient initially declined intubation but later consented after speaking with her husband and doctor. Her ABG showed a large A-a gradient, and her chest X-ray is concerning for ARDS. She has also been treated for pneumonia (PNA) and pulmonary edema. She is currently on high flow mask oxygen and Lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's worsening respiratory status, ABG results, and chest X-ray findings are concerning for ARDS. This condition can lead to severe lung dysfunction and may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for PNA, indicating a possible infection in the lungs. If not adequately managed, it can worsen her respiratory condition.
3. Cardiac issues: Although the patient's cardiac workup appears normal at present, it is important to monitor her cardiac status due to her symptoms of shortness of breath. Any cardiac complications could further exacerbate her respiratory distress.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been trending down, which may indicate anemia. This could contribute to her overall weakness and oxygenation difficulties.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of cerebral aneurysm, VP shunt, and fibrinolysis syndrome. She was admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a fracture but developed hyponatremia, pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, and possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient initially declined intubation but then consented after speaking with her husband and doctor. However, her ABG improved on non-rebreather and she became more comfortable after receiving Lasix. The ongoing question is the etiology of bilateral infiltrates. The patient is slightly worse today but maintaining saturation on 50% high flow mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening respiratory distress and bilateral infiltrates on imaging are concerning for ARDS. ARDS is a serious condition that can lead to severe respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been cultured twice, suggesting a possible infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has low serum sodium levels, which can cause symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or even coma if severe. Hyponatremia can have various causes, including fluid overload, medications, or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may be contributing to her respiratory distress. If left untreated, pulmonary edema can progress to severe respiratory failure.
5. Fibrinolysis Syndrome: The patient has a history of fibrinolysis syndrome, which is characterized by excessive breakdown of blood clots. This can lead to bleeding complications, especially during surgical procedures.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fever. He has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is currently being treated with Flagyl. The patient's condition has worsened, with temperatures throughout the day and a CT scan showing significant worsening in alveolar process, suggestive of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient developed worsened shortness of breath and oxygen saturation levels in the high 80s, prompting a switch to [Year (4 digits) 1358] and subsequent improvement in oxygen saturation to the low 90s. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pO2 of 60s after 10 minutes on [Name (NI) 1358]. The patient is now comfortable, but reports sore throat and chest pain from coughing. He denies shortness of breath upon awakening. The patient has allergies to penicillins, sulfa, iodine, and red dye. His last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin at [2114-2-12] 08:16 PM and aztreonam at [2114-2-12] 11:52 PM. The patient is currently on levofloxacin, Flagyl, and other ICU medications. There are no significant changes to the patient's medical and family history. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. Flow sheet data shows"

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, admitted for open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of a fracture. The patient's course was complicated by hyponatremia, pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, and possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient initially declined intubation but later consented for less than 14 days. The patient initially improved with diuresis and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) but then experienced a significant worsening of bilateral infiltrates on chest CT, increasing concern for ARDS. 

Saturations are currently tenuous on [**Last Name (LF) 1358**], and [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] likely need intubation with a plan for bronchoscopy today. 

The differential diagnosis for the etiology of ARDS in this patient includes Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), eosinophilic pneumonia, acute interstitial pneumonitis (AIP), aspiration pneumonitis, severe gram-negative bacterial pneumonia, and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). The clinical course and etiology are currently unclear. 

The plan is to discuss with the Infectious Disease (ID) specialist regarding the plan to start empirical treatment for PCP with steroids and antibiotics (sulfa allergic, will need second-line therapy).

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female admitted to the ICU for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a fracture. She has a history of cerebral aneurysm with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt and fibrinolysis syndrome. The patient presented with hyponatremia, pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, and possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She initially declined intubation but later consented after speaking with her husband and doctor. Her ABGs improved on non-rebreather oxygen and she became more comfortable after receiving Lasix. However, a repeat chest CT shows significant worsening of bilateral infiltrates, increasing concern for ARDS. The patient is stable on non-rebreather oxygen but will likely need intubation with plans for a bronchoscopy. She has been treated for possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and is currently on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, aztreonam, and Flagyl. Other medications include albuterol/atrovent nebs every 2 hours as needed, and tamiflu.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening respiratory status and diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest CT suggest the development of ARDS. ARDS is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has been"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) that was clipped with a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, and an ankle fracture that underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). She was admitted with hyponatremia and pneumonia (pna), and now presents with progressive hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on imaging consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). The patient's respiratory status has been worsening despite broad coverage with antibiotics. 

24-hour events include a low-grade temperature, pan-culture, repeat chest CT, desaturation to 88-89% with shortness of breath, and improvement with non-rebreather mask. The patient was started on Flagyl and Tamiflu, both of which were negative for flu infection. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 104/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is alert, oriented, and follows simple commands. Physical examination reveals crackles in the lungs, warm skin without rash, and no muscle wasting. Neurologic examination is stable with no signs of distress. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.3 K/u"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) that was clipped with a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, ankle fracture (fx) that underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and now presenting with progressive hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on imaging consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been admitted multiple times with hyponatremia and pneumonia (pna) and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's worsening respiratory status and bilateral infiltrates on imaging suggest the progression of ARDS. This condition can lead to severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Opportunistic Infections: Despite broad coverage with antibiotics, the patient's clinical picture raises suspicion for an opportunistic infectious process or a resistant organism. Further investigations, including bronchoscopy and additional cultures, are recommended to identify the causative agent.
3. Pulmonary Effusions: Large pleural effusions have been observed on CT and chest X-rays. Thoracentesis may be considered if there is a spike in temperature during antibiotic treatment, but it is suspected that the effusions are primarily due to an inflammatory process rather than contributing significantly to hypoxemia.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient continues to have hyponatremia, likely"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) that underwent clipping with a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, and an ankle fracture with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The patient was admitted with pneumonia (pna) and now presents with progressive hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on imaging consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards).

The patient has been experiencing low-grade fever, and there has been a change in the oxygen delivery device from high flow to non-rebreather with improvement. Tamiflu was discontinued yesterday due to negative influenza results.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/57 mmHg to 115/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles and rhonchi on lung auscultation.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.3 K/uL, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated D-dimer levels. The chest CT shows progressive infiltrates involving the bases, more consolidated, and larger effusions bilaterally. Microbiology sputum analysis reveals 2+ gram"

   no risk factors for PCP though LDH now continues to increase, verses
   HAP,  low suspciion for pe given neg lenis and clinical
   picture/imaging, ? alveolar hemorrhage remains of low suspicion, ?
   neurogenic component, no suggestion of CHF w/ BNP 400 at last check
   though seemed to respond well to diuresis, likely from ards with
   capillary leak.  While infection remains highest on ddx, this oicture
   could potentially, possibly, some other process--BOOP though atypical
   course, eosinophilc pna, will send bal for eos and if no improvement
   would probably move toward lung bx, ? reaction to amicar though again

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, and ankle fracture surgery. The patient was admitted with hyponatremia and pneumonia (pna) and is now experiencing progressive hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on imaging, consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). The main issue remains hypoxia and diffuse worsening bilateral infiltrates.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged stay on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and invasive lines make them susceptible to bloodstream infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and risk factors such as recent surgery increase the risk of PE.
5. Multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO): Prolonged antibiotic use and hospital stay increase the risk of MDRO infections.
6. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's recent surgery, altered mental status, and inability to protect their own airway, there is a risk of aspiration during oropharyngeal procedures.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient presented with worsening respiratory distress and was intubated.
- Fever of 101.2°F was recorded.
- The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, unknown, sulfa, anaphylaxis, shellfish derived, iodine, and red dye.
- The patient is currently on several antibiotics, including vancomycin, aztreonam, clindamycin, and metronidazole.
- The patient is also receiving midazolam, fentanyl, and pantoprazole in the ICU.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the worsening respiratory distress.
- Vital signs show a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/53 to 116/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with a total input of 4,579 mL and total output of 661 mL.
- The patient is receiving non-rebreather oxygen and is on mechanical ventilation with settings including Vt set at 400 mL, RR set at 28, PEEP at 15 cmH2O, FiO2 at 60%, PIP at 36 cmH2O, and SpO2 at 100%.
- ABG results indicate a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 272, and Ve of 10.4 L/min.
- Physical examination findings are mostly not assessed due to the patient's intubation.
- Lab results show elevated WBC count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and increased platelet count.
- Other lab results are within normal range or pending.
- Imaging studies, including a chest X-ray, are pending.
- Bronchial lavage and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures are pending as well.
- The patient's code status is DNR but okay to intubate for less than 14 days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should closely monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider appropriate antibiotic therapy if needed.
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection: With the patient's indwelling lines and central venous catheters, there is a potential risk of bloodstream infection. Regular monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters, along with appropriate infection control measures, should be implemented.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels may suggest AKI. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, such as fluid balance and medication adjustments, should be considered.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of DVT. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin for DVT prevention. Regular assessment for signs and symptoms of DVT should be performed.
5. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and prolonged bed rest can lead to pressure ulcers. Frequent repositioning and proper skin care are essential to prevent this complication."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who was admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a fracture. She presented with hyponatremia, pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, and possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition has been deteriorating, and she required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxia and ARDS. She also has anemia, which is likely due to blood loss during surgery, but no evidence of acute bleeding or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) at this time. The patient has a history of cerebral aneurysm with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, but her head CT showed no acute changes. She also has a history of fibrinolysis syndrome and received Amicar prior to surgery. The patient's code status is discussed with her and her husband, preferring to be do not resuscitate (DNR), but okay to intubate for 7 days, after which time she would like to continue until day 14, then extubate and become a comfort measure only (CMO) patient. If not improving on day 7, she would like to be extubated and made CMO immediately. The patient's husband is in agreement with her wishes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who was admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. She developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after surgery. The patient was intubated and transferred to the ICU, where she received mechanical ventilation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Bronchoscopy was performed, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were collected for microbiological analysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings are suggestive of ARDS, characterized by diffuse alveolar damage and impaired gas exchange. ARDS can lead to respiratory failure and requires careful management of oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for presumed pneumonia with antibiotics, but the causative organism has not yet been identified. Continued monitoring of respiratory cultures and consideration of additional diagnostic tests may be necessary to determine the specific pathogen and guide targeted therapy.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient presents with hyponatremia, which may be related to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) secondary to pneumonia or ARDS. Fluid restriction and close monitoring of electrolyte levels are essential to manage this condition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who was admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a fracture. She has a history of cerebral aneurysm with a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. The patient's post-operative course has been complicated by pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated on bronchoscopy day. The patient was transferred to the ICU with acute worsening in respiratory status and ABGs showing a large A-a gradient. A CT scan showed worsening infiltrates suggestive of ARDS. All bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) studies are pending. ABG shows good oxygenation and metabolic acidosis, and the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is fluctuating between 30-35, slightly higher than the goal.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hyponatremia, anemia, and a history of fibrinolysis syndrome. She also has an ankle fracture that will require revision surgery once she is medically stable. The patient's code status is discussed with her and her husband, and she prefers to be do not resuscitate (DNR), but is willing to be intubated for seven days, then continue until day 14, followed by extubation and making her a comfort measure-only (CMO) patient if she is not improving on day 7.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) post-clipping, and ankle fracture post-open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). She was admitted with hyponatremia and pneumonia (pna) and now presents with progressive hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on imaging consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The main issues remain hypoxia and diffuse bilateral infiltrates. The possible causes of ARDS include viral infection, aspiration, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), pulmonary embolism (PE), alveolar hemorrhage, neurogenic causes, and congestive heart failure (CHF). 

Infection remains the highest on the differential diagnosis, and alternative processes such as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) should be considered. Given the worsening respiratory status despite broad coverage, concern for opportunistic infectious processes or resistant organisms remains. 

Broad antibiotics and empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) treatment should continue, awaiting culture/bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) data. Follow-up cultures should be repeated. Gentle diuresis should be continued, and the ventilator settings should be adjusted to maintain low pressures while allowing the patient to be awake on the ventilator. 

Pulmonary effusions have been observed on imaging, but they do not significantly contribute to hypox"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) post-clipping with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, ankle fracture post-open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and now presenting with progressive hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on imaging consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and empirical Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) treatment. The main concerns include infection, ARDS, and potential opportunistic infectious processes or resistant organisms. The patient's condition is worsening despite broad coverage, and further evaluation is needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Given the patient's worsening respiratory status and imaging findings, infection remains a high possibility. Alternative processes such as Bronchiolitis Obliterate Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP) may also be considered. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics and empirical PCP treatment.
2. ARDS: The patient's bilateral infiltrates and progressive hypoxemia are consistent with ARDS. Continued management with low tidal volume ventilation and careful fluid balance is recommended.
3. Opportunistic Infections: With the patient's immunocompromised state, there is a concern for opportunistic infections, including PCP, which is being treated empirically."

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of cerebral aneurysm and VP shunt, hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, and ankle fracture. She was admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery and subsequently developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's current condition includes ARDS, hyponatremia, acute kidney injury (ARF), anemia, ankle fracture, and a history of fibrinolysis syndrome. The patient has been treated with various medications, including Vanc, Levo, Flagyl, albuterol/atrovent nebs, and amicar.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory status due to ARDS, electrolyte imbalances, further deterioration of kidney function, and infection due to the presence of oral flora in the sputum culture. Additionally, there is a risk of bleeding due to the patient's history of fibrinolysis syndrome.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, electrolyte levels, kidney function, and infection parameters. Regular reassessment and adjustments to the treatment plan will be necessary to manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who was admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. She developed postoperative complications including pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated on [**2114-2-13**] and transferred to the ICU. Since then, her condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS/Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status worsened, leading to ARDS. She required mechanical ventilation with FiO2 weaning and PEEP adjustment. There are concerns about ongoing hypoxia and the need for further management.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels with unclear etiology. Initial osmolality was low, suggesting a component of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The patient appears contracted now, and osmolality has improved. Monitoring electrolytes and strict input/output (I/O) balance is recommended.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by rising BUN/creatinine and low fractional excretion of sodium (FEN). This may be due to hypoperfusion or other causes. Close monitoring and fluid management are necessary.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased from 29 on admission to 21 today"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. Postoperatively, she developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated on 02/13/2114 and transferred to the ICU. The patient has been treated for pneumonia and pulmonary edema, and her condition has been improving. Her FiO2 was weaned overnight, and PEEP was decreased to 12, with good oxygenation. Chest X-ray showed improved infiltrates today. She tested negative for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, and Legionella. Sputum gram stain and culture showed oral flora. Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) test was negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS/Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, and she is at risk for further complications related to ARDS, including possible need for increased FiO2 and PEEP support.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, and her urine osmolality is high, suggesting a component of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Close monitoring of electrolytes and strict input/output balance is recommended.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) post-clipping with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, admitted with ankle fracture post-open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and now presenting with progressive hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on imaging consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The main issues remain hypoxemic respiratory failure, diffuse bilateral infiltrates, and ARDS. The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 28 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 150, indicating moderate ARDS.
- Diffuse bilateral infiltrates: The chest X-ray shows improvement in diffuse bilateral infiltrates, but there are still effusions present.
- ARDS: The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, which is characterized by severe hypoxemia, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, and respiratory failure.

The plan for the patient includes:
- Decrease FiO2 and follow ABG's to assess PaO2.
- Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, SAH s/p clipping with VP shunt, admitted with ankle fracture s/p ORIF. She is currently in the ICU due to hypoxemia, respiratory failure, and ARDS. The patient's main issue remains hypoxemic respiratory failure with diffuse bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen levels are decreasing, indicating a worsening condition that may require interventions such as increased FiO2 or mechanical ventilation adjustments.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory system is failing to maintain adequate gas exchange, leading to low PaO2 levels. This can result in further deterioration and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. ARDS: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is a severe lung condition that can develop after various triggers, including infections or trauma. In this case, the patient's ARDS is progressing slowly, but it is essential to closely monitor her respiratory status and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Pulmonary effusions: The presence of bilateral pleural effusions may indicate fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can impair oxygenation and ventilation. Regular monitoring and appropriate interventions, such as chest drainage, may be necessary.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which can be associated with various causes like SIADH or fluid overload. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female admitted to the ICU for open reduction and internal fixation of an ankle fracture. She has a history of cerebral aneurysm with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The patient developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after intubation. She was transferred to this hospital unit with acute worsening in respiratory status, and a CT scan showed worsening infiltrates suggestive of ARDS. The patient's current condition includes hyponatremia, acute kidney injury, anemia, ankle fracture, and a history of fibrinolysis syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and fever, along with the CT scan findings, indicate the possibility of ARDS. Close monitoring and management of oxygenation, ventilation, and fluid balance are crucial.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, and the etiology is unclear. Monitoring electrolytes and strict input/output measurements are necessary to manage this condition.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's FENa was low, and there was a correction of BUN/creatinine with aggressive volume resuscitation. Monitoring electrolytes and adjusting fluid management is important.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 29 on admission to 21 with IV fluids. Blood transfusion has already been given"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of aneurysm and fracture, currently admitted to the ICU. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CMV/ASSIST mode. The patient experienced several events overnight, including hypotension and hypertension, requiring IV fluids and Levophed. He also reported intermittent abdominal pain, which resolved spontaneously. His allergies include penicillins, sulfa, iodine, and red dye. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/58 mmHg to 109/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's blood cultures from 2/12, 2/13, and 2/16 are negative. Imaging shows improvement in bilateral air space opacities since yesterday's examination. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and mild hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and fluid imbalance. The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation puts him at risk for VAP, and the use of a central venous catheter increases the risk of bloodstream infections. The patient's immobilization and underlying medical conditions also increase the"

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history significant for hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, cerebral aneurysm with ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and ankle fracture. She was admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the ankle fracture but developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She required intubation on [02/13/08] and has been in the ICU since then.

The patient's recent events include receiving a 1L bolus in AM for contraction alkalosis and marginal urine output. She was tried on [**Month (only) 38**] PEEP but pO2 dropped, so she was placed back on PEEP of 14 and arterial blood gases (ABGs) improved. She developed hypotension and received a total of 2.5L of intravenous fluids (IVF) with mean arterial pressures (MAPs) less than 60. Levophed was started for less than 10 minutes but was stopped due to hypertension on the lowest settings. The patient reported intermittent abdominal pain when hypotensive, and blood and urine cultures were sent. An abdominal exam was performed, revealing mild distension and tenderness. The patient also experienced throat discomfort but no abdominal pain in the morning.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) that was treated with clipping and ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement, and ankle fracture with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). She was admitted with respiratory failure and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition has been worsening, with progressive hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on imaging consistent with ARDS. 

24-hour events include decreasing peep with worsening oxygenation, transient hypotension overnight, mild new abdominal discomfort, and stable neurological exam. 

Assessment and Plan:
The main issues remain hypoxemic respiratory failure, diffuse bilateral infiltrates, and ARDS. The patient is making slow progress, but imaging shows tenuous improvement that is dependent on peep. The plan is to wean FiO2 to 60% and attempt to wean peep further while following ABG's to assess pao2. Low tidal volume assisted control ventilation (ACV), pressure-controlled ventilation (PiPS), and plateau pressure remain in the 28-32 range. The patient will continue on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and follow-up chest X-rays will be limited as she has already been on several days of antibiotics, with no new data available. 

Other issues include pulmonary effusions seen on CT and films"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, SAH (subarachnoid hemorrhage) post-clipping with VP shunt, admitted with ankle fracture s/p ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation), now presenting with progressive hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The main issue remains hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS, which is slow progressing but still peep dependent. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and continues to be mechanically ventilated with low tidal volume ACV (airway pressure release ventilation) with PIP (plateau pressure) in the range of 28-32. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are currently stable at 97%, but there is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation due to the ongoing lung process.
2. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period and may require continued support.
3. Infection: Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but there is still a risk of developing healthcare-associated infections, especially since the patient has been on several days of antibiotics.
4. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, which could lead to fluid overload and worsening of ARDS.
5. Bleeding: The patient has a history of hyperfibrin"

   # Hyponatremia
Etiology unclear, [**Name2 (NI) **] osms were initially low at 263 &
   urine osms high at 400 suggesting SIADH component.  On [**2114-2-15**], pt was
   contracted & [**Date Range **] osms rose to 285.  Pt  received aggressive volume
   resusscitation & Na trended down to 129 today. No evidence of MS
   changes, continue monitoring lytes & strict i/os.
   - Head CT showed no acute changes
   - TSH & [**Date Range **] cortisol WNL
   # ARF: resolving with IVF, FENA was low at 0.1 yesterday,
   BUN/creatinine corrected with aggressive volume resuscitation. UA
   positive for WBCs, will change out foley & f/u urine culture.  Unclear
   if WBC casts seen on prior urine were accurate, low clinical suspicion
   of pyelo.  Continue broad spectrum empiric coverage.

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who was admitted for ORIF and post-operative course complicated by pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS. She was intubated on 03/04/08 and had difficulty weaning PEEP overnight. PEEP was titrated back up to 14 due to poor oxygenation at 10. ABGs improved this morning, and an attempt will be made to wean PEEP again today with serial ABGs. The chest X-ray continues to show some improvement in infiltrates. TTE with normal LVEF.

The patient has negative RSV, Influenza, and Legionella tests. Sputum gram stain and culture showed oral flora and yeast, while PCP was negative. Preliminary fungal, viral, and bacterial BAL culture data are also negative. The patient is currently on Vanc, Aztreonam, and Flagyl. She is receiving albuterol/atrovent nebs every 2 hours as needed. ID recommendations will be followed up.

The etiology of the patient's hypotension is unclear, with possible causes including volume depletion and increased PEEP causing a decrease in effective preload versus sepsis. The patient responded to aggressive volume resuscitation, and creatinine improved today. WBC is trending down, but the patient continues to have fevers. Urine/Blood Cx sent this morning,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) procedure. She has a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome and was initially admitted with pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated on [date] due to worsening bilateral infiltrates and ARDS. She had difficulty weaning PEEP overnight and her PEEP was titrated back up to 14 due to poor oxygenation at 10.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and D-dimer levels. Other lab results are within normal range. The patient's blood cultures are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is being treated for multiple conditions, including ARDS, hypoxia, hypotension, hyponatremia, acute kidney injury (ARF), anemia, and ankle fracture. The patient's medical history includes cerebral aneurysm with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt and fibrinolysis syndrome.

The patient is receiving aggressive volume resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and targeted therapies for each condition. She is also receiving pain management with fentanyl and has a plan for revision surgery once medically stable.

ICU Care:
The patient is receiving nutrition through enteral feeding and glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale. She has multiple lines inserted, including an arterial"

   Assessment and Plan:  52 yo F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, SAH s/p
   clipping with VP shunt, admitted with ankle fx s/p ORIF, course c/b
   hyponatremia and pna now with progressive hypoxemia and b/l infiltrates
   on imaging c/w ards
   Main issues remain:
   # hypoxemic respiratory failure, diffuse b/l infiltrates, ards
              -  Making slow progress by imaging though remains tenuous
   and peep dependent
              -  try to wean FIO2 further, attempt to wean peep further
   today and follow abg's to assess
               -  continue low tidal volume ACV but consider increasing Vt
   to 450. PiPS and plateau pr remain in 27-32 range
               -  continue broad-spec antibx  Vanco/Aztreonam/Flagyl
               -  cont f/u cx's, bronch studies limited as was on several
   days of antibx, no new data available
               - need to withdraw ETT 2 cm
   # Pulm effusions--b/l seen on ct and films, out of proportion to what
   might be expected in ARDS though suspect [**1-13**] underlying inflammatory
   process, improving on most recent cxrs
   #Fever, Leukocytosis
now off steroids--continue to follow
       continue on broad antibx coverage as above
   # + u/a--broad coverage at present
   # hypotension --? secondary to relative adrenal insufficiency vs
   sepsis. Doubt peep sensitivity. Concern for bleeding given h/h drop but
   now stable.
   -          repeat cultures sent, f/u. Will start empiric stress dose
   steroids.
   -          wean peep as tolerated

   Addendum: at time of signing  note (14:00), fever spiked to 102 with BP
   increase to 200 systolic. This was followed by desaturation to 79%.
   PEEP increased to 14 and FiO2 increased to 70%. CXR shows increase in
   RLL infiltrate. ETT is in good position ~4 cm above carina, no
   pneumothorax. Exam unchanged except for slight increase in lethargy.
   Suspect worsening sepsis with increase in capillary leak, possibly
   exacerbated by acute hypertension.
   Repeat culture to be sent. Pt will be sedated. Will diurese with Lasix
   20mg.  Antibiotic coverage will be broadened. Will discuss with ID
   first but likely add dose of gentamycin. Will consider switching vanco
   to linezolid.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 52-year-old female who underwent an ankle replacement surgery and subsequently developed ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's main issues include hypoxemic respiratory failure, diffuse bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS, and pulmonary effusions. 

The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and elevated D-dimer levels suggest an underlying inflammatory process. Her hypotension may be secondary to relative adrenal insufficiency or sepsis. The patient also has hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, anemia, acute kidney injury (pre-renal component), hyponatremia (likely due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), and a history of cerebral aneurysm with a VP shunt. 

The patient's current treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, diuresis with Lasix, and consideration of adding gentamicin. The ETT (endotracheal tube) should be withdrawn 2 cm. The patient's nutritional support includes enteral feeding through a nasogastric tube. 

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition remains in the ICU."

               -  try to wean FIO2 further, attempt to wean peep further
   today and follow abg's to assess
               - continue low tidal volume ACV but consider increasing Vt
   to 450. PiPS and plateau pr remain in 27-32 range, awake on vent
              -  continue broad-spec antibx
              -  cont f/u cx's, bronch studies limited as was on several
   days of antibx, no new data available

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. The patient's post-operative course was complicated by pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She required intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. ARDS/Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing severe hypoxia with a large alveolar-arterial gradient. Her chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS. The patient's peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 38 cmH2O, and plateau pressure (Pplat) is 30 cmH2O. She is being ventilated with a tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 28 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was increased to 14 due to poor oxygenation at 10 cmH2O.

2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, and the etiology is unclear. Possible causes include volume depletion, increased PEEP causing decreased preload, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient responded well to aggressive volume resuscitation. A urinalysis (UA) was positive, which may be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old female with a chief complaint of shortness of breath.
- She was admitted for an ORIF procedure and developed post-operative complications, including pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS.
- The patient has been intubated since [**2114-2-13**] and has difficulty weaning PEEP.
- She is experiencing a fungal infection on her lower back, buttocks, and perineum, which is being treated with fluconazole.
- The patient also has hyponatremia, anemia, acute renal failure, and a history of cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt.
- She is currently receiving various medications for pain control, infection, and other conditions.
- The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's worsening respiratory status and bilateral infiltrates on CT scan suggest the possibility of ARDS. This condition can lead to severe hypoxia and respiratory failure.
2. Fungal infection: The patient's rash on her lower back, buttocks, and perineum is indicative of a fungal infection, which has been confirmed by sputum gram stain and culture. If left untreated, this infection can spread and cause systemic complications.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female admitted for ORIF and post-operative course complicated by pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS. The patient was intubated on [**2114-2-13**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with worsening respiratory status. ABGs showed a large A/a gradient and CXR indicated ARDS. CT from [**2114-2-13**] revealed worsening bilateral infiltrates. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with PEEP at 12 cmH2O. TTE showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction.

Assessment and Plan:
1. ARDS/Hypoxia: The patient has ARDS with worsening respiratory status. The plan includes continuing Vanc, Aztreonam, Flagyl, and Levofloxacin empirically.
2. Hypotension: The etiology of the hypotension is unclear, with possible causes including volume depletion, increased PEEP causing decreased effective preload, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient responds well to aggressive volume resuscitation. Urine analysis positive for possible Foley catheter-related infection, so blood and urine cultures have been sent, and the Foley catheter has been changed.
3. Hyponatremia: The etiology of hyponatremia is unclear, but there may be a component of SIADH. Sodium levels have improved with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of aneurysm and fracture, admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. She developed postoperative complications including pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated on February 13th and transferred to the ICU. She has been experiencing hypoxemia, requiring increased levels of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Blood cultures have been negative for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, and Legionella. Sputum gram stain and culture showed oral flora and yeast. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) was negative. BAL culture data is pending.

The patient's condition has been unstable with episodes of hypotension, possibly due to volume depletion and increased PEEP causing decreased effective preload, or sepsis and adrenal insufficiency. She responded to aggressive volume resuscitation. A urinary catheter was changed due to possible infection indicated by a positive urine analysis. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc, Aztreonam, Flagyl, Levofloxacin) have been continued.

The patient also has hyponatremia, with an unclear etiology. SIADH component was suspected initially, but the patient's serum osmolality (osms) has trended down to 285 after aggressive volume res"

   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate), can intubate for 14days
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female admitted for ORIF (operative repair of an intertrochanteric fracture) and post-operative course complicated by pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient was intubated on [**2114-2-13**]. 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. ARDS/Hypoxia: The patient transferred to the ICU with worsening respiratory status, ABGs (arterial blood gases) showing large A/a gradient, and CXR (chest X-ray) concerning for ARDS. CT from [**2114-2-13**] showed worsening bilateral infiltrates, and the patient is intubated. RSV, Influenza, and Legionella tests are negative. Sputum gram stain and culture showed oral flora and yeast. PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) negative. BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) culture data (fungal, viral, bacterial) preliminary negative. The patient is being treated with Vanc (vancomycin), Aztreonam, Flagyl (metronidazole), Levofloxacin, and fluconazole. Albuterol/atrovent nebs (nebulizers) are given every 2 hours as needed. Repeat ABG is planned, and consideration is given to increasing sedation to provide more rest.

2. Hypotension: The etiology of hypotension is unclear, with possible causes including volume depletion, increased PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) causing a decrease in effective preload, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient responds to aggressive volume resuscitation. Urine analysis is positive, which may be related to an indwelling Foley catheter, changed out on [**2-16**]. The patient has improved since starting hydrocortisone. Empiric antibiotic therapy with Vanc/Levo/Aztreonam/Flagyl is continued, and fluconazole has been added for fungal coverage. The patient is very sensitive to lasix, and pressures drop with its administration. Cultures are monitored if spikes occur, and the stress dose steroids are being tapered for today.

3. Rash: The patient has a rash covering her lower back, buttocks, and perineum, which looks like yeast. She also has yeast in her urine and sputum cultures. IV fluconazole and miconazole powder are prescribed.

4. Hyponatremia: The etiology of hyponatremia is unclear, with initial osmolalities low at 263 and urine osmolalities high at 400, suggesting SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion) component. The patient received aggressive volume resuscitation, and sodium levels trended down to 129 today."

   - consider increasing sedation to give patient more rest, has been
   awake and agitated for most of intubation, may benefit from rest
   .
   # Hypotension: etiology unclear diff includes volume depletion and
   increased PEEP causing a [**Month (only) 38**] in effective preload vs sepsis v adrenal
   insufficiency. Pt responds to aggressive volume resuscitation.  UA
   positive which may be [**1-13**] to indwelling foley, changed out [**2-16**].  Has
   improved since starting hydrocort empirically despite normal [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. She has a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome and is currently experiencing respiratory failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated on [**2114-2-13**] and has been on mechanical ventilation since then. Her condition has been complicated by pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and lactate acid levels. The differential reveals an increased percentage of neutrophils and a decreased percentage of lymphocytes. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but her liver enzymes and kidney function tests indicate some abnormalities.

Microbiology tests have ruled out respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, and Legionella as the cause of the infection. The sputum and urine cultures have grown yeast, but further investigations are needed.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate (HR) ranging from 54 to 91 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 94/57 mmHg to 157/84 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95%. The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who was admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. She developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after intubation on February 13th. The patient's current condition is critical, and she is being treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure with ARDS: The patient has worsening bilateral infiltrates on a CT scan and is intubated. The plan is to wean from the ventilator as tolerated by increasing tidal volume (Vt) to 500 mL and then decreasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 10 cmH2O. If tolerated, a trial of pressure support (PS) will be attempted.
2. Infection: The patient's sputum and urine cultures showed yeast growth. Initial tests for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, and legionella were negative. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc, Aztreonam, Flagyl, Levofloxacin) empirically. Levofloxacin will be discontinued today on day 14.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for a surgical procedure. She has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypoxia, hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, hypotension, rash, hyponatremia, acute kidney injury (AKI), anemia, and an ankle fracture. The patient's condition has been improving over time with appropriate treatment and management. However, she still requires ongoing medical care and monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory complications if not properly treated.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS requires close monitoring and management. It can progress to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to volume depletion, increased PEEP, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. It needs to be carefully managed to ensure adequate perfusion and organ function.
4. Rash: The patient's rash is likely caused by a fungal infection. Prompt treatment is necessary to prevent it from spreading and causing further complications.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia should be carefully managed to avoid neurological complications. The underlying cause needs to be identified and addressed.
6. AKI: The patient's AKI requires close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management to prevent further kidney damage"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female admitted to the ICU for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. The patient's postoperative course has been complicated by pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated on [**2114-2-13**] and transferred to the ICU. The patient has tested negative for RSV, influenza, and Legionella, but a viral culture from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was positive for influenza. The patient's sedation level has been increased to give her more rest, and she has been awake and agitated for most of the intubation period. The patient's ventilation has improved, and she is expected to be weaned off the ventilator soon. Her diuresis will be continued with the goal of achieving a negative fluid balance today.

Medical Complications:
1. ARDS/Hypoxia: The patient developed ARDS with bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and CT scan. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Her viral culture from BAL was positive for influenza.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, and the etiology is unclear. Possible causes include volume depletion, increased PEEP causing decreased preload, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient responded to aggressive volume resuscitation.
3. Rash: The patient has a yeast"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) surgery. She developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) after intubation on [**2114-2-13**]. She was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with worsening respiratory status and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. A CT scan showed worsening bilateral infiltrates as well. The patient's BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) viral culture was positive for influenza A, which is the likely etiology of her ARDS. She has been off all antibiotics since the positive viral culture. 

The patient has shown improvement with increasing sedation to give her more rest. Her ventilation has improved, and she is weaning off the ventilator. Her PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) has been decreased to 8 cmH2O overnight, and she tolerates it well. Her FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) has been decreased to 50%. 

Her blood pressure is still a concern, and the etiology is unclear. It could be due to volume depletion, increased PEEP causing decreased effective preload, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. She responds well to aggressive volume resuscitation. Her urine analysis is positive, which may be related to the indwelling Foley catheter. 

The patient also has"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who was admitted for ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) of an ankle fracture. She developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after surgery. She was intubated on [**2114-2-13**] and has been in the ICU since then.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 128/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. She is sedated and unable to provide any history.

Her physical examination reveals the presence of an endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube, as well as crackles at the bases of her lungs bilaterally. Her extremities are warm and well-perfused, and she has a positive fluid balance with a total intake of 2,324 mL and output of 1,280 mL.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows new or worsening infiltrates in the left lower lobe of her lungs.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Respiratory failure with ARDS: The patient will be weaned from the ventilator as tolerated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female admitted to the ICU for ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) of an ankle fracture. She has a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome and was intubated on 02/13/2114 due to pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient's current condition includes low-grade fever, acute desaturation, worsening hypoxia, bilateral pneumonia on chest X-ray, hypotension with unclear etiology, hyponatremia, acute kidney injury with resolved fluid overload, anemia, ankle fracture, history of cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt, and previous fibrinolysis syndrome. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet settings, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and has a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome): The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive viral culture for influenza A, indicating a viral infection that could progress to a more severe condition.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral pneumonia on chest X-ray, which can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to volume depletion,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female admitted to the ICU for ORIF (orthopedic surgery) due to a fractured ankle. She has a history of cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt and fibrinolysis syndrome. The patient developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) post-surgery. She was intubated on 02/13 and transferred to the ICU. A CT scan showed worsening bilateral infiltrates, and the patient's BAL viral culture was positive for influenza A, likely causing her ARDS. The patient has completed a 10-day course of vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole, as well as a 2-week course of levofloxacin. Her current medications include furosemide (Lasix), fentanyl, and midazolam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS/Hypoxia: The patient's ARDS has been improving, but she still requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and the possibility of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Hypotension: The etiology of the patient's hypotension is unclear, with possible causes including volume depletion, increased PEEP causing decreased effective preload, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient responds to aggressive volume resuscitation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who was admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) procedure. She developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after surgery. The patient required intubation on [**2114-2-13**]. Since admission, she has been experiencing hypoxemia and required an increase in sedation, brief airway pressure release ventilation (APRV), and an increase in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 12. Fever was also noted, with minimal secretions being suctioned. A chest X-ray showed worsening bilateral infiltrates. The patient is unable to provide history due to sedation.

The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, shellfish-derived products, iodine, and red dye. She received various antibiotics, including fluconazole, metronidazole, vancomycin, and aztreonam. The patient is currently receiving midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and enoxaparin (Lovenox) infusions. Other medications include furosemide (Lasix), fentanyl, and midazolam (Versed).

Vital signs include a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/57 mmHg to"

   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   # ARDS/Hypoxia
 Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with worsening resp status,
   ABGs showing large A/a gradient & CXR concerning for ARDS. CT from
   [**2114-2-13**] showed worsening bilateral infiltrates & pt intubated  on
   [**2114-2-13**].  TTE with normal LVEF.  viral culture positive for influenza A,
   the likely etiology of her ARDS.  Antibiotics d/c
d [**2-19**].  Patient had
   persistent low grade temps.  Temp as high as 101.8 rectal  with acute
   desaturation to high 80s and evidence of worsening hypoxia +/- new
   bilateral pneumonia on CXR so restarted on antibiotics on [**2-21**].  Again,
   destted overnight, vent switched to APRV with good effect, currently
   weaning FiO2.
   - Given positve viral Cx, d/c
d all antibiotics [**2-19**].  She had
   completed 10 day course of vanc/atreonam/flagyl and a 2 week course of
   levo.
   - re-bronch [**2-21**]
 f/u micro
   - restarted antibx ([**2-21**])
 linezolid, levo and gentamicin
   - completed 5 day course of fluconazole ([**2-21**]), feel antifungal therapy
   still warranted, will continue but switch to voriconazole for now, may
   have to switch to caspo if renal function continues to worsen.
   - re-check fungal markers
   - f/u ID recs
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs Q2h prn
   - continue APRV setting on the vent for now
   # Hypotension: etiology unclear diff includes volume depletion and
   increased PEEP causing a [**Month (only) 38**] in effective preload vs sepsis v adrenal
   insufficiency. Pt responds to aggressive volume resuscitation.  UA

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who was admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) procedure. She developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after intubation on February 13th. The patient was transferred to another hospital unit due to worsening respiratory status, and a computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS. The viral culture was positive for influenza A, which is likely the cause of her ARDS. Antibiotics were discontinued on February 19th.

The patient experienced persistent low-grade temperatures and acute desaturation to the high 80s, along with evidence of worsening hypoxia and new bilateral pneumonia on chest X-ray. Therefore, antibiotics were restarted on February 21st, including linezolid, levofoxacin, and gentamicin. A bronchoscopy was performed on February 21st to follow up on the microorganisms. The patient completed a 5-day course of fluconazole and will continue antifungal therapy with voriconazole or caspofungin if renal function worsens.

The patient also had hypotension with an unclear etiology, possibly due to volume depletion, increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) causing decreased effective preload, or sepsis and adrenal insufficiency. The patient responded to aggressive volume res"

   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   # ARDS/Hypoxia
 Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with worsening resp status,
   ABGs showing large A/a gradient & CXR concerning for ARDS. CT from
   [**2114-2-13**] showed worsening bilateral infiltrates & pt intubated  on
   [**2114-2-13**].  TTE with normal LVEF.  viral culture positive for influenza A,
   the likely etiology of her ARDS.  Antibiotics d/c
d [**2-19**].  Patient had
   persistent low grade temps.  Temp as high as 101.8 rectal  with acute
   desaturation to high 80s and evidence of worsening hypoxia +/- new
   bilateral pneumonia on CXR so restarted on antibiotics on [**2-21**].  Again,
   destted overnight, vent switched to APRV with good effect, currently
   weaning FiO2.
   - Given positve viral Cx, d/c
d all antibiotics [**2-19**].  She had
   completed 10 day course of vanc/atreonam/flagyl and a 2 week course of
   levo.
   - re-bronch [**2-21**]
 f/u micro
   - restarted antibx ([**2-21**])
 linezolid, levo and gentamicin
   - completed 5 day course of fluconazole ([**2-21**]), feel antifungal therapy
   still warranted, will continue but switch to voriconazole for now, may
   have to switch to caspo if renal function continues to worsen.
   - re-check fungal markers
   - f/u ID recs
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs Q2h prn
   - continue APRV setting on the vent for now
   # Hypotension: etiology unclear diff includes volume depletion and
   increased PEEP causing a [**Month (only) 38**] in effective preload vs sepsis v adrenal
   insufficiency. Pt responds to aggressive volume resuscitation.  UA
   positive which may be [**1-13**] to indwelling foley, changed out [**2-16**].  Seemed
   to improve with hydrocort empirically despite normal [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim.
   Hydrocort now d/c
   - on levophed, continue efforts to wean
   - has been volume resuscitated
 5L+ yesterday
   # Abdominal Distention/Diarrhea
 worsening abdominal distension
   accompanied by several loose bowel movements in thelast day.  KUB
   showed dilated loops of bowel.  Brisk rise in WBC count, all concerning
   for cdiff colitis.  Though pt may have ileus from large amount of
   narcotis with IV sedation, cannot exclude toxic megacolon from
   differential.
   - restart flagyl
   - check c.diff and toxin B
   - if patient stable, off pressures with worsening symptoms, consider
   abdominal CT v gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] consult
   # Systolic murmur
 new murmur this am, flow v valvular lesions v newly
   opened PFO.  Unlikely, flow as harsh rather than soft and blolwing
   - TTE with bubble study
   # Urinary Tract Infection
 WBC casts in urine specimen concerning for
   pyelonephritis
   -  continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   # Rash
 covering lower back, buttocks and perineum, looks like yeast.
   Also has yeast in urine and sputum Cx.
   -  fluconazole for 5 day course complete
   - started on voriconazole
   - miconazole powder
   # Hyponatremia
Etiology unclear, [**Name2 (NI) **] osms were initially low at 263 &
   urine osms high at 400 suggesting SIADH component.  On [**2114-2-15**], pt was
   contracted & [**Date Range **] osms rose to 285.  Pt  received aggressive volume
   resusscitation & Na trended down to 129 today. No evidence of MS
   changes, continue monitoring lytes & strict i/os.  Resolved.
   - Head CT showed no acute changes
   - TSH & [**Date Range **] cortisol WNL
   # ARF: FENA was low at 0.1, BUN/creatinine corrected with aggressive
   volume resuscitation. UA positive for WBCs, changed out foley & f/u
   urine culture.  Unclear if WBC casts seen on prior urine were accurate,
   low clinical suspicion of pyelo.  Continue broad spectrum empiric
   coverage.   Initial ARF on presentation had resolved, now new evidence
   of recurrent renal failure in setting of hypotension, gentamicin
   administration and rapidly rising creatinine.  Received>5l of fluid
   yesterday with no increase in urine output.  Urine output did increase
   when started on levophed.
   - discuss with ID alternatives to gentamicin
   - consider renal consult
   - follow urine output
 has put out well on levophed, will follow
   closely when off pressors
   # Anemia - hct was 29 on adm and down to 21 with fluids. Hct stable in
   mid-low 20s.
   - transfuse 1upRBCs for hct <23
   - peripheral smears have been negative for schistocytes (fibrinogen &
   haptoglob have been elevated to date)
   # ankle fracture - plan for revision once medically stable.
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - f/u ortho recs re plan to return to OR when stable.
   # h/o cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt.
   - stable, Head CT shows no acute changes
   # h/o fibrinolysis syndrome
pt received Amicar per hem/onc recs prior
   to surgery. Hct trended down overnight with IVF. Peripheral smear neg
   for schistocytes, will recheck hct, fibrinogen/LDH/INR, and follow

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who was admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. She developed postoperative complications including pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated and transferred to the ICU.

The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, with episodes of acute desaturation and hypoxia, leading to the need for changes in ventilator settings. She was initially on invasive mechanical ventilation with assist-control mode, then switched to airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) which improved oxygenation.

The patient also has a positive viral culture for influenza A, suggesting it as the likely etiology of her ARDS. Antibiotics were discontinued on February 19th but restarted on February 21st due to persistent low-grade temperatures and worsening hypoxia. Bronchoscopy was performed on February 21st, and broad-spectrum antibiotics including linezolid, levofoxacin, and gentamicin were initiated.

The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring aggressive volume resuscitation and the use of norepinephrine. The cause of hypotension is unclear, with possibilities including volume depletion, increased PEEP causing decreased preload, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. Hydrocortisone was administered empirically but has since been discontinued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who was admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) procedure. She has a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome and is currently in the ICU due to pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following intubation on February 13th. The patient has been transferred to the ICU with worsening respiratory status, showing large A-a gradient on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis and a chest X-ray indicating bilateral infiltrates, consistent with ARDS. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Viral culture was positive for influenza A, likely causing her ARDS. Antibiotics were discontinued on February 19th. The patient experienced persistent low-grade fever and acute desaturation to high 80s, along with evidence of worsening hypoxia and new bilateral pneumonia on chest X-ray, leading to the restart of antibiotics on February 21st. The patient underwent bronchoscopy on February 21st and is currently being treated with linezolid, levofoxacin, and gentamicin. She also completed a 5-day course of fluconazole and will continue antifungal therapy with voriconazole. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension of unclear etiology, possibly related to volume depletion, increased positive end-expiratory pressure ("

   #Sepsis:  Patient w/ hypotension, leukocytosis, and fevers over last
   24hrs.  In this setting, patient has had an increasing lactic
   acidosis.  Possible sources include likely GI vs. VAP vs unidentified
   infection.  Given that patient has markedly dilated loops of bowel w/o
   movement of stool in multiple days while taking antibiotics, have
   suspicion of possible toxic megacolon from c.Diff.  Bowel exam not
   notably changed however.  Pressuress have held stable on pressors and
   patient has adequate urine output.  Central line was placed showed CVP
   of 9.
   n        fluid bolus for CVP between [**7-24**], then titrate

   persistent low grade temps.  Temp as high as 101.8 rectal  with acute
   desaturation to high 80s and evidence of worsening hypoxia +/- new
   bilateral pneumonia on CXR so restarted on antibiotics on [**2-21**].
      Patient had been switch to APRV ventilation mode and had been doing
   well.  In setting of sepsis overnight had some transient hyspoxia that
   was positional.   Have attempt to adjust ventilation parameters to
   facilitate improvement of acidosis.

   # Hyponatremia
Etiology unclear, [**Name2 (NI) **] osms were initially low at 263 &
   urine osms high at 400 suggesting SIADH component.  On [**2114-2-15**], pt was
   contracted & [**Date Range **] osms rose to 285.  Pt  received aggressive volume
   resusscitation & Na trended down to 129 today. No evidence of MS
   changes, continue monitoring lytes & strict i/os.  Resolved.
   - Head CT showed no acute changes
   - TSH & [**Date Range **] cortisol WNL
   # ARF: FENA was low at 0.1, BUN/creatinine corrected with aggressive
   volume resuscitation. UA positive for WBCs, changed out foley & f/u
   urine culture.  Unclear if WBC casts seen on prior urine were accurate,
   low clinical suspicion of pyelo.  Continue broad spectrum empiric
   coverage.   Initial ARF on presentation had resolved, now new evidence
   of recurrent renal failure in setting of hypotension, gentamicin
   administration and rapidly rising creatinine.  Seen by renal yesterday,
   feel that its ATNB in setting of hypotension/gent.  Cr only mildly
   increased to 1.3 Currently making good urine output.
   # Anemia - hct was 29 on adm and down to 21 with fluids. Hct stable in

   24 Hour Events:
   -- patient remained febrile throughout day Tm 101.8
   -- has been unable to ween from pressors with doses ranging btw
   0.15-0.20
   -- seen by renal, feel ARF [**1-13**] to ATN from likely gent vs. hypotension
   -- gent d/c'd, restarted on aztreonam.  Also, vori switched to
   caspofungin
   -- TTE unremarkable
   -- had allergic reaction after getting IV flagyl, resolved w/ benedryl,
   has not reoccured w/ subsequent dose
   -- patient has multiple and frequent episodes of NSVT, longest 10
   beats, w/ increased hypotension during episode.  Electrolytes were
   okay, no new hypoxia.  Rising lactate to 2.7 now acidotic.  Levophed
   cut in half and vasopressin added.  IV bolus of metoprolol also
   administered.  EKG w/o QT prolongation, evidence of ischemia or PE, or
   PR prolongation.  Belly somewhat tense and distended, but unchanged.
   KUB showed worsened bowel dilitaiton and CXR also appears worse.
   Degree of ectopy improved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient remained febrile throughout the day with a temperature of 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit. They were unable to wean off pressors, requiring doses ranging from 0.15-0.20. The patient was seen by renal specialists who felt acute renal failure (ARF) due to gentamicin or hypotension. Gentamicin was discontinued, and aztreonam was restarted. Voriconazole was switched to caspofungin. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no abnormalities. The patient experienced an allergic reaction after receiving intravenous (IV) Flagyl, which resolved with Benadryl and did not recur with subsequent doses. The patient had multiple episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), with the longest episode lasting 10 beats. These episodes were associated with increased hypotension. Electrolytes were normal, and there were no new findings of hypoxia or ischemia on the electrocardiogram (EKG). Lactate levels rose to 2.7, indicating acidosis. Levophed was cut in half, and vasopressin was added. Metoprolol was also administered via IV bolus. The patient's abdomen was somewhat tense and distended, but unchanged. Imaging showed worsened bowel dilation and a chest X-ray appeared worse. The degree of ectopy improved. The patient became increasingly acid"

   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   1. Sepsis/increased lactate with metabolic acidosis in setting of
   fever, dilated colon - high concern for bowel source, cdiff, other
   infection. ARDS progressed past 24-48 hrs, pO2 maintained ~200 on APRV
   100%. General surgery's input appreciated. Plan is to do sigmoidoscopy
   to decompress and assess mucosa for pseudomembranes, etc.
   2. Acute Resp failure
 progression of ARDS. Better on APRV with
   improved pO2, did not tolerate brief trial of PCV but was not
   paralysed. Remains on 100% O2 but will wean as tolerated. BAL cultures
   pending, gram stain unremarkable.
   3. Other ID issues - ARDS likely due to influenza initially, currently
   with fevers, hypotension, leukocytosis due to new process vs less
   likely recurrence. On broad spectrum Abx (linezolid, aztreonam,
   IV/PO/enema flagyl including cdiff
   converage.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who was admitted for ORIF (operative repair of a fractured bone) and subsequently developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). She is now in the ICU (intensive care unit) on mechanical ventilation and has multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/increased lactate with metabolic acidosis: The patient has a fever and a dilated colon, which raises concern for a bowel source of infection, such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff). The presence of sepsis along with increased lactate and metabolic acidosis indicates systemic infection and may require further investigation and treatment.
2. Acute respiratory failure (ARDS): The patient's ARDS has progressed despite being on 100% oxygen. There is a need to continue optimizing oxygenation and ventilation strategies to maintain adequate respiratory function.
3. Infectious disease issues: In addition to the suspected C. diff infection, the patient may also have other ID (infectious disease) issues, potentially related to influenza or another new process. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover various possible infections, including coverage for C. diff.
4. Hypotension: The patient requires low-dose levophed and vasopressin to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. This suggests ongoing hemodynamic"

   Assessment and Plan
   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   #Sepsis:  Patient w/ hypotension, leukocytosis, and fevers over last
   24hrs.  In this setting, patient has had an increasing lactic
   acidosis.  Possible sources include likely GI vs. VAP vs unidentified
   infection.  Given that patient has markedly dilated loops of bowel w/o
   movement of stool in multiple days while taking antibiotics, have
   suspicion of possible toxic megacolon from c.Diff.  Bowel exam not
   notably changed however.  Pressures have held stable on pressors and
   patient has adequate urine output.  Central line was placed showed CVP
   of 9.
   - fluid bolus for CVP between [**7-24**], then titrate levo/vasopressors for
   MAPs > 65 and monitor urine output for 20cc/hr
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics of linezolid, aztreonam and
   caspofungin
   - f/u c.diff cx
   - continue PO vanc and vanc enema, IV flagyl for possible cdiff/toxic
   megacolon
   - patient was seen by general surgery, hesistant to take patient to OR
   given instability, recommended sigmoidoscopy for decompression and
   diagnosis.  GI does not feel that procedure indicated at this time
   given that pt unstable and will only be able to provide diagnostic not
   decompressive maneuvers.   Treatment would not be altered.
   - If becomes increasingly acidodic such that ventilation cannot
   compensate, will consider Bicarb drip and asking renal to consider
   dialysis.
   - lactate continues to trend up suggesting bowel ischemia v necrotizing
   colon.  Could be either given hypotension and ileus v a possible toxic
   megacolon, follow closely
   - attempt to wean levophed, and then vasopressin as tolerated.  If
   stable of levo, can try to diurese to try to give some leeway with
   respiratory care
   # ARDS/Hypoxia
 Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with worsening resp status,
   ABGs showing large A/a gradient & CXR concerning for ARDS. CT from
   [**2114-2-13**] showed worsening bilateral infiltrates & pt intubated  on
   [**2114-2-13**].  TTE with normal LVEF.  viral culture positive for influenza A,
   the likely etiology of her ARDS.  Antibiotics d/c
d [**2-19**].  Patient had
   persistent low grade temps.  Temp as high as 101.8 rectal  with acute
   desaturation to high 80s and evidence of worsening hypoxia +/- new
   bilateral pneumonia on CXR so restarted on antibiotics on [**2-21**].
   Patient had been switch to APRV ventilation mode and had been doing
   well.  Poisitional hyspoxia with movement.   Have attempt to adjust
   ventilation parameters to facilitate improvement of acidosis.
   - if ableto wean levo, would try to diurese today
   - Given positve viral Cx, d/c
d all antibiotics [**2-19**].  She had
   completed 10 day course of vanc/atreonam/flagyl and a 2 week course of
   levo.
   - restarted antibx ([**2-21**])
 linezolid, levo and gentamicin
   - completed 5 day course of fluconazole ([**2-21**]), feel antifungal therapy
   still warranted, will continue but switch to voriconazole for now, may
   have to switch to caspo if renal function continues to worsen.
   - re-bronch [**2-21**]
 f/u micro
   - re-check fungal markers
   - f/u ID recs
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs Q2h prn
   - continue APRV setting on the vent for now
   - can try to put weight on chest to try to see if patient might benefit
   from proning
   # Systolic murmur
 new murmur this am, flow v valvular lesions v newly
   opened PFO.  Normal TTE yesterday, likely enhanced flow murmur in
   setting of increase ventilatory pressures.
   # Rash
 covering lower back, buttocks and perineum, looks like yeast.
   Also has yeast in urine and sputum Cx.
   -  fluconazole for 5 day course complete
   - started on voriconazole
   - miconazole powder
   # Hyponatremia
Etiology unclear, [**Name2 (NI) **] osms were initially low at 263 &
   urine osms high at 400 suggesting SIADH component.  On [**2114-2-15**], pt was
   contracted & [**Date Range **] osms rose to 285.  Pt  received aggressive volume
   resusscitation & Na trended down to 129 today. No evidence of MS
   changes, continue monitoring lytes & strict i/os.  Resolved.
   - Head CT showed no acute changes
   - TSH & [**Date Range **] cortisol WNL
   # ARF: FENA was low at 0.1, BUN/creatinine corrected with aggressive
   volume resuscitation. UA positive for WBCs, changed out foley & f/u
   urine culture.  Unclear if WBC casts seen on prior urine were accurate,
   low clinical suspicion of pyelo.  Continue broad spectrum empiric
   coverage.   Initial ARF on presentation had resolved, now new evidence
   of recurrent renal failure in setting of hypotension, gentamicin
   administration and rapidly rising creatinine.  Seen by renal yesterday,
   feel that its ATNB in setting of hypotension/gent.  Cr trending down.
    Currently making good urine output.
   # Coagulopathy
 INR to 1.8 in setting of albumin of 1.9, impaired
   renal function on lovenox and FDP levels elevated to 40-80
   -          give vit K
   -          nutrition consuit for TPN
   -          follow DIC labs
   -          discuss with ortho lovenox (which is renally metabolized) v
   heparin
   # Anemia - hct was 29 on adm and down to 21 with fluids. Hct stable in
   mid-low 20s.
   - transfuse 1upRBCs for hct <23
   - peripheral smears have been negative for schistocytes (fibrinogen &
   haptoglob have been elevated to date)
   # ankle fracture - plan for revision once medically stable.
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   -          f/u ortho recs re plan to return to OR when stable.
   -           touch base with ortho re lovenox v heparin
   # h/o cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt.
   - stable, Head CT shows no acute changes
   # h/o fibrinolysis syndrome
pt received Amicar per hem/onc recs prior
   to surgery. Hct trended down overnight with IVF. Peripheral smear neg
   for schistocytes, will recheck hct, fibrinogen/LDH/INR, and follow
   daily
   - transfuse 1upRBCs for hct <23

   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   #Sepsis:  Patient w/ hypotension, leukocytosis, and fevers over last
   24hrs.  In this setting, patient has had an increasing lactic
   acidosis.  Possible sources include likely GI vs. VAP vs unidentified
   infection.  Given that patient has markedly dilated loops of bowel w/o
   movement of stool in multiple days while taking antibiotics, have
   suspicion of possible toxic megacolon from c.Diff.  Bowel exam not
   notably changed however.  Pressuress have held stable on pressors and
   patient has adequate urine output.  Central line was placed showed CVP
   of 9.
   n        fluid bolus for CVP between [**7-24**], then titrate
   levo/vasopressors for MAPs > 65 and monitor urine output for 20cc/hr
   n        continue broad spectrum antibiotics of linezolid.  No longer
   on gent, continue aztreonam and caspofungin

   to OR given instability, recommended sigmoidoscopy for decompression
   and diagnosis.  Will c/s GI.
   n        If becomes increasingly acidodic such that ventilation cannot
   compensate, will consider Bicarb drip and asking renal to consider
   dialysis.
   # ARDS/Hypoxia
 Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with worsening resp status,
   ABGs showing large A/a gradient & CXR concerning for ARDS. CT from
   [**2114-2-13**] showed worsening bilateral infiltrates & pt intubated  on
   [**2114-2-13**].  TTE with normal LVEF.  viral culture positive for influenza A,
   the likely etiology of her ARDS.  Antibiotics d/c

   persistent low grade temps.  Temp as high as 101.8 rectal  with acute
   desaturation to high 80s and evidence of worsening hypoxia +/- new
   bilateral pneumonia on CXR so restarted on antibiotics on [**2-21**].
      Patient had been switch to APRV ventilation mode and had been doing
   well.  In setting of sepsis overnight had some transient hyspoxia that
   was positional.   Have attempt to adjust ventilation parameters to
   facilitate improvement of acidosis.
   - Given positve viral Cx, d/c

   Also has yeast in urine and sputum Cx.
   -  fluconazole for 5 day course complete
   - started on voriconazole
   - miconazole powder
   # Hyponatremia
Etiology unclear, [**Name2 (NI) **] osms were initially low at 263 &
   urine osms high at 400 suggesting SIADH component.  On [**2114-2-15**], pt was
   contracted & [**Date Range **] osms rose to 285.  Pt  received aggressive volume
   resusscitation & Na trended down to 129 today. No evidence of MS
   changes, continue monitoring lytes & strict i/os.  Resolved.
   - Head CT showed no acute changes
   - TSH & [**Date Range **] cortisol WNL
   # ARF: FENA was low at 0.1, BUN/creatinine corrected with aggressive
   volume resuscitation. UA positive for WBCs, changed out foley & f/u
   urine culture.  Unclear if WBC casts seen on prior urine were accurate,
   low clinical suspicion of pyelo.  Continue broad spectrum empiric
   coverage.   Initial ARF on presentation had resolved, now new evidence
   of recurrent renal failure in setting of hypotension, gentamicin
   administration and rapidly rising creatinine.  Seen by renal yesterday,
   feel that its ATNB in setting of hypotension/gent.  Cr only mildly
   increased to 1.3 Currently making good urine output.
   # Anemia - hct was 29 on adm and down to 21 with fluids. Hct stable in
   mid-low 20s.

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female admitted to the ICU for an open reduction and internal fixation of an ankle fracture. She has a history of cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt, fibrinolysis syndrome, and multiple medical comorbidities. She developed postoperative complications including pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after intubation on February 13th. The patient was initially treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal therapy due to positive viral culture for influenza A and suspicion of Clostridium difficile infection. However, she continued to have persistent low-grade fever and worsening hypoxia, leading to the restart of antibiotics on February 21st.

The patient's current condition includes multi-lumen central line placement, sedation, vasopressor support, and mechanical ventilation in APRV mode. Her vital signs show fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, lactic acidosis, hyponatremia, and renal dysfunction. Imaging studies reveal bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and CT scan consistent with ARDS.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient exhibits signs of sepsis with hypotension, leukocytosis, and fever. Possible sources of infection include gastrointestinal tract, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or unidentified infection. Given the suspicion of toxic megacolon from"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has a history of influenza and underwent ankle surgery. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various complications. These include runs of ventricular tachycardia, ventilator dyssynchrony, dilated colon, labile blood pressure requiring levophed and vasopressin, and fever. She is on multiple medications including amiodarone, vecuronium, vasopressin, norepinephrine, and midazolam.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains profoundly hypoxemic and is tolerating APRV (Airway Pressure Release Ventilation) settings. A trial of proning will be attempted.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are improving, and urine output is adequate. If she can be weaned off the pressors, diuresis will be attempted.
3. Dilated Colon/Lactic Acidosis: The patient is presumed to have Clostridium difficile infection, for which Flagyl has been started. The abdomen is less firm on examination, and lactic acidosis is stabilizing. Lactate levels will be rechecked.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
- Prolonged or severe respiratory failure leading to further hypoxemia and potential organ damage.
- Progression of renal failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo woman with influenza A and ARDS s/p R ankle surgery.  Now also
   with increasing lactate, very dilated loops of bowel.
   Respiratory Failure: Remains profoundly hypoxemic.  Tolerating APRV for
   the moment.  [**Name2 (NI) **] stay on curremt APRV setting.
   Will not reverse paralysis until MAP/HR stable and lactate resolving as
   any decline with Ph will make ventilation difficult
   Renal Failure: Cr improving, U/O adequate.  Will try to diurese if we
   can get her off of pressors. Will transfuse with pRBC
s to see if she
   may wean off pressors
   Dilated Colon/Lactic acidosis: Working under presumed diagnosis of
   C.Diff.  Getting Flagyl.  Abd less firm on exam and lactic acidosis
   stabilizing.  Will rechaeck lactate. Hold off on flex sig unless
   Surgical staff feel she is operative candidate as she is too risky to
   even reposition in bed for procedures.

   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   #Sepsis:  continues to be pressor dependant, lactic acid trended down
   slightly over course of day. Etiologies include likely GI vs. VAP vs
   unidentified infection.  Given that patient has markedly dilated loops
   of bowel w/o movement of stool in multiple days while taking
   antibiotics, have suspicion of possible toxic megacolon from c.Diff.
   Bowel exam not notably changed however.  Pressures have held stable on
   pressors and patient has adequate urine output.  Central line was
   placed showed CVP of 9.
   - fluid bolus for CVP between [**7-24**], then titrate levo/vasopressors for
   MAPs > 65 and monitor urine output for 20cc/hr
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics of linezolid, aztreonam and
   caspofungin
   - f/u c.diff cx, neg x 1
   - continue PO vanc and vanc enema, IV flagyl for possible cdiff/toxic
   megacolon
   - patient was seen by general surgery, hesistant to take patient to OR
   given instability, recommended sigmoidoscopy for decompression and
   diagnosis.  GI does not feel that procedure indicated at this time
   given that pt unstable and will only be able to provide diagnostic not
   decompressive maneuvers.   Treatment would not be altered.
   - If becomes increasingly acidodic such that ventilation cannot
   compensate, will consider Bicarb drip and asking renal to consider
   dialysis.
   - lactate continues to trend up suggesting bowel ischemia v necrotizing
   colon.  Could be either given hypotension and ileus v a possible toxic
   megacolon, follow closely
   - attempt to wean levophed, and then vasopressin as tolerated.  If
   stable of levo, can try to diurese to try to give some leeway with
   respiratory care
   # ARDS/Hypoxia
 Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with worsening resp status,
   ABGs showing large A/a gradient & CXR concerning for ARDS. CT from
   [**2114-2-13**] showed worsening bilateral infiltrates & pt intubated  on
   [**2114-2-13**].  TTE with normal LVEF.  viral culture positive for influenza A,
   the likely etiology of her ARDS.  Antibiotics d/c
d [**2-19**].  Patient had
   persistent low grade temps.  Temp as high as 101.8 rectal  with acute
   desaturation to high 80s and evidence of worsening hypoxia +/- new
   bilateral pneumonia on CXR so restarted on antibiotics on [**2-21**].
   Patient had been switch to APRV ventilation mode and had been doing
   well. Weaned FiO2 to 80% & pt has been maintaining sats better with
   turning per nursing
   - Given positive viral Cx, d/c
d all antibiotics [**2-19**], had completed 10
   day course of vanc/atreonam/flagyl and a 2 week course of levo.
   - continue Abx Vanc PO & PR, Linezolid, Aztreonam, Levo, Flagyl,
   Caspofungin
   - per ID can start Tigacycline if clinically decompensates
   - f/u micro data, BAL from [**2-21**] NGTD
   - fungal markers from [**2-21**] still pending
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs Q2h prn
   - continue APRV setting on the vent for now
   - can try to put weight on chest to try to see if patient might benefit
   from proning
   # ARF: resolving, likely prerenal etiology with low FENA. UA positive
   for WBCs, changed out foley & f/u urine culture.  Unclear if WBC casts
   seen on prior urine were accurate, low clinical suspicion of pyelo.
   Continue broad spectrum empiric coverage. Renal function stable despite
   2 days of gentamicin & hypotension.  UOP approx 40cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine/UOP
   - avoiding nephrotoxins, wean pressors if possible
   # Coagulopathy
 INR 1.7 in setting of albumin of 1.9, impaired renal
   function on lovenox and FDP elevated 40-80, Fibrinogen trended down
   500s
   - rec'd Vit K
   - f/u nutrition consult for TPN
   - follow DIC labs
   # Anemia - hct of 23.2, received 1u pRBCs & bumped approp this am to
   26.8
   - peripheral smears have been negative for schistocytes (fibrinogen &
   haptoglob have been elevated to date)
   # ankle fracture - hard cast d/c'd on [**2-23**], sutures C/D/I.  No plan for
   revision until medically stabilized
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - touch base with ortho re lovenox v heparin
   # h/o fibrinolysis syndrome
pt received Amicar per hem/onc recs prior
   to surgery. Hct trended down overnight with IVF. Peripheral smear neg
   for schistocytes, will recheck hct, fibrinogen/LDH/INR, and follow
   daily
   - transfuse 1upRBCs for hct <25

","The patient is a 52-year-old female who was admitted for orthopedic surgery but developed pulmonary edema, respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after intubation. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation since February 13th.

The patient's medical history includes hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, which is a condition characterized by excessive breakdown of blood clots. This can lead to bleeding and difficulty in controlling bleeding. The patient has also been diagnosed with ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can cause low oxygen levels in the blood.

The patient's current medications include broad-spectrum antibiotics (linezolid, aztreonam, levofloxacin, flagyl, and caspofungin) to cover for various potential infections, including C. difficile, as well as anti-inflammatory medication (pantoprazole) for stress ulcers. The patient is also receiving vasopressor support (norepinephrine) to maintain blood pressure and sedation (vecuronium) to facilitate ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 53 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on assisted ventilation. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (15.4 K/uL),"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 52-year-old woman with influenza A and ARDS, post right ankle surgery. She is currently experiencing increasing lactate levels and very dilated loops of bowel. The patient remains profoundly hypoxemic but on slightly less FIO2 today (80%). She is tolerating APRV for the moment, and it is recommended to continue with the current APRV settings. Paralytics will be continued for today, and the plan is to think about reversing them when able to decrease the FIO2.

The patient's renal function is improving, with a decreasing creatinine level. Adequate urine output is being maintained, and an attempt will be made to initiate diuresis with 40mg iv Lasix today.

There is a presumed diagnosis of C. Diff, so Flagyl and po/pr vanc will be administered. The lactate level is improving.

The patient has bradycardia in the setting of amio for SVT, but it appears sinus. The 12-lead EKG will be checked, and amio will be held today.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and management of lines (arterial line, PICC line, multi-lumen line). Prophylaxis measures include DVT prevention with SQ UF Heparin, stress ulcer prevention with PPI, and VAP prevention with HOB elevation, mouth care, and RSBI.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. The patient's post-operative course has been complicated by pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated on [**2114-2-13**].

The patient continues to be pressor-dependent, but her lactic acid levels have trended down from a peak of 4.4 to 2.6 this morning. Etiologies for sepsis include bowel ischemia/infection versus ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). No definitive culture dates are currently available. Suspicion of possible toxic megacolon versus ileus, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) negative x 1. The abdominal exam has shown improvement, with stool output. Central venous pressures (CVPs) have ranged from [**8-27**].

The plan includes:
- Continue antibiotics linezolid, aztreonam, levofloxacin, flagyl, and caspofungin.
- Follow-up cultures for C. diff, blood, urine, and sputum.
- Continue PO and PR vancomycin plus IV flagyl for possible C. diff/toxic megacolon.
- Follow with serial abdominal exams, arterial blood gases (ABGs) with lactates q4"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, admitted for ORIF and post-operative complications. She has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, toxic megacolon, bowel ischemia/infection, and possible C. diff infection. She has been intubated since February 13th and is currently on mechanical ventilation in APRV mode. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 131/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and temperature of 37.6°C. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to bowel ischemia/infection and VAP-induced sepsis. Continued antibiotic therapy is recommended.
2. ARDS/Hypoxia: The patient's ARDS is likely caused by influenza A. Oxygenation remains a concern, and she may require ongoing ventilatory support.
3. C. diff infection: Although her C. diff test was negative once, there is still suspicion of possible C. diff infection. Monitoring for symptoms and follow-up cultures are necessary.

   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
    1. Acute Resp failure
 felt to be due to progression of ARDS, stable
   vent settings over weekend with FiO2 weaned to 70% on APRV,
   parlalysedd. On lasix drip now. Will wean as tolerated. BAL cultures
   pending, gram stain unremarkable. Will switch to A/c to reduce mean
   airway pressures.
   2. ID issues - Sepsis/increased lactate in setting of fever, dilated
   colon - high concern for bowel infection, but cdiff neg x 2, ileus
   resolving. ID and general surgery's input appreciated. Likely all
   resolving ileus. Consider d/c cdiff antibiotics.
   ARDS likely due to influenza initially, currently with hypotension,
   leukocytosis on broad spectrum Abx linezolid, aztreonam, IV/PO/enema
   flagyl, levoflox.
                                                                  All
   antibiotics had been d/c'd [**2-20**] except for fluconazole. Bronch with BAL
   [**2-21**]. F/u on cultures. C diff pending.
    3. Hypotension -currently requiring low dose levophed and vasopressin.
   High mean airway pressures may be playing a role. Maintain MAP >65.
   Will try switching to A/C. Agree with lasix drip.
   Previously responsive to fluids and steroids despite negative stim. ?
   effect of PEEP.
    4. h/o cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt - head CT shows no acute
   changes
   5. Anemia
 hct fluctuates but overall stable, hct was 29 on adm, last
   unit of PRBCs on [**2114-2-14**]. No indication for transfusion.
    6. ankle fracture - ortho following, cast off.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU for ORIF surgery. She is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure due to the progression of ARDS, which is likely caused by influenza. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 70%. Her condition is stable with vent settings and she is on a lasix drip. BAL cultures are pending. The patient also has issues with sepsis and increased lactate, as well as a dilated colon, which suggests a bowel infection. C. difficile has been ruled out. She has hypotension and requires low-dose levophed and vasopressin. Her mean airway pressures are high, which may be contributing to her hypotension. She is also anemic with fluctuating HCT levels. She has a history of cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt, but no acute changes were seen on head CT. She has an ankle fracture being managed by orthopedics, and a history of fibrinolysis syndrome. She was treated with Amicar prior to surgery. She also had a non-sustained VT that was treated with amiodarone and is now in sinus rhythm. It is agreed to start total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient's ICU care includes nutrition provided through TPN, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, arterial and multi-lumen lines, and prophylaxis for DVT,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. The patient developed postoperative complications including pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated on [**2114-2-13**].

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to bowel ischemia/infection or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Cultures have not yet provided definitive results. There is suspicion of possible toxic megacolon versus ileus, with negative Clostridium difficile toxin assays. The patient's condition has improved, with stool output and improved bowel dilation on imaging studies.

The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including linezolid, aztreonam, levofloxacin, metronidazole, and caspofungin. Vancomycin is being administered both orally and rectally for potential Clostridium difficile infection. The plan is to continue these medications until the Clostridium difficile toxin B assay results are negative.

The patient's cardiovascular status has been unstable, with recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) in the setting of acidemia. She was loaded with amiodarone, which improved pH levels and prevented further episodes of NSVT. The amiodarone has been discontinued.

   paralysis & switch to APRV mode, pt has been oxygenating better.  Had
   attempted to weened to 60% and did not tolerated, failed AC trial
   overnight.  Patient has been difficult to ween from vent.  Unclear if
   there is some VAP or other insult causing continued pulmonary capillary
   leakage.
   - continue Abx Vanc PO & PR, Linezolid, Aztreonam, Levo, Flagyl,

   - fungal markers negative
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs Q2h prn
   - failed AC trial, PaO2 poor on 60%
   - will continue lasix gtt as volume overload an additional barrier to
   oxygenation.  Will continue to diurese through low pressures using
   levophed.  Goal 2L negative.
   # Transaminitits:  Sudden increase in LFTs, but normal TB and mildly
   increased LDH.  Maybe be secondary to bowel/heptic iscemia in setting
   of hypotension, although patient was not had new sudden hypotensive
   insult.  CVP should not suggest increased post-hepatic congestion.
   Patient w/o elevated TB/LDH to suggest billiary infection.
   - will get RUQ u/s to evaluate for acanulocholysistitis.
   # Rhythm: pt has recurrent NSVT in setting of acidemia, loaded with

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. The patient developed postoperative complications including pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated on February 13th and has been receiving mechanical ventilation since then.

The patient has been difficult to wean from the ventilator due to recurrent fevers, acute desaturation events, and worsening hypoxia. A chest X-ray revealed new bilateral infiltrates, leading to the restart of antibiotics. Despite being switched to Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) mode, the patient still struggles with oxygenation. It is unclear if there is a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other insult causing continued pulmonary capillary leakage.

Other significant findings include:
- C. difficile toxin assay negative three times, with Toxin B assay pending.
- Sepsis likely due to bowel ischemia/infection or VAP-induced sepsis.
- Abdominal exam showing improvement, with stool output and improvement of bowel dilation.
- The patient has a history of transaminitis, with sudden increases in liver function tests (LFTs), but normal troponin levels and mildly increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This may be secondary to bowel/hepatic ischemia in the setting of hypotension,"

   Assessment and Plan
   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   1. Acute Resp failure
 continues to have high O2 requirements, severe
   ARDS, FiO2 at 70% on APRV, parlalysed. On lasix drip now. BAL cultures
   pending, gram stain unremarkable.
   Today is ~15 days of intubation. High peeps may preclude trach
   placement but this will need to be discussed with husband.
   2. ID issues - afebrile, slightly decreased wbc. Continue
   linezolid/levoflox/aztreonam/flag/caspo.
   Question of sepsis/increased lactate in setting of fever, dilated colon
   - high concern for bowel infection, but cdiff neg x 3, b toxin pending.
   Seems to all have been an ileus, which appears to be resolving. The
   hypotension was likely due to her arrhythmia.  ID input highly
   appreciated. D/c cdiff coverage if b toxin negative.
   ARDS likely due to influenza initially, currently with hypotension,
   leukocytosis on broad spectrum Abx linezolid, aztreonam, IV/PO/enema
   flagyl,
   levoflox.
                                                          All antibiotics
   had been d/c'd [**2-20**] except for fluconazole. Bronch with BAL [**2-21**]. F/u
   on cultures. C diff b toxin pending.
   3. Hypotension -currently requiring low dose levophed and vasopressin.
   High mean airway pressures may be playing a role. Maintain MAP >65. Did
   not tolerate switch to A/C. Agree with continuing lasix drip.
   Previously responsive to fluids and steroids despite negative stim. ?
   effect of PEEP.
   4. h/o cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt - head CT shows no acute changes
   5. Anemia
 hct decreased. Hct was 29 on adm, last unit of PRBCs on
   [**2114-2-24**].
   6. ankle fracture - ortho following, cast off.
   7. h/o fibrinolysis syndrome
pt received Amicar per hem/onc recs prior
   to surgery.
   8. non-sustained VT
 treated with amio, in sinus now
   9. Transaminitis - likely med related. Doubt acalc chole with near
   normal Alk Phos and normal T bili.
   9. FEN
 agree with starting TPN

   Assessment and Plan
   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   #Sepsis: Etiologies include bowel ischemia/infection vs VAP induced
   sepsis.  No definitive culture date currently. Had suspected possible
   toxic megacolon vs ileus,  but C. diff neg x 3, B toxin pending.  Abd
   exam overall improved, having stool output and KUB shows improvement of
   bowel dilitation.  CVPs ranging from [**8-27**].
   - continue Abx linezolid, aztreonam, levofloxacin, flagyl & caspo
   - continue PO & PR Vanco + IV flagyl for possible cdiff/toxic
   megacolon, continue until c.diff toxin B back negative
   - f/u GI/[**Doctor First Name 458**] recs, no plan for OR at this time
   - repeat KUB
   - follow with serial abd exams, do not need to follow serial lactates
   - attempt to wean levophed, ok to be on pressures while aggressively
   trying to diurese with lasix drip.
   # ARDS/Hypoxia
inciting event likely influenza A causing ARDS,
   antibiotics d/c
d [**2-19**]. Pt developed recurrent fevers with acute desats
   and e/o worsening hypoxia, CXR revealed new bilateral infiltrated,
   antibiotics restarted [**2-21**].  Pt has been difficult to oxygenate, s/p
   paralysis & switch to APRV mode, pt has been oxygenating better.  Had
   attempted to weened to 60% and did not tolerated, failed AC trial
   overnight.  Patient has been difficult to ween from vent.  Unclear if
   there is some VAP or other insult causing continued pulmonary capillary
   leakage.
   - continue Abx Vanc PO & PR, Linezolid, Aztreonam, Levo, Flagyl,
   Caspofungin
   - per ID can start Tigacycline if clinically decompensates
   - f/u micro data, BAL from [**2-21**] NGTD
   - fungal markers negative
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs Q2h prn
   - failed AC trial, PaO2 poor on 60%
   - will continue lasix gtt as volume overload an additional barrier to
   oxygenation.  Will continue to diurese through low pressures using
   levophed.  Goal 2L negative.
   # Transaminitits:  Sudden increase in LFTs, but normal TB and mildly
   increased LDH.  Maybe be secondary to bowel/heptic iscemia in setting
   of hypotension, although patient was not had new sudden hypotensive
   insult.  CVP should not suggest increased post-hepatic congestion.
   Patient w/o elevated TB/LDH to suggest billiary infection.
   - will get RUQ u/s to evaluate for acanulocholysistitis.
   # Rhythm: pt has recurrent NSVT in setting of acidemia, loaded with
   Amiodarone, pH improved, and no recurrence of NSVT for last 48hrs. Pt
   currently in sinus bradycardia while on levophed.
   - amiodoarone d/c
d [**2-25**]
   - replete lytes & follow serial ABGs
   # ARF: resolving, likely prerenal etiology with low FENA. [**2-20**] Urine +
   for WBCs/yeast, changed out foley & f/u urine cx on [**2-21**] was NGTD.
   Continue broad spectrum empiric coverage. Renal function stable & UOP
   approx 50-60cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine/UOP

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, admitted for open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. She developed postoperative complications including pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated on February 13th and has been difficult to wean from the ventilator.

The patient's current condition is complicated by several issues:
1. Sepsis: Etiologies include bowel ischemia/infection vs ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) induced sepsis. No definitive culture date is currently available. The patient had suspected possible toxic megacolon vs ileus, but Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is negative on three occasions, and B toxin is pending. Abdominal examination overall improved, with stool output and kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) showing improvement of bowel dilation. Central venous pressure (CVP) readings range from 8-27 mmHg.
- Continue antibiotics linezolid, aztreonam, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.
- Continue PO and PR vancomycin plus IV metronidazole for possible C. diff/toxic megacolon until C. diff toxin B is back negative.
- Follow up with GI recommendations, no plan for OR at this time.

   Imaging: 1.  Slightly distended gallbladder with edema involving the
   anterior
   gallbladder wall.  While findings may be seen in cholecystitis, no
   gallstones
   or pericholecystic fluid is identified.  Perihepatic ascites and
   pleural
   effusions raise the possibility of the gallbladder wall edema being
   related to
   third spacing.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
   2.  Small right pleural effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   #Sepsis: Etiologies include bowel ischemia/infection vs VAP induced
   sepsis.  No definitive culture date currently. Had suspected possible
   toxic megacolon vs ileus,  but C. diff neg x 3, B toxin pending.  Abd
   exam overall improved, having stool output and KUB shows improvement of
   bowel dilitation.  CVPs ranging from [**8-27**].
   - continue Abx linezolid, aztreonam, levofloxacin, flagyl
   - continue IV flagyl for possible cdiff/toxic megacolon, continue until
   c.diff toxin B back negative at the very least
   - f/u GI/[**Doctor First Name 458**] recs, no plan for OR at this time
   - follow with serial abd exams, do not need to follow serial lactates
   - attempt to wean levophed, ok to be on pressures while aggressively
   trying to diurese with lasix drip.
   # ARDS/Hypoxia
inciting event likely influenza A causing ARDS,
   antibiotics d/c
d [**2-19**]. Pt developed recurrent fevers with acute desats
   and e/o worsening hypoxia, CXR revealed new bilateral infiltrated,
   antibiotics restarted [**2-21**].  Pt has been difficult to oxygenate, s/p
   paralysis & switch to APRV mode, pt has been oxygenating better.  Had
   attempted to weened to 60% and did not tolerated, failed AC trial
   overnight.  Patient has been difficult to ween from vent.  Unclear if
   there is some VAP or other insult causing continued pulmonary capillary
   leakage.
   - continue Abx Linezolid, Aztreonam, Levo, Flagyl
   - per ID can start Tigacycline if clinically decompensates
   - f/u micro data, BAL from [**2-21**] NGTD
   - fungal markers negative
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs Q2h prn
   - will continue lasix gtt as volume overload an additional barrier to
   oxygenation.  Will continue to diurese through low pressures using
   levophed.  Goal 2L negative daily
   - consider switching to AC and attempting stepwise wean
   - consider placing sandbags, saline bags on pt
s chest as a
   pseudo-proning maneuver
   # Transaminitits:  Sudden increase in LFTs, but normal TB and mildly
   increased LDH.  Maybe be secondary to bowel/heptic iscemia in setting
   of hypotension, although patient was not had new sudden hypotensive
   insult.  CVP should not suggest increased post-hepatic congestion.
   Patient w/o elevated TB/LDH to suggest billiary infection. Could likely
   be the effect of caspo, LFTs now trending back down off  Caspo
   - RUQ US
 showed only mild ant wall thickening of the gallbladder
   - LFTs trending back down.
   # Rhythm: pt has recurrent NSVT in setting of acidemia, loaded with
   Amiodarone, pH improved, and no recurrence of NSVT for last 48hrs. Pt
   currently in sinus bradycardia while on levophed.
   - amiodoarone d/c
d [**2-25**]
   - replete lytes & follow serial ABGs
   # ARF: resolving, likely prerenal etiology with low FENA. [**2-20**] Urine +
   for WBCs/yeast, changed out foley & f/u urine cx on [**2-21**] was NGTD.
   Continue broad spectrum empiric coverage. Renal function stable & UOP
   approx 50-60cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine/UOP
   - avoiding nephrotoxins, wean pressors if possible
   -continue lasix gtt
   # Hem/fibrinolysis syndrome
no e/o acute bleed, Hct down from 27 to 23
   after receiving last tranfsusion.  Peripheral smear neg for
   schistocytes, fibrinogen >500, INR 1.7 & D-dimer elevated
   - follow daily coags & DIC labs
   - transfuse 1upRBCs for hct <25, will check PM hct
   - TPN
    -guaiac all stools
   # ankle fracture - hard cast d/c'd on [**2-23**], sutures C/D/I.  No plan for

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a complex medical history. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for an ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) procedure and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications.

1. The patient has a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected sepsis of unknown etiology. Cultures have not yet returned, and the patient is being treated empirically.

2. The patient developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following intubation on [**2114-2-13**]. She is currently on mechanical ventilation in APRV mode, which is helping to oxygenate her better. The cause of ARDS is suspected to be influenza A.

3. The patient's abdominal examination has shown improvement, with stool output and a decrease in bowel dilation. Clostridium difficile toxin B has been negative three times, and there is suspicion of toxic megacolon versus ileus. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

4. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have suddenly increased, but they are now trending back down. A recent RUQ ultrasound showed mild anterior wall thickening of the gallbladder, which may be secondary to third spacing or gallbladder wall edema.

5. The patient has recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NS"

   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   #Sepsis: Etiologies include bowel ischemia/infection vs VAP induced
   sepsis.  No definitive culture date currently. Had suspected possible
   toxic megacolon vs ileus,  but C. diff neg x 3, B toxin pending.  Abd
   exam overall improved, having stool output and KUB shows improvement of
   bowel dilitation.  CVPs ranging from [**8-27**].
   - continue Abx linezolid, aztreonam, levofloxacin, flagyl
   - continue IV flagyl for possible cdiff/toxic megacolon, continue until
   c.diff toxin B back negative at the very least
   - f/u GI/[**Doctor First Name 458**] recs, no plan for OR at this time
   - follow with serial abd exams, do not need to follow serial lactates
   - attempt to wean levophed, ok to be on pressures while aggressively
   trying to diurese with lasix drip.
   # ARDS/Hypoxia
inciting event likely influenza A causing ARDS,
   antibiotics d/c
d [**2-19**]. Pt developed recurrent fevers with acute desats
   and e/o worsening hypoxia, CXR revealed new bilateral infiltrated,
   antibiotics restarted [**2-21**].  Pt has been difficult to oxygenate, s/p
   paralysis & switch to APRV mode, pt has been oxygenating better.  Had
   attempted to weened to 60% and did not tolerated, failed AC trial
   overnight.  Patient has been difficult to ween from vent.  Unclear if
   there is some VAP or other insult causing continued pulmonary capillary
   leakage.
   - continue Abx Linezolid, Aztreonam, Levo, Flagyl
   - per ID can start Tigacycline if clinically decompensates
   - f/u micro data, BAL from [**2-21**] NGTD
   - fungal markers negative
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs Q2h prn
   - will continue lasix gtt as volume overload an additional barrier to
   oxygenation.  Will continue to diurese through low pressures using
   levophed.  Goal 2L negative daily
   - consider switching to AC and attempting stepwise wean
   - consider placing sandbags, saline bags on pt
s chest as a
   pseudo-proning maneuver
   # Transaminitits:  Sudden increase in LFTs, but normal TB and mildly
   increased LDH.  Maybe be secondary to bowel/heptic iscemia in setting
   of hypotension, although patient was not had new sudden hypotensive
   insult.  CVP should not suggest increased post-hepatic congestion.
   Patient w/o elevated TB/LDH to suggest billiary infection.
   - will get RUQ u/s to evaluate for acanulocholysistitis.
   # Rhythm: pt has recurrent NSVT in setting of acidemia, loaded with
   Amiodarone, pH improved, and no recurrence of NSVT for last 48hrs. Pt
   currently in sinus bradycardia while on levophed.
   - amiodoarone d/c
d [**2-25**]
   - replete lytes & follow serial ABGs
   # ARF: resolving, likely prerenal etiology with low FENA. [**2-20**] Urine +
   for WBCs/yeast, changed out foley & f/u urine cx on [**2-21**] was NGTD.
   Continue broad spectrum empiric coverage. Renal function stable & UOP
   approx 50-60cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine/UOP
   - avoiding nephrotoxins, wean pressors if possible
   -continue lasix gtt
   # Hem/fibrinolysis syndrome
no e/o acute bleed, Hct down from 27 to 23
   after receiving last tranfsusion.  Peripheral smear neg for
   schistocytes, fibrinogen >500, INR 1.7 & D-dimer elevated
   - continue Vitamin K replacement
   - follow daily coags & DIC labs
   - transfuse 1upRBCs for hct <25, will check PM hct
   - TPN
    -guaic all stools
   # ankle fracture - hard cast d/c'd on [**2-23**], sutures C/D/I.  No plan for
   revision until medically stabilized

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who was admitted for open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. Post-operatively, she developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also had suspected toxic megacolon versus ileus, but Clostridium difficile (C. diff) was negative on three occasions. The abdominal examination showed improvement, with stool output and improvement in bowel distension. Central venous pressure (CVP) readings ranged from 8-27 mmHg.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. ARDS/Hypoxia: The patient developed recurrent fevers with acute desaturation and evidence of worsening hypoxia. Chest X-ray revealed new bilateral infiltrates, and antibiotics were restarted. The patient has been difficult to oxygenate, and there is uncertainty about whether there is some ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other insult causing continued pulmonary capillary leakage.

2. Transaminitis: There is a sudden increase in liver function tests (LFTs), but with normal total bilirubin (TB) and mildly increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This may be secondary to bowel/hepatic ischemia in the setting of hypotension, although the patient did not have a new sudden hypotensive insult. The CVP should"

   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   1. Acute Resp failure with severe ARDS
 continues to have high O2
   requirements, FiO2 at 90% on APRV, well-sedated. On lasix drip with
   good u/o. BAL cultures negative, gram stain unremarkable.
   Today is 15 days post intubation. High peeps may preclude trach
   placement but this will need to be discussed with husband. Advanced
   directive was documented but husband has reversed that temporarily.
   2. ID issues - afebrile, slightly decreased wbc. Continue
   linezolid/levoflox/aztreonam/flag. Caspo d/c'd.
   Question of sepsis/increased lactate in setting of fever, dilated colon
   - high concern for bowel infection, but cdiff neg x 3, b toxin pending.
   Seems to all have been an ileus, which appears to be resolving. The
   hypotension was likely due to her arrhythmia which resolved on
   amiodarone drip.  ID input highly appreciated. D/c cdiff coverage if b
   toxin negative.
   ARDS likely due to influenza initially, currently with hypotension,
   leukocytosis on broad spectrum
   Abx.
                                                     All antibiotics had
   been d/c'd [**2-20**] except for fluconazole. Bronch with BAL [**2-21**]. F/u on
   cultures. C diff b toxin pending.
   3. Hypotension -currently requiring vasopressin +/- low dose lovephed.
   High mean airway pressures may be playing a role. Maintain MAP >65. Did
   not tolerate switch to A/C. Agree with continuing lasix drip.
   Previously responsive to fluids and steroids despite negative stim. ?
   effect of PEEP.
   4. h/o cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt - head CT shows no acute changes
   5. Anemia
 hct decreased but stable. Hct was 29 on adm, last unit of
   PRBCs on [**2114-2-24**].
   6. ankle fracture - ortho following, cast off.
   7. h/o fibrinolysis syndrome
pt received Amicar per hem/onc recs prior
   to surgery.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. She developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after intubation on February 13th. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with APRV mode, requiring 90% FiO2. She has been sedated and unresponsive. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 130/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg. The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including linezolid, levofloxacin, aztreonam, and vancomycin. Cultures have been negative, and c. difficile testing has been negative three times, with b toxin pending. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and anemia. She also has a history of cerebral aneurysm with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, which shows no acute changes on head CT. The patient has ankle fracture treated with orthopedic follow-up, and a history of fibrinolysis syndrome. She is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. She has a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome and is currently in the ICU due to pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following intubation on February 13th.

The patient's medical conditions include sepsis with multiple etiologies including bowel ischemia/infection versus ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), transaminitis, rhythm disturbances such as nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) resolved with amiodarone, acute renal failure (ARF) likely pre-renal in origin, and a hemostatic disorder with evidence of fibrinolysis.

The patient's current treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, diuresis with furosemide (Lasix) for volume overload, weaning off vasoactive medications like norepinephrine, and attempting to extubate the patient. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening ARDS, VAP, sepsis, renal failure, and coagulopathy."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who was admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation of an ankle fracture. She developed postoperative complications including pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated on 2/13/2114 and has been in the ICU since then. She has been difficult to wean from the ventilator and has experienced recurrent fevers, acute desaturations, and worsening hypoxia. The patient's condition is complicated by hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, sepsis of uncertain etiology, transaminitis, rhythm disturbances, acute kidney injury, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, but the exact etiology is unclear. It could be due to bowel ischemia/infection or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. ARDS: The patient developed ARDS after surgery, which is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. This condition can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Hyperfibrinolysis Syndrome: The patient has a condition called hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, which involves excessive breakdown of blood clots. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating a potential liver injury. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

   Assessment and Plan
   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   1. Acute Resp failure with severe ARDS
 continues to have high O2
   requirements, FiO2 at 70% on APRV, well-sedated. On lasix drip with
   good u/o. BAL cultures negative, gram stain unremarkable.
   Today, will trial reducing peep high and FiO2. If tolerated, will try
   switching vent and placing esoph balloon.
   Today is 16 days post intubation. High peeps may preclude trach
   placement but this will need to be discussed with husband. Advanced
   directive was documented but husband has reversed that
   temporarily.
    2. ID issues - new fever, leukocytosis no change. Continue
   linezolid/levoflox/flag. Aztreonam d/c'd [**2-28**], caspo d/c'd [**2-27**].
   Cultures 3/20 pending.
   Previous hx: question of sepsis/increased lactate in setting of fever,
   dilated colon - there was a high concern for bowel infection, but cdiff
   neg x 3, b toxin pending. Seems to all have been an ileus, which
   appears to be resolving. The hypotension was likely due to her
   arrhythmia which resolved on amiodarone drip.  ID input highly
   appreciated. D/c cdiff coverage if b toxin negative.
   ARDS likely due to influenza initially, currently with hypotension,
   leukocytosis on broad spectrum
   Abx.
                                                     All antibiotics had
   been d/c'd [**2-20**] except for fluconazole. Bronch with BAL [**2-21**]. F/u on
   cultures. C diff b toxin pending.
   3. Hypotension - currently requiring vasopressin, off lovephed. High
   mean airway pressures may be playing a role. Maintain MAP >65. Did not
   tolerate switch to A/C. Agree with continuing lasix drip. Previously
   responsive to fluids and steroids despite negative stim. ? effect of
   PEEP.
   4. h/o cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt - head CT shows no acute changes
   5. Anemia
 hct decreased but stable. Hct was 29 on adm, last unit of
   PRBCs on [**2114-2-24**].
   6. ankle fracture - ortho following, cast off.
   7. h/o fibrinolysis syndrome
pt received Amicar per hem/onc recs prior
   to surgery.
   8. non-sustained VT
 treated with amio, in sinus now
   9. Transaminitis - likely med related, resolving off caspo. RUQ
   ultrasound showed just mild GB wall thickening
   10. FEN - on TPN

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. She developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after intubation on February 13th. She continues to require high oxygen supplementation, currently at 70% FiO2 on assisted pressure-controlled ventilation (APRV). She is well-sedated and receiving lasix drip with good urine output. BAL cultures were negative, and gram stain unremarkable.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure with severe ARDS: The patient continues to have high oxygen requirements and is being ventilated with APRV at 70% FiO2. The plan is to trial reducing PEEP high and FiO2. If tolerated, the vent will be switched, and an esophageal balloon will be placed.
2. Infectious Disease (ID) Issues: The patient has a new fever and leukocytosis but no change. She is being continued on linezolid, levofloxacin, and flagyl. Aztreonam was discontinued on February 28th, and caspofungin was discontinued on February 27th. Cultures from February 20th are pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. She developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after intubation on February 13th. She has had multiple episodes of sepsis, with suspected etiologies including bowel ischemia/infection versus ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has been difficult to wean from the ventilator, and there is uncertainty about the cause of continued pulmonary capillary leakage. She also has transaminitis, resolving acute kidney injury (ARF), and a rhythm disturbance known as nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). Her hemoglobin levels are low, indicating ongoing bleeding or hemolysis. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and she remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has had multiple episodes of sepsis, which can be life-threatening if not promptly and effectively treated.
2. ARDS: The patient developed ARDS, a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
3. VAP: The patient's respiratory distress and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of VAP, which can worsen her lung function and increase the risk of mortality.

","The patient is a 52-year-old female admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture, post-operative course complicated by pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to suspected influenza A infection. She has been intubated since February 13th.

The patient's current condition includes hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, sepsis with etiologies including bowel ischemia/infection versus ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and transaminitis. She also has a history of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) but has been stable on amiodarone. Additionally, the patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) that is resolving, likely pre-renal in etiology.

Assessment and plan:
1. Continue levofloxacin, flagyl; discontinue aztreonam and linezolid.
2. Continue IV flagyl for possible Clostridium difficile (C. diff) / toxic megacolon, continue until C. diff toxin B is back negative at the very least.
3. Follow with serial abdominal exams, do not need to follow serial lactates.
4. Attempt to wean levophed, okay to be on pressures while aggressively trying to diurese with lasix drip.
5. ARDS/Hypoxia: Inciting event likely influenza A causing ARDS, antibiotics discontinued on February 19th."

   Assessment and Plan
   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   1. Acute Resp failure with severe ARDS
 continues to have high O2
   requirements, FiO2 at 70% on APRV, transpulmonary pressure ~ 2 cmH2O
   via esoph balloon.
   On lasix drip with good u/o. Need to aim for 1-2 liters negative.
   BAL cultures negative, gram stain unremarkable. Today is 17 days post
   intubation.
   Did not tolerate switch to A/C but only brief
   trial.
    2. ID issues - low grade fever, leukocytosis stable. Will d/c
   linezolid today. Continue levoflox/flag. Aztreonam d/c'd [**2-28**], caspo
   d/c'd [**2-27**].
   Previous hx: question of sepsis/increased lactate in setting of fever,
   dilated colon - there was a high concern for bowel infection, but cdiff
   neg x 3, b toxin pending. Seems to all have been an ileus, which
   appears to be resolving. The hypotension was likely due to her
   arrhythmia which resolved on amiodarone drip.  ID input highly
   appreciated. D/c cdiff coverage if b toxin negative.
   ARDS likely due to influenza initially, currently with hypotension,
   leukocytosis on broad spectrum
   Abx.
                                                     All antibiotics had
   been d/c'd [**2-20**] except for fluconazole. Bronch with BAL [**2-21**]. F/u on
   cultures. C diff b toxin pending.
   3. Hypotension - currently requiring vasopressin, on/off low dose
   lovephed.
   Maintain MAP >65. Agree with continuing lasix drip. Previously
   responsive to fluids and steroids despite negative stim. ? effect of
   PEEP.
   4. h/o cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt - head CT shows no acute changes
   5. Anemia
 hct decreased but stable. Hct was 29 on adm, last unit of
   PRBCs on [**2114-2-24**].
   6. ankle fracture - ortho following, cast off.
   7. h/o fibrinolysis syndrome
pt received Amicar per hem/onc recs prior
   to surgery.
   8. Sedation - switch to propofol from high dose versed 20/fentanyl 500
   9. DNR - advanced directive was documented but husband has reversed
   this temporarily, to be reassessed within one week unless she shows
   significant regression. Should she have siginificant improvement by
   middle of next week, husband will consider trach. Otherwise, he will
   likely withdraw care.

   Assessment and Plan
   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   # ARDS/Hypoxia
inciting event likely influenza A causing ARDS,
   antibiotics d/c
d [**2-19**]. Pt developed recurrent fevers with acute desats
   and e/o worsening hypoxia, CXR revealed new bilateral infiltrated,
   antibiotics restarted [**2-21**].  Pt has been difficult to oxygenate, s/p
   paralysis & switch to APRV mode, pt has been oxygenating better.  Had
   attempted to weened to 60% and did not tolerated, failed AC trial.
   Patient has been difficult to ween from vent.  Unclear if there is some
   VAP or other insult causing continued pulmonary capillary leakage.
   Continues to show frequent dysinchonry from vent.  Have switched from
   APRV to PCV w/ improved ventialtion, continued poor oxygenation.
   - consider esophogeal balloon.
   - continue  Levo, Flagyl, d/c Linezolid
   - f/u micro data, BAL from [**2-21**] NGTD
   - fungal markers negative
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs Q2h prn
   - will continue lasix gtt as volume overload an additional barrier to
   oxygenation.  Will continue to diurese through low pressures using
   levophed.  Goal 2L negative daily
   - switched from fent/midaz to propofol, which will hopefully sedate
   better and require less volumes infused.  Still transitioning
   #Sepsis: Etiologies include bowel ischemia/infection vs VAP induced
   sepsis.  No definitive culture date currently. Had suspected possible
   toxic megacolon vs ileus,  but C. diff neg x 3, B toxin pending.  Abd
   exam overall improved, having stool output and KUB shows improvement of
   bowel dilitation.  CVPs ranging from [**8-27**].
   - now growing yeast in sputum and urine, will consider starting
   fluconazole and draw fungal blood cultures and change foley.
   - continue levofloxacin, flagyl: d/c
d aztreonam , d/c linezolid today
   - continue IV flagyl for possible cdiff/toxic megacolon, continue until
   c.diff toxin B back negative at the very least
   - follow with serial abd exams, do not need to follow serial lactates
   - attempt to wean levophed, ok to be on pressures while aggressively
   trying to diurese with lasix drip.
   # Transaminitits:  Sudden increase in LFTs, but normal TB and mildly
   increased LDH.  Maybe be secondary to bowel/heptic iscemia in setting
   of hypotension, although patient was not had new sudden hypotensive
   insult.  CVP should not suggest increased post-hepatic congestion.
   Patient w/o elevated TB/LDH to suggest billiary infection. Could likely
   be the effect of caspo, LFTs now trending back down off  Caspo
   - RUQ US
 showed only mild ant wall thickening of the gallbladder
   - LFTs trending back down, with exception of LDH, will continue to
   trend
   # Rhythm: pt has recurrent NSVT in setting of acidemia, loaded with
   Amiodarone, pH improved, and no recurrence of NSVT for last 48hrs. Pt
   currently in sinus bradycardia while on levophed.
   - amiodoarone d/c
d [**2-25**]
   - replete lytes & follow serial ABGs
   - if continues to have runs of vtach, consider restarting amio
   # ARF: resolving, likely prerenal etiology with low FENA. [**2-20**] Urine +
   for WBCs/yeast, changed out foley & f/u urine cx on [**2-21**] was NGTD.
   Continue broad spectrum empiric coverage. Renal function stable & UOP
   approx 50-60cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine/UOP
   - avoiding nephrotoxins, wean pressors if possible
   - continue lasix gtt
   # Hem/fibrinolysis syndrome
no e/o acute bleed, Hct down from 27 to 23
   after receiving last tranfsusion.  Peripheral smear neg for
   schistocytes, fibrinogen >500, INR 1.7 & D-dimer elevated
   - follow daily coags & DIC labs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and a history of aneurysm. The patient's current condition includes septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ dysfunction. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation in pressure control mode with PEEP set at 20 cmH2O, FiO2 at 70%, and RR set at 25 breaths per minute. Norepinephrine and vasopressin infusions are being used to maintain blood pressure. Propofol is being used for sedation. Lasix infusion is being given to manage fluid balance. The patient has a central venous catheter, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk due to being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures will be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin are being implemented.
3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines/catheters increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including bloodstream infections."

   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   # ARDS/Hypoxia
inciting event likely influenza A causing ARDS,
   antibiotics d/c
d [**2-19**]. Pt developed recurrent fevers with acute desats
   and e/o worsening hypoxia, CXR revealed new bilateral infiltrated,
   antibiotics restarted [**2-21**].  Pt has been difficult to oxygenate, s/p
   paralysis & switch to APRV mode, pt has been oxygenating better.  Had
   attempted to weened to 60% and did not tolerated, failed AC trial.
   Patient has been difficult to ween from vent.  Unclear if there is some
   VAP or other insult causing continued pulmonary capillary leakage.
   Continues to show frequent dysinchonry from vent.  Have switched from
   APRV to PCV w/ improved ventialtion, continued poor oxygenation.
   - optimize PEEP with esophogeal balloon
   - optimize ventilation with improved sedation.
   -- switched from fent/midaz to propofol w/ slow transition in order to
   facilitate possible extubation if window presents itself.
   - continue  Levo, Flagyl, d/c Linezolid
   - f/u micro data, BAL from [**2-21**] NGTD
   - fungal markers negative
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs Q2h prn
   - will continue lasix gtt as volume overload an additional barrier to
   oxygenation.  Will continue to diurese through low pressures using
   levophed.  Goal 2L negative daily
   #Sepsis: Etiologies include bowel ischemia/infection vs VAP induced
   sepsis.  No definitive culture date currently. Had suspected possible
   toxic megacolon vs ileus,  but C. diff neg x 3, B toxin pending.  Abd
   exam overall improved, having stool output and KUB shows improvement of
   bowel dilitation.  CVPs ranging from [**8-27**].
   - now growing yeast in sputum and urine, will change foley and consider
   starting fluconazole if repeat UCx +.
   - continue levofloxacin, flagyl: d/c
d aztreonam , d/c linezolid today
   - continue IV flagyl for possible cdiff/toxic megacolon, continue until
   c.diff toxin B back negative at the very least
   - follow with serial abd exams, do not need to follow serial lactates
   - attempt to wean levophed, ok to be on pressures while aggressively
   trying to diurese with lasix drip.
   # Transaminitits:  Sudden increase in LFTs, but normal TB and mildly
   increased LDH.  Maybe be secondary to bowel/heptic iscemia in setting
   of hypotension, although patient was not had new sudden hypotensive
   insult.  CVP should not suggest increased post-hepatic congestion.
   Patient w/o elevated TB/LDH to suggest billiary infection. Could likely
   be the effect of caspo, LFTs now trending back down off  Caspo
   - RUQ US
 showed only mild ant wall thickening of the gallbladder
   - LFTs trending back down, with exception of LDH, will continue to
   trend
   # Rhythm: pt has recurrent NSVT in setting of acidemia, loaded with
   Amiodarone, pH improved, and no recurrence of NSVT for last 48hrs. Pt
   currently in sinus bradycardia while on levophed.
   - amiodoarone d/c
d [**2-25**]
   - replete lytes & follow serial ABGs
   - if continues to have runs of vtach, consider restarting amio
   # ARF: resolving, likely prerenal etiology with low FENA. [**2-20**] Urine +
   for WBCs/yeast, changed out foley & f/u urine cx on [**2-21**] was NGTD.
   Continue broad spectrum empiric coverage. Renal function stable & UOP
   approx 50-60cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine/UOP
   - avoiding nephrotoxins, wean pressors if possible
   - continue lasix gtt
   # Hem/fibrinolysis syndrome
no e/o acute bleed, Hct down from 27 to 23
   after receiving last tranfsusion.  Peripheral smear neg for
   schistocytes, fibrinogen >500, INR 1.7 & D-dimer elevated
   - follow daily coags & DIC labs
   - transfuse 1upRBCs for hct <25, will check PM hct

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who was admitted for ORIF (operative repair of a fracture) and subsequently developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) following intubation on February 13th.

The patient has been difficult to oxygenate and has required various ventilator modes, including APRV (airway pressure release ventilation) and PCV (pressure control ventilation), with improved ventilation. She has also been switched from propofol to midazolam for sedation.

The patient has shown frequent dysinchony from the vent (ventilator) and has had recurrent fevers with acute desats (desaturation events) and worsening hypoxia. Her chest X-ray has revealed new bilateral infiltrates, indicating possible pneumonia or worsening ARDS.

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies have shown improvement in colonic distension, but there are new diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications on chest X-ray.

The patient's medical team is considering the possibility of sepsis, with potential etiologies including bowel ischemia/infection versus ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There are no definitive culture dates currently, but there is growth of yeast in sputum and urine. Antibiotics have been adjusted accordingly.

The patient's condition is complex and requires careful monitoring and management. Potential"

   Previous hx: question of sepsis/increased lactate in setting of fever,
   dilated colon - there was a high concern for bowel infection, but cdiff
   neg x 3, b toxin pending. Seems to all have been an ileus, which
   appears to be resolving. The hypotension was likely due to her
   arrhythmia which resolved on amiodarone drip.  ID input highly
   appreciated. D/c cdiff coverage if b toxin negative.
   ARDS likely due to influenza initially, currently with hypotension,
   leukocytosis on broad spectrum

   Aztreonam d/c'd [**2-28**], caspo d/c'd [**2-27**]. Linezolid d/c'd [**3-2**].
   3. Hypotension - currently requiring vasopressin, on/off low dose
   lovephed.
   Maintain MAP >65. Agree with continuing lasix drip. Previously
   responsive to fluids and steroids despite negative stim. ? effect of
   PEEP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female admitted to the ICU for ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) surgery. She has been experiencing pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) since her intubation on [**2114-2-13**]. The patient continues to require high levels of oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Her condition has not improved significantly despite various interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure with severe ARDS: The patient continues to have high O2/PEEP requirements and is on PCV (pressure-controlled ventilation) with FiO2 at 70%. There is a concern for worsening respiratory distress.
2. ID (infection) issues: The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including levofloxacin and flagyl. There were previous concerns about sepsis and increased lactate levels. Further evaluation is needed to rule out any infections.
3. Hypotension: The patient is currently requiring vasopressin and low-dose norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. Fluid resuscitation and steroids have been previously used but were not effective.
4. h/o cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt: A head CT has been performed, showing no acute changes.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct)"

   Assessment and Plan
   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   # ARDS/Hypoxia
inciting event likely influenza A causing ARDS,
   antibiotics d/c
d [**2-19**]. Pt developed recurrent fevers with acute desats
   and e/o worsening hypoxia, CXR revealed new bilateral infiltrated,
   antibiotics restarted [**2-21**].  Pt has been difficult to oxygenate, s/p
   paralysis & switch to APRV mode, pt has been oxygenating better.  Had
   attempted to weened to 60% and did not tolerated, failed AC trial.
   Patient has been difficult to ween from vent.  Unclear if there is some
   VAP or other insult causing continued pulmonary capillary leakage.
   Continues to show frequent dysinchonry from vent.  Have switched from
   APRV to PCV w/ improved ventialtion, continued poor oxygenation.
   - optimize PEEP with esophogeal balloon
   - optimize ventilation with improved sedation.
   -- switched from fent/midaz to propofol w/ slow transition in order to
   facilitate possible extubation if window presents itself.
   - continue  Levo, Flagyl, d/c Linezolid
   - f/u micro data, BAL from [**2-21**] NGTD
   - fungal markers negative
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs Q2h prn
   - will continue lasix gtt as volume overload an additional barrier to
   oxygenation.  Will continue to diurese through low pressures using
   levophed.  Goal 2L negative daily
   #Sepsis: Etiologies include bowel ischemia/infection vs VAP induced
   sepsis.  No definitive culture date currently. Had suspected possible
   toxic megacolon vs ileus,  but C. diff neg x 3, B toxin pending.  Abd
   exam overall improved, having stool output and KUB shows improvement of
   bowel dilitation.  CVPs ranging from [**8-27**].
   - now growing yeast in sputum and urine, will change foley and consider
   starting fluconazole if repeat UCx +.
   - continue levofloxacin, flagyl: d/c
d aztreonam , d/c linezolid today
   - continue IV flagyl for possible cdiff/toxic megacolon, continue until
   c.diff toxin B back negative at the very least
   - follow with serial abd exams, do not need to follow serial lactates
   - attempt to wean levophed, ok to be on pressures while aggressively
   trying to diurese with lasix drip.
   # Transaminitits:  Sudden increase in LFTs, but normal TB and mildly
   increased LDH.  Maybe be secondary to bowel/heptic iscemia in setting
   of hypotension, although patient was not had new sudden hypotensive
   insult.  CVP should not suggest increased post-hepatic congestion.
   Patient w/o elevated TB/LDH to suggest billiary infection. Could likely
   be the effect of caspo, LFTs now trending back down off  Caspo
   - RUQ US
 showed only mild ant wall thickening of the gallbladder
   - LFTs trending back down, with exception of LDH, will continue to
   trend
   # Rhythm: pt has recurrent NSVT in setting of acidemia, loaded with
   Amiodarone, pH improved, and no recurrence of NSVT for last 48hrs. Pt
   currently in sinus bradycardia while on levophed.
   - amiodoarone d/c
d [**2-25**]
   - replete lytes & follow serial ABGs
   - if continues to have runs of vtach, consider restarting amio
   # ARF: resolving, likely prerenal etiology with low FENA. [**2-20**] Urine +
   for WBCs/yeast, changed out foley & f/u urine cx on [**2-21**] was NGTD.
   Continue broad spectrum empiric coverage. Renal function stable & UOP
   approx 50-60cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine/UOP
   - avoiding nephrotoxins, wean pressors if possible
   - continue lasix gtt
   # Hem/fibrinolysis syndrome
no e/o acute bleed, Hct down from 27 to 23
   after receiving last tranfsusion.  Peripheral smear neg for
   schistocytes, fibrinogen >500, INR 1.7 & D-dimer elevated
   - follow daily coags & DIC labs
   - transfuse 1upRBCs for hct <25, will check PM hct
   -guaiac all stools
   # ankle fracture - hard cast d/c'd on [**2-23**], sutures C/D/I.  No plan for
   revision until medically stabilized
   - Fentanyl for pain control

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who was admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. She developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following intubation on February 13th. The patient has been difficult to oxygenate, and multiple attempts to wean her off the ventilator have been unsuccessful. 

The patient has recurrent fevers with acute desats and evidence of worsening hypoxia. A chest X-ray revealed new bilateral infiltrates, and antibiotics were restarted on February 21st. She has been on paralysis and switched to assist-control ventilation (ACV) mode, which has improved her oxygenation. However, she continues to show frequent dyssynchrony from the ventilator, and there are concerns about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other insults causing continued pulmonary capillary leakage.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and elevated liver enzymes. There is also evidence of yeast growth in the sputum and urine, and she is being started on fluconazole. The patient's kidney function is improving, but there are concerns about acute kidney injury (AKI). Her coagulation profile indicates a possible hemostasis disorder, with elevated D-dimer levels.

The patient has a history of sepsis, likely secondary to bowel ischemia/in"

   Assessment and Plan
   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   # ARDS/Hypoxia
inciting event likely influenza A causing ARDS,
   antibiotics d/c
d [**2-19**]. Pt developed recurrent fevers with acute desats
   and e/o worsening hypoxia, CXR revealed new bilateral infiltrated,
   antibiotics restarted [**2-21**].  Pt has been difficult to oxygenate, s/p
   paralysis & switch to APRV mode, pt has been oxygenating better.  Had
   attempted to weened to 60% and did not tolerated, failed AC trial.
   Patient has been difficult to ween from vent.  Unclear if there is some
   VAP or other insult causing continued pulmonary capillary leakage.
   Continues to show frequent dysinchonry from vent.  Have switched from
   APRV to PCV w/ improved ventilation.  This am pCO2 very high, will
   decrease Peep.
   - optimize ventilation with improved sedation
 d/c versed, wean
   fentanyl, increase propofol
   -- switched from fent/midaz to propofol w/ slow transition in order to
   facilitate possible extubation if window presents itself, in addition
   to, high fentanyl requirements to achieve suboptimal sedation
   - continue  Levo, Flagyl
   - f/u micro data, BAL from [**2-21**] NGTD
   - fungal markers negative
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs Q2h prn
   - will continue lasix gtt as volume overload an additional barrier to
   oxygenation.  Will continue to diurese through low pressures using
   levophed.  Goal 2L negative daily
   #Sepsis: Etiologies include bowel ischemia/infection vs VAP induced
   sepsis.  No definitive culture date currently. Had suspected possible
   toxic megacolon vs ileus,  but C. diff neg x 3, B toxin pending.  Abd
   exam overall improved, having stool output and KUB shows improvement of
   bowel dilitation.  CVPs ranging from [**8-27**].
   - now growing yeast in sputum and urine, will change foley and consider
   starting fluconazole if repeat UCx +.
   - continue levofloxacin, flagyl
   - continue IV flagyl for possible cdiff/toxic megacolon, continue until
   c.diff toxin B back negative at the very least
   - follow with serial abd exams, do not need to follow serial lactates
   - attempt to wean levophed, ok to be on pressures while aggressively
   trying to diurese with lasix drip.
   # Metabolic Alkalosis
 likely contraction alkalosis [**1-13**] to aggressive
   diuresis
   - acetazolamide x1
   - re-check ABG
   - pm bicarb
   # Transaminitits:  Sudden increase in LFTs, but normal TB and mildly
   increased LDH.  Maybe be secondary to bowel/heptic iscemia in setting
   of hypotension, although patient was not had new sudden hypotensive
   insult.  CVP should not suggest increased post-hepatic congestion.
   Patient w/o elevated TB/LDH to suggest billiary infection. Could likely
   be the effect of caspo, LFTs now trending back down off  Caspo
   - RUQ US
 showed only mild ant wall thickening of the gallbladder
   - LFTs trending back down, including LDH, will continue to trend
   # Rhythm: pt has recurrent NSVT in setting of acidemia, loaded with
   Amiodarone, pH improved, and no recurrence of NSVT for last 48hrs. Pt
   currently in sinus bradycardia while on levophed.
   - amiodoarone d/c
d [**2-25**]
   - replete lytes & follow serial ABGs
   - if continues to have runs of vtach, consider restarting amio
   # ARF: resolving, likely prerenal etiology with low FENA. [**2-20**] Urine +
   for WBCs/yeast, changed out foley & f/u urine cx on [**2-21**] was NGTD.
   Continue broad spectrum empiric coverage. Renal function stable & UOP
   approx 50-60cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine/UOP
   - avoiding nephrotoxins, wean pressors if possible
   - continue lasix gtt
   # Hem/fibrinolysis syndrome
no e/o acute bleed, Hct down from 27 to 23
   after receiving last tranfsusion.  Peripheral smear neg for
   schistocytes, fibrinogen >500, INR 1.7 & D-dimer elevated.
   - transfuse 1upRBCs for hct <25, will check PM hct
   -guaiac all stools
   # ankle fracture - hard cast d/c'd on [**2-23**], sutures C/D/I.  No plan for
   revision until medically stabilized
   - Fentanyl for pain control

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. She developed postoperative complications including pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza A infection. The patient was intubated on [**2114-2-13**] and has been difficult to wean from the ventilator due to recurrent fevers with acute desaturations, new bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, and frequent dysynchrony from the ventilator. 

The patient has been on aggressive diuresis with Lasix, but continues to show signs of fluid overload. She has been on multiple pressors including norepinephrine and vasopressin, and her blood cultures have grown yeast in both the sputum and urine. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated lactate, and elevated D-dimer levels. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal with elevated liver enzymes and mildly increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Her renal function is resolving with prerenal etiology and low fractional excretion of sodium (FENa). 

The patient's cardiac rhythm has been abnormal with recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) but has been successfully managed with amiodarone. Her coag"

   Assessment and Plan
   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   1. Acute Resp failure with severe ARDS
 continues to have high O2/Peep
   requirements, FiO2 at 70% on PCV 20/peep 22.
   Had excellent diuresis yesterday. Current gas shows compensated met
   acidosis with serum HCO3 38 likely due to contraction + resp acid.
   Will give dose of acetazolamide. Reduce peep to 20 with the goal of
   increasing tidal volumes (effectively reducing FRC).
   Transpulmonary pressure ~30 on insp hold, 5 on exp hold via esoph
   balloon.
   On lasix drip with good u/o. Will aim for additional 1-2 liters
   negative.
   BAL cultures negative, gram stain unremarkable. Today is 19 days post
   intubation.
   2. ID issues - afeb, no leukocytosis. Continue levoflox day 9/flag 11.
   Previous hx: question of sepsis/increased lactate in setting of fever,
   dilated colon - there was a high concern for bowel infection, but cdiff
   neg x 3, b toxin pending. Seems to all have been an ileus, which
   appears to be resolving. The hypotension was likely due to her
   arrhythmia which resolved on amiodarone drip.  ID input highly
   appreciated. D/c cdiff coverage if b toxin negative.
   ARDS likely due to influenza initially, currently with hypotension,
   leukocytosis on broad spectrum
   Abx.
                                                     All antibiotics had
   been d/c'd [**2-20**] except for fluconazole. Bronch with BAL [**2-21**]. F/u on
   cultures. C diff b toxin pending.
   Aztreonam d/c'd [**2-28**], caspo d/c'd [**2-27**]. Linezolid d/c'd [**3-2**].
   3. Hypotension - currently requiring vasopressin, on/off low dose
   lovephed.
   Maintain MAP >65. On lasix drip but reduced diuresis goals.
   4. h/o cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt - head CT shows no acute changes
   5. Anemia
 hct decreased but stable. Hct was 29 on adm, last unit of
   PRBCs on [**2114-2-24**].
   6. ankle fracture - ortho following, cast off.
   7. h/o fibrinolysis syndrome
pt received Amicar per hem/onc recs prior
   to surgery.
   8. Sedation -  propofol started, versed 4/fentanyl 300
   9. DNR - advanced directive was documented but husband has reversed
   this temporarily, to be reassessed within one week unless she shows
   significant regression. Should she have siginificant improvement by

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post-operative course complicated by pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS.
- She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with high O2/PEEP requirements.
- The patient has shown excellent diuresis, but still has a high FiO2 requirement.
- She has a positive DNR advanced directive, which has been temporarily reversed by the husband.
- The patient has multiple medical complications including acute respiratory failure with severe ARDS, hypotension, ileus, and anemia.
- She also has a history of cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt and ankle fracture.
- The patient's current medications include propofol, fentanyl, lasix, and fluconazole.
- Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, slightly low Hct, and elevated D-dimer levels.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows compensated metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure with Severe ARDS: The patient continues to require high levels of oxygen and PEEP, indicating severe lung damage and impaired gas exchange.
2. Hypotension: The patient requires vasopressin and low-dose norepinephrine to maintain a stable blood pressure.
3. Ileus: The patient had a concern for bowel infection, but"

   Assessment and Plan
   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   # ARDS/Hypoxia
inciting event likely influenza A causing ARDS,
   antibiotics d/c
d [**2-19**]. Pt developed recurrent fevers with acute desats
   and e/o worsening hypoxia, CXR revealed new bilateral infiltrated,
   antibiotics restarted [**2-21**].  Pt has been difficult to oxygenate, s/p
   paralysis & switch to APRV mode, pt has been oxygenating better.  Had
   attempted to weened to 60% and did not tolerated, failed AC trial.
   Patient has been difficult to ween from vent.  Unclear if there is some
   VAP or other insult causing continued pulmonary capillary leakage.
   Continues to show frequent dysinchonry from vent.  Have switched from
   APRV to PCV w/ improved ventilation.  This am pCO2 very high, will
   decrease Peep.
   - optimize ventilation with improved sedation
 d/c versed, wean
   fentanyl, increase propofol
   -- switched from fent/midaz to propofol w/ slow transition in order to
   facilitate possible extubation if window presents itself, in addition
   to, high fentanyl requirements to achieve suboptimal sedation
   - continue  Levo, Flagyl
   - f/u micro data, BAL from [**2-21**] NGTD
   - fungal markers negative
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs Q2h prn
   - will continue lasix gtt as volume overload an additional barrier to
   oxygenation.  Will continue to diurese through low pressures using
   levophed.  Goal 2L negative daily
   #Sepsis: Etiologies include bowel ischemia/infection vs VAP induced
   sepsis.  No definitive culture date currently. Had suspected possible
   toxic megacolon vs ileus,  but C. diff neg x 3, B toxin pending.  Abd
   exam overall improved, having stool output and KUB shows improvement of
   bowel dilitation.  CVPs ranging from [**8-27**].
   - now growing yeast in sputum and urine, will change foley and consider
   starting fluconazole if repeat UCx +.
   - continue levofloxacin, flagyl
   - continue IV flagyl for possible cdiff/toxic megacolon, continue until
   c.diff toxin B back negative at the very least
   - follow with serial abd exams, do not need to follow serial lactates
   - attempt to wean levophed, ok to be on pressures while aggressively
   trying to diurese with lasix drip.
   # Metabolic Alkalosis
 likely contraction alkalosis [**1-13**] to aggressive
   diuresis
   - acetazolamide x1
   - re-check ABG
   - pm bicarb
   # Transaminitits:  Sudden increase in LFTs, but normal TB and mildly
   increased LDH.  Maybe be secondary to bowel/heptic iscemia in setting
   of hypotension, although patient was not had new sudden hypotensive
   insult.  CVP should not suggest increased post-hepatic congestion.
   Patient w/o elevated TB/LDH to suggest billiary infection. Could likely
   be the effect of caspo, LFTs now trending back down off  Caspo
   - RUQ US
 showed only mild ant wall thickening of the gallbladder
   - LFTs trending back down, including LDH, will continue to trend
   # Rhythm: pt has recurrent NSVT in setting of acidemia, loaded with
   Amiodarone, pH improved, and no recurrence of NSVT for last 48hrs. Pt
   currently in sinus bradycardia while on levophed.
   - amiodoarone d/c
d [**2-25**]
   - replete lytes & follow serial ABGs
   - if continues to have runs of vtach, consider restarting amio
   # ARF: resolving, likely prerenal etiology with low FENA. [**2-20**] Urine +
   for WBCs/yeast, changed out foley & f/u urine cx on [**2-21**] was NGTD.
   Continue broad spectrum empiric coverage. Renal function stable & UOP
   approx 50-60cc/hr
   - monitor creatinine/UOP
   - avoiding nephrotoxins, wean pressors if possible
   - continue lasix gtt
   # Hem/fibrinolysis syndrome
no e/o acute bleed, Hct down from 27 to 23
   after receiving last tranfsusion.  Peripheral smear neg for
   schistocytes, fibrinogen >500, INR 1.7 & D-dimer elevated.
   - transfuse 1upRBCs for hct <25, will check PM hct
   -guaiac all stools
   # ankle fracture - hard cast d/c'd on [**2-23**], sutures C/D/I.  No plan for
   revision until medically stabilized

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hypoxemia, who is currently admitted to the ICU for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. She has been diagnosed with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome and is experiencing recurrent fevers, acute desaturation, and worsening respiratory distress. The patient has developed pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely caused by influenza A infection.

The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation in assist-control (AC) mode, but has been difficult to wean from the ventilator. She has been switched to pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) with improved ventilation. Sedation has been optimized with propofol, and fentanyl weaning is being attempted.

The patient is also experiencing sepsis, with etiologies including bowel ischemia/infection and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). No definitive culture date is currently available. There are suspicions of toxic megacolon versus ileus, but Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has tested negative three times, and beta toxin is pending. Abdominal exam has shown improvement, with stool output and improved bowel dilation.

The patient's blood cultures have grown yeast in the sputum and urine, so fluconazole will be considered if repeat UCx is positive. She will continue to receive levofloxacin and Flagyl for possible C. diff/toxic megacolon, until C. diff toxin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted to the ICU for an ankle fracture surgery. She developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after intubation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a reduced fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). She has hypotension and requires vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient also has a history of cerebral aneurysm with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, but recent head CT shows no acute changes. She has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and antibiotic therapy is being adjusted accordingly. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can lead to difficulty in breathing and low oxygen levels.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are on mechanical ventilation. This condition can worsen the patient's respiratory status and may require additional antibiotic therapy.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can compromise organ perf"

   Assessment and Plan
   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - intubated [**2114-2-13**]
   - making some progress, with substantial successful reductions in PEEP
   over the past few days
   - reduce FiO2 today
   - we are supporting diuresis with vasopressors at this point.  Goal
   negative ~1000
 1500 today.
   - needs art line
   VENTILATOR ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA
   - clarify antibiotic course today.  Anticipate eight-day course.
   (levoflox day 10/flag 12)
   HYPOTENSION
   -          likely has some relative hypovolemia given CVP 8-12 in
   setting of PEEP 16.  However, we are favoring diuresis (for pulmonary
   status) at this point
   -          Consider repeating adrenal axis assessment
   INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES
   - review all micro and antibiotics course today
   - per prior notes: previous hx: question of sepsis/increased lactate in
   setting of fever, dilated colon - there was a high concern for bowel
   infection, but cdiff neg x 3, b toxin pending. Seems to all have been
   an ileus, which appears to be resolving. The hypotension was likely due
   to her arrhythmia which resolved on amiodarone drip.  ID input highly
   appreciated. D/c cdiff coverage if b toxin negative. ARDS likely due to
   influenza initially, currently with hypotension, leukocytosis on broad
   spectrum
   Abx.
                                                     All antibiotics had
   been d/c'd [**2-20**] except for fluconazole. Bronch with BAL [**2-21**]. F/u on

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of cerebral aneurysm, VP shunt, hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, and ankle fracture. She was admitted for ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) of an ankle fracture but developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) after intubation on [**2114-2-13**].

The patient is currently in the ICU (intensive care unit) with multiple medical complications. She has acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, ventilator-associated pneumonia, hypotension, and infectious disease issues.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 50-87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 7-12 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.7-12.7 thousand/mm3, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 286-382 thousand/mm3, elevated lactate level of 1.5 mmol/L, and elevated D-dimer level of 3818 ng/mL. Other laboratory values are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging shows bilateral infiltrates on chest"

   Assessment and Plan
   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
   # ARDS/Hypoxia
   Inciting event likely influenza A causing ARDS.  Recently oxygenating
   better, now off APRV
 Pressure control.  Unclear if there is some VAP
   or other insult causing continued pulmonary capillary leakage.
     Continues to show frequent dysinchonry from vent.  Have switched from
   APRV to PCV w/ improved ventilation.  This am pCO2 very high, will
   decrease Peep.
   - optimize ventilation with improved sedation
 d/c versed, wean
   fentanyl, increase propofol
   -- switched from fent/midaz to propofol w/ slow transition in order to
   facilitate possible extubation if window presents itself, in addition
   to, high fentanyl requirements to achieve suboptimal sedation
   - continue  Levo, Flagyl
   - f/u micro data, BAL from [**2-21**] NGTD
   - fungal markers negative
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs Q2h prn
   - will continue lasix gtt as volume overload an additional barrier to
   oxygenation.  Will continue to diurese through low pressures using
   levophed.  Goal 2L negative daily
   #Sepsis: Etiologies include bowel ischemia/infection vs VAP induced
   sepsis.  No definitive culture date currently. Had suspected possible
   toxic megacolon vs ileus,  but C. diff neg x 3, B toxin pending.  Abd
   exam overall improved, having stool output and KUB shows improvement of
   bowel dilitation.  CVPs ranging from [**8-27**].
   - now growing yeast in sputum and urine, will change foley and consider
   starting fluconazole if repeat UCx +.
   - continue levofloxacin, flagyl
   - continue IV flagyl for possible cdiff/toxic megacolon, continue until
   c.diff toxin B back negative at the very least
   - follow with serial abd exams, do not need to follow serial lactates
   - attempt to wean levophed, ok to be on pressures while aggressively
   trying to diurese with lasix drip.
   # Metabolic Alkalosis

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of influenza A infection, who was admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. She has been experiencing pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently intubated on pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode, with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, and plateau pressure (PC) of 18 cmH2O. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 40 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, sulfonamides, shellfish, iodine, and red dye. She has received several antibiotics, including levofloxacin and metronidazole. Her current medications include norepinephrine, furosemide (Lasix), fentanyl, propofol, pantoprazole (Protonix), and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate (HR) of 71 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 100/54 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 2 mmHg, with a fluid balance of +1,798 mL since midnight. The patient's weight is currently 83.5 kg, with a decrease from her admission weight of 65.8 kg.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.7 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 26.1%, platelet (Plt) count of 286 thousand/mm3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 47 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.5 mg/dL, and glucose level of 129 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are as follows: sodium (Na+) of 139 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 98 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) of 8.0 mg/dL, and magnesium (Mg++) of 2.1 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
1. ARDS/Hypoxia: The patient is suspected to have ARDS due to influenza A infection. She is showing improvement in oxygenation, but still requires mechanical ventilation. The plan is to optimize ventilation with improved sedation, continue antibiotics,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who was admitted for ORIF (operative repair of a fractured bone) and is now in the ICU due to post-operative complications. The patient has hyperfibrinolysis syndrome and is being treated for pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) caused by influenza A. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure control mode.

The patient's oxygenation has improved, and she has been weaned off APRV (airway pressure release ventilation). However, there may still be some VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) or other insult causing continued pulmonary capillary leakage. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for VAP and is currently on levofloxacin and metronidazole.

The patient's sedation has been managed with propofol, but there are concerns about its toxicities. It is planned to switch to methadone as a sedative. The patient's FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) and PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) levels will be further decreased today or tomorrow. Nebulized albuterol and atrovent will be given every 2 hours as needed.

The patient continues to require norepinephrine, a vasopressor, and lasix, a diuretic. The patient's abdominal examination is benign, and previous kidney/urinary bladder (K"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who was admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. Post-operatively, she developed pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated on February 13th and has been receiving mechanical ventilation. The inciting event for ARDS is suspected to be influenza A. The patient has been treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with linezolid and is now on levofloxacin and metronidazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS/Hypoxia: The patient's condition indicates severe hypoxia due to ARDS. Oxygenation is being managed through mechanical ventilation, but there may be ongoing pulmonary capillary leakage contributing to her respiratory distress. Further adjustments in FiO2 and PEEP are being considered.
2. Shock: The patient continues to require norepinephrine, indicating ongoing hypotension and shock. Vasopressin has been discontinued, possibly due to relative hypovolemia or fentanyl effect. Modestly elevated PEEP (14) and previous flu-induced sepsis and ARDS are likely contributing to the shock state.
3. Fungal Infection: Growing yeast from sputum and urine suggests a fungal infection. Fungal blood culture is pending.
4. Clostridium Difficile Infection: A pending test for C. difficile infection indicates a possible bacterial infection.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may be due to hypotension, caspofungin, or other factors. Liver function should be monitored in the coming days.
6. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) during acidemia and is currently in sinus bradycardia while on levophed. If episodes of ventricular tachycardia recur, restarting amiodarone may be considered.
7. Ankle Fracture: The patient had an ankle fracture that was treated with an ORIF procedure. The hard cast was removed on February 23rd, and sutures were placed.
8. Orthopedic Consultation: Orthopedic input has been appreciated regarding the ankle fracture treatment.
9. ICU Care: The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, lines (PICC line, multi-lumen line, arterial line), prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, VAP), and code status are all being managed in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a complicated course in the ICU. She was admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture and developed acute respiratory failure, requiring intubation on February 13th. The patient has made some progress, with successful reductions in PEEP over the past few days. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PRES/AC mode, set at a PC of 18 cmH2O, RR of 23, PEEP of 14 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and a SpO2 of 94%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 70 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 150.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is being treated accordingly. There are concerns about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and antibiotics will be clarified today with an anticipated eight-day course. The patient has developed a relative metabolic acidosis, which may be related to acetazolamide or changes in total parenteral nutrition (TPN). It is recommended to avoid acetazolamide for now and balance TPN in favor of acetate today.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension and will undergo a trial of albumin challenge today. Low-dose levophed will be used to support this. The patient has"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female who presented with hypoxemia and is currently admitted to the ICU. She underwent ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) of her right ankle and subsequently developed pulmonary edema, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and is suspected to be induced by the Flu virus.

The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with improvements in oxygenation over the past few days. Her condition is stable, and she has responded well to diuresis and decreased PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure). Antibiotics have been reduced due to negative blood cultures.

The patient also experienced septic shock, likely resolving, and had a prior episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) but is currently in normal sinus rhythm. Her influenza infection is resolving, and possible secondary infection is being considered. Blood cultures remain negative, and there is low-grade fever and increasing leukocytosis.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, and antibiotics are being peeled back. Flagyl has been discontinued, and Levofloxacin may be continued until tomorrow. Clostridium difficile toxin B is pending, but without large volume diarrhea.

The patient has hypernatremia, possibly induced by diuresis, and a free water deficit has been identified. Lasix gtts have been turned off, and TPN settings are being adjusted to decrease sodium levels. Hyperkalemia has been addressed"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right ankle. She has a postoperative course complicated by pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and likely influenza-induced hypoxemia. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her oxygenation has been improving over the past several days, and she is being weaned off pressors. Blood cultures remain negative, but she still has low-grade fever and increasing leukocytosis. The patient's respiratory status is improving, and the antibiotics are being peeled back.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team is monitoring for any signs of infection, such as increased sputum production or changes in chest X-ray findings. Antibiotics will be adjusted accordingly.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings or pharmacological prophylaxis, should be considered.

3. Fibrinolysis syndrome: The patient has evidence of coagulopathy with elevated D-dimer levels and low fibrinogen. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management are necessary.

4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia and hyperkalemia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who has been in the ICU for several days following an ORIF of her right ankle. She has a history of pulmonary edema, ARDS, and likely influenza-induced pneumonia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with improving oxygenation. She has received multiple diuretics, antibiotics, and sedatives. Her current conditions include hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and a recent episode of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) with hypotension, for which she was started on amiodarone. She has also shown signs of fever and increasing leukocytosis, suggesting a possible secondary infection. The patient's family has agreed to tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) given her improving condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for several days, increasing her risk of developing VAP. This will need to be closely monitored with appropriate cultures and antibiotics.
2. Line-related infection: The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line, multi-lumen line, and arterial line. These lines can serve as potential sources of infection, especially since the patient has already shown signs of fever.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia due to water deficit likely induced by diuresis. This will need to"

   Family Meeting
   [**2114-3-7**]
   Along with social work and palliative care, I met with Mr. [**Known lastname **] and
   reviewed his wife
s current status in detail.  She has made substantial
   improvement in her respiratory status, with a decrement of PEEP from 22
   to 12 in a comparatively short period of time.  When we discussed her
   desire for tracheostomy, he noted that she had associated tracheostomy
   with being
mentally deficient
 because of the patient
s mother
s prior
   experience (with a brain aneurysm).  We discussed that, given her rate
   of improvement this week, it appears that she has a reasonably good
   chance (in my estimation, greater than 50%) of eventually being able to
   come off of the ventilator.  We discussed that this would still likely
   take weeks to months, and that a very prolonged period of
   rehabilitation would follow (for example, a year).  However, at this
   point we have no evidence that she has suffered brain damage or other
   irreversible problems.  [**Name (NI) **] questions were answered, and based on this
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] requested that we pursue continued aggressive care.  He
   understands that this would mean trachestomy and feeding tube, and
   wishes to proceed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female admitted to the ICU for ORIF (operative repair of a fracture) with a postoperative course complicated by pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/62 to 157/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus rhythm. The patient has allergies to penicillins, sulfa, shellfish, iodine, and red dye. She is receiving several medications including furosemide, fentanyl, amiodarone, propofol, lorazepam, heparin, and others. 

The patient has a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt, ankle fracture, DNR (do not resuscitate) status, and previous code status changes. 

Assessment and plan:
The patient is critically ill with acute respiratory failure due to ARDS, requiring intubation. There is ongoing improvement in oxygenation but worsening pCO2, possibly due to fluid balance and decreased tidal volume. Sedation will be reduced, and fever will be controlled as feasible. ABGs will be monitored every few hours. If pCO2 does not"

   Assessment and Plan
   52F with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF, post op course
   c/b pulmonary edema, worsening resp distress, fever & ARDS s/p
   intubation on [**2114-2-13**].
    ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - intubated [**2114-2-13**]
   - oxygenation continues to improve
   - pCO2 has worsened
 potentially due to change in compliance (positive
   fluid balance, possibly derecruitment with PEEP decrement) leading to
   decreased Vt.
   - Reduce sedation today.  Control fever as feasible. Follow ABGs every
   few hours.  If pCO2 does not improve, increase driving pressure
   - diurese -1000 today, possibly with albumin challenge if needed
   VENTILATOR ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA
   -          finished course of levofloxacin
   FEVER
   -          concerning, given that we have just discontinued ABX
   -          check all cultures
   -          line sites look OK
   HYPOTENSION
   -          resolved
   INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES
   - complicated course.
   - will discuss with ID further today.
   H/O CEREBRAL ANEURYSM WITH VP SHUNT
    - stable; prior head CT shows no acute changes
   ANEMIA
   - Stable
   Ankle fracture
   - Ortho following, cast off.
   H/O hyperfibrinolysis syndrome
   - pt received Amicar per hem/onc recs prior to surgery.
   SEDATION
   - will begin to decrease sedation
   DNR
   Per prior notes: advanced directive was documented but husband has
   reversed this temporarily, to be reassessed within one week unless she
   shows significant regression.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of cerebral aneurysm, VP shunt, and hyperfibrinolysis syndrome. She was admitted for ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) and developed postoperative complications such as pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). She has been intubated since [**2114-2-13**] and is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure. Her oxygenation continues to improve, but she has worsening pCO2 levels due to decreased compliance and positive fluid balance. The patient is also at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has completed a course of levofloxacin. She has been febrile, and all cultures have been checked. Her hypotension has resolved, and she is being weaned off sedation. She has a history of ankle fracture, which has been treated with orthopedic consultation. The patient's advanced directive regarding DNR (do not resuscitate) has been temporarily reversed by her husband. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to her prolonged intubation and the presence of fever. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient already has ARDS, and there is a risk of progression or"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, sulfonamides, shellfish, iodine, and red dye. They are currently on multiple infusions, including furosemide, fentanyl, amiodarone, and propofol. The patient's vital signs show fever, elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest and the presence of a systolic murmur. Extremity edema is also noted, with trace edema on the right leg and absent edema on the left leg. Neurological assessment shows no spontaneous movement. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, while other values are within normal limits or slightly abnormal. The patient has been monitored closely, with frequent measurements of vital signs, fluid balance, and arterial blood gas analysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is critically ill and at risk for several potential medical complications. Some of the complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be implemented.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory failure and abnormal arterial blood gas values indicate respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure.
- She has been admitted for ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) and is now experiencing pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
- The patient is intubated and making progress with successful reductions in PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) over the past few days.
- The plan is to reduce PEEP further and continue supporting her with low-dose pressors to maintain even or negative fluid balance.
- The patient has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia, and the antibiotic course will be clarified with an anticipated eight-day treatment.
- She has also developed a relative metabolic acidosis, possibly related to acetazolamide or changes in TPN (total parenteral nutrition).
- Avoiding acetazolamide and balancing TPN in favor of acetate is advised.
- The patient is hypotensive and will undergo a trial of albumin challenge with low-dose levophed support.
- Infectious disease issues are being discussed further with the ID (infectious disease) team.
- The patient has a history of cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt, which is stable with no acute changes on head CT.
- Anemia and ankle fracture are stable, with the cast off.
- The patient has a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome and received Amicar prior to surgery.
- Sedation management involves compliance with the ventilator using propofol, versed, and fentanyl, transitioning to methadone.
- The patient has hypernatremia, which requires replete free water.
- The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) status, which may be reassessed within one week unless there is significant regression.
- ICU care includes nutrition through TPN with lipids, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is a common complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is likely contributing to her respiratory failure and may worsen if not properly managed.
3. Hyperfibrinolysis syndrome: The patient has a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, which can lead to bleeding complications and coagulopathy.
4. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has developed a relative metabolic acidosis, which can be caused by various factors such as lactic acidosis, renal dysfunction, or TPN-related issues.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia requires careful management"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. She has been experiencing pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory distress, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) since intubation on [**2114-2-13**]. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvements in oxygenation but worsening pCO2 levels. She has developed a positive fluid balance and requires fluid restriction and diuretics to manage this. The patient also has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is being treated with antibiotics. She has developed a relative metabolic acidosis possibly due to acetazolamide or changes in total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Her blood pressure is low, and she is receiving low-dose vasopressors to support it. There are ongoing discussions regarding her infectious disease management and potential complications such as hypotension, anemia, hypernatremia, and sedation. The patient has a history of cerebral aneurysm with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, which is currently stable. She also has an ankle fracture being managed by orthopedics. The patient's advanced directive regarding do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status has been temporarily reversed by her husband. Her nutritional support is provided through TPN with lipids. The patient remains critically ill."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old female who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right ankle.
- She developed post-operative complications, including pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely induced by influenza virus.
- The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
- Oxygenation has been improving over the past few days, transitioning from airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) to pressure control mode.
- There are ongoing efforts to peel back antibiotics despite fevers, seeking alternative sources other than lung pathology, with sputum gram stain without organism.
- The patient responded well to albumin and will continue to receive it.
- She is on diuretics, aiming for a goal of -1L fluid balance.
- Family meeting was held, and informed consent (IP) for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was obtained.
- The plan is to titrate peep to 8 today and then further according to ARDSnet protocol.
- The patient is suspected to have shock, possibly due to ARDS or influenza sepsis.
- Pressors were held off, but she will remain on the dry side for weaning purposes.
- Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) is present and responding well to amiodarone.
- QTc prolongation is noted, so methadone will be discontinued.

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ORIF right ankle, who has been experiencing pulmonary edema, ARDS, and likely induced via Flu virus. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her oxygenation has been improving over the past several days. The patient also shows signs of resolving septic shock, likely secondary to influenza and a possible secondary infection. Blood cultures remain negative, and her respiratory status is improving. However, she still has low-grade temperatures and increasing leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's history of pulmonary edema and flu virus infection suggests the possibility of ARDS. ARDS is a serious condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to impaired oxygenation and respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. VAP is a type of lung infection that can occur in patients receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours.
3. Septic Shock: Although the patient's septic shock appears to be resolving, there is still a risk of complications associated with sepsis, such as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels may be induced by di"

The patient is a 52-year-old female who underwent right ankle ORIF and is now experiencing ARDS following influenza infection. She has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/49 to 91/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is in sinus rhythm.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's current condition is hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS. The treatment plan includes tracheostomy, pressure control ventilation, and gradually decreasing sedation to allow for switching to pressure support/PEEP. However, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient's temperature is elevated, and her white blood cell count is increased. Possible sources of infection include lines, recent invasive procedures (trach/PEG), and VAP. Fungal cultures have grown yeast, and there is a need for further investigation and treatment with antifungal medication.
3. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy: The patient experienced SVT with aberrancy, and amiodarone"

   and send tips to cx (attempt to place new PICC today; if not possible,
   then resite central line).
   -          Hold abx for now; start broad spectrum if spikes to 101,
   becomes hemodynamically unstable
   # SVT with aberrancy: Received amiodarone 150mg IV load given concern
   for sustained VT; EP consulted, EKG evidences SVT with aberrancy.
   Amiodarone 600mg PO BID continued, with metoprolol 25mg; following CE.
   Request official EP staffing by attending today.
   # Sedation: Decreasing sedation, now only on fentanyl and midazolam
   # Fluid balance: Goal even.  Diuresis held given contraction
   alkalosis.  Maintaining SBP 100s without pressors, still on albumin IV
   BID.  D/c albumin.
   # Hypernatremia:  Na 146.  Increase free water boluses via PEG once
   usable.
   # Fibrinolysis syndrome:  STABLE.  Hct stable, maintaining above 24
   # R ankle fracture s/p ORIF:  STABLE.  Staples out.

","The patient is a 52-year-old female who underwent right ankle open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and is now experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following influenza. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with pressure control mode. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F), blood pressure ranging from 91/51 to 86/49 mmHg, heart rate between 64 and 142 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.8 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, normal potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L, and elevated lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L. 

The patient's ABG results show respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 76 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 180. The patient's arterial blood gases also indicate metabolic alkalosis with a bicarbonate level of 36 mEq/L. 

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS and has been sedated with methadone and propofol. However, sedation has been decreased, and attempts have been made to switch to spontaneous breathing"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. They underwent percutaneous tracheostomy and PEG insertion, tolerating both procedures but experiencing respiratory decompensation requiring ventilator adjustments. The patient has a history of wide-complex tachycardia, which was determined to be an atrial dysrhythmia with aberrancy. Propofol and methadone were stopped due to the patient's inability to provide history as they were sedated.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which necessitates ongoing ventilator support.
2. Atrial Dysrhythmia with Aberrancy: The patient experienced wide-complex tachycardia overnight, which was identified as an atrial dysrhythmia with aberrancy.
3. Complications after Tracheostomy and PEG Insertion: Although the patient tolerated these procedures, there was some respiratory decompensation following them, necessitating multiple ventilator adjustments.
4. Potential Infections: The presence of persistent bilateral opacities on chest X-ray suggests a possibility of ongoing or recurrent infections.
5. Fluid Balance: The patient has an imbalance in their fluid balance, with a total input of 3,634 mL and a total output of 4,300 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -666 mL.
6. Laboratory Abnormalities: The patient exhibits several abnormal laboratory values, including elevated white blood cell"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old woman with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted [**2114-2-1**] for
   ORIF, now with a complicated post-opeartive including pulmonary edema,
   influenza, and ARDS s/p intubation on [**2114-2-13**].  She has made substantial
   progress in oxygenation over the past week (down from PEEP 22).  She
   tolerated trach and PEG yesterday, although had some ventilatory and
   derecruitment issues overnight.  Two major acute issues include a
   wide-complex tachycardia (now resolved) and low-grade fever and
   leucocytosis as she has come off of antibiotics.
    ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - intubated [**2114-2-13**].  T/G [**2114-3-8**]
   - keep event today
   - wean FiO2.  Consider trying PSV in afternoon
   LOW-GRADE FEVER
   -          still with some fevers without clear source.  Increasing WBC
   is also concerning.
   -          ID has signed off
   -          Remove CVL, PICC and art line.  Resite art line.  Try to get
   PIVs and give a one-day holiday with no CVL.  If unable to get PIVs,
   then PICC or CVL.
   -          Follow cultures.  Hold on antibiotics unless she has
   worsening clinical status at this point.
   WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA
   -          unclear to me whether this represents VT or (as per EP
   overnight) an SVT with aberrancy
   -          consult EP today
   -          continue amiodarone in the interim
   H/O CEREBRAL ANEURYSM WITH VP SHUNT
    - prior head CT shows no acute changes
   ANEMIA
   - Stable
   Ankle fracture
   - Ortho following, cast off.
   H/O hyperfibrinolysis syndrome
   - pt received Amicar per hem/onc recs prior to surgery.
   SEDATION
   - continue to slowly decrease sedation

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. She now presents with respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, influenza, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following intubation on February 13th. She has made progress in oxygenation over the past week but continues to have acute issues including a wide-complex tachycardia (resolved), low-grade fever, and leukocytosis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure due to ARDS, which has required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Wide-Complex Tachycardia: The patient experienced a wide-complex tachycardia overnight, which may indicate ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy. Further evaluation by an electrophysiologist is recommended.
3. Low-Grade Fever: The patient continues to have fevers without a clear source, along with increasing white blood cell count, suggesting a possible infection.
4. Hyperfibrinolysis Syndrome: The patient has a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, which may contribute to bleeding complications.
5. Anemia: The patient is anemic but stable.
6. Cerebral Aneurysm with VP Shunt: The patient has a history of a cerebral aneurysm with a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. Regular monitoring and follow-up are necessary.
7. Sedation: The patient's sedation should be gradually decreased as tolerated.
8. DNR Status: The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) status per discussion with her husband.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information or tests may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
   size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) The
   right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
   contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
   with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
   valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-2-22**], the right
   ventricle appears larger, current study much better quality, tricupsid

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who has undergone right ankle ORIF, ARDS due to influenza, and subsequently had a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She is currently in the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by ARDS, on pressure control ventilation, and recently experienced respiratory acidosis due to vecuronium paralysis. The patient also has a fever and leukocytosis, with a WBC count of 16.8 and a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit. There are concerns about potential sources of infection such as lines, recent invasive procedures (trach/PEG), and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics and cultures have been taken from various sites. The patient also experienced a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy, for which amiodarone and metoprolol were administered. Sedation has been decreased, and fluid balance is being closely monitored. The patient's sodium levels are high, and steps are being taken to manage this. There are no signs of fibrinolysis syndrome or complications related to the patient's ankle fracture. The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) status and her current disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:

   right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
   contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
   with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
   valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-2-22**], the right

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female who has undergone right ankle ORIF, ARDS due to influenza, and subsequently had a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure with an etiology of ARDS from flu, for which she is on pressure control ventilation. She also experienced recent respiratory acidosis and vecuronium paralysis. The patient's recent WBC count increased from 12.7 to 16.8, and she had a fever curve, but her temperature is now back down. There are concerns about potential infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), but cultures have been negative so far. The patient's sedation is being decreased, and she is now only on fentanyl and midazolam. Her fluid balance is being closely monitored, and diuresis is being held due to contraction alkalosis. The patient has resolved hypernatremia with a free water bolus. There are no current allergies noted. The patient's medical history includes an ankle fracture that has been operated on and treated with ORIF. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS from influenza. This condition can lead to further"

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and hyperfibrinolysis syndrome. The patient is a 52-year-old woman who was admitted for an ORIF procedure and now has a complicated post-operative course including pulmonary edema, influenza, and ARDS. She is intubated since February 13th.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/69 to 183/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on ventilator support. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), elevated platelet count (Plt), normal creatinine (Cr), and troponin-T levels below detection limit. Other lab values such as electrolytes, liver function tests, and cardiac enzymes are within normal limits. The D-dimer level is elevated at 3818 ng/mL, indicating a possible thromboembolic event.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a slightly elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), normal partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), and pH within normal range. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is deferred due to PEEP >"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and hyperfibrinolysis syndrome. They have a history of allergies to penicillins, sulfa, shellfish, and anaphylaxis to iodine and red dye. The patient has been on various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and dextrose. They have received infusions of furosemide, and their diet consists of ProBalance nutrition.

Assessment:
The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 102/69 to 183/102 mmHg, heart rate between 66 and 78 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and their central venous pressure is 4 mmHg.

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,036 mL and output of 2,105 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 69 mL. Respiratory support indicates the patient is on mechanical ventilation with PCV+assist mode, with pressures set at 16 cmH2O for the peak inspiratory pressure, 10 cmH2O for the positive end-expiratory pressure, and a FiO2 of 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 58 mmHg, SaO2 of 72%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 180.

Lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 16.8 K/uL, thrombocytosis with a Plt count of 514 K/uL, elevated troponin T level of <0.01 ng/mL, elevated D-dimer level of 3818 ng/mL, and elevated lactate level of 1.5 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Plan:
The patient is receiving ICU care with nutrition provided through ProBalance. Glycemic control is being monitored, and arterial and central venous lines have been placed. Prophylaxis measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia are in place. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate status."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman admitted for ORIF (operative repair or fixation) with a complicated post-operative course including pulmonary edema, influenza, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). She is currently intubated and has persistent respiratory failure. She also has a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome and was previously treated with Amicar prior to surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing persistent respiratory failure despite being intubated. There is a need for further weaning of the ventilator settings, such as decreasing the driving pressure and maintaining PEEP at 10. It is also planned to reduce FiO2 and consider trying pressure support ventilation (PSV) in the afternoon.

2. Low-Grade Fever: The patient continues to have some fevers without a clear source. Cultures have been taken, and antibiotics have been withheld unless there is worsening clinical status.

3. Wide Complex Tachycardia: An electrocardiogram (ECG) consult has been requested for Flecainide with beta-blockade.

4. History of Cerebral Aneurysm with VP Shunt: The patient has a history of cerebral aneurysm with a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. A prior head CT showed no acute changes.

5. Anemia: The patient is stable with anemia.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 52-year-old female who has undergone right ankle ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) and is currently experiencing ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to influenza. She also has a history of SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) with aberrancy and has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been weaned from sedation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 139/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on FiO2 of 40%. She is receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood cultures are pending, but sputum, NG (nasogastric) tube, and urine cultures are negative.

The patient's assessment and plan include management of hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS, fever/leukocytosis with negative cultures, SVT with aberrancy, sedation, fluid balance, hypernatremia, fibrinolysis syndrome, and right ankle fracture post ORIF"

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with pressure control ventilation (PCV) mode, set respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 34 cmH2O, and the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to FiO2 ratio is 165.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.4 g/dL, blood glucose level of 150 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.6 mg/dL, troponin-T level of less than 0.01 ng/mL, C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 106 mEq/L, and D-dimer level of 3818 ng/mL. Other lab results include normal sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels, but slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, unknown anaphylaxis, sulfa, shellfish-derived products, iodine, and red dye. The last doses of antibiotics given were levofloxacin and vancomycin on March 8th.

The patient's fluid balance shows an overall negative balance of 685 mL since 12 AM, with input exceeding output. She is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has been sedated with fentanyl and midazolam.

The patient has a code status of do not resuscitate (DNR) and is currently on various medications for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old woman with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for ORIF (orthopedic surgery) and now experiencing pulmonary edema, influenza, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) post intubation.
- She has acute respiratory failure requiring intubation on February 13th and persistent respiratory failure.
- She has a low-grade fever without a clear source, and cultures are being followed. Antibiotics are withheld unless there is worsening clinical status.
- She experienced wide complex tachycardia, and an electrophysiology consult was requested with the use of Flecainide and beta-blocker.
- She has a history of cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt, but a recent head CT shows no acute changes.
- She has stable anemia and an ankle fracture, which is being managed by orthopedics.
- She has a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, for which she received Amicar prior to surgery.
- She is sedated and undergoing gradual weaning from sedation.
- She has a DNR (do not resuscitate) status.
- Her current medications include regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, ProBalance for nutrition, and stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates a high risk of further deterioration in lung"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who was admitted for an ORIF procedure. She now has a complicated postoperative course including pulmonary edema, influenza, and ARDS, resulting in persistent respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated since February 13th and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She is experiencing low-grade fevers without a clear source, wide complex tachycardia, anemia, and sedation. The patient has a history of cerebral aneurysm with VP shunt and ankle fracture, which is being managed by orthopedics. The patient's condition is critical, and she has a DNR status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates a potential complication that may arise due to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The presence of low-grade fevers suggests a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis and further complications if not appropriately managed.
3. Wide complex tachycardia: The patient's wide complex tachycardia may indicate a cardiac arrhythmia, which could have serious implications if not addressed promptly.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia could contribute to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues and may require intervention to correct.
5. Sedation: The patient's sedation level needs to be carefully managed to ensure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and in the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs show an increased heart rate and blood pressure, along with a slightly elevated temperature. The patient's weight has increased from 65.8 kg at admission to 83.5 kg currently. 

The patient is on several medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, lopressor, and flecainide. They are also receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam. 

The patient's lab results indicate a high white blood cell count and a decreased hemoglobin level. The platelet count is within normal range, but the creatinine level is slightly elevated. Other lab values such as electrolytes, kidney function tests, and cardiac markers are within normal limits.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator in PCV+Assist mode with a set respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. The peak inspiratory pressure is 34 cmH2O, and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 40%. The patient's blood gases show a slightly low partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and normal carbon dioxide levels.

The patient's arterial line was started on March 10th at 4:00 PM and stopped at 4:11 PM. There are no recent changes in the patient's medical or family history.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female who has undergone right ankle ORIF, ARDS due to influenza, and now has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure caused by ARDS, for which she is on pressure control ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 105/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 83.5 kg, and her height is 65 inches. 

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, sulfa, shellfish, iodine, and red dye. She has received various medications, including midazolam, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever, hypernatremia, and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN). 

Fluid balance shows a positive fluid intake of 2,673 mL and output of 2,850 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -177 mL. The patient is receiving nutrition through ProBalance at a rate of 60 mL/hour. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of AST, ALT,"

   -          still with some fevers without clear source.  Elevated LFTS
   slughtly check RUQ US
   -          Removed CVL, PICC
   -          Resited A line
   -          Follow cultures.  Hold on antibiotics unless she has
   worsening clinical status at this point.
   WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA
           -     Appreciate Ep consult on Flecainide with B blockade
   H/O CEREBRAL ANEURYSM WITH VP SHUNT
    - prior head CT shows no acute changes
   ANEMIA
   - Stable
   Ankle fracture
   - Ortho following, cast off.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who was admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. She now presents with post-operative complications including pulmonary edema, influenza, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intubation on February 13th. She remains dependent on mechanical ventilation with persistent respiratory failure.

Assessment and Plan:
1. ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
   - The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
   - Further weaning of the ventilator will be attempted, aiming for a driving pressure of 8 and decreasing PEEP to 8.
   - If the patient tolerates these changes, pressure support ventilation (PSV) will be tried again in the afternoon.
   - Sedation will be weaned off.

2. LOW-GRADE FEVER:
   - The patient continues to experience fevers without a clear source.
   - Slightly elevated liver function tests (LFTs) were observed.
   - A bedside ultrasound of the right upper quadrant (RUQ) will be performed.
   - Central venous line (CVL) and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) have been removed.
   - Arterial line has been repositioned.
   - Cultures will be followed, and antibiotics will be withheld unless there is a worsening clinical status.

","The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who was admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a fracture. She now presents with complications including pulmonary edema, influenza, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following endotracheal intubation on [**2114-2-13**]. The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, low-grade fever, wide complex tachycardia, cerebral aneurysm with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, anemia, ankle fracture, and a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/62 mmHg to 179/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. The patient's weight has increased from 65.8 kg at admission to 83.5 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,673 mL and output of 2,850 mL with a negative balance of -177 mL. The patient is receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions, as well as other ICU medications.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 12.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL, platelet count of 488 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 150 to 225 mg/dL, and elevated D-dimer levels at 3818 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds and a thin appearance. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's sedation. The patient has not been assessed for peripheral pulses, skin, or heart auscultation.

The patient's plan includes weaning off ventilatory support with a target driving pressure of 12, maintaining PEEP at 10, and attempting pressure support ventilation (PSV) if well tolerated. Antibiotics will be held unless there is worsening clinical status. The patient will continue to have sedation decreased slowly. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection (due to fever and presence of IV lines), arrhythmias (given the wide complex tachycardia), bleeding (due to low platelet count and history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome), and potential complications related to the VP shunt."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female who has undergone right ankle ORIF, ARDS due to influenza, and tracheostomy with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient's main issues include hypoxic respiratory failure, hypertension, SVT with aberrancy, hypernatremia, and an R ankle fracture post ORIF.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given are:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a positive gram stain showing 1+ gram-positive cocci in clusters. There is also a spike in temperature, which suggests an infection. The patient is already on vancomycin and cefepime for suspected VAP.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated. This could be due to dehydration, medication side effects, or decreased renal perfusion.

3. Cholecystitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are trending slightly up. This may indicate an inflammatory process in the gallbladder, such as acalculous cholecystitis.

4. Sinusitis: The patient has a sputum gram stain showing 1+ gram-positive cocci in clusters. This suggests a possible sinus infection.

5. Stroke: The patient's breathing pattern is described as [Last Name (un)] strokes type breathing pattern. This"

The patient is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to ARDS and is being ventilated with pressure control mode.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 100.1°F (37.8°C), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 174/78 to 113/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight has increased from 65.8 kg at admission to 83.5 kg currently.

The patient is receiving midazolam (Versed) at 1 mg/hour and fentanyl at 50 mcg/hour for sedation. She is also on hydralazine for hypertension, which is responsive. The patient has been febrile, with a temperature spike to 100°F, and her leukocyte count is elevated.

There are concerns about potential medical complications such as infection, given the presence of fever and leukocytosis. The patient's blood, urine, stool, and sputum cultures are pending. Acute calculous cholecystitis is also being considered, and an ultrasound will be followed if necessary. Sinus CT may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after undergoing right ankle ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) surgery, and is now experiencing ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to influenza. The patient has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in place. She is febrile with a temperature of 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit, and her blood cultures show gram-positive cocci in clusters. The patient's vital signs are as follows: blood pressure (BP) ranging from 174/78 to 113/50 mmHg, heart rate (HR) at 70 bpm, respiratory rate (RR) at 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 98%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a pressure control ventilation mode, with peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at 24 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco2) of 64 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 273.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman who was admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. She has developed post-operative complications including pulmonary edema, influenza, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to intubation on February 13th. She continues to experience respiratory failure, with ongoing ventilator support. The patient also has a poor mental status, fevers, wide complex tachycardia, anemia, and a history of sedation. Her code status is do not resuscitate (DNR). The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, despite being on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Infection: The presence of fevers and GPC in the sputum suggests a possible pulmonary infection. Additionally, there are increased densities in the right lower lobe on imaging, indicating a potential source of infection.
3. Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient's wide complex tachycardia may indicate a cardiac arrhythmia. Further evaluation and management are required to stabilize the patient's heart rhythm.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates anemia. This can contribute to poor tissue oxygenation and increase the risk of complications.
5. Poor Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who underwent right ankle ORIF and developed ARDS due to influenza. She is currently on tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with cefepime and vancomycin. The patient has been experiencing fever, leukocytosis, and respiratory alkalosis. There are multiple potential sources of infection including sputum culture showing GPC pairs/clusters, acalculous cholecystitis, sinus opacification, liver abscess, and intracranial infection. The patient's mental status has improved after discontinuing sedation, but there is concern for meningitis given the elevated white blood cell count. An evaluation for lumbar puncture placement is pending, considering the patient's hyperfibrinolysis syndrome. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acalculous cholecystitis: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, and there is evidence of sludge in the gallbladder on ultrasound. This may indicate acalculous cholecystitis, which is a condition characterized by inflammation of the gallbladder without the presence of gallstones. It can occur in critically ill patients due to decreased gallbladder motility and stasis of bile.

2. Sinusitis: The patient has extensive sinus disease with mucosal thickening"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who has undergone right ankle ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation), ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) following influenza, and now has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. She is currently on cefepime and vancomycin for empiric ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) treatment. The patient's recent events include a CT scan of the sinuses showing extensive sinus disease with mucosal thickening and fluid throughout the sinuses, as well as a CT scan of the head without contrast showing no acute intracranial process. An ultrasound of the gallbladder revealed gallbladder wall edema anteriorly, nonspecific, and small perihepatic ascites. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains unresponsive and has been experiencing fevers. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes, with slightly decreased hemoglobin and platelet count. Imaging studies pending include a chest X-ray and blood cultures. The patient's assessment and plan include hypoxic respiratory failure due to ARDS, possible causes of apnea, fever, and leukocytosis, as well as the need to convert to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and start vancomycin and cefepime for VAP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who underwent right ankle ORIF, ARDS due to influenza, and now has a tracheostomy with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. She is currently on cefepime and vancomycin for empirical treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has extensive sinus disease, nonspecific gallbladder edema, and small perihepatic ascites on imaging. Her vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 108/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is currently 83.5 kg, with a total fluid intake of 2965 mL and output of 2565 mL. She is receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube and IV fluids. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure due to ARDS from influenza. She is also febrile with leukocytosis and has several potential infectious sources including sputum with gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, acalculous cholecystitis, sinus opacification, and possible liver abscess. The patient's mental status is off sedation but there is concern for meningitis given the VP shunt and hyperfibrinolysis syndrome"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with hypoxemia. He has a history of allergies to penicillins, sulfa, iodine, and red dye. He has been receiving various medications including Vancomycin, Cefipime, and Metronidazole.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/66 mmHg to 149/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 610 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory support index (RSBI) is 54, and the arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.48, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 55 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 113 mEq/L, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 99%, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to FiO2 ratio of 283.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.0 g/dL, glucose level of 101 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 141 mEq/L, potassium (K+) level of 4.6 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) level of 101 mg/dL, calcium (Ca++) level of 8.3 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) level of 1.8 mg/dL, phosphate (PO4) level of 3.0 mg/dL, and creatinine (Cr) level of 0.3 mg/dL. The blood cultures have been positive for gram-negative bacilli, and the urine cultures have shown the presence of Candida species.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds in the right lower lung field and dullness to percussion in the same area. There are also decreased bowel sounds and mild abdominal distension.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and aspiration pneumonia. The patient's decreased breath sounds in the right lower lung field may indicate the presence of atelectasis or consolidation, which could lead to VAP. The use of CPAP/PSV mode with high tidal volumes may increase the risk of VILI. Additionally, the presence of Candida species in the urine cultures suggests a possible fungal infection.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, perform regular chest X-rays to assess for any signs of pneumonia,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of right ankle ORIF, ARDS due to influenza, and now with a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support (PS) 5/5 and has been weaned off sedation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 130/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is receiving several medications including fentanyl, versed, cefepime, vancomycin, and metoprolol. The patient's fluid balance is slightly negative, and her nutritional intake is via a feeding tube.

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as maintaining proper head-of-bed elevation, performing regular oral care, and using appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis should be implemented to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility due to bed rest increases the risk of DVT. The patient is already on prophylactic measures like boots to prevent DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged mechanical ventilation and the use of corticosteroids can increase the"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 52-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure due to ARDS caused by the influenza virus. She has undergone tracheostomy and PEG placement.
- She has a history of right ankle ORIF and ARDS.
- Her current medications include metoprolol for hypertension, flecainide and metoprolol for SVT with aberrancy, and nutrition through a feeding tube.
- She is receiving prophylactic treatment for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
- Her vital signs are stable with a temperature within normal range, blood pressure slightly elevated, heart rate within normal range, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 99%.
- She has a history of unclear source of previous fevers, but her recent HIDA scan shows no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
- She also has a sinus infection with yeast growth, and pending cultures are being evaluated.
- She has been weaned to a tracheostomy mask and will continue to be weaned to humidified air.
- Her fluid balance goal is slightly negative.
- She has a stable right ankle fracture post ORIF.
- She is on full nutrition via feeding tube.
- Her glycemic control is well-controlled.
- She has multiple lines, including a central line that is non-functioning and awaiting culture.
- She has received various prophylactic treatments.
- She has a DNR status.
- She is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The ICU care plan includes measures to prevent VAP, such as maintaining head-of-bed elevation, performing regular mouth care, and using chlorhexidine for line insertion.
2. bloodstream infections: The patient has multiple lines, including a central line, which can serve as a potential source of bloodstream infection. The non-functioning central line has been sent for culture, indicating concern for possible infection.
3. Sinus infection: The patient has a sinus infection with yeast growth, which may require treatment with antifungals. Monitoring for any worsening of symptoms or spread of infection is important.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and she is on metoprolol for hypertension. Close monitoring of blood pressure and adjustment of medication may be necessary.
5. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance goal is slightly negative. Monitoring intake and output and adjusting fluid administration accordingly is important to maintain appropriate fluid balance.
6. Wound infection: Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's history of surgery (ankle ORIF) increases the risk of wound infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or drainage, is important.
7. Delirium: The patient's recent ICU admission and prolonged sedation can increase the risk of delir"

   HIDA
   Serial images over the abdomen show normal uptake of tracer into the he
   patic
   parenchyma.  At 67 minutes, the gallbladder is visualized with tracer a
   ctivity
   noted in the small bowel at 11 minutes.
   The above findings are consistent with normal filling of the gallbladde
   r.
   IMPRESSION: No scintigraphic evidence of acute cholecystitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   52F s/p R ankle ORIF, ARDS [**1-13**] influenza, now s/p trach/PEG.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Etiology ARDS [**1-13**] flu. Trach'd, now on
   PS 5/5.
   Weaned to trach mask today.  Will cont to wean to humidified air.
   # ID
   Afebrile x 24 hrs.
   Unclear source of previous fevers.
   Will discuss w/ ID whether keeping on FLAGYL, CEFEPIME, VANCO is best.
   Appears acalculous cholecystitis is not playing a role in fevers given
   HIDA findings, LFTs trending down.
   Evaluated sinus infection w/ ENT, cultures pending, growing yeast.  ?
   treat, will check w/ ID.
   -          cont saline / afrin for sinuns infeciton
   -          ? treat abx / antifungals, check w/ ID
   - Follow pending blood, line tip cultures; follow CXR
   - CDiff negative x3, can dc precautions
   - d/c A-line and send for culture (not functioning)
   Hypertension:
   Metoprolol 50 tid
   SVT with aberrancy: continue flecainide and metoprolol.
   Fluid balance: Goal slightly negative.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of right ankle ORIF, ARDS due to influenza, and tracheostomy with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. 

The patient's recent events include a negative HIDA scan, indicating no evidence of acute cholecystitis. Her mental status has improved, as she is now more interactive. The healthcare team is maintaining cefepime, an antibiotic that penetrates the cerebrospinal fluid and is used for bacterial meningitis, at current dosing while holding on low-pressure ventilation (LP). 

The patient's allergies include penicillins, anaphylaxis, sulfa (sulfonamides), anaphylaxis, shellfish-derived substances causing rash, iodine with unknown reaction, and red dye with unknown reaction. 

The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on 03/14/2114 at 08:15 AM, cefepime on 03/14/2114 at 11:37 AM, and metronidazole on 03/15/2114 at 06:07 AM. 

In terms of infusions, the patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole (Protonix), and other ICU medications.

","The patient is a 52-year-old female who underwent right ankle ORIF, ARDS due to influenza, and subsequently had a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She is currently on cefepime and vancomycin for gram-positive cocci pairs/clusters in her sputum. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 103/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a pressure support level of 12 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her ABG results are pending. 

The patient's physical examination reveals that she appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. Her tracheostomy tube is in place, and she has mildly coarse breath sounds bilaterally. Her cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and her peripheral pulses are present and intact. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.5, hemoglobin of 25.9, platelet count of 447, creatinine of 0.5, total carbon dioxide of 43, glucose of 127, and other labs"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome. She was admitted on [**2114-2-1**] for an ORIF procedure and now presents with complications including pulmonary edema, influenza, and ARDS. The patient has been intubated since [**2114-2-13**] and is slowly but definitely improving from respiratory failure.

Medical Complications:

1. ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE: The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with a recent decrease in driving pressure and PEEP. She has been converted to PSV mode but experiences periodic breathing. The differential diagnosis includes high PaCO2 and primary neurologic causes. Poor mental status persists despite sedation reduction, and a VP shunt has been considered. A head CT will be performed to assess vent size.

2. LOW-GRADE FEVER: The patient continues to have fevers without a clear source. There is an increase in sputum density in the right lower lobe, and Vancomycin/Cefepime has been started. Original cultures will be followed up, and an endotracheal aspirate will be sent for analysis. Elevated liver function tests have prompted a RUQ US and a sinus CT while performing a head CT. CVL and PICC lines have been removed, and an arterial line has been reset.

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old woman with reported hx of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome
   admitted [**2114-2-1**] for ORIF, now with a complicated post-operative
   including pulmonary edema, influenza, and ARDS s/p intubation on [**2114-2-13**]
   with persistent but slowly improving respiratory failure.
    ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - intubated [**2114-2-13**].  T/G [**2114-3-8**]
   - try trach mask today
   Mental Status:
          Received heavy sedation for extended period, which is most
   likely cause
          CT reassuring
          Has improved significantly since yesterday
          We are awaiting formal hematology recs about the safety of
   LP given hx of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome.  However, the benefits of LP
   have fallen, since her mental status is improving so we will likely
   defer this test.
   LOW-GRADE FEVER
   -          Most likely source is sinuses.  Lines have all been removed
   or changed, and venetilatory status is improving
   -          HIDA (-) in this picture adequately excludes cholecystitis
   SINUSITIS
   She has evidence, both by CT and endoscopically, of fairly significant
   sinusitis.  An endoscopically obtained sample from the middle meatus is
   so far only showing
yeast.
  Although this may just be a colonizer, we
   will ask ID to re-visit her for assistance in further evaluation.
   WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA (AFIB WITH ABERRANCY
   -          Appreciate EP consult.  On Flecainide with B blockade.  We
   will ask EP to comment on course of rx.
   ANEMIA
   - Stable
   Ankle fracture
   - Ortho following, cast off.  Will eventually need further work, but I
   would advocate holding off until she has recovered substantially.
   DNR
   FAMILY MEETING
   Held in the afternoon at about 3:30pm.  All questions answered.
   DISPO
   She remains critically ill.  However, if she continues to progress at
   the current pace then she will likely be ready for rehab next week.  We
   will ask case management to consult.
   Other issues as per ICU team note.

","The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) procedure. She is currently in the ICU with multiple complications, including pulmonary edema, influenza, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been intubated since February 13th and is now being weaned off mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's current assessment includes acute respiratory failure, low-grade fever, sinusitis, wide complex tachycardia (atrial fibrillation with aberrancy), anemia, ankle fracture, and do not resuscitate (DNR) status. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/97 to 170/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her weight has increased from 65.8 kg at admission to 83.5 kg currently. 

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, but her kidney function may be slightly impaired. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin appearance, normal cardiovascular examination, obscured upper airway sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both extremities, warm skin, and decreased"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old woman with hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted [**2114-2-1**] for
   ORIF, now with a complicated post-operative including pulmonary edema,
   influenza, and ARDS s/p intubation on [**2114-2-13**] with persistent resp
   failure
    ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - intubated [**2114-2-13**].  T/G [**2114-3-8**]
   - Further weaned vent with drop to a driving pressure of 8, decrease
   PEEP to 8
 did well.
   - Converted to PSV
 has periodic breathing.  DDx high PaCo2, primary
   neurologic
   Poor Mental Status: certainly did get heavy sedation for extended
   period, however still not waking up, VP shunt
 would check head CT
   today to assess vent size.
   LOW-GRADE FEVER
   -          still with fevers without clear source.  Now 101 today. GPC
   in sputum with slightly increased density in RLL. Start Vanco/Cefipime,
   follow up original culture
 send endotracheal aspirate.
   -          Elevated LFTS slightly check RUQ US
   -          Sinus CT while at head CT
   -          Removed CVL, PICC
   -          Resited A line
   Consult ID
   WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA
   -          Appreciate Ep consult on Flecainide with B blockade
   -          Discuss with cards
   ANEMIA
   - Stable
   Ankle fracture
   - Ortho following, cast off.
   SEDATION
   - continue to slowly decrease sedation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to ARDS caused by influenza. The patient has a history of fever and leukocytosis, with possible sources including pulmonary, sinus, gallbladder, intraabdominal, or meningitis. Antibiotics have been started to cover for pulmonary and meningitis infections, and metronidazole was added for intraabdominal organisms. The patient also has a history of multiple fractures in the right ankle, which underwent ORIF surgery. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slight elevation in blood pressure. Fluid balance needs to be monitored, and the patient's sodium levels need to be corrected. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is expected to be weaned off sedation soon. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS. There is a risk of further deterioration or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Infection: The patient has signs of fever and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection. The source of infection could be pulmonary, sinus, gallbladder, intraabdominal, or meningitis. Proper management of antibiotics is crucial to prevent the spread of infection.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia. This condition can lead to dehydration"

","The patient is a 52-year-old female who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for a fracture. She has a history of flu and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which led to the placement of a tracheostomy (trach) collar. Currently, she is on positive airway pressure (PS) ventilation and tolerates the trach mask. The plan is to keep her in the trach mask and retry passive mode ventilation (PMV) speaking valve today.

The patient has been febrile since March 13th and has had a rising white blood cell count from 12,500 on March 13th to 25,000 on March 16th. Despite being on cefepime and vancomycin, no obvious source of infection has been found as all cultures have been negative. However, a differential count showing 95% polys and 1 band suggests some sort of infection. Considering her ventriculoperitoneal (vP) shunt and negative cultures, the next possible source that needs to be evaluated is her central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, a lumbar puncture (LP) will be performed today.

The patient is also being treated for sinusitis with aggressive saline flushes, and the use of cefepime and vancomycin will continue for empirical coverage of sinusitis for three weeks. All cultures will be followed up, and if yeast grows in culture, treatment for fungal infection of the sinus"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   52-year-old woman with reported hx of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome
   admitted [**2114-2-1**] for ORIF, now with a complicated post-operative
   including pulmonary edema, influenza, and ARDS s/p intubation on [**2114-2-13**]
   with persistent but slowly improving respiratory failure.  She is
   slowly weaning from the ventilator, but main issue now is leucocytosis
   and improving but still not normal mental status.
    ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - intubated [**2114-2-13**].  T/G [**2114-3-8**]
   - back on ventilator last evening for fatigue. Will trial PS/CPAP again
   today and then hopefully TC . will diurese goal net neg today.
   Mental Status:
          CT reassuring
          Continues to have definite improvement, although not back to
   normal. Seems to be slowly impriving.
          Hematology
s recommendations about amikar peri-LP are
   appreciated.  See
leucocytosis
 regarding LP
   LEUCOCYTOSIS (now afebrile): slightly decreased today.
   -          At least in part this  is sinuses, which are a clear issue
   on Afrin, ABX and .  Cultures only with budding yeast (not thought to
   be pathogenic)
   -          Lines have all been removed or changed. C. dif has been neg
   on many samples
   -          Ventilatory status is improving  PNA unlikely
   -          HIDA (-) in this picture adequately excludes cholecystitis
   -          Repeat UA ([**3-17**]): looks cloudy today.
   -          By report, no diarrhea (although C diff toxin is ordered and
   multiple samples neg)
   -          also concerned about VP shunt infection: with high WBC in
   LP. Awaiting the VP shunt results. Will f/u with neurosurg re:
   management.  Unsure on whether this is infection. Continue Cefepime and
   Vanco (at meningitis doses)
          No eosinophilia (do not think this is a drug fever)
   SINUSITIS
   She has evidence, both by CT and endoscopically, of fairly significant
   sinusitis.  An endoscopically obtained sample from the middle meatus is
   so far only showing
yeast.
  Appreciate ID
s thoughts about this being
   unlikely to be a pathogen.  Will continue present Rx for now.
   WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA (AFIB WITH ABERRANCY
   -          Appreciate EP consult.  On Flecainide with B blockade for a
   month, per EP.
   HTN
   - metop. Well controlled at present.
   ANEMIA
   - Stable
   Ankle fracture
   - Ortho following, cast off.  Will eventually need further work, but I
   would advocate holding off until she has recovered substantially.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 52-year-old woman admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) procedure. She has a complicated post-operative course including pulmonary edema, influenza, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated on February 13th and has been slowly weaning off the ventilator but still requires assistance. 

The patient's current medical issues include acute respiratory failure, mental status changes, leucocytosis (high white blood cell count), sinusitis, wide complex tachycardia (atrial fibrillation with aberrancy), hypertension, anemia, and an ankle fracture. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) order in place.

The patient is currently on the ventilator and needs to settle issues such as leucocytosis and potential VP shunt infection before considering weaning off the ventilator. Other issues are noted in the ICU team's note. The patient's nutrition is being provided through a feeding tube with Nutren 2.0, and her glycemic control is being managed with regular insulin sliding scale. She has multiple lines inserted, including a central line, and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's condition is critically ill, and ongoing monitoring and management are required."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a reported history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). She developed post-operative complications including pulmonary edema, influenza, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intubation on February 13th. The patient has been slowly weaning from the ventilator but still experiences respiratory failure. She also has leucocytosis and an improving but not normal mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's main issue is persistent but slowly improving respiratory failure. She was intubated on February 13th and briefly taken off the ventilator but had to be placed back on it due to fatigue. She will be tried on pressure support/continuous positive airway pressure (PS/CPAP) again today and then potentially tested for weaning from the ventilator.

2. Leucocytosis: The patient has leucocytosis, which is a high white blood cell count. This can be due to infection or other causes. The source of leucocytosis could be sinusitis, as there is evidence of significant sinusitis on CT and endoscopic examination. The yeast found in the sample from the middle meatus is unlikely to be a pathogen, but further identification is pending. The patient's lines have been removed or changed, and cultures are negative for Clostridium difficile (C"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   52-year-old woman with reported hx of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome
   admitted [**2114-2-1**] for ORIF, now with a complicated post-operative
   including pulmonary edema, influenza, and ARDS s/p intubation on [**2114-2-13**]
   with persistent but slowly improving respiratory failure.  She is
   slowly weaning from the ventilator, but main issue now is leucocytosis
   and improving but still not normal mental status.
    ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - intubated [**2114-2-13**].  T/G [**2114-3-8**]
   - back on ventilator last evening for fatigue. Will trial PS/CPAP again
   today and then hopefully TC . will diurese goal net neg today.
   Mental Status:
          CT reassuring
          Continues to have definite improvement, although not back to
   normal. Seems to be slowly impriving.
          Hematology
s recommendations about amikar peri-LP are
   appreciated.  See
leucocytosis
 regarding LP
   LEUCOCYTOSIS (now afebrile): slightly decreased today.
   -          At least in part this  is sinuses, which are a clear issue
   on Afrin, ABX and .  Await cultures
   -          Lines have all been removed or changed. C. dif has been neg
   on many samples
   -          Ventilatory status is improving
 PNA unlikely
   -          HIDA (-) in this picture adequately excludes cholecystitis
   -          Repeat UA ([**3-17**]): looks cloudy today.
   -          By report, no diarrhea (although C diff toxin is ordered)
   -          also concerned about VP shunt infection: with high WBC in
   LP. Awaiting the VP shunt results. Will f/u with neurosurg re:
   management.  Unsure on whether this is infection. Continue Cefepime and
   Vanco (at meningitis doses)
          No eosinophilia (do not think this is a drug fever)
   SINUSITIS
   She has evidence, both by CT and endoscopically, of fairly significant
   sinusitis.  An endoscopically obtained sample from the middle meatus is
   so far only showing
yeast.
  Appreciate ID
s thoughts about this being
   unlikely to be a pathogen.  Will continue present Rx for now.
   WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA (AFIB WITH ABERRANCY
   -          Appreciate EP consult.  On Flecainide with B blockade for a
   month, per EP.
   HTN
   - metop. Well controlled at present.
   ANEMIA
   - Stable
   Ankle fracture
   - Ortho following, cast off.  Will eventually need further work, but I
   would advocate holding off until she has recovered substantially.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome.
- She was admitted on [**2114-2-1**] for an operation and developed post-operative complications, including pulmonary edema, influenza, and ARDS.
- She has been intubated since [**2114-2-13**] and is slowly weaning from the ventilator.
- The main issues now are leukocytosis and improving but still not normal mental status.
- The patient has several medical conditions, including acute respiratory failure, mental status changes, hematology concerns, leucocytosis, sinusitis, wide complex tachycardia (AFIB with aberrancy), hypertension, anemia, ankle fracture, and DNR status.
- The patient is still on the ventilator and needs to settle the issues mentioned above before considering vent weaning.
- The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and appropriate prophylaxis measures.
- The patient's condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and early identification of any signs of infection are crucial.
2. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has a history of wide complex tachycardia (AFIB with aberrancy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who underwent right ankle ORIF and is now in a cast. She is also diagnosed with ARDS following the flu and has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She is currently on cefepime and vancomycin due to concerns for meningitis.

24-hour events include an increase in work of breathing and high pCO2, returning to PS 5/5 after a brief tracheostomy mask trial; PMV tolerated for 5 minutes. A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed, which was traumatic. A neurosurgical consultation resulted in a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement. Orthopedic consultation led to the application of a right lower extremity (RLE) cast.

Allergies include penicillins, unknown anaphylaxis; sulfa (sulfonamides), anaphylaxis; shellfish-derived, rash; iodine, unknown; red dye, unknown. The last doses of antibiotics were metronidazole on 03/15/2014 at 02:10 PM, ceftriaxone on 03/17/2014 at 02:30 AM, vancomycin on 03/17/2014 at 08:00 AM, and cefepime on 03/17/2014 at 01:02 PM.

Infusions include other ICU medications and other medications. There are no changes to the medical and family history. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Vital signs as of 03/17/2014 at 05:45 PM are as follows: temperature (Tmax) at 36.7 degrees Celsius (98%), current temperature at 36.7 degrees Celsius (98%), heart rate (HR) at 67 beats per minute (61-86 bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 162/83 mmHg to 102/65 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 23 breaths per minute (15-36 bpm), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 98%.

Hemodynamic monitoring shows an increase in fluid balance with a total input of 3,164 mL and output of 1,300 mL. The patient's weight is currently 83.5 kg, with a baseline admission weight of 65.8 kg.

Respiratory support includes the use of a tracheostomy mask, CPAP/PSV ventilator mode, set tidal volume (Vt) at 440 mL (380-490 mL), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) deferred due to RR"

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who is currently in the ICU. She underwent right ankle ORIF (operative repair of injured fracture) and now has a cast on her right lower extremity. The patient also has ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to flu, and there are concerns about meningitis.

24-hour events include increased work of breathing, high pCO2, return to PS 5/5 after a brief tracheostomy mask trial; PMV (partial mandatory ventilation) tolerated for 5 minutes. A traumatic lumbar puncture was performed, and a VP (ventriculoperitoneal) shunt tap was done due to neurosurgical consultation. An orthopedic consultation led to the placement of a right lower extremity cast.

   Imaging:
   [**3-17**] CXR pending official read
   [**3-15**] ankle three views:
   Compared with [**2114-2-3**], the cast has been removed. Again seen are
   multiple pins through the medial malleolus and a screw through the
   tibia and fibula at the level of syndesmosis. No true mortise view is
   available. Allowing for
   this, the mortise does appear asymmetric, wider medially, similar to
   the appearance on the AP view from [**2114-2-3**]. Heterotopic ossification
   and tiny metallic flecks are noted medially. A nondisplaced posterior
   tibial fracture is again noted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who is currently in the ICU for ARDS secondary to the flu. She has undergone ORIF of the right ankle and is now in a cast. The patient is on cefepime and vancomycin for concern of meningitis. She has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 162/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. The patient's recent events include a traumatic lumbar puncture, placement of a VP shunt, and application of an RLE cast. Allergies include penicillins, sulfa, shellfish, and iodine. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 28.9 K/uL, elevated CRP, and thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 501 K/uL. Imaging reveals an asymmetric mortise with heterotopic ossification and a nondisplaced posterior tibial fracture. Microbiology results are negative for C. difficile and show no microorganisms in the CSF gram stain. The patient's assessment and plan include hypoxic respiratory failure due to ARDS, anxiety, fluid restriction, infection control measures, hypertension management"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 52-year-old female who has undergone right ankle ORIF and is now casted. She has a history of ARDS due to the flu and concerns for meningitis. The patient is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy.

The patient's recent events include being pancultured due to a change in mental status and becoming diaphoretic. A VP shunt tap was completed, and an MRI head with gadolinium was requested. An ID consult was also requested, but imaging could not be performed due to an aneurysm clip present in the brain.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.3°F (axillary) and 35.6°C (rectal), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109-184/65-83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 50%. The patient's neurological status is as follows: awake, alert, laying in bed, sweaty extremities, unable to move fingers/toes on command, unreliable finger follow, able to move head left/right, equivocal Babinski reflex on right foot, and increased reflexes bilaterally.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 501 K/u"

   - Vent plan o/n: Rest on PS 5/5
   - Neurosurg: Sent for CDiff A, B; VP shunt tap completed (results in
   OMR).  Requested ID consult.
   - ID: Will officially consult on Sunday.  MRI head with gad requested.
   - Imaging: MRI head impossible given brain aneurysm clip, and the fact
   we do not know make/model.  Will need to contact [**Name (NI) 1244**] neurosurgeon
   [**Name (NI) 1991**] (name and number on whiteboard) to determine make/model of
   brain aneurysm clip.
   - Weight in bed measured for baseline after foley d/c'd as concern for
   it being source of infection; will use daily weights to assess fluid
   status.
   - Fluid: Put out 1L with furosemide 20mg IV x1, written for furosemide
   20mg IV x2 again for p.m. and o/n diuresis.

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old woman with reported hx of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome
   admitted [**2114-2-1**] for ORIF, now with a complicated post-operative
   including pulmonary edema, influenza, and ARDS s/p intubation on [**2114-2-13**]
   with persistent but slowly improving respiratory failure.  She is
   slowly weaning from the ventilator, but main issue now is leucocytosis
   and improving but still not normal mental status. The significant
   concern now is whether the VP shunt is infected.
    ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - intubated [**2114-2-13**].  T/G [**2114-3-8**]
   - [**Last Name (un) **] collar in dayPS/CPAP again today and then hopefully TC . Goal
   net negative daily (500 cc a day)
   Mental Status: seems to have plateau'd of late, concerning given the VP
   shunt with elevated WBC
          CT reassuring (no bleed or dilated ventricles)
          Continues to have slow improvement (no real change in last
   48 hrs), although not back to normal.
   LEUCOCYTOSIS (now afebrile): elevated, [**3-17**] down to 27 (awaiting [**3-18**]
   labs)
   -          At least in part this  is sinuses, which are a clear issue
   on Afrin, ABX and .  Cultures only with budding yeast (not thought to
   be pathogenic)
   -          Lines have all been removed or changed. C. dif has been neg
   on many samples (neg again [**3-17**])
   -          Ventilatory status is improving  PNA unlikely (repeat CXR no
   change [**3-18**])
   -          HIDA (-) in this picture adequately excludes cholecystitis
   -          Repeat UA ([**3-17**]): looks cloudy (12 WBC, trace leuk esterase,
   neg nitrite, urine culture pending),remove foley
   -          By report, no diarrhea (although C diff toxin is ordered and
   multiple samples neg)
   -          also concerned about VP shunt infection: with high WBC in
   LP. Awaiting the VP shunt results. Will f/u with neurosurg re:
   management.  Unsure on whether this is infection. Continue Cefepime and
   Vanco (at meningitis doses). We are awaiting input from ID and
   neurosurg. We are going to try to get MRI (but she has a clip from her
   aneurysm so we need to determine if this is safe to do)
          No eosinophilia (do not think this is a drug fever/WBC)
   SINUSITIS
   She has evidence, both by CT and endoscopically, of fairly significant
   sinusitis.  An endoscopically obtained sample from the middle meatus is
   so far only showing
yeast.
  Appreciate ID
s thoughts about this being
   unlikely to be a pathogen.  Will continue present Rx for now.
   WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA (AFIB WITH ABERRANCY
   -          Appreciate EP input.  On Flecainide with B blockade for a
   month, per EP.
   HTN: a little higher today. [**Month (only) 60**] need some additional prn control
   - metop.
   ANEMIA
   - Stable
    Ankle fracture
   - Ortho followin.  Will eventually need further work, but I would
   advocate holding off until she has recovered substantially.
   Other Issues per ICU resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old woman with a reported history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who was admitted on [**2114-2-1**] for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. She now presents with complications including pulmonary edema, influenza, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following endotracheal intubation on [**2114-2-13**]. The main concerns at this time include leukocytosis, improving but still abnormal mental status, and the possibility of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt infection.

The patient has been intubated since [**2114-2-13**] and is currently on pressure support/continuous positive airway pressure (PS/CPAP). The goal is to wean her off the ventilator and transition to a tracheostomy collar soon. Her mental status has plateaued recently, which is concerning given the VP shunt and elevated white blood cell count. A CT scan shows no bleed or dilated ventricles, indicating no acute changes.

Leukocytosis is present, with a count of 27 (awaiting labs). This is attributed in part to sinusitis, for which the patient is receiving antibiotics. Cultures have only shown budding yeast, which is not considered pathogenic. All lines have been removed or changed, and Clostridium difficile (C."

   change [**3-18**])
   -          HIDA (-) in this picture adequately excludes cholecystitis
   -          Repeat UA ([**3-17**]): looks cloudy (12 WBC, trace leuk esterase,
   neg nitrite, urine culture pending),remove foley
   -          By report, no diarrhea (although C diff toxin is ordered and
   multiple samples neg)
   -          also concerned about VP shunt infection: with high WBC in
   LP. Awaiting the VP shunt results. Will f/u with neurosurg re:
   management.  Unsure on whether this is infection. Continue Cefepime and
   Vanco (at meningitis doses). We are awaiting input from ID and
   neurosurg. We are going to try to get MRI (but she has a clip from her
   aneurysm so we need to determine if this is safe to do)
          No eosinophilia (do not think this is a drug fever/WBC)
   SINUSITIS
   She has evidence, both by CT and endoscopically, of fairly significant
   sinusitis.  An endoscopically obtained sample from the middle meatus is
   so far only showing
yeast.
  Appreciate ID
s thoughts about this being
   unlikely to be a pathogen.  Will continue present Rx for now.
   WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA (AFIB WITH ABERRANCY
   -          Appreciate EP input.  On Flecainide with B blockade for a
   month, per EP.
   HTN: a little higher today. [**Month (only) 60**] need some additional prn control
   - metop.
   ANEMIA
   - Stable
    Ankle fracture
   - Ortho followin.  Will eventually need further work, but I would
   advocate holding off until she has recovered substantially.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old woman with a reported history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome. She was admitted on [**2114-2-1**] for an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture. However, she developed complications post-operatively, including pulmonary edema, influenza, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated on [**2114-2-13**] and has been slowly weaning from the ventilator.

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, mental status changes, leucocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), sinusitis, wide complex tachycardia (atrial fibrillation with aberrancy), hypertension, anemia, and an ankle fracture. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and analgesics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Proper measures, such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, and daily awakening, are being implemented to prevent VAP.

2. Central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient has multiple central venous catheters in place, which can increase the risk of bloodstream infections. Regular monitoring and appropriate care of the lines should be maintained to minimize this risk.

3. Deep vein throm"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of right ankle ORIF, s/p ARDS from the flu, and concern for meningitis. She is currently on invasive ventilation and has undergone an MRI. The patient does not respond to verbal commands but nods no when asked if she is in pain. She has multiple allergies, including penicillins, sulfa, shellfish-derived, iodine, and red dye. Her last dose of antibiotics was on [**2114-3-17**] at 02:30 AM. She is receiving various ICU medications and has an ongoing fever curve that is improving. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure due to ARDS from the flu.
2. Meningitis, possibly secondary to a VP shunt or sinusitis. Cultures are pending, and HSV PCR is also pending.
3. Possible UTI, as indicated by the UA results.
4. C.difficile infection, although currently negative.
5. Hypertension, which is stable and being treated with metoprolol.
6. SVT/aberrancy, which is stable and being treated with flecainide and metoprolol.
7. R ankle fracture s/p ORIF, with a cast placed per ortho.
8. The patient's lack of response to verbal commands could indicate a neurological issue or encephalitis.
9. The patient's overall condition requires careful monitoring and management"

   team
s note reflects my input.
   Key points:
     * Resp failure s/p influenza, ARDS, tolerated long trach mask period
       today. Appeared more comfortable on trach mask today.
     * Leukocytosis, question of VP shunt infection
     * Mental status
     *
    ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - intubated [**2114-2-13**].  T/G [**2114-3-8**]
   - [**Last Name (un) **] collar in dayPS/CPAP again today and then hopefully TC . Goal
   net negative daily (500 cc a day)
   Mental Status: seems to have plateau'd of late, concerning given the VP
   shunt with elevated WBC
          CT reassuring (no bleed or dilated ventricles)
          Continues to have slow improvement (no real change in last
   48 hrs), although not back to normal.
   LEUCOCYTOSIS (now afebrile): elevated, [**3-17**] down to 27 (awaiting [**3-18**]
   labs)
   -          At least in part this  is sinuses, which are a clear issue
   on Afrin, ABX and .  Cultures only with budding yeast (not thought to
   be pathogenic)
   -          Lines have all been removed or changed. C. dif has been neg
   on many samples (neg again [**3-17**])
   -          Ventilatory status is improving  PNA unlikely (repeat CXR no
   change [**3-18**])
   -          HIDA (-) in this picture adequately excludes cholecystitis
   -          Repeat UA ([**3-17**]): looks cloudy (12 WBC, trace leuk esterase,
   neg nitrite, urine culture pending),remove foley
   -          By report, no diarrhea (although C diff toxin is ordered and
   multiple samples neg)
   -          also concerned about VP shunt infection: with high WBC in
   LP. Awaiting the VP shunt results. Will f/u with neurosurg re:
   management.  Unsure on whether this is infection. Continue Cefepime and
   Vanco (at meningitis doses). We are awaiting input from ID and
   neurosurg. We are going to try to get MRI (but she has a clip from her
   aneurysm so we need to determine if this is safe to do)
          No eosinophilia (do not think this is a drug fever/WBC)
   SINUSITIS
   She has evidence, both by CT and endoscopically, of fairly significant
   sinusitis.  An endoscopically obtained sample from the middle meatus is
   so far only showing
yeast.
  Appreciate ID
s thoughts about this being
   unlikely to be a pathogen.  Will continue present Rx for now.
   WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA (AFIB WITH ABERRANCY
   -          Appreciate EP input.  On Flecainide with B blockade for a
   month, per EP.
   HTN: a little higher today. [**Month (only) 60**] need some additional prn control
   - metop.
   ANEMIA
   - Stable
    Ankle fracture
   - Ortho followin.  Will eventually need further work, but I would
   advocate holding off until she has recovered substantially.

          Mental status altered and not continuing to improve as it

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who has been critically ill since admission. She was intubated on 2/13/2114 due to acute respiratory failure secondary to influenza and ARDS. The patient has tolerated a long trach mask period and appeared more comfortable today. Mental status has plateaued and is concerning, especially with the VP shunt and elevated WBC. CT scan is reassuring, showing no bleed or dilated ventricles. The patient continues to have slow improvement but is not back to normal.

Medical history includes:
- Recent ankle ORIF, now casted
- ARDS following flu
- Concern for meningitis
- Hypoxic respiratory failure with etiology ARDS flu
- Tracheostomy performed
- Anxiety controlled with lorazepam PRN
- Fluid goal: even to net negative 500cc
- ID discussed cerebritis with ID/Neurosurg - preliminary MRI read without evidence of cerebritis, though meningeal enhancement c/w meningitis. Cultures still pending. HSV PCR pending.
- Source: (1) VP shunt: No clear evidence of meningitis by labs; but MRI c/w meningitis. Cultures still pending. HSV PCR pending.
- (2) Sinusitis: Saline flushes with collar inflated. Improvement seen by MRI of sinusitis. On therapy currently.
- (3) Stool: CDiff negative x2 ([3-16] and [3-17]); sent for Cdiff B pending- no diarrhea at this time.
- (4) Urine: UA, Ucx. UA c/w with possible UTI, though cultures pending.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current assessment includes:
- Hypoxic respiratory failure: Etiology ARDS flu. Trach'd, PS 5/5, tolerated trach collar but returned to PS given increased WOB.
- Anxiety: Control with lorazepam PRN
- Fluid: Goal even to net negative 500cc

   Mrs [**Known lastname **]  was seen and examined with the ICU team, and I was
   physically present for key portions of the services rendered.  The ICU
   team
s note reflects my input.
   Key points:
     * Resp failure s/p influenza, ARDS, tolerated long trach mask period
       today. Appeared more comfortable on trach mask today.
     * Leukocytosis, question of VP shunt infection
     * Mental status
     *
    ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   - intubated [**2114-2-13**].  T/G [**2114-3-8**]
   - [**Last Name (un) **] collar in dayPS/CPAP again today and then hopefully TC . Goal
   net negative daily (500 cc a day)
   Mental Status: seems to have plateau'd of late, concerning given the VP
   shunt with elevated WBC
          CT reassuring (no bleed or dilated ventricles)
          Continues to have slow improvement (no real change in last
   48 hrs), although not back to normal.
   LEUCOCYTOSIS (now afebrile): elevated, [**3-17**] down to 27 (awaiting [**3-18**]
   labs)
   -          At least in part this  is sinuses, which are a clear issue
   on Afrin, ABX and .  Cultures only with budding yeast (not thought to
   be pathogenic)
   -          Lines have all been removed or changed. C. dif has been neg
   on many samples (neg again [**3-17**])
   -          Ventilatory status is improving  PNA unlikely (repeat CXR no
   change [**3-18**])
   -          HIDA (-) in this picture adequately excludes cholecystitis
   -          Repeat UA ([**3-17**]): looks cloudy (12 WBC, trace leuk esterase,
   neg nitrite, urine culture pending),remove foley
   -          By report, no diarrhea (although C diff toxin is ordered and
   multiple samples neg)
   -          also concerned about VP shunt infection: with high WBC in
   LP. Awaiting the VP shunt results. Will f/u with neurosurg re:
   management.  Unsure on whether this is infection. Continue Cefepime and
   Vanco (at meningitis doses). We are awaiting input from ID and
   neurosurg. We are going to try to get MRI (but she has a clip from her
   aneurysm so we need to determine if this is safe to do)
          No eosinophilia (do not think this is a drug fever/WBC)
   SINUSITIS
   She has evidence, both by CT and endoscopically, of fairly significant
   sinusitis.  An endoscopically obtained sample from the middle meatus is
   so far only showing
yeast.
  Appreciate ID
s thoughts about this being
   unlikely to be a pathogen.  Will continue present Rx for now.
   WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA (AFIB WITH ABERRANCY
   -          Appreciate EP input.  On Flecainide with B blockade for a
   month, per EP.
   HTN: a little higher today. [**Month (only) 60**] need some additional prn control
   - metop.
   ANEMIA
   - Stable
    Ankle fracture
   - Ortho followin.  Will eventually need further work, but I would
   advocate holding off until she has recovered substantially.

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of ankle ORIF, s/p ARDS [1-13] flu, concern for meningitis. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, tracheostomy, and has been weaned off the ventilator. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, intubated on [2114-2-13], tracheostomy performed on [2114-3-8], and currently on CPAP/PSV mode. 

The patient's mental status has plateaued of late, which is concerning given the VP shunt with elevated WBC. A CT scan was reassuring, showing no bleed or dilated ventricles. The patient continues to have slow improvement but is not back to normal. 

Leukocytosis is present, with a count of 27 (awaiting [3-18] labs). The elevated WBC count is partially attributed to sinuses, which are an issue on Afrin, ABX, and cultures only show budding yeast (not thought to be pathogenic). 

Lines have all been removed or changed, and C. diff has been negative on multiple samples. The patient's ventilatory status is improving, and pneumonia is unlikely (repeat CXR no change [3-18]). 

A repeat UA ([3-17]) shows cloudy urine with 12 WBC, trace leuk esterase, negative nitrite, and urine culture pending. The Foley catheter should"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of right ankle ORIF (operative repair of ankle fracture) who is now casted. She also has a past medical history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) following the flu, and there are concerns for meningitis.

The patient is currently in the ICU and is being ventilated via tracheostomy with CPAP/PSV mode, with a set FiO2 of 50%. Her vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 177/88 mmHg to 123/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count of 19.3 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's platelet count is within normal range. The coagulation profile shows a prolonged PT and PTT, but normal INR. Other lab values such as electrolytes, kidney function, and cardiac markers are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds bilaterally, and she has trace pedal edema on the left side with a wound present on the right lower extremity. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, responds to verbal stimuli,"

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Mild pachymeningeal enhancement can be consistent with inflammatory
   response from the ventricular shunt catheter. The fact that this
   enhancement
   is not nodular makes the possibility of acute meningitis less likely,
   although
   clinical correlation is recommended. Mild edema remains along the
   ventricular
   shunt catheter route as it traverses the right frontal lobe.
   2. Persistent but improved sinus disease including an air-fluid level
   within
   the left maxillary and bilateral sphenoid sinuses.
   3. No abnormal enhancing lesions or intra-axial parenchymal edema to
   suggest
   HSVas clinically suspected.
   CXR [**3-20**]:
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-19**], the patient is
   substantially
   obliqued, somewhat degrading the image. Nevertheless, the bilateral
   pulmonary
   opacities are again seen and the tracheostomy tube remains in place.

Summary:
- The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who underwent VP shunt placement for a cerebral aneurysm.
- She was admitted to the ICU after undergoing ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) for a right ankle fracture.
- The patient developed hypoxia and was intubated, later tracheostomized due to influenza/ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
- She has been diagnosed with pseudomonas pneumonia and underwent tracheostomy percutaneous dilatational (trach peg).
- There are concerns about meningitis and VP shunt infection.
- The patient's current condition includes flaccid paralysis, which may be due to ICU myopathy or a central process.
- She has a history of seizures/syncope episode and hypertension, for which she is on metoprolol.
- The patient also has sinus disease, including an air-fluid level within the left maxillary and bilateral sphenoid sinuses.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: Given the concerns about VP shunt infection and altered mental status, there is a potential risk of meningitis. The MRI head did not show evidence of meningitis, but the possibility still exists, especially with the increased white blood cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid"

   Rads: MRI [**3-18**]:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Mild pachymeningeal enhancement can be consistent with inflammatory
   response from the ventricular shunt catheter. The fact that this
   enhancement
   is not nodular makes the possibility of acute meningitis less likely,
   although
   clinical correlation is recommended. Mild edema remains along the
   ventricular
   shunt catheter route as it traverses the right frontal lobe.
   2. Persistent but improved sinus disease including an air-fluid level
   within
   the left maxillary and bilateral sphenoid sinuses.
   3. No abnormal enhancing lesions or intra-axial parenchymal edema to
   suggest
   HSVas clinically suspected.
   CXR [**3-20**]:
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-19**], the patient is
   substantially
   obliqued, somewhat degrading the image. Nevertheless, the bilateral
   pulmonary
   opacities are again seen and the tracheostomy tube remains in place.

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, s/p VP shunt for cerebral aneurysm, admitted for ORIF, and now in the ICU for post-procedure hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with influenza/ARDS, pseudomonas pneumonia, and has undergone a tracheostomy.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature at 100.1 axillary, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106-185 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's neurological status has been fluctuating, with episodes of altered mental status and flaccid paralysis.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated potassium, and low sodium levels. Imaging studies reveal mild pachymeningeal enhancement consistent with an inflammatory response from the ventricular shunt catheter, persistent sinus disease, and no evidence of HSV encephalitis. Chest X-ray shows bilateral pulmonary opacities.

The patient's medical team is concerned about meningitis, VP shunt infection, and the possibility of cerebritis. They plan to repeat a lumbar puncture or VP tap in about 2 days, continue antibiotics, and follow up with HSV PCR. The patient will undergo further evaluation for the cause of flaccid paralysis and ongoing management of her respiratory failure and other comor"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who underwent VP shunt placement for a cerebral aneurysm and was admitted for ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) of a right ankle fracture. Post-procedure, the patient experienced hypoxia and was transferred to the ICU. The patient also has influenza/ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and a pseudomonas infection, for which a tracheostomy peg was placed. There are concerns about meningitis, and an MRI is pending for further evaluation. The patient has multiple allergies and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals.

24-Hour Events:
- The patient's temperature is 100.1°F (axillary) at midnight.
- Tolerated tracheostomy collar for approximately 9 hours yesterday, with occasional thick secretions.
- No bands seen on the add-on differential.

Physical Examination:
- General: The patient is awake, sitting in a chair, tracks with eyes, and nods to questions.
- HEENT: Mmm (motor function not mentioned).

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who had a VP shunt for a cerebral aneurysm and was admitted for ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) surgery. She is currently in the ICU for post-procedure hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with influenza/ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and pseudomonas pneumonia, and has undergone a tracheostomy. There is a concern for meningitis. The patient has allergies to penicillins, sulfonamides, shellfish, iodine, red dye, and unknown allergens. She received her last dose of antibiotics on 03/19/2114 at 07:31 PM (vancomycin), 03/20/2114 at 02:18 AM (acyclovir), and 03/20/2114 at 03:22 AM (cefipime).

24-hour events:
- An MRI is pending for possible meningitis and shunt infection.
- The patient's temperature reached 100.1 axillary degrees at midnight.
- No bands were seen on the add-on differential.
- Vital signs are stable with a heart rate ranging from 57-78 bpm, blood pressure between 106/63 mmHg and 185/116 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%.

   Imaging: MRI brain [**3-18**] final read:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Mild pachymeningeal enhancement can be consistent with inflammatory
   response from the ventricular shunt catheter. The fact that this
   enhancement is not nodular makes the possibility of acute meningitis
   less likely, although clinical correlation is recommended. Mild edema
   remains along the ventricular shunt catheter route as it traverses the
   right frontal lobe.
   2. Persistent but improved sinus disease including an air-fluid level
   within the left maxillary and bilateral sphenoid sinuses.
   3. No abnormal enhancing lesions or intra-axial parenchymal edema to
   suggest HSV as clinically suspected.

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who presented to the ICU after undergoing open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a right ankle fracture. She was found to have respiratory failure due to ARDS secondary to the flu and required intubation and tracheostomy. She also presented with altered mental status, flaccid paralysis, and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Imaging showed mild pachymeningeal enhancement near the ventricular shunt catheter, but no signs of acute meningitis or HSV infection. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected meningitis and VP shunt infection. She has been weaned off mechanical ventilation and is tolerating tracheostomy trials. Her leukocyte count is increasing on broad coverage antibiotics, indicating a possible ongoing infection. The patient's other medical issues include hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, and a history of aneurysm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged intubation and the risk of aspiration.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient has multiple central lines, increasing the risk of infection.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility from paralysis and cast can increase the risk of DVT.
4. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and prolonged bed rest"

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Mild pachymeningeal enhancement can be consistent with inflammatory
   response from the ventricular shunt catheter. The fact that this
   enhancement is not nodular makes the possibility of acute meningitis
   less likely, although clinical correlation is recommended. Mild edema
   remains along the ventricular shunt catheter route as it traverses the
   right frontal lobe.
   2. Persistent but improved sinus disease including an air-fluid level
   within the left maxillary and bilateral sphenoid sinuses.
   3. No abnormal enhancing lesions or intra-axial parenchymal edema to
   suggest HSV as clinically suspected.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who presented to the ICU with a history of flu/ARDS, tracheostomy, flaccid paralysis, concern for meningitis/VP shunt infection, and previous ankle fracture with ORIF. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 157/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological status has deteriorated since extubation, with an inability to move fingers now to complete flaccid paralysis. There is concern for central process or ICU myopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms, including altered mental status and increased white blood cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), suggest a possible meningitis. The MRI brain showed mild pachymeningeal enhancement, which can be consistent with an inflammatory response from the ventricular shunt catheter, but further clinical correlation is recommended.
2. VP Shunt Infection: The patient's symptoms, such as altered mental status, flaccid paralysis, and abnormal CSF findings, raise concern for a VP shunt infection. The MRI brain also showed mild edema along the ventricular shunt catheter route.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure secondary to influenza pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has shown significant neurological improvement, including increased interaction and following commands. However, the patient still exhibits flaccid paralysis and hyperreflexia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern due to ARDS. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

2. Neurological complications: Despite the neurological improvement, the patient's flaccid paralysis and hyperreflexia suggest ongoing neurological impairment. There is a risk of developing additional neurological complications such as pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or pneumonia caused by aspiration.

3. Infection: The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers and leukocytosis, indicating a possible ongoing infection. The source of infection is still unclear, and there is a risk of developing new infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infection or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

4. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobilization and prolonged bed rest. This can lead to pulmonary embolism if a clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.

5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). However,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a right ankle fracture. Post-operatively, she developed respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to the flu. She was intubated, tracheostomized, and developed flaccid paralysis. There are concerns about meningitis and VP shunt infection. The patient's altered mental status and hyperreflexia are concerning for two processes: CNS infection and ICU polyneuropathy. 

The MRI of the cervical spine showed no signs of meningitis or cord compression. There is some cervical spondylosis but nothing to explain paralysis. The patient's transaminase levels have been waxing and waning during the hospital stay, and there is new elevation in pancreatic enzymes in the setting of leukocytosis. 

The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics for suspected meningitis, treatment for sinusitis, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CNS infection: The patient's altered mental status, hyperreflexia, and abnormal CSF raise concerns for a CNS infection. Further evaluation with EMG, EEG, NCS, and possibly repeating the VP shunt tap is recommended.
2. ICU polyneuropathy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of tachycardia. She has a history of aneurysm, fracture, and allergies to penicillins, sulfa, iodine, shellfish, and red dye. The patient received various antibiotics including metronidazole, acyclovir, vancomycin, and cefipime. She has been monitored in the ICU and has undergone several tests and treatments. Her vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) suggests a possible infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the source and appropriate treatment.
2. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive total input of 1,805 mL with an output of 365 mL over the past 24 hours. This indicates a fluid overload situation, which may require adjustment of fluid administration.
3. Abnormal liver function: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) indicate possible liver dysfunction. Monitoring liver function and assessing for any underlying causes is necessary.
4. Kidney function: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of kidney function and appropriate management are required.
5. Coagulation disorder: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) indicate a coagulation disorder"

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right ankle, complicated by respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), flu, tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), altered mental status, and flaccid paralysis with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and leukocytosis.

The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated.
2. Fracture: The patient has a right leg fracture that underwent ORIF.
3. An aneurysm: The patient has a history of an aneurysm.
4. Flu/ARDS: The patient developed hypoxia post-flu infection leading to ARDS and required intubation and tracheostomy.
5. Flaccid paralysis: The patient exhibits flaccid paralysis, possibly due to meningitis or ICU polyneuropathy.
6. Abnormal CSF: The patient has abnormal CSF, suggesting a possible CNS infection.
7. Transaminitis/pancreatic enzyme elevation: The patient experienced waxing transaminitis during the hospital stay, and new elevation in pancreatic enzymes in the setting of leukocytosis. A HIDA scan and RUQ ultrasound were negative for gallbladder/biliary pathology.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to flu, and is currently intubated and tracheostomized. There is concern for meningitis/VP shunt infection, and the patient is experiencing altered mental status, flaccid paralysis, and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated pancreatic enzymes without a clear medication explanation. This could indicate an underlying pancreatic issue, such as necrotizing pancreatitis. Further imaging and monitoring may be necessary.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which can be indicative of an infection. The source of infection is uncertain, but it could be related to the VP shunt or sinusitis. Ongoing evaluation and treatment are needed.

4. Hypertension: The patient has stable hypertension, which requires ongoing monitoring and medication management.

5. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)/aberrancy: The patient has a history of SVT, and is being treated with flecainide and metoprolol. Regular follow-up with an electrophysiologist is recommended.

6. R ankle fracture s/p ORIF: The patient had a right ankle fracture that underwent open reduction and internal fixation. Follow-up"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for a right ankle fracture. Postoperatively, she developed respiratory failure due to ARDS secondary to flu infection and was intubated. She also has been diagnosed with tracheostomy, flaccid paralysis, and suspected meningitis with a VP shunt infection. The patient has altered mental status and hyperreflexia. Imaging studies show no signs of meningitis or cord compression. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) for suspected bacterial meningitis and is also being treated for sinusitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infected VP shunt: The patient has an abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile with elevated WBC count, suggesting a possible VP shunt infection. Further evaluation with repeated VP shunt tap is planned to assess for persistent elevated WBC count, which could indicate an ongoing infection causing encephalopathy.
2. CNS infection/polyneuropathy: The patient's altered mental status, hyperreflexia, and abnormal CSF findings raise concerns for two possible processes - CNS infection and ICU polyneuropathy. Neurological recommendations include continuing current management, prolonged EEG if clinical suspicion remains high, and considering electrom"

   52 F s/p R ankle ORIF in [**1-19**], post-op course complicated by hypoxia
   FLU/ARDS, intubated, now trached, flaccid paralysis and concern for
   meningitis/VP shunt infection.
   #CNS.  Altered mental status with hyperreflexia, low tone, paralysis.
   Abnormal CSF, repeat shunt tap with improvement form prior.  Likely a
   combination of infection and ICU polyneuropathy given prolonged course
   with intubation and period of treatment with paralytic agents.
   -MRI no sign meningitis
   -MRI spine without evidence for cord compression or abcess, some
   cervical spondylosis but nothing to explain paralysis.
   -Appreciate neuro recs.  EEG without evidence seizures, should still
   keep in mind if clinical suspicion remains high.  Can consider
   prolonged EEG.
   -EMG, NCS if does not continue to improve
   -HSV PCR negative, d/c

   -Pt had LP on [**3-16**], VP shunt tap on [**3-17**], both with elevated WBC, 167,
   25.  Abnormal but not c/w bacterial meningitis. Repeat VP shunt tap on
   [**3-23**] with 5 WBC and normal protein/glucose.  Appreciate neurosurgery
   involvement.
    -Continue to treat sinusitis with Flagyl (restarted on [**3-20**]) , nasal
   irrigation
   - Can consider panorex to eval for dental abscesses when more stable,
   though given significant improvement, may not be necessary to image.
   #Transaminits/pancreatic enzyme elevation.  Waxing [**Doctor Last Name 42**] transaminits,
   now resolving, may be attributed to various medications.  However now
   pt with increasing pancreating enzymes in absence of med to explain
   this, no pain on exam, no evidence of fluid shifts. Would expect sicker
   if necrotozing pancreatitis, however does have low grade fevers and
   leukocytosis (though this is improving).
   -No CT as pt has documented allergy to Iodine (anaphylaxis to
   shellfish)
   - Continue to trend enzymes, if clinically worsens will need to image
   abd, ? surgery c/s for necrotizing pancreatitits.
   - Consider repeat RUQ u/s.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a right ankle fracture. Post-operatively, she developed respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and flu. She was intubated and tracheostomized, and now presents with altered mental status, flaccid paralysis, and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient also has leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and pancreatic enzymes. She is on multiple medications including antibiotics for suspected meningitis and meningoencephalitis, antivirals, and proton pump inhibitors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis, fever curve, and abnormal CSF suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated pancreatic enzymes may indicate acute pancreatitis. Further evaluation with imaging studies such as a CT scan of the abdomen, if iodine allergy is not present, is recommended to assess for pancreatic inflammation or necrosis.
3. Liver dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver injury or dysfunction. Monitoring liver function tests and assessing for signs of jaundice or other symptoms related to liver dysfunction is essential.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows a positive fluid intake-output balance, indicating potential fluid overload. Close monitoring"

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a chief complaint of flaccid paralysis and persistent fevers. The patient has been in the ICU and has undergone several interventions and treatments. The patient's medical history includes influenza pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), weakness, and a shunt infection.

On examination, the patient is alert and able to answer questions, but feels confused. Vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/74 to 91/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight is currently 57.6 kg, with a decrease from the admission weight of 65.8 kg. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,600 mL and output of 548 mL.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 17.8 to 26.8 thousand cells/mm3, slightly elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, thrombocytopenia with platelet counts ranging from 28 to 347 thousand cells/mm3, normal creatinine levels, elevated glucose levels, and elevated liver enzymes such as ALT and AST. Other lab values including electrolytes, kidney function tests, cardiac markers, and coagulation profile are within normal ranges.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to previous influenza pneumonia and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with flaccid paralysis and persistent fevers. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, sulfa, shellfish, iodine, and unknown allergens. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 145/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's recent medical history includes shunt tap with 5 WBCs, normal protein and glucose levels, negative EEG for seizures, and negative results for hepatitis B and C antibodies. The patient was treated with acyclovir, vancomycin, and cefepime antibiotics.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and weight loss. The patient's physical examination shows decreased b-blocker for relative hypotension, e-mycin started for conjunctivitis, and no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, or other systems.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The creatinine (Cr) level is within normal range. Other lab values including glucose, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and cardiac markers are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of influenza pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), weakness, depressed mental status, and flaccid paralysis. The patient has shown improvement in mental status but still requires close monitoring. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is conversant. An EEG has been performed, which came back negative for seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shunt infection: The patient is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for a suspected shunt infection. Repeat shunt tap with fewer white blood cells (WBCs) will be discussed with the neurosurgeon.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of influenza pneumonia and ARDS, resulting in respiratory failure. The patient is now on partial mandatory ventilation (PMV) and is conversant.
3. Weakness: The patient is slowly improving but will require prolonged and aggressive physical therapy (PT)/occupational therapy (OT)/rehabilitation.
4. Leukocytosis and low-grade fevers: The patient has leukocytosis and low-grade fevers, possibly indicating an ongoing infection. Treatment for shunt infection is ongoing.
5. Transaminitis and increased pancreatic enzymes: The patient has transaminitis and mildly increased pancreatic enzymes, although there are no signs of pancreatitis on examination.
6. Volume status: The patient's volume status is even to slightly negative, so daily weights should be followed"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 F s/p R ankle ORIF in [**1-19**], post-op course complicated by hypoxia
   FLU/ARDS, intubated, now trached, flaccid paralysis and concern for
   meningitis/VP shunt infection.
   #CNS:  Altered mental status with hyperreflexia, low tone, paralysis.
   Now improving. CSF profile improved from prior shunt tap.  Likely a
   combination of infection and ICU polyneuropathy given prolonged course
   with intubation and period of treatment with paralytic agents.
   -MRI no sign meningitis
   -MRI spine without evidence for cord compression or abcess, some
   cervical spondylosis but nothing to explain paralysis.
   -Appreciate neuro recs.  EEG without evidence seizures, should still
   keep in mind if clinical suspicion remains high.  Can consider
   prolonged EEG.
   -EMG, NCS if does not continue to improve
   -HSV PCR negative, d/c
d acyclovir
   -F/u ID recs
   -Continue tx of meningoencephalitis with cefepime, vancomyicn,
   currently day 13 for both
   -Pt had LP on [**3-16**], VP shunt tap on [**3-17**], both with elevated WBC, 167,
   25.  Abnormal but not c/w bacterial meningitis. Repeat VP shunt tap on
   [**3-23**] with 5 WBC and normal protein/glucose.  Appreciate neurosurgery
   involvement.
   -Continue to treat sinusitis with Flagyl (restarted on [**3-20**]) , nasal
   irrigation
   -Can consider panorex to eval for dental abscesses when more stable,
   though given significant improvement, may not be necessary to image.
   #Transaminits/pancreatic enzyme elevation:  Waxing [**Doctor Last Name 42**] transaminits,
   now resolving, may be attributed to various medications.  However now
   pt with increasing pancreating enzymes in absence of med to explain
   this, no pain on exam, no evidence of fluid shifts. Would expect sicker
   if necrotozing pancreatitis, however does have low grade fevers and
   leukocytosis (though this is improving).
   - No CT as pt has documented allergy to Iodine (anaphylaxis to
   shellfish)
   - Continue to trend enzymes, if clinically worsens will need to image
   abd, ? surgery c/s for necrotizing pancreatitits.
   - Consider repeat RUQ u/s.
   #Hypoxic respiratory failure: Improving. Etiology ARDS [**1-13**] flu.
   Trach'd, PS 5/5, tolerating trach collar trials, has been off vent
   several days.
   - Anxiety: Control with lorazepam PRN, dose lowered given concern for
   neuroactive meds
   - Fluid: Goal even to net negative 500cc, pt incontinent, monitor daily
   weights
   - PMV trial tolerated well, patient communicating well
   #Leukocytosis. Down somewhat today, fever curve slightly decreased.
   -F/u c. diff toxin B [**3-17**], [**3-20**], [**3-21**], still pending.  Continue PO flagyl
   per ID recs, pt having loose stools
   -Appreciate ortho involvement, case removed, no evidence soft tissue
   infection.
   -Hold off CT chest for now for reasons as above.
   -Continue vanc, cefepime, flagyl
   -CIS
   #Hypertension: STABLE.  Decrease metoprolol to 37.5 TID for relative
   hypotension/[**Name2 (NI) 2088**].
   #SVT/aberrancy: STABLE.  Flecainide x1mo course, metoprolol.
   - Outpatient EP in 1 mo (end of [**Month (only) 1996**])
   #R ankle fracture s/p ORIF: F/u with ortho re: recasting.
   #FEN: Bowel regimen added for TF, increase fiber (banana flakes) given

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with a history of right ankle ORIF (operation repair and fixation) and post-operative complications including hypoxia and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient has been intubated, tracheostomized, and experienced flaccid paralysis with concerns for meningitis or VP shunt infection. 

The patient's neurological status has improved, with altered mental status, hyperreflexia, low tone, and paralysis now improving. CSF profile has improved, suggesting a combination of infection and ICU polyneuropathy. MRI of the brain and spine did not show any signs of meningitis or cord compression.

The patient is currently being treated for meningoencephalitis with cefepime and vancomycin, and the VP shunt tap on 3/23 showed normal results. The patient also has sinusitis, which is being treated with Flagyl and nasal irrigation. 

There are concerns regarding elevated pancreatic enzymes, which may be due to medication side effects or developing pancreatitis. However, since the patient does not exhibit symptoms such as pain or fluid shifts, a CT scan may not be necessary at this time. 

The patient's respiratory failure is improving, and they are tolerating tracheostomy collar trials, having been off the ventilator for several days. 

Other medical issues include leukocytosis, anxiety controlled with loraz"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who was admitted to the ICU after undergoing open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a right ankle fracture. She developed respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and flu symptoms, leading to intubation and tracheostomy. The patient also presented with altered mental status, flaccid paralysis, and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, suggesting meningitis or VP shunt infection. Imaging studies ruled out meningitis and showed no evidence of cord compression or abscess. The patient's neurological condition improved over time, and she is now tolerating tracheostomy mask and speaking interactively. However, she still has some sputum production.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and pancreatic enzymes. She has been treated with various antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole, for suspected bacterial meningitis, meningoencephalitis, and sinusitis. The patient also has elevated blood glucose levels and abnormal electrolytes, including low potassium and magnesium levels. 

The patient's vitals are stable, with controlled hypertension and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). She is being closely monitored for potential complications such as hypoxic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, and anxiety. The patient's fluid balance is being managed to achieve"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome following open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for a right ankle fracture, respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), flu, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She presented with altered mental status, flaccid paralysis, abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leukocytosis, and improvement in these conditions. 

The patient is currently tolerating tracheostomy mask and is off mechanical ventilation. She is awake, bright, and interactive. The tracheostomy and PEG tubes are in place. The right leg is in a brace without edema. Neurological examination shows improvement with squeezed hands but no toe movement. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and leukocytosis, but other parameters such as hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and glucose levels are within normal limits. Imaging studies show no evidence of meningitis or cord compression. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. CNS: Altered mental status with hyperreflexia, low tone, paralysis. Improvement noted, likely a combination of infection and ICU polyneuropathy.
   -MRI no sign meningitis
   -MRI spine without evidence for cord compression or abcess, some cervical spondylosis but nothing to explain paralysis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a chief complaint of weakness and confusion. The patient has a history of influenza pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and flaccid paralysis. She is currently on mechanical ventilation (PMV) and is able to clear her own secretions. The patient's mental status has fluctuated from depressed to confused, with negative results on an electroencephalogram (EEG). 

The patient is being treated for a shunt infection with vancomycin and cefepime, with plans to repeat the shunt tap if there are fewer white blood cells (WBCs). Her leukocytosis and low-grade fevers are improving, indicating a positive response to treatment. 

She also has leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count, transaminitis (elevated liver enzymes), and mildly increased pancreatic enzymes. There are no signs of pancreatitis on examination. 

The patient's volume status is even to slightly negative, so daily weights will be followed to monitor fluid balance. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube (Nutren 2.0 at 35 mL/hour) and has a PICC line inserted. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with subcutaneous heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a chief complaint of confusion, anxiety, and flaccid paralysis. She has a history of influenza pneumonia, ARDS, weakness, and a tracheostomy. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation (PMV) and is conversant, able to clear her own secretions. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/70 mmHg to 142/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is also on several medications, including cefipime, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure due to influenza pneumonia and ARDS. Although she is currently stable on PMV, there is still a risk of further respiratory complications.
2. Shunt infection: The patient has a shunt infection, for which she is being treated with antibiotics (cefipime and vancomycin). There is a risk of ongoing infection and potential complications related to the shunt.
3. Leukocytosis and low-grade fevers: The patient has leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and low-grade fevers, indicating a possible ongoing infection. This needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of her right ankle. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and flu. The patient has been intubated, tracheostomized, and has flaccid paralysis with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and leukocytosis. She is experiencing altered mental status, which is improving. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place and is tolerating cool mist tracheostomy mask. She is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and antipyretics. The patient's condition is stable, with improving leukocytosis and resolving transaminase elevations. She is off the ventilator for more than five days. The patient has allergies to penicillins, sulfa, shellfish, and iodine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. Proper tracheostomy care and mouth care are being implemented to prevent this complication.
2. Meningitis: The patient's CSF profile initially showed elevated white blood cell count, but subsequent VP shunt taps have revealed normal findings. However, continued treatment with antibiotics is recommended until [**3"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a right ankle fracture. Postoperatively, she developed respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and flu. She was intubated, tracheostomized, and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient also presented with flaccid paralysis and concerns for meningitis or VP shunt infection. Her mental status has been altered, with periods of orientation and delirium. Laboratory findings show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile. Imaging studies reveal diffuse interstitial markings on chest X-ray and no evidence of cord compression or abscess on MRI spine. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Meningitis: The patient's altered mental status, elevated white blood cell count in CSF, and abnormal CSF profile suggest the possibility of meningitis.
3. VP shunt infection: The patient's clinical presentation and CSF findings raise concerns for a VP shunt infection.
4. Delirium: The patient's fluctuating mental status indicates delirium, which can be associated with prolonged ICU stay and the use of neuroactive medications.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's"

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for a right ankle fracture. Postoperatively, she developed respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to intubation and tracheostomy. She also presented with altered mental status, flaccid paralysis, and concerns of meningitis/VP shunt infection.

The patient has shown gradual improvement in her neurological status, with an improving affect, ability to move arms to mouth, and movement of legs. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile has also improved.

The patient's leukocytosis is improving, and she is tolerating cool mist tracheostomy mask. She is off the ventilator for several days. Her abdominal pain and fever have resolved.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, unknown anaphylaxis, sulfa (sulfonamides), anaphylaxis, shellfish-derived products, rash, iodine, and red dye. Her last doses of antibiotics were metronidazole, vancomycin, and cefepime on 03/25/2114 at 12:00 AM, 08:00 PM, and 04:00 AM, respectively.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 138"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome following open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. She also has respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the flu, for which she underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient presents with altered mental status, flaccid paralysis, and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). She is currently improving and is able to sit up in a chair, move her arms to her mouth, and move her legs.

The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, sulfa, shellfish, iodine, and red dye. Her last doses of antibiotics were metronidazole on 03/25/2114 at 12:00 AM, vancomycin on 03/25/2114 at 08:00 PM, and cefepime on 03/26/2114 at 04:00 AM.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/96 to 162/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a prolonged respiratory course, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and elevated white blood cell count. She has been on a tracheostomy collar for over 4 days and is doing well. The patient has shown improvement in her fever curve, and her weakness has dramatically improved compared to last week. The patient's allergies include penicillins, sulfa, shellfish, iodine, and red dye. She has received various antibiotics, including metronidazole, cefepime, and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation and mouth care are being implemented to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulability can increase the risk of DVT in ICU patients. Prophylaxis with boots and possibly anticoagulants may be considered.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness can predispose patients to stress ulcers. Prophylactic measures like stress ulcer prophylaxis may be necessary.
4. Worsening ARDS: Although the patient's respiratory status has improved, there is still a risk of worsening ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure.
5. Infection: Despite the improvement in"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a prolonged respiratory course, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been intubated and placed on a tracheostomy collar for over four days. Her white blood cell count (WBC) was elevated but is now resolving. The patient's fever curve has improved. She is still experiencing hypoxemia, but is doing well on the tracheostomy collar and is comfortable. The plan is to downsize the tracheostomy.

The patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed an elevated WBC count, suggesting possible meningitis. She will continue to receive antibiotics (Vancomycin and Cefepime) for seven days after normal CSF results. If she does not continue to improve, a repeat CSF tap may be considered.

The patient is also experiencing cognitive dysfunction with confusion, waxing and waning orientation, as well as severe weakness. Physical therapy has been involved and appreciated.

The patient's other lab results show normal creatinine, potassium, sodium, and calcium levels. Her blood glucose levels have been within normal range. Her platelet count has been fluctuating, but mostly within normal limits.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 152/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a prolonged respiratory course, including ARDS, and improvement in fever and WBC count. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been for over 4 days. The patient has been receiving antibiotics for suspected meningitis and is expected to continue improving with time, treatment, and movement out of the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been on mechanical ventilation for over 4 days, there is a risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures such as elevating the head of bed, mouth care, and regular assessment of respiratory status should be implemented to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of DVT. The patient should receive prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT.
3. Nosocomial infection: The prolonged stay in the ICU increases the risk of nosocomial infections. Regular monitoring of vital signs and daily review of laboratory results are important to detect any potential infections early.
4. Cognitive dysfunction: The patient exhibits confusion and severe weakness, which may be attributed to the prolonged illness or complications related to meningitis. Close monitoring of mental status and involvement of physical therapy for rehabilitation are necessary.
5. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored to ensure adequate hydration without causing fluid overload."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU due to a respiratory failure following surgery for an ankle fracture. She has a history of flu, ARDS, tracheostomy, and flaccid paralysis. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, hyperreflexia, low tone, and paralysis, which are improving. Her vital signs are stable, and she is tolerating a tracheostomy mask. The patient has been weaned off the ventilator for more than 6 days.

The patient's medical history also includes anemia, leukocytosis, and hypertension, all of which are being closely monitored. She has a DNR (do not resuscitate) status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of ARDS, which can lead to hypoxic respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and respiratory function is necessary.
2. Meningitis: The patient's CSF profile showed elevated white blood cell count, but no bacterial growth. She has been treated with antibiotics for possible meningitis, and repeat CSF tap showed normal results. Continued monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy if needed.
3. Transaminitis/pancreatic enzyme elevation: The patient initially had elevated liver enzymes and pancreatic enzymes, which are now resolving. Regular monitoring of liver function tests and pancreatic enzymes is required.
4. Anemia: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU for various medical conditions. She underwent an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of her right ankle after a fracture, but her post-operative course was complicated by respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and influenza (flu). The patient required intubation and tracheostomy, and she also developed flaccid paralysis and concern for meningitis or VP shunt infection. Her mental status has been improving, but it is still waxing and waning. Laboratory tests show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated pancreatic enzymes. Imaging shows diffuse increased interstitial markings with a granular/miliary pattern, suggesting possible left atrial prominence. Microbiology results indicate negative CSF culture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial hypoxia and ARDS indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Although she has improved and is off the ventilator for more than 6 days, close monitoring is necessary.
2. Meningitis: The patient's altered mental status and concern for meningitis necessitate further investigation and treatment. The CSF profile has improved, but there is still a need for ongoing evaluation.
3. VP Shunt Infection: The presence of elevated white blood cell count in CSF suggests a possible VP shunt infection. Monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are required.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels have"

The patient is a 52-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU following an ankle surgery. She developed hypoxia and was diagnosed with FLU/ARDS, leading to intubation and tracheostomy. The patient also has concerns for meningitis/VP shunt infection. She has shown improvement in her mental status, and CSF profile has also improved. The patient's neurologic condition is stable, and further neurologic studies will be deferred. HSV PCR was negative, so acyclovir was discontinued. The patient will continue with antibiotic therapy for meningitis until March 31st. 

The patient also has transaminitis/pancreatic enzyme elevation, which is improving. Her leukocytosis is also improving, and there are no signs of abdominal pain or fever. The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure is improving, and she has been weaned off the ventilator. She is tolerating the tracheostomy well and is being prepared for eventual decannulation. 

The patient's leukocytosis is stable, and fever curve has decreased. Clostridium difficile toxin B testing is pending. The patient's hypertension and SVT/aberrancy are stable, and she is on appropriate medications for these conditions. She will follow up with cardiology and orthopedics as needed. The patient's code status remains DNR (do not resuscitate), and she is being screened for possible transfer to a long-term"

   The patient is status post tracheostomy. There is mild prominence of
   the cardiomediastinal silhouette and slight splaying of the carina
   suggestive of left atrial prominence. In addition, there are diffuse
   increased interstitial
   markings with a granular/miliary pattern. These findings are
   essentially
   unchanged compared with [**2114-3-22**]. No gross effusions are identified. The
   PICC line tip is again seen to overlie the distal SVC/RA junction.
   Microbiology: CSF: Final cx NG
   Assessment and Plan
   52 F s/p R ankle ORIF in [**1-19**], post-op course complicated by hypoxia
   FLU/ARDS, intubated, now trached, flaccid paralysis and concern for
   meningitis/VP shunt infection.
   #CNS:  Altered mental status with hyperreflexia, low tone, paralysis.
   Now improving. CSF profile improved from prior shunt tap.  Likely a
   combination of infection and ICU polyneuropathy given prolonged course
   with intubation and period of treatment with paralytic agents.
   Persistent waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 42**] mental status/delerium most likely in setting
   of prolonged illness/ICU stay.
   -MRI no sign meningitis
   -MRI spine without evidence for cord compression or abcess, some
   cervical spondylosis but nothing to explain paralysis.
   -EEG without evidence seizures
   -Given improvement will defer NCS/EMG, f/u neuro recs. Neuro to discuss
   prognosis with pt
s husband.
   -HSV PCR negative, d/c
d acyclovir
   -F/u ID recs, plan to continue meningitis tx with vanc and cefepime
   until [**3-31**] (7 days after normal CSF)
   -Pt had LP on [**3-16**], VP shunt tap on [**3-17**], both with elevated WBC, 167,
   25.  Abnormal but not c/w bacterial meningitis. Repeat VP shunt tap on
   [**3-23**] with 5 WBC and normal protein/glucose.  Appreciate neurosurgery
   involvement.
   -ID recs re-tapping shunt off abx, can d/w neurosurgery and consider if
   pt clinically worsens off antibiotics.
   - Continue PT, frequent re-orientation.
   #Transaminitis/pancreatic enzyme elevation:  Improving.  Waxing [**Doctor Last Name 42**]
   transaminits, now resolving, may be attributed to various medications.
   Leukocytosis improving, no abdominal pain, afebrile, clinically
   improving as well. Pancreatic enzymes trending down.
   - No CT as pt has documented allergy to Iodine (anaphylaxis to
   shellfish)
   - Continue to trend enzymes.  No imaging unless develops pain or
   clinically worsens.
   #Hypoxic respiratory failure: Improving. Etiology ARDS [**1-13**] flu.
   Trach'd,  tolerating trach mask, has been off vent >5 days.
   - Anxiety: Control with lorazepam PRN, dose lowered given concern for
   neuroactive meds
   - Fluid: Goal even to net negative 500cc, pt incontinent, monitor daily
   weights
   - PMV trial tolerated well, patient communicating well
   - Consider downsizing trach today in preparation for eventual
   tracheostomy decannulation
   #Leukocytosis: Stable. Fever curve decreased
   -F/u c. diff toxin B [**3-17**], [**3-20**], [**3-21**], still pending.
   -Flagyl discontinued given lack of positive c. diff toxin.
   -Appreciate ortho involvement, cast removed, no evidence soft tissue
   infection.
   -Hold off CT chest for now for reasons as above.
   -Continue vanc, cefepime, flagyl until [**3-31**]
   -CIS
   #Hypertension: STABLE.  Decreased metoprolol to 37.5 TID for relative
   hypotension/[**Name2 (NI) 2088**].
   #SVT/aberrancy: STABLE.  Flecainide x1mo course, metoprolol.
   - Outpatient EP in 1 mo (end of [**Month (only) 1996**])
   #R ankle fracture s/p ORIF: F/u with ortho re: recasting.  Per ortho,
   patient is non-weight bearing.  Continue PT as above
   #FEN: Bowel regimen added for TF, increased fiber (banana flakes) given
   loose stools.

- Persistent waxing/deteriorating mental status/delirium is likely due to prolonged illness/ICU stay.
- Neuro consultation was deferred, with plans for follow-up neuro recommendations.
- ID recommendations include continuing meningitis treatment with vancomycin and cefepime until March 31st (7 days after normal CSF).
- Repeat VP shunt tap on March 23rd showed normal protein/glucose levels and only 5 white blood cells.
- ID recs re-tapping shunt off abx, considering neurosurgery involvement.

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hyperfibrinolysis syndrome, respiratory failure, ARDS, flu, tracheostomy, and altered mental status. She is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation for more than 6 days. The patient has a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt in place and is suspected to have meningitis or VP shunt infection.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.5 C (99.5 F), heart rate 71 bpm, blood pressure 132/75 mmHg, respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on aerosol-cool tracheostomy mask. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 234 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 117, elevated fibrinogen level of 450 mg/dL, and elevated D-dimer level of 3818 ng/mL. The patient's chest X-ray reveals diffuse increased interstitial markings with a granular/miliary pattern, consistent with ARDS.

The patient's neurological examination shows flaccid paralysis and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile. An MRI of the brain and spine was performed, which did not show any signs of meningitis or cord compression. An EEG was also performed, which did not show evidence of seizures. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who underwent right ankle open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. Her post-operative course has been complicated by hypoxia due to flu-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intubation, tracheostomy, and concern for meningitis/VP shunt infection. The patient's current condition includes flaccid paralysis and altered mental status, which are improving. The patient is now tolerating a tracheostomy mask and has been off the ventilator for more than six days. There is a concern for meningitis, but imaging studies have shown no signs of infection. The patient's white blood cell count in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is elevated, but not consistent with bacterial meningitis. The VP shunt tap on 03/23/21 showed normal protein and glucose levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient has shown signs of altered mental status and elevated white blood cell count in the CSF, which raises concern for meningitis. However, imaging studies have shown no signs of infection. Continuous monitoring and appropriate treatment with antibiotics are necessary.
2. VP Shunt Infection: The patient's VP shunt tap on 03/23/21 showed elevated white blood cell count, but subsequent VP shunt tap on 03/26/21 showed normal protein and glucose levels. Close observation and consideration of further intervention may be needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 F s/p R ankle ORIF in [**1-19**], post-op course complicated by hypoxia
   FLU/ARDS, intubated, now trached, flaccid paralysis and concern for
   meningitis/VP shunt infection.
   #CNS:  Altered mental status with hyperreflexia, low tone, paralysis.
   Now improving, though mental status still waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**]. CSF
   profile improved from prior shunt tap.  Likely a combination of
   infection and ICU polyneuropathy given prolonged course with intubation
   and period of treatment with paralytic agents. Persistent waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 42**]
   mental status/delerium most likely in setting of prolonged illness/ICU
   stay.
   -MRI no sign meningitis
   -MRI spine without evidence for cord compression or abcess, some
   cervical spondylosis but nothing to explain paralysis.
   -EEG without evidence seizures
   -Given improvement will defer NCS/EMG, f/u neuro recs. Neuro to discuss
   prognosis with pt
s husband.
   -HSV PCR negative, d/c
d acyclovir
   -F/u ID recs, plan to continue meningitis tx with vanc and cefepime
   until [**3-31**] (7 days after normal CSF)
   -Pt had LP on [**3-16**], VP shunt tap on [**3-17**], both with elevated WBC, 167,
   25.  Abnormal but not c/w bacterial meningitis. Repeat VP shunt tap on
   [**3-23**] with 5 WBC and normal protein/glucose.  Appreciate neurosurgery
   involvement.
   -ID recs re-tapping shunt off abx, can d/w neurosurgery and consider if
   pt clinically worsens off antibiotics.
   - Continue PT, frequent re-orientation.
   #Transaminitis/pancreatic enzyme elevation:  Improving.  Waxing [**Doctor Last Name 42**]
   transaminits, now resolving.  Will stop checking her LFTs/pancreatic
   enxymes.  Was likely due to medications as no clinical evidence of
   pancreatitis.  Can consider imagine if patient clinically declines.
   #Hypoxic respiratory failure: Improving. Etiology ARDS [**1-13**] flu.
   Trach'd,  tolerating trach mask, has been off vent >6 days.
   - Anxiety: Control with lorazepam PRN, dose lowered given concern for
   neuroactive meds
   - Fluid: Goal even to net negative 500cc, pt incontinent, monitor daily
   weights
   - PMV trial tolerated well, patient communicating well
   - Downsizing trach today in preparation for eventual tracheostomy
   decannulation
   #R ankle fracture s/p ORIF: F/u with ortho re: recasting.  Per ortho,
   patient is non-weight bearing.  Continue PT as above. Patient
   complaining of pain today in her ankle and calf which had not been
   noted prior.
   - Will call ortho to reevaluate her leg as have not been by for several
   days. ? re: when she will return to OR as she is NWB which will
   interfere with her rehabilitation
   - LENI of RLE as some evidence of pain and fullness on exam.  Any other
   imaging as per ortho recs.
   # Anemia: Baseline Hct between 26 and 28 during her stay, down from 28
   to 25 today. No report of guaiac positive stools.  Patient is HD
   stable.
   - Recheck this am.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Leukocytosis: Stable. Fever curve decreased.
   -F/u c. diff toxin B [**3-17**], [**3-20**], [**3-21**], still pending.
   -Flagyl discontinued given lack of positive c. diff toxin.
   -Appreciate ortho involvement, cast removed, no evidence soft tissue
   infection.
   -Continue vanc, cefepime, flagyl until [**3-31**]
   -CIS
   #Hypertension: STABLE.  Decreased metoprolol to 37.5 TID for relative
   hypotension/[**Name2 (NI) 2088**].
   #SVT/aberrancy: STABLE.  Flecainide x1mo course, metoprolol.
   - Outpatient EP in 1 mo (end of [**Month (only) 1996**])
   #FEN: Bowel regimen added for TF, increased fiber (banana flakes) given
   loose stools.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who underwent right ankle open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. Postoperatively, she developed hypoxia due to flu-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to intubation and subsequent tracheostomy. She also experienced flaccid paralysis, and there were concerns about meningitis and VP shunt infection. Her current condition includes altered mental status with hyperreflexia, low tone, and paralysis, which is improving but still waxing and waning. Imaging studies showed no signs of meningitis or cord compression. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, transaminitis/pancreatic enzyme elevation, hypoxic respiratory failure, anemia, and hypertension. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for suspected meningitis, and other medications are being administered for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: Although the patient has shown improvement, the presence of altered mental status and elevated white blood cell count in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) raises concerns about meningitis. Continued antibiotic therapy is recommended until normal CSF results are obtained.
2. VP Shunt Infection: There is concern for infection related to the VP shunt, given the elevated white blood cell count in CSF. Close monitoring and repeated CSF analysis are necessary to assess the situation.
3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced ARDS, resulting in hypoxic respiratory failure."
