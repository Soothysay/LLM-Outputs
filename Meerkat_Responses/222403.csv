","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient presents with shortness of breath and somnolence for three days. He was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, with a carbon dioxide level of 105 on admission, which improved to the baseline of 80s with the use of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). The patient's condition is unclear, possibly due to a COPD exacerbation or volume overload exacerbated by heart failure. There is no history of fever, cough, or white blood cells suggesting an active infection. The patient is currently receiving intravenous steroids, nebulizer treatments, BiPAP, and IV levo. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with high levels of carbon dioxide in his blood, indicating difficulty in exhaling carbon dioxide. This condition can lead to respiratory acidosis and may require ongoing respiratory support.
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient's symptoms may be due to a worsening of his underlying COPD. If left untreated, this could progress to respiratory failure.
3. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's chest X-ray suggests volume overload, indicating possible worsening of his heart failure. This can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs and respiratory distress.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and CHF. He presents with shortness of breath and somnolence for three days. The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, with an initial CO2 level of 105 on admission but improved to baseline levels with BIPAP. There is no clear history of COPD exacerbation, fever, cough, or signs of active infection. It is suggested that CHF and volume overload may be exacerbating the situation. The patient is currently receiving solumedrol, nebs, BIPAP, and IV levo. Additional medications and interventions are being considered, including a CT chest if consolidation on CXR cannot be ruled out or if the patient develops a fever.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's elevated CO2 levels indicate respiratory failure. If not adequately managed, this can lead to further deterioration in gas exchange and respiratory function.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CHF and the presence of volume overload suggest the possibility of cardiac complications. Monitoring and managing fluid balance, along with adjusting medications, will be crucial to prevent further cardiac issues.
3. Infection: Despite the absence of fever, cough, or elevated white blood cell count, there is still a possibility of underlying infection. Close monitoring for any signs of infection, such as fever or changes"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presents with shortness of breath and somnolence for the past three days. The patient has been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure, with initial CO2 levels of 105 on admission that improved to baseline levels in the 80s with the use of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). There is uncertainty regarding the cause of the COPD exacerbation, as there is no history of fever, cough, or elevated white blood cell count to suggest an active infection. The situation may be worsened by slightly increased volume overload, which is further exacerbating the condition. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows respiratory acidosis improving with BiPAP.

The patient is currently receiving intravenous steroids, nebulizers, BiPAP, and intravenous fluids. Antibiotics have been administered, but consolidation on chest X-ray cannot be completely ruled out. The patient's blood and urine cultures are being followed up. Additional interventions include holding glyburide for diabetes mellitus type 2, simvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and discontinuing ultram, rozerem, and diphenhydramine due to delirium. Haldol is being administered as needed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 73-year-old female patient with COPD, OSA/OHV on biPAP, and schizophrenia admitted with shortness of breath and acute exacerbation of chronic hypercarbic failure due to volume overload.
- Patient's condition has shown some improvement but is still not at baseline.
- The patient has been restarted on lasix with effective diuresis.
- Current medications include alb/atrov nebs, advair, solumedrol 80 mg IV q8, and others.
- The patient's agitation may be due to underlying schizophrenia and worsening agitation from steroid use and hospital delirium. Agitation responded to haldol and zyprexa prn.
- Plan is to continue current medications, restart oral prednisone, and add azithromycin for anti-inflammatory effects while monitoring for QT interval effects.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and disposition is transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and volume overload can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute on chronic hypercarbic failure increases the risk of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
3. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics, suggesting a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as needed is important.
4. Delirium/Agitation: The patient's agitation may wors"

   is not clear.  For example, is the progestin meant to be primary
   treatment for her respiratory disease?  How did her psychiatric
   medication regimen get to present state.  Ask pharmacy to help.  If
   still an issue, consider psych consult for psychopharm mgmt assistance.
   -consider sleep consult for chronic management
   -wean steroids (help wtih neuropsych sxs)
   -spoke with daughter who was concerned that pt. was not on home BiPap

   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure:
    Patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest
   COPD exacerbation but unclear precipitant given lack of fever,
   infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF
   and volume overload were worse from baseline and were exacerbating
   respiratory symptoms but now euvolemic with developing metabolic
   alkalosis. Given 25% of COPD exacerbaions of unclear etiology can be
   triggered by an underlying PE, will pursue further workup with CTA.CO2
   of 105 on admit ABG, improved to 80s with BiPAP. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission. Most recent ABG suggests chronic repiratory acidosis with
   developing concomitant metabolic alkalosis.   Will start to wean
   steroids since likely exacerbating agitation

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and CHF. She presents with shortness of breath and somnolence for three days and was initially admitted to the MICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was transferred to the floor on 4L O2 and now has been transferred back to the MICU with agitation and persistent hypercarbia. The patient's vital signs are stable, and her recent ABG shows chronic respiratory acidosis with developing concomitant metabolic alkalosis. She is on BiPAP at night per home settings. The patient's lab results indicate hyperglycemia and anemia, but other lab values are within normal range. She has a history of diabetes mellitus II, well-controlled, with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.8 in [**Month (only) 1996**] [**2132**]. The patient's medications include glyburide, HISS, simvastatin, levothyroxine, and various psychiatric medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Exacerbation of COPD: The patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation, and hypercarbia suggest a possible exacerbation of COPD. Further evaluation and treatment are required to manage this condition.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's lab results show elevated glucose levels, indicating hyperglycemia. This could be exacerbated by"

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   -need to review all medications and OMR.  At present, the role of each
   is not clear.  For example, is the progestin meant to be primary
   treatment for her respiratory disease?  How did her psychiatric
   medication regimen get to present state.  Ask pharmacy to help.  If
   still an issue, consider psych consult for psychopharm mgmt assistance.
   -consider sleep consult for chronic management
   -wean steroids (help wtih neuropsych sxs)
   -spoke with daughter who was concerned that pt. was not on home BiPap
   settings and wanted to know that carbon dioxide was coming down;
   someone should touch base with her every day
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure:
    Patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest
   COPD exacerbation but unclear precipitant given lack of fever,
   infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF
   and volume overload were worse from baseline and were exacerbating
   respiratory symptoms but now euvolemic with developing metabolic
   alkalosis. Given 25% of COPD exacerbaions of unclear etiology can be
   triggered by an underlying PE, will pursue further workup with CTA.CO2
   of 105 on admit ABG, improved to 80s with BiPAP. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission. Most recent ABG suggests chronic repiratory acidosis with
   developing concomitant metabolic alkalosis.   Will start to wean
   steroids since likely exacerbating agitation
   - Will change solumedrol 80 IV TID to 60mg Prednisone daily in am
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2
   - BiPAP at night per home settings
   - home advair
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - continue azithromycin for 5-day course, Day [**4-3**]
   - wean O2 as tolerated to baseline to maintain sats 90%
   .
   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic:
   CXR from this am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary
   edema and has had trending up bicarb likely from diuresis and
   contraction alkaslosis. Currently appears euvolemic. Patient had been
   on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold for now given
   adequate diuresis and euvolemia. Yesterday had autodiuresed -4L UOP
   over the last 24hrs. BNP was 2600 on admission, up from previous 800 in
   [**2132-4-30**].
   - Lasix prn SOB, e/o volume overload
   - hold additional lasix for now as autodiuresing
   - follow strict I/Os
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   - repeat EKG this AM
   .
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.
   Responded well to 5 mg Zyprexa previously, well to 2.5mg tonight.
   - hold Ultram, Rozerem, diphenhydramine
   - continue home Abilify, risperdal, Artane
   - Zyprexa prn for sundowning
   - restraints as needed
   # Diabetes mellitus II, well-controlled. Hemoglobin A1c of 6.8 in [**Month (only) 1996**]
   [**2132**]. Currently on home glyburide and HISS given hyperglycemia
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
   - continue home glyburide
   - HISS with QID fingersticks
   - wean steroids
   # Hyperlipidemia. No active concerns.
   - continue home simvastatin
   .
   # Anemia. Baseline hematocrit high 20s to low 30s. Most recent was 28
   and stable.
   - continue to trend daily hematocrit

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and CHF.
- She presents with shortness of breath and somnolence for three days and was initially admitted to the MICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient was transferred to the floor on 4L O2 but is now back in the MICU with agitation and persistent hypercarbia.
- Steroids were changed from Solumedrol 80mg TID to Prednisone 60mg qd.
- CO2 levels improved from 105 on admit ABG to the 80s with BiPAP.
- A PE protocol CTA showed preliminary negative results, and the CXR appears improved from an edema standpoint.
- The patient has an ICD in place and discussions are ongoing regarding DNR status.
- There was a resolved issue with decreased UOP overnight, possibly due to a Foley repositioning.
- The patient has large insulin requirements.
- A repeat ECG showed new V3 deep S wave not present before.
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below.
- Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 134/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on BiPAP.

","The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), congestive heart failure (CHF), and schizophrenia. She presents with shortness of breath and somnolence for three days, initially admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypercarbic respiratory failure, then transferred to the floor and back to the MICU due to agitation and persistent hypercarbia.

The patient's symptoms include shortness of breath, agitation, and hypercarbia, suggesting a COPD exacerbation. However, the exact precipitant is unclear due to the absence of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, or viral syndrome. The patient's baseline CO2 levels were in the 70s but have been in the 40s to 50s during previous admissions.

The patient is currently on BiPAP 18/10, standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, and prn q2 with home Advair. Her euvolemic status and developing metabolic alkalosis are being monitored with ABGs. The patient's daughter reports that she does not take Depakote at home, and ammonia levels are low. Psychiatric consultation is planned to discuss medication management.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus II with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.8 in 1996, currently on home glyburide and HISS given hyperglycemia exacerbated by high-dose steroids. Steroid wean is ongoing, and the patient's blood sugar will be monitored on SSI and glyberide with QID fingersticks.

Other medical issues include diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic, with cardiomegaly on CXR but improved pulmonary edema. The patient has been on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but it will be held for now given adequate diuresis and euvolemia.

The patient's agitation is likely multifactorial, secondary to hypercarbia and exacerbated by high-dose steroids versus underlying schizophrenia. Risperdal is being given prn for agitation, and the patient continues on home Abilify, risperdal, and Artane.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, confirmed with the daughter and healthcare power of attorney. The patient is at risk for aspiration pneumonia due to her inability to follow NPO orders and will continue to receive nectar thickened liquids and soft solids. Regular insulin sliding scale is being used for glycemic control.

Prophylactic measures include SQ UF Heparin for DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a PPI, although the need for PPI is unclear given the risk of aspiration pneumonia. VAP precautions are also being followed. The patient's need for restraints is reviewed regularly.

The patient is currently in the ICU awaiting transfer to the floor."

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission. Most recent ABG suggests chronic repiratory acidosis with
   developing concomitant metabolic alkalosis.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. Will get ABGs after changes to
   monitor improvement. Sleep is following
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - continue azithromycin, day [**4-1**]
   - Continue steroid wean. Prednisone 10mg po [**8-21**] then stop.
   - Unclear why patient is on MedroxyPROGESTERone. Will discuss with PCP
   and consider stopping as could be worsening her OHV.
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   - if transferred to floor, will have pulm continue to follow to monitor
   care
   # 9 beat asymptomatic Vtach: Patient at baseline has ectopic atrial
   rhythm with PVCs
   - No significant electrolyte abnormalities, will replete lytes as
   needed
   - changes in V6 only, not consistent with myocardial injury
   - Cont tele
   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: CXR from this
   am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary edema and has
   had trending up BUN likely from diuresis and contraction alkaslosis.
   Currently appears euvolemic. Bicarb trending up could be in part from
   contraction alkalosis.
   - Patient had been on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold
   for now given adequate diuresis and euvolemia.
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.
   - continue home Abilify, risperdal, Artane
   - Risperdal prn for aggitation. Per home psych Zyprexa has caused
   hyperglycemia
   - restraints as needed
   - Depakote and amonia levels low. Patient

   does not take Depakote at home. Will clarify with psych if she needs to
   be on it.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient has a history of COPD and is currently experiencing increased symptoms of shortness of breath and agitation. These symptoms, along with elevated carbon dioxide levels, suggest a possible COPD exacerbation.

2. Hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation, and persistent hypercarbia indicate a possible respiratory failure. This condition can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the patient has a history of well-controlled diabetes, the recent hyperglycemia exacerbated by high-dose steroids may lead to DKA. It is crucial to monitor blood sugar levels and adjust treatment accordingly.

4. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's symptoms, including cardiomegaly on CXR and trending up BUN, suggest diastolic congestive heart failure. This condition requires careful management of fluid balance and diuretic therapy.

5. Delirium/confusion: The patient's agitation and fluctuating mental status may be indicative of delirium or confusion. Multifactorial causes such as hypercarbia and high-dose steroids should be considered and addressed.

6. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's impaired gait and balance, as well as the decision to continue eating despite the risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart failure (CHF), and schizophrenia. She presented with shortness of breath, somnolence, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was initially admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypercarbic respiratory failure and then transferred to the floor on 4 liters of oxygen. She is now back in the MICU with agitation and persistent hypercarbia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's symptoms suggest a COPD exacerbation, which can be triggered by various factors such as infections, environmental pollutants, or other underlying conditions.
2. Hypercarbic Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbia and hypoxia indicate inadequate ventilation, which can lead to further respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of CHF, and her current symptoms may indicate worsening of the condition. This can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs and other organs, causing further respiratory distress.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate level is trending up, suggesting the development of metabolic alkalosis. This can occur due to diuretic use, dehydration, or other electrolyte imbalances.

   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF

   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. ABG unchanged following sleep
   recs of 88-90%SaO2 o/n.
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - Continue steroid wean. stop prednisone.
   - Unclear why patient is on MedroxyPROGESTERone. Will discuss with PCP
   and consider stopping as could be worsening her OHV.
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   - if transferred to floor, will have pulm continue to follow to monitor
   care
   -talk with sleep and talk with daughter concerning level of care
   necessary and most appropriate next step in care.
   -watch over night to let pt equilibrate in terms of respiratory
   status.  Consider acetazolamide tomorrow if respiratory status does not

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart failure (CHF), and schizophrenia. She presents with shortness of breath, somnolence, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was initially admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypercarbic respiratory failure and later transferred to the floor on 4 liters of oxygen. However, she was returned to the MICU due to agitation and persistent hypercarbia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, agitation, and hypercarbia suggest a COPD exacerbation. However, the precipitant is unclear given the lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, or viral syndrome.
2. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure, Acute on Chronic: The patient has evidence of diastolic CHF with persistent cardiomegaly on chest X-ray and trending up blood urea nitrogen (BUN) likely from diuresis and contraction alkalosis.
3. Agitation: The patient is likely experiencing multifactorial agitation secondary to hypercarbia and exacerbated by high-dose steroids versus underlying schizophrenia.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's current hyperglycemia may be exacerbated by high-dose steroids and previous use of Zyprexa, which has caused hyper"

2. Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: The patient has a history of CHF, and the recent trend of increasing BUN may indicate worsening heart failure.
3. Agitation: Multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and exacerbated by high-dose steroids or underlying schizophrenia.
4. Hyperglycemia: Exacerbated by high-dose steroids, the patient's blood glucose levels are elevated.
5. Anemia: The patient has a baseline hematocrit in the high 20s to low 30s, and the most recent value was 28.
6. Hypothyroidism: No active concerns, but the patient is on home"

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. ABG improved wearing BIPAP all
   night.
   - final Bcx negative.
   - Prednisone stopped
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   - if transferred to floor, will have pulm continue to follow to monitor
   care
   -watch over night to let pt equilibrate in terms of respiratory
   status.  Consider acetazolamide tomorrow if respiratory status does not
   change.  Would need art line for acetazolamide.
   # 9 beat asymptomatic Vtach: Patient at baseline has ectopic atrial
   rhythm with PVCs, no new Vtach o/n.
   - No significant electrolyte abnormalities, will replete lytes as
   needed
   - Cont tele
   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: CXR from this
   am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary edema and has
   had trending up BUN likely from diuresis and contraction alkaslosis.
   Currently appears euvolemic. Bicarb trending up could be in part from
   contraction alkalosis.
   - Patient had been on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold
   for now given adequate diuresis and euvolemia.
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.
   - continue home Abilify, risperdal, Artane
   - Risperdal prn for aggitation. Per home psych Zyprexa has caused
   hyperglycemia
   - restraints as needed
   - psych following
   # Diabetes mellitus II, well-controlled. Hemoglobin A1c of 6.8 in [**Month (only) 1996**]
   [**2132**]. Currently on home glyburide and HISS given hyperglycemia
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
   - Have reduced steroids and stopped zyprexa. Increased sliding scale
   and will monitor blood sugar on SSI and glyberide
   - HISS with QID fingersticks
   # Hyperlipidemia. No active concerns.
   - continue home simvastatin
   # Anemia. Baseline hematocrit high 20s to low 30s. Most recent was 28
   and stable.
   - continue to trend daily hematocrit
   # Hypothyroid. No active concerns.
   - continue home levothyroxine
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, soft solids and nectar thickened
   liquids
   # Communication: with daughter and patient via phone interpreter
   # Code status: DNR/DNI (confirmed with daughter, HCP)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart failure (CHF), and schizophrenia. She presents with shortness of breath and somnolence for three days, initially admitted to the MICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, then transferred to the floor on 4L O2, and now back to the MICU with agitation and persistent hypercarbia.

The patient has a past medical history of COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, anemia, and hypothyroidism. She is currently on several medications including albuterol/ipratropium nebs, BiPAP, prednisone, metoprolol, aspirin, Abilify, risperdal, Artane, glyburide, HISS, simvastatin, levothyroxine, and repletes electrolytes.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 75/20 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 89% on BiPAP, and sinus rhythm. The patient has crackles anteriorly in the lungs, no jugular venous distention (JVD), and no peripheral"
