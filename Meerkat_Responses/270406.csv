","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male who presented with dyspnea, constipation, chest pain, and delirium. He was intubated in the ER and diagnosed with right lower lobe pneumonia and extensive stool. The patient has a history of hepC, CVA with left hemiparesis, hypertension, and former alcohol use. His vital signs are stable, and he is receiving propofol and heparin infusions. The patient's neurologic examination shows delirium, and his review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of delirium. The patient's recent labs and imaging results are also provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with right lower lobe pneumonia. If left untreated or not appropriately managed, it can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and potentially death.
2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status or delirium. This condition can increase the risk of falls, aspiration pneumonia, development of pressure ulcers, and other complications associated with immobility.
3. Hepatitis C: Although the patient has hepC, there are currently no active issues related to it. However, if left untreated or unmanaged, hepC can progress and lead to liver damage, cirrhosis, and an increased risk of liver cancer.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for"

 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Assesment: 52 year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, prior
   strokes with left hemiparesis, HTN, HL who presents with altered mental
   status.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Altered Mental Status: Pt with baseline line deficits after stroke
   as well as extensive substance abuse history.  However, pt was more
   combative, oriented x 0 and confused on arrival.  He had to be
   intubated and sedated in Ed initially. CT-head negative for acute
   process. Pt with h/o hepC and lab work significant for mild
   transaminitis.  No evidence of decompensated liver failure or hepatic
   encephalopathy. Ammonia was 57.  Infectious workup + for right lower
   lobe pneumonia, but no leukocytosis or elevated lactate. Urine and
   serum tox negative. LP does not show evidence of meningitis but pt
   received single dose of Acyclovir for ? HSV now stopped given LP
   results.  Unclear cause of altered mental status. Current differential
   includes: infection (pneumonia vs encephalitis), hepatic
   encephalopathy, stroke or medications (diclofenac is hepatically
   cleared). Overnight still required significant Haldol to control
   agitation but this morning is interacting and less agitated.   At this
   point given negative work up  pt likely has baseline dementia and
   infection (pneumonia) likely altered him.
   -- treat pneumonia with Vanc and Zosyn
   -- F/U final CSF culture (gram stain neg)
   -- trial of lactulose with titration to BM >3
   -- holding gabapentin and diclofenac
   -- consider MRI in the future if continues to be altered
   -- Consider psych consult given history
   --Obtain records from [**Last Name (un) 11401**] to determine baseline/psych history
   -- Try to minimize use of anti-psychotics and orient frequently
   #. Pneumonia: CT-scan showed RLL pneumonia. No leukocytosis or elevated
   lactate. Urine legionella negative. Given sputum cultures (GPC in
   pairs/clusters) and healthcare associated pneumonia have changed to
   Vanc/Zosyn
   -- Continue Vanc/Zosyn day #2
   -- F/U final sputum culture/sensetivities
   .
   #. Hepatitis C: Pt with mild transaminitis, no evidence of
   encephalopathy per report. Ammonia level of 57. Last PCR showed 13.7
   million copies. No treatment and followed by hepatology.
   -- cont to trend LFT
   -- lactulose trial
   .
   #. Respiratory: Pt intubated for sedation to obtain imaging but easily
   extubated on arrival to ICU
   #. HTN: Pt currently normotensive with BP 114/76. Will hold BP meds for
   now given evidence of infection.  Will monitor and add back home
   regimen if stable.

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, prior strokes with left hemiparesis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with altered mental status and was intubated and sedated in the Emergency Department. The CT scan of his head is negative for any acute process. He has a history of extensive substance abuse.

The patient's lab work shows mild transaminitis, but no evidence of decompensated liver failure or hepatic encephalopathy. His ammonia level is 57, and infectious workup is positive for right lower lobe pneumonia. However, there is no leukocytosis or elevated lactate. The urine and serum toxicology tests are negative, and the lumbar puncture does not show evidence of meningitis. The patient received a single dose of Acyclovir for suspected HSV, but it was stopped given the negative LP results.

The patient requires significant doses of Haldol to control agitation but is more interactive and less agitated this morning. The differential diagnosis includes infection (pneumonia vs encephalitis), hepatic encephalopathy, stroke, or medications (diclofenac is hepatically cleared). Given the negative workup, the patient likely has baseline dementia and infection (pneumonia) likely altered him.

Plan:
1. Altered Mental Status: Treat pneumonia with Vanc and Zosyn. F/U final CSF culture (gram stain neg).
2. Pneumonia: Continue Vanc/Zosyn day #2. F/U final sputum culture/sensetivities.
3. Hepatitis C: Trend LFT. Lactulose trial.
4. Respiratory: Pt intubated for sedation to obtain imaging but easily extubated on arrival to ICU.
5. HTN: Pt currently normotensive with BP 114/76. Will hold BP meds for now given evidence of infection. Will monitor and add back home regimen if stable.
6. HL: Cont simvastatin.
7. FEN: NPO.
8. Access: PIV.
9. PPx: H2/heparin sq/ bowel regimen.
10. Code: FULL.
11. Dispo: ICU.
12. Comm: Sister: [**Name (NI) 11389**] [**Known lastname 11390**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11391**].

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening of pneumonia and development of sepsis.
2. Progression of hepatic encephalopathy due to Hepatitis C.
3. Development of delirium or worsening of baseline dementia.
4. Complications related to medication use, such as drug interactions or side effects.
5. Possible need for tracheostomy or prolonged mechanical ventilation.
6. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility.
7. Potential for further neurological decline or stroke.
8. Development of nosocomial infections while in the ICU.
9. Increased risk of pressure ulcers due to immobility.
10. Possible need for renal replacement therapy if there is acute kidney injury."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, prior strokes, hypertension, and heart failure. He presented with altered mental status, confusion, and agitation. The patient was intubated and sedated, and a CT scan of the head showed no acute process. The patient's lab work indicated mild transaminitis but no evidence of decompensated liver failure or hepatic encephalopathy. The infectious workup revealed right lower lobe pneumonia, but there were no signs of leukocytosis or elevated lactate. Other possible causes of altered mental status include infection (pneumonia or encephalitis), stroke, or medications. The patient's current condition includes pneumonia, altered mental status (not delirium), and hepatitis C. Treatment plans include antibiotics for pneumonia, lactulose trial for hepatic encephalopathy, holding certain medications, and considering an MRI if the altered mental status persists. The patient's respiratory condition requires ongoing monitoring and plans for weaning sedation and extubation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male who presented with dyspnea, constipation, chest pain, and delirium. He was intubated due to confusion and combative behavior. Head CT was negative for acute changes, but torso CT showed right lower lobe pneumonia and extensive stool. The patient was given vancomycin and zosyn, and tox screen was negative. He underwent CTX 2 gm and LP which was negative. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, receiving various medications including propofol, heparin sodium, and haloperidol. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 126 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/127 to 109/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The patient has a history of pneumonia, altered mental status possibly related to pneumonia or baseline dementia, and hepC. He is awaiting family arrival to clarify these issues. The patient's lab results show normal WBC count, Hct, and Plt levels. However, his Cr level is slightly elevated at 0.8 mg/dL, and Troponin-T level is below detection limit. Other lab results are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thromb"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male who presented with dyspnea, constipation, chest pain, and delirium. He was initially confused and combative but has since been extubated. The patient has a history of Hepatitis C, past cerebrovascular accident resulting in left-sided hemiparesis and impaired cognition, and is on multiple psychiatric medications for chronic dementia/agitation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slightly elevated heart rate. He is receiving mechanical ventilation and oxygen support. His blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and mildly elevated liver function tests. The patient has pneumonia and extensive stool in his torso, for which he is receiving antibiotics. He also has a history of hypertension, which is well-controlled when calm but increases during agitation.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current assessment includes pneumonia, altered mental status likely related to the pneumonia, and potential hepatic encephalopathy. The plan includes continuing current antibiotics, minimizing tubes and restraints, administering lactulose for possible encephalopathy and retained stool, monitoring and managing hypertension, and providing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications for this patient may include worsening pneumonia, hepatic encephalopathy, delirium, agitation, and hypertension. It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, mental status, liver function, blood pressure, and overall progress"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a chief complaint of dyspnea, constipation, chest pain, and delirium. He presented to the emergency room with stable vital signs but was confused and combative. He was given Haldol and Ativan, and subsequently intubated for further evaluation. A head CT showed no acute changes, while a torso CT revealed right lower lobe pneumonia and extensive stool. The patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn, and a tox screen came back negative. He received CTX 2 gm and underwent LP, which was also negative.

The patient has been extubated and is currently on invasive ventilation support. His vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 126 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/127 mmHg to 109/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. 

The patient has allergies to Zosyn, vancomycin, propofol, heparin sodium, haloperidol, lactulose, simvastatin, colace, risperidone, pantoprazole, dipyridamide, nicotine, lopressor, and nifedipine.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of -376 mL and -557 mL, respectively. His respiratory support includes an aerosol-cool face tent, CPAP/PSV mode, tidal volume of 818 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and arterial blood gas (ABG) results of ///24/. His vital signs and physical examination findings are listed as well.

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 9.4 K/uL, hematocrit of 36.2 g/dL, platelet count of 228 K/uL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, troponin T of <0.01 ng/mL, glucose of 108 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with hep C, a past cerebrovascular accident resulting in left side hemiparesis and impaired cognition. He is currently experiencing pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics. His altered mental status may be related to the pneumonia causing delirium on top of baseline dementia. The liver seems like a less likely cause. The patient's hep C is not currently active. He will be extubated and followed closely. Awaiting family arrival to clarify these issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics. There is a potential for the pneumonia to worsen or spread to other areas of the lungs.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and delirium may continue if the underlying cause, such as pneumonia, is not adequately treated.
3. Hepatitis C: Although the patient's hep C is not currently active, there is a risk of reactivation or complications associated with chronic hepatitis C infection.
4. Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA): The patient's past CVA may lead to further complications, including worsening hemiparesis or cognitive impairment.
5. Dementia: The patient has baseline dementia, which may progress or lead to additional cognitive decline if not managed appropriately."

24-hour events include invasive ventilation, administration of antibiotics, and infusion of various medications such as propofol, heparin sodium, haloperidol, and others. The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented.

Physical examination findings are limited due to the patient's unresponsive state. Lab results show elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Liver enzymes are within normal range, while electrolyte levels are mostly within normal limits. The patient's blood glucose level is normal.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient remains in the ICU for ongoing care. Nutrition, glycemic control, and lines management are being addressed. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP are also being administered."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 52 year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, prior
   strokes with left hemiparesis, HTN, HL who presents with altered mental
   status.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Altered Mental Status: Pt with baseline line deficits after stroke
   as well as extensive substance abuse history.  However, pt was more
   combative, oriented x 0 and confused on arrival.  He had to be
   intubated and sedated in Ed initially. CT-head negative for acute
   process. Pt with h/o hepC and lab work significant for mild
   transaminitis.  No evidence of decompensated liver failure or hepatic
   encephalopathy. Ammonia was 57.  Infectious workup + for right lower
   lobe pneumonia, but no leukocytosis or elevated lactate. Urine and
   serum tox negative. LP does not show evidence of meningitis but pt
   received single dose of Acyclovir for ? HSV now stopped given LP
   results.  Unclear cause of altered mental status. Current differential
   includes: infection (pneumonia vs encephalitis), hepatic
   encephalopathy, stroke or medications (diclofenac is hepatically
   cleared). Overnight still required significant Haldol to control
   agitation but this morning is interacting and less agitated.   At this
   point given negative work up  pt likely has baseline dementia and
   infection (pneumonia) likely altered him.
   -- treat pneumonia with Vanc and Zosyn
   -- F/U final CSF culture (gram stain neg)
   -- trial of lactulose with titration to BM >3
   -- holding gabapentin and diclofenac
   -- consider MRI in the future if continues to be altered
   -- Consider psych consult given history
   --Obtain records from [**Last Name (un) 11401**] to determine baseline/psych history-
   -- Try to minimize use of anti-psychotics and orient frequently
   #. Pneumonia: CT-scan showed RLL pneumonia. No leukocytosis or elevated
   lactate. Urine legionella negative. Given sputum cultures (GPC in
   pairs/clusters) and healthcare associated pneumonia have changed to
   Vanc/Zosyn
however overnight WBC increasing but afebrile overnight
   --Send U/A and culture
   -- Continue Vanc/Zosyn day #3
   -- F/U final sputum culture/sensetivities
   .
   #. Hepatitis C: Pt with mild transaminitis, no evidence of
   encephalopathy per report. Ammonia level of 57. Last PCR showed 13.7
   million copies. No treatment and followed by hepatology.
   -- cont to trend LFT
   -- lactulose trial
   .
   #. Respiratory: Pt intubated for sedation to obtain imaging but easily
   extubated on arrival to ICU
   #. HTN: Pt currently normotensive with BP 114/76. Will hold BP meds for
   now given evidence of infection.  Will monitor and add back home
   regimen if stable.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, prior strokes with left hemiparesis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with altered mental status and was more combative, oriented x 0 and confused on arrival. The patient required intubation and sedation initially. A CT scan of the head showed no acute process. 

The patient has a history of Hepatitis C and lab work significant for mild transaminitis. No evidence of decompensated liver failure or hepatic encephalopathy was found. Ammonia levels were 57, infectious workup positive for right lower lobe pneumonia, but no leukocytosis or elevated lactate. Urine and serum tox negative. A lumbar puncture (LP) does not show evidence of meningitis, but the patient received a single dose of Acyclovir for suspected HSV, which is now stopped given the LP results. The cause of altered mental status remains unclear. 

The current differential diagnosis includes infection (pneumonia vs encephalitis), hepatic encephalopathy, stroke, or medications (diclofenac is hepatically cleared). Overnight, the patient still required significant Haldol to control agitation but is now interacting and less agitated. Given the negative workup, the patient likely has baseline dementia and infection (pneumonia) likely altered him.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of agitation and restlessness. He was previously admitted to the hospital and received morphine and other medications, which made him sleepy. After being discharged home, he experienced pain and was given pain medications before being brought to the emergency room. The patient has a history of prolonged QT interval and is currently on haloperidol (Haldol) and heparin sodium (Prophylaxis). His vital signs show sinus tachycardia, slightly elevated blood pressure, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient has received several antibiotics including acyclovir, levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and vancomycin. His flow sheet data indicates fluid balance and respiratory support. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The assessment and plan include pneumonia, altered mental status, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms and abnormal chest x-ray may indicate pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory distress and sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's agitation and restlessness could be due to delirium or another underlying condition. If left untreated, it can progress to severe agitation, confusion, and increased risk of falls or self"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 52 year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, prior
   strokes with left hemiparesis, HTN, HL who presents with altered mental
   status.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Altered Mental Status: Pt with baseline line deficits after stroke
   as well as extensive substance abuse history.  However, pt was more
   combative, oriented x 0 and confused on arrival.  He had to be
   intubated and sedated in Ed initially. CT-head negative for acute
   process. Pt with h/o hepC and lab work significant for mild
   transaminitis.  No evidence of decompensated liver failure or hepatic
   encephalopathy. Ammonia was 57.  Infectious workup + for right lower
   lobe pneumonia, but no leukocytosis or elevated lactate. Urine and
   serum tox negative. LP does not show evidence of meningitis but pt
   received single dose of Acyclovir for ? HSV now stopped given LP
   results.  Unclear cause of altered mental status. Current differential
   includes: infection (pneumonia vs encephalitis), hepatic
   encephalopathy, stroke or medications (diclofenac is hepatically

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with altered mental status. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is being treated with vancomycin. His medical history includes schizophrenia, polysubstance abuse, neuropathic pain, constipation, hypertension, and a stroke. The patient's current vital signs show sinus tachycardia, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate within normal range, oxygen saturation at 93%, and he is on a regular diet with RN observation. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. The imaging shows a small infiltrate in the right lower lobe of the lung, which could indicate pneumonia. 

The patient's plan includes consulting psychiatry to evaluate his paranoid behavior and suspected underlying schizophrenia. He will also be monitored for QTc prolongation and his pain will be managed with neurontin. Lactulose will be continued to treat constipation. The patient's blood pressure medication will be changed to long-acting nifedipine, and he will continue taking aggrenox for his stroke. 

Potential medical complications that could arise include worsening of the pneumonia, development of delirium due to the altered mental status, potential side effects from the medications such as QTc prolongation, and further deterioration of renal function."

   as well as extensive substance abuse history.  However, pt was more
   combative, oriented x 0 and confused on arrival.  He had to be
   intubated and sedated in Ed initially. CT-head negative for acute

   transaminitis.  No evidence of decompensated liver failure or hepatic
   encephalopathy. Ammonia was 57.  Infectious workup + for right lower
   lobe pneumonia, but no leukocytosis or elevated lactate. Urine and
   serum tox negative. LP does not show evidence of meningitis but pt
   received single dose of Acyclovir for ? HSV now stopped given LP
   results.  Unclear cause of altered mental status. Current differential
   includes: infection (pneumonia vs encephalitis), hepatic
   encephalopathy, stroke or medications (diclofenac is hepatically
   cleared). Overnight still required significant Haldol to control
   agitation but this morning is interacting and less agitated.   At this
   point given negative work up  pt likely has baseline dementia and

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, prior strokes with left hemiparesis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient presents with altered mental status.

The patient's recent medical history includes being treated for psychosis with Haldol and Zyprexa, and overnight became very rigid with bruxism, given Benadryl 25mg x 1 for suspected dystonia with improvement.

The patient has been on various medications, including Acyclovir, Levofloxacin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and Vancomycin. The patient is currently receiving Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis), Haloperidol (Haldol), and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate 91 bpm, blood pressure 149/102 mmHg, respiratory rate 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support but does not require supplemental oxygen.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count of 281 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL, platelet count of 81 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 108 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular issues, skin not assessed, and neurologic examination not assessed due to the patient's altered mental status.

The patient's assessment includes altered mental status, right lower lobe pneumonia, hepatic encephalopathy ruled out, and no evidence of stroke or medication-related causes. The plan includes treating pneumonia with Vancomycin and Zosyn, restarting Gabapentin for pain contribution to altered mental status, and minimizing the use of antipsychotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening of pneumonia, development of antibiotic resistance, hepatic encephalopathy if the patient's liver function deteriorates, and potential side effects from medications such as Haldol and Zyprexa. Additionally, the patient's baseline dementia may contribute to ongoing altered mental status.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical response to antibiotics and other treatments. Frequent re-evaluation of the patient's mental status and neurological examination is necessary. Close communication with the hepatology team is important for managing the patient's Hepatitis C."

The patient also received Haloperidol (Haldol) for psychosis and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) for DVT prevention.

Upon examination, the patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 152/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has clear breath sounds but with crackles at the right base. The patient's extremities show no edema, and their neurologic examination is normal.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.0 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient has pneumonia and will continue receiving vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia for 10 days. The patient will have a PICC line placed, and altered mental status is noted, which may be related to recent treatment for psychosis. A possible dystonic reaction to Haldol overnight improved with Benadryl. The plan is to hold oral Haldol pending psychiatric re-evaluation this morning. The patient will continue taking Cogentin, restraints, and behavioral therapy.
