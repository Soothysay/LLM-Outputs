   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
   A/P: 80 yo W with PMH of DM, HTN, dementia presents with DKA and severe
   hypernatremia with unclear precipitant.
   .
   DKA: Likely precipitating factors include poor PO intake and not
   receiving insulin. ? whether pulm infiltrate on CT abd. Bcx sent in ED.
   UA without evidence of infection. No indwelling lines to raise concern
   for skin source.
   - monitor q1hr FS
   - continue Insulin gtt until anion gap is closed and able to tolerate
   POs
   - monitor lytes/A gap q6hrs until sustained improvement
   - start D51/2  if FS less than 250; otherwise continue 1/2 NS
   - monitor I/Os
   - levaquin for empiric tx of PNA and consider d/c if cultures negative
   - reimage chest after fluid repletion
   .
   Hypernatremia: Likely secondary to dehydration from poor po intake and
   osmotic diuresis if FS have been very elevated. Sodium 174 after
   glucose correction. Will not decrease serum sodium more than 12meq over
   24hr period as increased risk of cerebral edema, seizures and death.
   Free water deficit ~5.5L. Will replete for now with 1/2 NS for
   management of DKA and then change fluids to D5W when volume replete.
   - monitor lytes as above
   - 1/2 NS for now until gap closed and off insulin gtt

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dementia. She presents with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe hypernatremia, with unclear precipitant. The patient's DKA is likely caused by poor oral intake and not receiving insulin. There is also a concern about a possible pulmonary infiltrate on CT abdomen, but urine analysis does not show evidence of infection. 

The patient's hypernatremia is likely secondary to dehydration from poor oral intake and osmotic diuresis. The sodium level after glucose correction is 174, and the free water deficit is approximately 5.5L. The patient will be repleted with half-normal saline (1/2 NS) for the management of DKA and then changed to D5W when volume is replete. 

The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) is likely prerenal in etiology. Last creatinine level in our system from [**12/2175**] was 1.1. The patient will have urine electrolytes sent, IV fluids as above, and renally dosed medications. Nephrotoxins will be avoided, and ACE inhibitors will be held.

The patient's diabetes management will continue as above. Once the anion gap is closed, the patient can restart home dose insulin and sliding scale. 

The patient's hypertension will be managed once she is stable and renal function improves.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dementia. He presents with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe hypernatremia. The likely precipitating factors for DKA include poor oral intake and not receiving insulin. The hypernatremia is likely secondary to dehydration from poor oral intake and osmotic diuresis. Acute renal failure is also present, likely prerenal in etiology. The patient's blood pressure is currently unstable, and antihypertensive medications have been held. There are concerns for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) based on EKG changes, and the patient is scheduled for an echo today. The patient is experiencing constipation, which may be contributing to his poor oral intake. He requires repletion of electrolytes as needed, IV fluids with D51/2NS, and antiemetic medication. If the patient continues to refuse oral intake, placement of a feeding tube may be necessary. Prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) have been initiated. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is ICU care."

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of IDDM, hypertension, and dementia. She has been experiencing poor oral intake for one week and was found to be lethargic with elevated blood glucose levels. She was transferred to the hospital where she received intravenous fluids, insulin, and antibiotics. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), a heart rate of 90 bpm, a blood pressure ranging from 102/45 to 156/80 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98%. 

Her physical examination reveals that she is more awake but still slightly disoriented. She has dry mucous membranes, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm without murmurs, and tender abdomen without masses or organomegaly. Her extremities show no edema, and her neurological examination indicates that she is oriented to self but not time or place.

The patient's laboratory results show a blood glucose level of 355 mg/dL, a white blood cell count of 5.8 K/uL, a hematocrit of 29.8%, a platelet count of 367 K/uL, a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and a troponin-T level of 0.02. Her electrolyte levels include sodium at 162 mEq/L, potassium at 4.4 mEq/L, magnesium at 1.7 mg/dL, and phosphate at 2.3 mg/dL. 

The patient's assessment and plan include management for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), constipation, hypernatremia, acute renal failure (ARF), and hypertension. The patient is also being closely monitored for glycemic control, and her diet is being advanced. She has multiple lines in place for medication administration, and prophylactic measures are being taken for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of DKA, further electrolyte imbalances, progression of ARF, development of infections due to indwelling lines, and complications related to the patient's underlying conditions such as IDDM and hypertension."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of IDDM, HTN, and dementia who has been experiencing poor oral intake for one week. She was found lethargic and had elevated serum glucose levels, leading to her transfer to the ICU. The patient was started on IV fluids, insulin, and antibiotics. Her cardiac enzymes were within normal range, and imaging did not show any signs of infection or other abnormalities. She was also given prophylactic heparin and levoquin. The patient's vital signs have been stable, with a temperature of 36.6 C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/45-156/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her fluid balance has been monitored, with a total intake of 2,753 mL and output of 980 mL. The patient has received respiratory support but does not require supplemental oxygen. Her physical examination showed mild dehydration and tenderness in the abdomen. Laboratory results indicate hyperglycemia, elevated white blood cell count, high potassium levels, and signs of renal failure. The patient's glucose levels have been controlled, and her renal function is improving with IV fluids. The assessment and plan include managing diabetic ketoacidosis, addressing hypernatremia, acute renal failure, hypertension, and constipation.

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
   A/P: 80 yo W with PMH of DM, HTN, dementia presents with DKA and severe
   hypernatremia with unclear precipitant.
   # DKA: Likely precipitating factors include poor PO intake and not
   receiving insulin. Unclear whether pulm infiltrate on CT abd. Bcx sent
   in ED. UA without evidence of infection. No indwelling lines to raise
   concern for skin source.
   - monitor q1hr FS
   - continue Insulin gtt, will overlap with SQ insulin since AG now
   closed
   - will start NPH 4 [**Hospital1 **] and humalog SSI
   - monitor lytes
   - started on D5W for free water and since FS is <250
   - monitor I/Os
   - levaquin for empiric tx of PNA and consider d/c if cultures negative
   # Hypernatremia: Likely secondary to dehydration from poor po intake
   and osmotic diuresis if FS have been very elevated. Sodium 174 after
   glucose correction on admission. Will not decrease serum sodium more
   than 12meq over 24hr period as increased risk of cerebral edema,
   seizures and death.
   - change fluids to D5W 80/hr
   - monitor lytes as above
   # ARF: Likely prerenal in etiology. Last cr in our system fom [**12/2175**]

   - will send urine lytes
   - IVFs as above
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins, hold ACE
   # HTN: hold antihypertensives given hypotension and renal failure
   - restart when stable, first will restart dilt
   # Changes on EKG: concern for possible ST depressions in lateral leads

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dementia. The patient presents with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe hypernatremia. The likely precipitating factors for DKA include poor oral intake and not receiving insulin. It is unclear whether a pulmonary infiltrate on the CT abdomen is contributing to the patient's condition. Urine analysis does not show evidence of infection, and there are no indwelling lines that raise concern for a skin source.

The plan includes monitoring the patient's fingerstick glucose every hour, continuing insulin via a continuous infusion, overlapping with subcutaneous insulin since the anion gap has closed. The patient will start NPH and Humalog subcutaneously. Monitoring of electrolytes is also important.

Hypernatremia is likely secondary to dehydration from poor oral intake and osmotic diuresis if the fingerstick glucose has been very elevated. Sodium levels are being carefully managed to avoid rapid changes that could lead to cerebral edema, seizures, or death.

Acute renal failure (ARF) is suspected to be prerenal in etiology. The most recent creatinine level from our system was 1.1 on [**12/2175**]. Urine electrolytes will be sent, and IV fluids will continue as previously ordered. Medications will be dosed accordingly for renal function, and nephrotoxins will be avoided. ACE"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and dementia. He presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe hypernatremia, with unclear precipitants. The likely factors contributing to DKA include poor oral intake and not receiving insulin. 

The patient has been vomiting, which may be contributing to the poor oral intake. A CT scan showed a lot of stool in the colon, indicating constipation, which could be a precipitating factor for DKA. Cultures remain negative.

The patient is currently on NPH insulin and Humalog SSI. Fluids are being given at a rate of D5W 80/hr to address hypernatremia, and electrolyte levels are being closely monitored. The free water deficit is still 3L. 

Acute renal failure (ARF) is suspected to be prerenal in origin, with creatinine levels now resolved. Hypertension can be restarted as the blood pressure tolerates it. 

There are concerns about possible ST depressions in lateral leads on the EKG, indicating a possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event prior to admission. An echo is pending.

Constipation may be contributing to the patient's lack of oral intake and precipitating DKA. Aggressive bowel regimens, including enemas and lactulose, are being continued.

   Patient is ill but improving
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of hyperglycemia. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's medical history includes diabetes, but no known drug allergies. He was previously receiving insulin infusions and has now been transitioned off the drip. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/45-124/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,770 mL and output of 1,885 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 885 mL. His urine output is within normal limits at 780 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula, with an ABG showing pH at 7.22. 

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and not in acute distress. His cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds, and his peripheral pulses are palpable. The respiratory system examination shows symmetric chest expansion and rhonchi on auscultation. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, and extremities show no edema. Neurological examination reveals the patient to be attentive and purposeful, with normal muscle tone. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated blood glucose levels ranging from"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's glucose levels were significantly elevated at 618 mg/dL, indicating hyperglycemia. The patient's HbA1c level of 8.2% suggests poor long-term blood sugar control, consistent with diabetes mellitus. The presence of ketones in the urine (NGTD) confirms the diagnosis of DKA.

The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T) are within normal limits, but there is a borderline positive result for Troponin-T. This indicates a potential cardiac issue that needs further evaluation. The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are all within normal range.

The patient has a history of diabetes, but no known drug allergies. The patient has been on insulin therapy, which was advanced to a home diabetic regimen. The patient's diet will be advanced as tolerated. Levaquin, an antibiotic, will be discontinued if cultures remain negative.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 107/45 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.1°C (98.8°F).

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,770 mL and output of 1,885 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient"
