 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
   ASSESSMENT:
   This is a 82 year old male with a history of hypertension and diastolic
   heart failure who was admitted to the surgical service with acute
   cholecystitis, s/p ERCP for gallstone pancreatitis followed later by
   lap CCY with a complicated hospital course requiring SICU transfer for
   anemia, and now with persistent dyspnea and new oxygen requirement.
   .
   DYSPNEA/TACHYPNEA
   Pt becomes acutely dyspneic on sitting up although does not drop 02
   sats. Rapid onset and resolution of episodes suggests cardiogenic over
   reactive airway disease. Smoking history concern for COPD however CXR
   not remarkable, and COPD expect hypercarbia- does not have on gas.
   Prior gases  suggested compensating for metabolic acidosis, now
   7.49/32/138/22  likely hyperventilating and blowing off CO2.Rapid
   on/off of wheeze suggests cardiac wheeze from pulmonary edema although
   CXR not striking for volume overload
with some increased interstitial
   pattern consistent with early, possibly diastolic CHF.
   -continue diuresis with lasix, goal output 1-2L
   -check pm lytes.
   -Wean 02 as tolerated.
   .
   Leukocytosis:
   - White count trending down. Did bump y/d evening in absence of fever,
   ? PNA vs abdominal process in setting recent surgery: /KUB unrevealing
   unclear whether PNA with consolidaton obscured by pleural effusions.
   Blood cultured, continue Vanc/Zosyn day 2 for empiric coverage while
   cultures pending.
   - abdominal labs show no acute change thus far; if new abd syndromes,
   low threshold for CT
   - repeat echocardiogram to eval RV function.
   .
   - diuresing currently; afterload reduction for BP, restart home dose
   lisinopril 40 and labetolol.  Consider - along these lines, hydral for
   BP overnight, IV-->oral
   - holding verapamil for now given renal failure though may be
   advantageous in setting of diastolic failure and Cr likely his outpt
   baseline, will consider restarting
   LEUKOCYTOSIS
   Concern for pneumonia; given recent surgical history, concern for GI
   bacteria.
   - cover with vanc/zosyn as above
   - f/u cultures
   - follow wbc/diff
   - low threshold for CT abdomen, as above
   .
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
   Continue home levothyroxine
   .
   GLAUCOMA
   Continue home eye drops
   .
   GOUT
   Holding allopurinol for now; restart if Cr remains stable, vs. hold

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted to the surgical service for acute cholecystitis and later underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CCY) with complications requiring transfer to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). The patient has been experiencing persistent dyspnea and new oxygen requirements.

During the 24-hour period, the patient's blood pressure remained high despite being on hydralazine and verapamil. At 1 am, the patient suddenly called for help and was found to be in respiratory distress with audible expiratory wheezing. Nebulizer treatment and morphine were administered, and the symptoms rapidly improved with treatment.

The patient's allergies include ibuprofen and an unknown allergy. The last doses of antibiotics given were ampicillin/sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure of 167/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The physical examination reveals crackles throughout the lungs, a systolic murmur, a soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm, well-perfused extremities with 2+ radial and dorsalis"

- The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diastolic heart failure.
- He was admitted for acute cholecystitis, s/p ERCP for gallstone pancreatitis, and later underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CCY) with a complicated hospital course.
- The patient has persistent dyspnea and requires new oxygen.
- His vital signs include a blood pressure of 167/63 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.
- The patient experienced respiratory distress at 1 am with audible expiratory wheezing, but symptoms rapidly improved with nebulizer treatment and morphine.
- Physical examination reveals crackles throughout the lungs, worse at bilateral bases, and the patient becomes dyspneic with expiratory wheeze when sitting up.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels.
- Imaging shows bilateral lower lobe consolidations-pleural effusions vs atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.
- The patient is being assessed for pulmonary edema, respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute anemia secondary to blood loss, and hyperglycemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diastolic heart failure who was admitted for acute cholecystitis, followed by ERCP for gallstone pancreatitis and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He had a complicated hospital course requiring transfer to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) due to anemia and now presents with persistent dyspnea and new oxygen requirement.

The patient experienced episodes of sudden respiratory distress with audible expiratory wheezing, which improved rapidly with treatment. His blood pressure remains elevated, and he requires diuretics to manage pulmonary edema. The patient has leukocytosis, which could be indicative of pneumonia, and is being covered with antibiotics. There are concerns about the patient's mental status and the difficult relationship with his son.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent dyspnea and new oxygen requirement indicate a potential respiratory failure. The cause may be related to cardiogenic or reactive airway disease, possibly exacerbated by underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Close monitoring of respiratory function and oxygenation is necessary.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's elevated blood pressure and crackles throughout the lungs suggest fluid overload, leading to pulmonary edema. Diuretic therapy should be continued to manage this condition.

3. Pneumonia: Leukocytosis and the presence of bilateral lower lobe consolidations on chest"

   INDICATION: 82-year-old man with new acidemia. Evaluation for
   obstruction,
   free air or intra-abdominal process.
   COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen from [**2189-8-5**].
   FINDINGS:
   Air and stool seen throughout the small and large bowel with no obvious
   bowel
   distention seen. The domes of the diaphragm are not seen so evaluation
   for
   free air cannot be made on this supine radiograph. Osseous structures
   are
   unremarkable.
   X-ray abdomen
   No obstruction seen. For evaluation of free air a decubitus film is
   suggested.
   [**2189-8-12**]: AP chest compared to [**8-9**]. Respiratory motion obscures
   anatomic detail
   in the lower lungs, but there appears to be increasing right basal
   consolidation and a stable left lower lobe consolidation due either to
   pneumonia or atelectasis, with respect to [**8-10**] and 25. Upper lungs
   are
   clear. Heart is not enlarged. Pleural effusion is small if any. No
   pneumothorax.
   Microbiology: Urine Cx from 25th no growth final .
   Blood Cx from 17th no growth.
   3 blood Cx pending from 26th.
   Being MRSA screened.

 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
   ASSESSMENT:
   This is a 82 year old male with a history of hypertension and diastolic
   heart failure who was admitted to the surgical service with acute
   cholecystitis, s/p ERCP for gallstone pancreatitis followed later by
   lap CCY with a complicated hospital course requiring SICU transfer for
   anemia, and now with persistent dyspnea and new oxygen requirement.
   .
   DYSPNEA/TACHYPNEA
   ABG obtained shortly prior to arrival in MICU suggests that tachypnea
   on the floor was most likely largely compensating for an underlying
   metabolic acidosis, of unclear cause. However, also having some
   expiratory wheezing as well. Some increased interstitial pattern
   consistent with early pulmonary edema on his cxr. No known hx of COPD
   though was a long-time smoker. Labs not c/w CO2 retention. Obstructive
   sounds on exam could be associated w ""cardiac wheeze"" secondary to pulm
   edema. PE is a consideration given acute onset but quick resolution
   argues against this. Prior negative LENIs. Acute heart failure makes
   cardiac ischemia a consideration. S/p episode on the floor, he
   complains of being ""cold"" and as above, acidosis appears to underlie
   his tachypnea; suggestive of underlying infection. X-ray suggests
   possibility of pneumonia, would be HAP if so.
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - nebs for symptomatic relief
   - vancomycin and zosyn for infection/?pneumonia
   - abdominal labs show no acute change thus far; if new abd syndromes,
   low threshold for CT
   - repeat echocardiogram to eval RV function
   - diuresing currently; afterload reduction for BP; will hold off on
   restarting home ACEi for now to allow for more aggressive diuresis
   without renal insult, but likely would restart this soon once pt stably
   improved
   - along these lines, hydral for BP overnight, IV-->oral
   - holding verapamil for now given renal failure though may be
   advantageous in setting of diastolic failure and Cr likely his outpt
   baseline, will consider restarting
   .
   LEUKOCYTOSIS
   Concern for pneumonia; given recent surgical history, concern for GI
   bacteria.
   - cover with vanc/zosyn as above
   - f/u cultures
   - follow wbc/diff
   - low threshold for CT abdomen, as above
   .
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
   Continue home levothyroxine
   .
   GLAUCOMA
   Continue home eye drops
   .
   GOUT
   Holding allopurinol for now; restart if Cr remains stable, vs. hold

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted to the surgical service with acute cholecystitis, followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CCY) and experienced complications such as gallstone pancreatitis requiring ERCP and subsequent anemia requiring SICU transfer. The patient is now presenting with persistent dyspnea, new oxygen requirement, leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, and pulmonary edema. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has shown signs of respiratory distress with expiratory wheezing and an ABG suggesting metabolic acidosis. This could be due to underlying infection, cardiac ischemia, or pneumonia. The patient is already receiving nebulizers for symptomatic relief and antibiotics for suspected pneumonia.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: Given the patient's history of diastolic heart failure and acute onset of dyspnea, cardiac ischemia is a consideration. Further evaluation with cardiac enzymes is recommended.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's chest X-ray shows increasing right basal consolidation and stable left lower lobe consolidation, which could be due to pneumonia or atelectasis. Pleural effusion is small if any. Diuretics are being administered to manage the pulmonary edema.
4. Anemia: The patient had a previous episode of anemia requiring SICU transfer. Ongoing assessment of blood counts and management"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has been in the ICU. The patient's blood pressure remains high despite medication, and they have had recurrent respiratory distress episodes requiring intervention. The patient has received multiple antibiotics and various medications for hypertension and pain management.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within normal range, elevated blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and there is evidence of edema. The patient's neurological status is limited due to respiratory distress.

Lab results indicate anemia with a low hemoglobin level, elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine level, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. The patient also has hyperglycemia and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The assessment and plan include pulmonary edema, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute anemia secondary to blood loss, and hyperglycemia. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU with full code status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), further deterioration of renal function, progression of anemia, uncontrolled hypertension, and potential infections due to prolonged ICU stay and use of indwelling lines.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient has a history of hypertension and an unknown allergy to ibuprofen. The patient received Lasix, which improved his condition temporarily, but then experienced recurrent respiratory distress around 2 AM and was given Nitro Morphine and nebs, which improved his condition but he remains hypertensive this morning.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), heart rate of 87 bpm (54-101), blood pressure of 178/85 mmHg (108/53-197/128), respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute (13-30), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and has a sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress, a systolic murmur, faint end expiratory wheezes, fair air movement, distended abdomen with no rebound tenderness, and 2+ edema. The patient's mental status is described as answering some questions yes or no but with limited responses and often inconsistent.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 23.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL, potassium of 5.56 mEq/L, sodium of 137 mEq/L, chloride of 104 mEq/L, magnesium of 1."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. He has been experiencing recurrent episodes of respiratory distress despite receiving various treatments including Lasix, Hydralazine, Nitro Morphine, and nebs. The patient remains hypertensive this morning. His allergies include Ibuprofen, and he has been receiving multiple antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show elevated blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and low oxygen saturation. He is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and has mild respiratory distress. Physical examination reveals a systolic murmur, faint end expiratory wheezes, fair air movement, distended soft abdomen, and 2+ edema. The patient's mental status is altered, and he is only answering some questions yes or no with limited responses. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications for this patient may include:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of respiratory distress, hypoxia, and crackles on lung examination suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's increased respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, and the need for respiratory support indicate a potential respiratory failure.

   DYSPNEA/TACHYPNEA
   Pt becomes acutely dyspneic on sitting up although does not drop 02
   sats. Rapid onset and resolution of episodes suggests cardiogenic over
   reactive airway disease. Smoking history concern for COPD however CXR
   not remarkable, and COPD expect hypercarbia- does not have on gas.
   Prior gases  suggested compensating for metabolic acidosis, now
   7.49/32/138/22  likely hyperventilating and blowing off CO2.Rapid
   on/off of wheeze suggests cardiac wheeze from pulmonary edema although
   CXR not striking for volume overload
with some increased interstitial
   pattern consistent with early, possibly diastolic CHF.
   -continue diuresis with lasix, goal output 1-2L
   -check pm lytes.

   Blood cultured, continue Vanc/Zosyn day 2 for empiric coverage while

   - abdominal labs show no acute change thus far; if new abd syndromes,
   low threshold for CT
   - repeat echocardiogram to eval RV function.

   - diuresing currently; afterload reduction for BP, restart home dose
   lisinopril 40 and labetolol.  Consider - along these lines, hydral for

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted to the surgical service with acute cholecystitis, followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy and ERCP for gallstone pancreatitis. He had a complicated hospital course requiring transfer to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) due to anemia. The patient now presents with persistent dyspnea and new oxygen requirements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory failure and acute dyspnea may be attributed to pulmonary edema, which is often seen in patients with heart failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not managed appropriately.
3. Anemia: The patient's acute anemia is secondary to blood loss, which can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, indicating possible hyperglycemia, which can be associated with stress and poor glycemic control.
5. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: The trans-thoracic echo reveals hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with functional LVOT obstruction and increased mitral regurgitation. This condition can lead to heart failure and arrhythmias.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted to the surgical service for acute cholecystitis and subsequently underwent an ERCP for gallstone pancreatitis, followed by a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patient's hospital course has been complicated, requiring transfer to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) due to anemia and now presenting with persistent dyspnea and new oxygen requirement.

Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, which is not associated with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Treatment includes diuretics and monitoring of fluid balance.
2. Anemia, Acute: The patient has developed acute anemia secondary to blood loss during surgery. Blood transfusions may be necessary to manage this condition.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated. Close monitoring and appropriate management are required.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains high despite previous interventions. Medications such as lisinopril, labetalol, and hydralazine are being used for blood pressure control.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient initially presented with leukocytosis, which was initially concerning for possible pneumonia. However, the patient is now afebrile, clinically improved, and antibiotics have been discontinued. Monitoring of liver function tests (L"

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted to the surgical service for acute cholecystitis and subsequently underwent an ERCP for gallstone pancreatitis. He also had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap CCY) with a complicated hospital course requiring transfer to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with persistent dyspnea and new oxygen requirement.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/61 to 197/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is alert, calm, and cooperative, with faint expiratory wheezes bilaterally and a 2/6 systolic murmur. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, and shows minimal old blood at the laparoscopic incision sites. He has trace pedal edema.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diastolic heart failure, acute cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis, and complicated hospital course. He has been treated with various medications including verapamil, labetalol, hydralazine, lasix"

 PULMONARY EDEMA
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
   1.       Acute Resp Distress: Given his known diastolic dysfn and how
   rapidly he improved may well have been flash pulm edema, restart
   anti-HTN for rate pressure product control. Goal another 1 L negative.
   Repeat Echo shows diastolic dysfn and MR.
   COPD less likely as explaining acute decompensations- given rapid on
   and offset
 but should get PFTs at some point given ++ tobacco.
   2.       Leukocytosis: has received emprici ABX but were stopped when
   no source found. WBC trending down. Noo fevers Will monitor
   3.            ARF: stable CR- watch UOP, hematuria, in setting of foley
   trauma
   4.            Altered Mental Status: trying to discern extent of
   underlying mild demtia
 try to reach son

   Disposition :Transfer to floor
","The patient's chief complaint is acute respiratory distress. The patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction and mitral regurgitation, as evidenced by the trans-thoracic echo showing mildly worsening MR. The patient also experienced agitation overnight.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/61 mmHg to 112/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 346 mL, with 125 mL through the oral route, 221 mL through intravenous fluids, and a total output of 1745 mL, including 110 mL of urine output. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 24.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, platelet count of 437 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 30 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL, glucose of 88 mg/dL, and potassium levels of 3.7 mEq/L and 25 mEq/L. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.04 ng/mL, TCO2 is 21 mmHg, and lactic acid is 1.8 mmol/L. Other lab results are provided in the note.

The patient's assessment and plan include pulmonary edema, respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage), hyperglycemia, leukocytosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and altered mental status. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory distress, further deterioration of renal function, development of infections due to prolonged ICU stay, and potential complications related to hyperglycemia."
