   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o female with mod-severe aortic stenosis and 3 vessel coronary
   artery disease was admitted with CHF exacerbation.
   1. CAD:
   She will be candidate for surgical revascularization once infection
   from foot is cleared. For now, will continue medical management
   with aspirin. Plavix is primarily for PVD/stenting.
   - continue aspirin, statin, plavix
   - will follow-up with CT surgery regarding need for any further
   pre-operative evaluation
   2. CHF/AS:
   Etiology of her decompensation is unclear, but likely due to her aortic
   stenosis and worsened with infection. She currently appears slightly
   hypervolemic.
   - continue lasix 20mg IV with goal of being 1L negative today
   3. Hypoxia
   Etiology of her hypoxia is likely related to congestive heart failure.
   Additional possibility includes pulmonary emboli.
   - continue diuresis
   - if she doesn't improve with diuresis, consider CTA
   4. PVD: Stable
   - continue asa/plavix.
   - appreciate vascular surgery input
   5. Fever
   Differential diagnosis includes infection in her right lower extremity.
   Additional possibility includes pneumonia, endocarditis, or
   osteomyelitis.
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - check TTE
   - consider right lower extremity imaging for evidence of osteo
   6. ANEMIA: likely multifactorial. Will follow/trend.
   - Continue Iron.
   7. DIABETES: Has aggressive non-insulin regimen for outpatient
   use. Will hold these oral hypoglycemics and institute RISS for
   now while in-house.
   8. Tachycardia
   Etiology is likely related to her fever and infection.
   - continue to treat her fevers aggressively
   - continue beta blocker
   9. HYPOTHYROIDISM: continue LT4
   10. OSTEOPENIA/POROSIS: will hold fosamax while in house.
   11. Depression
   - continue escitalopram

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with moderate to severe aortic stenosis and three-vessel coronary artery disease. She was admitted with a congestive heart failure exacerbation. 

The patient presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia. She has been febrile since 08:00 PM the previous day and had blood and urine cultures sent. Her temperature peaked at 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit overnight. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate in the 110s to 120s, blood pressure ranging from 109/56 to 112/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination revealed a harsh systolic murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border, bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation, and trace edema in both lower extremities. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.1 thousand/mmÂ³, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, elevated troponin-T at 0.10 ng/mL, and elevated levels of PT/PTT/INR. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with aortic stenosis, hypoxia, peripheral vascular disease"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with moderate to severe aortic stenosis and three-vessel coronary artery disease. She was admitted with a congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient's current vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and an elevated respiratory rate. Her blood and urine cultures have been sent. She is receiving antibiotics, metoprolol, and heparin sodium. Other medications include aspirin, Plavix, statin, lasix, and iron. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of fever. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and blood glucose levels. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows low blood pressure and high heart rate. The patient's respiratory support includes an oxygen delivery device and supplemental oxygen. Physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, a harsh systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, and trace edema in both lower extremities. The patient's neurologic examination has not been assessed. The assessment and plan include treatment for CHF, aortic stenosis, hypoxia, peripheral vascular disease, fever, anemia, diabetes, tachycardia, hypothyroidism, osteopenia/porosis, and depression. The ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and ventilation-associated pneumonia prevention."

   TTE: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrial pressure is
   indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global hypokinesis
   (LVEF = 25-30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. The diameters of aorta at the
   sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
   (area <0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   fat pad. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-1-28**],
   global left ventricular systolic function is more depressed (and
   apprears global) and the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed. No
   discrete vegetations identified (does not exclude with deformed
   valves). Is the patient a surgical candidate for AVR?

","Summary:
The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note. The note highlights several events that occurred within a 24-hour period. The patient underwent a trans-thoracic echo (TTE) which revealed severe aortic valve stenosis and mild mitral regurgitation. The patient also had fever, but the fever curve trended down and no growth was observed in the urine culture. The patient's blood culture is pending. The patient's heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were within normal limits, although the patient was tachycardic with a heart rate of 118 bpm. The patient received diuretics to achieve negative fluid balance. The patient's TSH levels were within normal range, and the patient's blood glucose level was elevated at 214 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels were mostly within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's white blood cell count was elevated, and the platelet count was decreased. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were slightly lower than the previous day. The patient's creatinine level was stable, and cardiac enzymes were within normal range. The patient's daily flow sheet data showed an increased maximum temperature of 37.8Â°C, tachycardia, hypotension, and mildly increased respiratory rate. The patient's weight remained unchanged. The patient received metoprolol and furosemide infusions. The patient's"

   -HCT 24.3 in pm
   -Diuresed with Lasix 20 IV->40IV->60 IV; UOP 200cc per hour with 60 IV
   -TTE: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrial pressure is
   indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global hypokinesis
   (LVEF = 25-30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. The diameters of aorta at the
   sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
   (area <0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   fat pad. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-1-28**],
   global left ventricular systolic function is more depressed (and
   apprears global) and the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed. No
   discrete vegetations identified (does not exclude with deformed
   valves). Is the patient a surgical candidate for AVR?

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o female with mod-severe aortic stenosis and 3 vessel coronary
   artery disease was admitted with CHF exacerbation.
   1. CAD:
   She will be candidate for surgical revascularization once infection
   from foot is cleared. For now, will continue medical management
   with aspirin. Plavix is primarily for PVD/stenting.
   - continue aspirin, statin, plavix
   - will follow-up with CT surgery regarding need for any further
   pre-operative evaluation
   2. CHF/AS:
   Etiology of her decompensation is unclear, but likely due to her aortic
   stenosis and worsened with infection. She currently appears slightly
   hypervolemic.
   - continue lasix 20mg IV with goal of being 1L negative today
   3. Hypoxia
   Etiology of her hypoxia is likely related to congestive heart failure.
   Additional possibility includes pulmonary emboli.
   - continue diuresis
   - if she doesn't improve with diuresis, consider CTA
   4. PVD: Stable
   - continue asa/plavix.
   - appreciate vascular surgery input
   5. Fever
   Differential diagnosis includes infection in her right lower extremity.
   Additional possibility includes pneumonia, endocarditis, or
   osteomyelitis.
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - check TTE
   - consider right lower extremity imaging for evidence of osteo
   6. ANEMIA: likely multifactorial. Will follow/trend.
   - Continue Iron.
   7. DIABETES: Has aggressive non-insulin regimen for outpatient
   use. Will hold these oral hypoglycemics and institute RISS for
   now while in-house.
   8. Tachycardia
   Etiology is likely related to her fever and infection.
   - continue to treat her fevers aggressively
   - continue beta blocker
   9. HYPOTHYROIDISM: continue LT4
   10. OSTEOPENIA/POROSIS: will hold fosamax while in house.
   11. Depression
   - continue escitalopram

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with moderate to severe aortic stenosis and three-vessel coronary artery disease admitted for a heart failure exacerbation. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, likely due to congestive heart failure or pulmonary embolism, fever with unclear etiology, anemia, diabetes, tachycardia, hypothyroidism, osteopenia/porosis, and depression. The patient is being treated with various medications including lasix for fluid management, beta blockers for heart function, and antibiotics for potential infection. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 102/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of heart failure symptoms, progression of aortic stenosis, development of arrhythmias, further infection or sepsis, and complications related to diabetes management. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any changes in their condition and adjust treatment accordingly."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis and three-vessel coronary artery disease. She was admitted with congestive heart failure exacerbation. The patient's current condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease, which puts her at risk for further cardiac complications such as heart failure exacerbation, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction.

2. Infection: The patient has an infection in her right lower extremity, and there is a concern for possible osteomyelitis. The infection may be contributing to her fever and could lead to systemic complications if not treated appropriately.

3. Pulmonary Complications: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, which could be due to congestive heart failure or a pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation with a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) may be necessary to rule out a pulmonary embolism.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit level is low, indicating anemia. This could be multifactorial, including bleeding from the foot wound, chronic kidney disease, or other underlying causes. Blood transfusion and iron supplementation may be required to manage the anemia.

5. Diabetes Management: The patient has diabetes and is currently on an aggressive non-insulin regimen for outpatient use. However"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with moderate-severe aortic stenosis and three-vessel coronary artery disease. She was admitted with congestive heart failure exacerbation. The patient's current medical management includes aspirin, statin, and Plavix. She also has a foot infection that is being treated with wound care and antibiotics. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate in the 110s, blood pressure ranging from 109/61 to 113/81 mmHg, respiratory rate between 25-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97% on nasal cannula. 

Her laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The blood culture came back negative, and her renal function tests are within normal limits. 

The patient's physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor, crackles in the bibasilar chest, and evidence of bilateral lower extremity thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). 

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing medical management with aspirin, statin, and Plavix. She will be a candidate for surgical revascularization once the foot infection clears. The plan is to wean off oxygen, monitor for tachycardia, continue diuretics, and evaluate for pulmonary embolism if necessary. The patient's foot wound will be managed with wound vacuum therapy"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o female with mod-severe aortic stenosis and 3 vessel coronary
   artery disease was admitted with CHF exacerbation.
   # CAD: She will be candidate for surgical revascularization once
   infection from foot is cleared. For now, will continue medical
   managementwith aspirin. Plavix is primarily for PVD/stenting.
   - continue aspirin, statin, plavix
   - will follow-up with CT surgery regarding need for any further
   pre-operative evaluation (will need AVR at that time)
   #. CHF/AS: Repeat  echo showed EF 25-30% with progression of  AS to
   severe. Etiology of her decompensation is unclear, but likely due to
   her aortic stenosis and worsened with infection. She currently appears
   slightly hypervolemic.
   -responds to 60mg IV lasix, give today with blood
   -continue gentle diuresis bc of tight AS with goal 500-1L neg
   #.Tachycardia-NSR, baseline HR in 110s likely multifactorial infection
   vs anemia vs PE currently on 25mg TID metoprolol
   -give 1unit of PRBC today
   -monitor on tele
   -uptitrate betablocker as needed for goals HR<110
   -continue fever workup as below
   - LENIs negative on admission, consider CTA to r/o PE if not improved
   #. Hypoxia
   Etiology of her hypoxia is likely related to congestive heart failure.
   Additional possibility includes pulmonary emboli.
   - continue diuresis as above
   - if she doesn't improve with diuresis, consider CTA
   #. PVD: Stable
   - continue asa/plavix.
   - appreciate vascular surgery input
   #. Fever
   Differential diagnosis includes infection in her right lower extremity
   vs osteo. Additional possibility includes pneumonia consider CAP vs.
   HAP. Endocarditis unlikely given neg BCx and echo not suspicious for
   vegetations.
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures NGTD
   - consider right lower extremity imaging for evidence of osteo
   -appreciate vascular recs re wound vac
   #. ANEMIA: likely multifactorial. Hct at 24, baseline 28.
   - Continue Iron.
   -xfuse 1 PRBCs today
   -trend hct
   #. DIABETES: Has aggressive non-insulin regimen for outpatient
   use. Will hold these oral hypoglycemics and institute RISS for
   now while in-house.
   #. HYPOTHYROIDISM: continue LT4

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with moderate-severe aortic stenosis and three-vessel coronary artery disease. She was admitted with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient's current conditions include:

1. CHF/AS: The patient has a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 25-30% and severe aortic stenosis. The cause of her decompensation is unclear, but it may be due to her aortic stenosis and worsened with infection. She appears slightly hypervolemic.

2. Tachycardia: The patient has a baseline heart rate in the 110s, which is likely multifactorial, possibly due to infection, anemia, or pulmonary embolism. She is currently on 25mg TID metoprolol.

3. Hypoxia: The etiology of her hypoxia is likely related to congestive heart failure, but there is also an additional possibility of pulmonary embolism. 

4. PVD (peripheral vascular disease): Stable, and the patient is on aspirin and Plavix.

5. Fever: The differential diagnosis includes infection in the right lower extremity or osteomyelitis, as well as pneumonia. Endocarditis is unlikely given negative blood cultures and an echo that showed no suspicious veget"
