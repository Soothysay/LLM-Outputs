   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 67 year old male with history COPD (on 3L home O2) and newly
   diagnosed small cell lung cancer with intracranial met who is
   transferred from the oncology floor with progressive altered mental
   status and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Hypercarbic respiratory failure. Possibly
   secondary to COPD flare. This may also be secondary to altered mental
   status and hypoventilation.
   - Already on steroids.
   - Expand antibiotic coverage to possible hospital acquired organisms,
   including double coverage for pseudomonas: Vanc, zosyn, levo
   - Follow cultures
   - Continue albuterol, ipratropium nebs and steroid inhaler.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation.
   .
   # Altered mental status. Multiple possible etiologies. Hypercapnia as
   above from COPD exacerbation could be driving altered mental status.
   Intracranial hemorrhage in the setting of known intracranial metastatic
   disease is possible. A paradoxic medication effect including possible
   benzo intoxication/paradoxic effect or steroid psychosis are possible.
   - Treat pulmonary issues as above.
   - Noncontrast head CT to rule out intracranial hemorrhage ([**2120-5-19**])
   showed no change.
   - Limit sedating medications as much as possible.
   .
   # Small cell lung cancer. Widely metastatic to bone, liver and brain.
   - Day [**1-22**] carboplatin/etopiside with dexamethasone was [**2120-5-19**].
   - Continue allopurinol prophylaxis.
   - Neuro checks q4h.
   - Seizure prophylaxis with keppra, 500mg x3 days, 750mg x3 days then
   1000mg.
   - Expected XRT of brain met when stable.
   - Continue to be followed by oncology
   .
   # Leukocytosis. Likely in part secondary to steroids. Also a component
   of infection secondary to post-obstructive.
   - Trend WBC.
   .
   # Acute on chronic kidney failure. FeUrea 23% suggestive of pre-renal
   etiology. Platinum agents can also cause renal failure.
   - Maintain U output at 150cc/hr for possible tumor lysis component.
   .
   # Recurring rectal prolapse. Stable. Monitor for signs of recurrence.
   Surgical repair not indicated at this time.
   # COPD. Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs with steroid inhaler.
   .
   # CAD s/p MI. No signs of acute MI.
   - Hold aspirin while ruling out possible acute intracranial hemorrhage.
   - Hold beta-blocker in the setting of relative hypotension.
   - Continue statin therapy.
   - Continue holding plavix (bleeding risk) and valsartan (ARF) therapy.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 67 year old male with history COPD (on 3L home O2) and newly
   diagnosed small cell lung cancer with intracranial met who is
   transferred from the oncology floor with progressive altered mental
   status and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   #Hypotension: currently on phenylephrine drip; attempt to wean off
   phenylephrine today
   # Respiratory failure. Hypercarbic respiratory failure. Possibly
   secondary to COPD flare. This may also be secondary to altered mental
   status and hypoventilation.
   - Already on steroids.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with double coverage for
   pseudomonas: Vanc, zosyn, levo
   - Follow cultures
   - Continue albuterol, ipratropium nebs and steroid inhaler.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation.
   .
   # Altered mental status. Multiple possible etiologies. Hypercapnia as
   above from COPD exacerbation could be driving altered mental status.
   Intracranial hemorrhage in the setting of known intracranial metastatic
   disease is possible. A paradoxic medication effect including possible
   benzo intoxication/paradoxic effect or steroid psychosis are possible.
   - Treat pulmonary issues as above.
   - Noncontrast head CT ([**2120-5-19**]): no intracranial hemorrhage
   - Limit sedating medications as much as possible.
   .
   # Small cell lung cancer. Widely metastatic to bone, liver and brain.
   - Day [**1-22**] carboplatin/etopiside with dexamethasone was [**2120-5-19**].
   - Continue allopurinol prophylaxis.
   - Neuro checks q4h.
   - Seizure prophylaxis with keppra, 500mg x3 days, 750mg x3 days then
   1000mg.
   - Expected XRT of brain met when stable.
   - Continue to be followed by oncology
   .
   # Leukocytosis. Likely in part secondary to steroids. Also a component
   of infection secondary to post-obstructive.
   - Trend WBC.
   .
   # Acute on chronic kidney failure. FeUrea 23% suggestive of pre-renal
   etiology. Platinum agents can also cause renal failure.
   - Maintain U output at 150cc/hr for possible tumor lysis component.
   .
   # Recurring rectal prolapse. Stable. Monitor for signs of recurrence.
   Surgical repair not indicated at this time.
   # COPD. Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs with steroid inhaler.
   .
   # CAD s/p MI. No signs of acute MI.
   - Hold aspirin while ruling out possible acute intracranial hemorrhage.
   - Hold beta-blocker in the setting of relative hypotension.
   - Continue statin therapy.
   - Continue holding plavix (bleeding risk) and valsartan (ARF) therapy.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of COPD and newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer with intracranial metastasis. The patient was transferred from the oncology floor with progressive altered mental status and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Hypotension: The patient is on a phenylephrine drip to maintain blood pressure. There are plans to attempt to wean off phenylephrine today.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be secondary to a COPD flare or altered mental status leading to hypoventilation. The patient is already on steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started with double coverage for pseudomonas. Mechanical ventilation continues, and cultures are being followed.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has multiple possible etiologies for altered mental status, including hypercapnia from COPD exacerbation, intracranial hemorrhage in the setting of known intracranial metastatic disease, paradoxical medication effect including possible benzodiazepine intoxication/paradoxical effect or steroid psychosis. Treatment of pulmonary issues is ongoing, and a noncontrast head CT has ruled out intracranial hemorrhage. Sedating medications are being limited as much as possible.
4. Small cell lung cancer: The patient has widely metastatic small cell"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of COPD, small cell lung cancer with intracranial metastasis, and acute on chronic kidney failure. He was transferred from the oncology floor with progressive altered mental status and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently dependent on pressors for blood pressure support. He has multiple possible etiologies for altered mental status, including hypercapnia from COPD exacerbation, intracranial hemorrhage, paradoxical medication effect, or steroid psychosis. The patient has small cell lung cancer with widespread metastasis and has received chemotherapy. He also has leukocytosis likely secondary to steroids and infection, acute on chronic kidney failure, recurring rectal prolapse, and a history of CAD with previous myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is currently on a phenylephrine drip to maintain blood pressure. There is a concern for ongoing hypotension, which may require further intervention.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly secondary to COPD flare or altered mental status and hypoventilation. Continuous pressure control mechanical ventilation will be continued.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has multiple possible etiologies for altered mental status, including hypercapnia, intracranial hemorrhage, paradoxical medication effect, or steroid psychosis. Close monitoring and treatment of underlying causes are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 67 year old male with history COPD (on 3L home O2) and newly
   diagnosed small cell lung cancer with intracranial met who is
   transferred from the oncology floor with progressive altered mental
   status and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   #Hypotension: persists; currently on phenylephrine drip; requiring less
   today. Maintain pressors until family has confirmed that they would
   like to withdraw care.
   - CT chest [**2120-5-21**] shows lung cancer has a mass effect on SVC.
   Extension of cancer is most likely cause for positional hypotension.
   # Respiratory failure. Hypercarbic respiratory failure. Possibly
   secondary to COPD flare. This may also be secondary to altered mental
   status and hypoventilation.
   - CT chest [**2120-5-21**] revealed bilateral pleural effusions and persistence
   of lung cancer.
   - Already on steroids.
   - Follow cultures
   - Continue albuterol, flovent, ipratropium nebs, and steroid inhaler.
    - If patient and family still wish to withdraw care today will allow
   extubation.
   # Altered mental status. Multiple possible etiologies. Hypercapnia as
   above from COPD exacerbation could be driving altered mental status.
   Intracranial hemorrhage in the setting of known intracranial metastatic
   disease is possible. A paradoxic medication effect including possible
   benzo intoxication/paradoxic effect or steroid psychosis are possible.
   - Treat pulmonary issues as above.
   - Noncontrast head CT ([**2120-5-19**]): no intracranial hemorrhage
   - Limit sedating medications as much as possible.
   # Small cell lung cancer. Widely metastatic to bone, liver and brain.
   - Day [**1-22**] carboplatin/etopiside with dexamethasone was [**2120-5-19**].
   - Continue allopurinol prophylaxis.
   - Neuro checks q4h.
   - Seizure prophylaxis with keppra, 500mg x3 days, 750mg x3 days then
   1000mg.
   - Continue to be followed by oncology: notified Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 821**] of patients
   status ([**2120-5-22**]) and likely extubation
   # Recurring rectal prolapse. Stable. Monitor for signs of recurrence.
   Surgical repair not indicated at this time.
   # Constipation: improved. Continue treating constipation with increased
   dose of lactulose.
   # COPD. Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs with steroid inhaler.
   # CAD s/p MI. No signs of acute MI.
   - Hold beta-blocker in the setting of relative hypotension.
   - Continue statin therapy.
   - Continue holding plavix (bleeding risk) and valsartan (ARF) therapy.
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, H2 Blocker, Bowel regimen PRN.
   # FEN: d/c tube feeds prior to extubation
   # Access: Central line, Peripheral IV's.
   # Code Status: DNR/DNI
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) **], wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 790**]
   -    Meet with family to day to discuss goals of therapy
   -    Schedule a family meeting to discuss and initiate CMO care

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 67 year old male with history COPD (on 3L home O2) and newly
   diagnosed small cell lung cancer with intracranial met who is
   transferred from the oncology floor with progressive altered mental
   status and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   #Hypotension: persists; currently on phenylephrine drip; requiring less
   today. Maintain pressors until family has confirmed that they would
   like to withdraw care.
   - CT chest [**2120-5-21**] shows lung cancer has a mass effect on SVC.
   Extension of cancer is most likely cause for positional hypotension.
   # Respiratory failure. Hypercarbic respiratory failure. Possibly
   secondary to COPD flare. This may also be secondary to altered mental
   status and hypoventilation.
   - CT chest [**2120-5-21**] revealed bilateral pleural effusions and persistence
   of lung cancer.
   - Already on steroids.
   - Follow cultures
   - Continue albuterol, flovent, ipratropium nebs, and steroid inhaler.
    - If patient and family still wish to withdraw care today will allow
   extubation.
   # Altered mental status. Multiple possible etiologies. Hypercapnia as
   above from COPD exacerbation could be driving altered mental status.
   Intracranial hemorrhage in the setting of known intracranial metastatic
   disease is possible. A paradoxic medication effect including possible
   benzo intoxication/paradoxic effect or steroid psychosis are possible.
   - Treat pulmonary issues as above.
   - Noncontrast head CT ([**2120-5-19**]): no intracranial hemorrhage
   - Limit sedating medications as much as possible.
   # Small cell lung cancer. Widely metastatic to bone, liver and brain.
   - Day [**1-22**] carboplatin/etopiside with dexamethasone was [**2120-5-19**].
   - Continue allopurinol prophylaxis.
   - Neuro checks q4h.
   - Seizure prophylaxis with keppra, 500mg x3 days, 750mg x3 days then
   1000mg.
   - Continue to be followed by oncology: notified Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 821**] of patients
   status ([**2120-5-22**]) and likely extubation
   # Recurring rectal prolapse. Stable. Monitor for signs of recurrence.
   Surgical repair not indicated at this time.
   # Constipation: improved. Continue treating constipation with increased
   dose of lactulose.
   # COPD. Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs with steroid inhaler.
   # CAD s/p MI. No signs of acute MI.
   - Hold beta-blocker in the setting of relative hypotension.
   - Continue statin therapy.
   - Continue holding plavix (bleeding risk) and valsartan (ARF) therapy.
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, H2 Blocker, Bowel regimen PRN.
   # FEN: d/c tube feeds prior to extubation
   # Access: Central line, Peripheral IV's.
   # Code Status: DNR/DNI
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) **], wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 790**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of COPD and newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer. He was transferred from the oncology floor with progressive altered mental status and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently dependent on vasopressors for hypotension and is on mechanical ventilation. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, and elevated LDH levels. Imaging shows large left-sided pleural effusion, small right-sided pleural effusion, large left hilar mass with bronchial obstruction, confluent liver metastases, and a large right paratracheal lymph node with mass effect on the superior vena cava.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is currently dependent on vasopressors for hypotension. Noncontrast CT chest/abdomen is ordered to determine the extent of lung pathology and rule out vessel compression as a cause of low blood pressure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly secondary to COPD exacerbation or altered mental status and hypoventilation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and cultures are being followed. The patient is already on steroids and will continue with albuterol, fluticasone, ipratropium nebs, and steroid inhaler.
