   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presents
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt had acute onset of tachycardia,
   tachypnea and hypoxia, with 02 sats in 80's on NC and NRB. Pt intubated
   for hypoxia, tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. CTA
   did not show PE..
   Etiology of resp failure is most likely sepsis with lactic acidosis and
   respiratory compensation with tachypnea. Restrictive physiology may be
   also contributing, in setting of obesity and abdominal distention.
   There is concern for developing ARDS given severity of pancreatitis,
   but Pa-2/Fi02 now within stable range.
   - maintain on AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg, goal Pa02>60,
   plateua pressure<30, permissive hypercapnea
   - wean Fi02 as tolerated
   - increase PEEP to 15 to prevent further collapse within low lung
   volumes, monitor for e/o autoPEEP
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC 46 from 26 in past 24 hours. Also has reactive
   thrombocytosis. Fever 101 this AM. Most likely due to severe
   necrotizing pancreatitis, possibly c/b bacterial translocation into
   bloodstream and sepsis. C. dif neg. Pt also has PICC in place, so there
   is mild concern for line infection.
   - empiric Zosyn 4.5 gIV q8h, vancomycin 1g q12 and fluconazole 400 mg
   daily
   - monitor fever curve and WBC/diff
   - blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx
   .
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis:
   Pt currently stable with decreasing LFTs and bili. Persistent abdominal
   pain may have been [**3-1**] narcotics causing sphincter of Oddi contractions
   vs. worsening of pancreatitis as seen on CT. Pt has distributive shock
   [**3-1**] 3rd spacing and likely sepsis.
   - aggressive IVF (4L overnight) for goal UOP>30cc/hr, MAP>65
   - fluid replete with D5W with 3 amp biacrb in between liters of NS
   (held off LR because hyperkalemia)
   - consider albumin as per surgery team
   - trend lactate
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - OGT to suction

   - follow bladder pressure as a measure of intra-ab
   distention/compartment syndrome
   - check TG (blood sample lipemic)
   - check B-glucan
   .
   # Hypotension: currently on levophed, likely [**3-1**] sepsis, narcotics and
   sedation. BP responding to IVF boluses.
   - IVF as above, wean levophed as tolerated for MAP>65
   .
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tachy to 160s this AM after repositioning. Tachy
   likely mutlifactorial in setting of pain, fever, infection.
   - control fever with Tylenol/Motrin prn
   - pain control with increased Fentayl
   .
   #. hyponatremia: most likely hypovolemic given rest of picture and
   resolution with IVF.
   - monitor with ongoing resusitation
   .
   # Coagulopathy:
   Likely due to vitamin K deficiency from poor nutrition and recent
   antibiotics.
   - monitor coags
   - replete Vitamin K prn, monitor for signs of bleeding

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated for hypoxia and tachypnea. The cause of respiratory failure is most likely sepsis with lactic acidosis and respiratory compensation. There is concern for developing ARDS due to the severity of pancreatitis, but the patient's Pa-2/FiO2 is now within a stable range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient had an acute onset of tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia, requiring intubation. This condition is likely due to sepsis with lactic acidosis and respiratory compensation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 46 from 26 in the past 24 hours, reactive thrombocytosis, and fever. Severe necrotizing pancreatitis may lead to bacterial translocation into the bloodstream and sepsis.
3. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient has persistent abdominal pain, decreasing LFTs and bili, and distributive shock. There is concern for worsening pancreatitis as seen on CT.
4. Hypotension: The patient is currently on levophed, likely due to sepsis, narcotics, and sedation. BP is responding to IVF boluses"

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presents
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt had acute onset of tachycardia,
   tachypnea and hypoxia, with 02 sats in 80's on NC and NRB. Lack of
   improvement on 02 sat and low p02 on NRB intially suggested shunt
   physiology. CXR unremarkable for any acute infiltrate or PTX. Acute
   onset of these symptoms highly concerning for PE, and patient does have
   risk factors (recent surgery, immobilization [**3-1**] pain). CTA however did
   not show PE. Pt intubated for hypoxia, tachypnea to 50s, with concern
   for imminent fatigue.
   Etiology of resp failure is most likely sepsis with lactic acidosis and
   respiratory compensation with tachypnea. Restrictive physiology may
   have also contributed, in setting of obesity and abdominal distention.
   There is concern for developing ARDS given severity of pancreatitis.
   - maintain on AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg, goal Pa02>60,
   plateua pressure<30, permissive hypercapnea
   - wean Fi02 as tolerated, maintain 10 PEEP for now
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC 46 from 26 in past 24 hours. Also has reactive
   thrombocytosis. Afebrile. Most likely due to severe necrotizing
   pancreatitis, possibly c/b bacterial translocation into bloodstream and
   sepsis. C. dif is pending, but timing of elevation seems rapid for this
   etiology. Pt also has PICC in place, so there is mild concern for line
   infection.
   - empiric Zosyn 4.5 gIV q8h
   - pull PICC and give one time dose vanco empirically
   - trend WBC, obtain diff
   - hold off abx unless appears septic or further decompensates
   - blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx
   - f/u C. dif
   .
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis:
   Pt currently stable with decreasing LFTs and bili. Persistent abdominal
   pain may have been [**3-1**] narcotics causing sphincter of Oddi contractions
   vs. worsening of pancreatitis as seen on CT. Pt has distributive shock
   [**3-1**] 3rd spacing and likely sepsis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, necrosis, and pseudocyst. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated due to hypoxia and tachypnea. The etiology of respiratory failure is likely sepsis with lactic acidosis and respiratory compensation. There is concern for developing ARDS given the severity of pancreatitis.

The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 46 from 26 in the past 24 hours, along with reactive thrombocytosis. He is afebrile, but there is concern for line infection as he has a PICC line in place.

The patient's abdominal pain may be related to narcotics causing sphincter of Oddi contractions or worsening of pancreatitis as seen on CT. He has distributive shock and likely sepsis.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient had acute onset tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia, initially suggesting shunt physiology. The lack of improvement on O2 sat and low PaO2 on NRB intially suggested pulmonary embolism (PE), but CTA did not show PE. The patient was intubated for hypoxia, tachypnea, and concern for imminent fatigue.
2. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis, lactic acidosis,"

   tachypnea and hypoxia, with 02 sats in 80's on NC and NRB. Lack of
   improvement on 02 sat and low p02 on NRB intially suggested shunt
   physiology. CXR unremarkable for any acute infiltrate or PTX. Acute
   onset of these symptoms highly concerning for PE, and patient does have
   risk factors (recent surgery, immobilization [**3-1**] pain). CTA however did
   not show PE. Pt intubated for hypoxia, tachypnea to 50s, with concern
   for imminent fatigue.
   Etiology of resp failure is most likely sepsis with lactic acidosis and
   respiratory compensation with tachypnea. Restrictive physiology may
   have also contributed, in setting of obesity and abdominal distention.

   etiology of sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated due to hypoxia and tachypnea. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, which is likely the cause of his respiratory failure. He is currently being treated in the ICU with aggressive fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with acute hypoxia, tachypnea, and tachycardia. This condition was initially thought to be due to a pulmonary embolism (PE), but a computed tomography angiography (CTA) did not show any evidence of PE. However, the patient's symptoms and risk factors for PE suggest that it could still be a potential complication. The etiology of respiratory failure is now believed to be sepsis with lactic acidosis and respiratory compensation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count and a left shift. He also has a thrombocytosis with an elevated platelet count. These findings, along with his clinical presentation, suggest the development of sepsis. The source of infection appears to be the necrotizing pancreatitis, which may have led to bacterial translocation into the bloodstream.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has necrotizing pancreatitis and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure but showed no evidence of cholangitis. The patient's oxygenation worsened during the procedure, so they were given 100% FiO2. They were also given phenylephrine transiently during the ERCP. The plan is to perform a CT-guided aspirate of phlegmon with initial gram stain, and if positive, consider an operation later tomorrow. The patient was paralyzed overnight with cisatracurium to improve synchrony with the ventilator. The patient's pCO2 trended up, so the tidal volume was increased to 450 cc. The patient received fluid boluses of LR and NS. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C), heart rate of 137 bpm, blood pressure of 112/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 18 cmH2O PEEP and 60% FiO2. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.35, PaCO2 of 58 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 120. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 63.5 K/uL, and their blood glucose level is elevated at 160 mg"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and
   pseudocyst presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt had acute onset of tachycardia,
   tachypnea and hypoxia, with 02 sats in 80's on NC and NRB. Lack of
   improvement on 02 sat and low p02 on NRB intially suggested shunt
   physiology. CXR unremarkable for any acute infiltrate or PTX. Acute
   onset of these symptoms was concerning for PE, and patient does have
   risk factors (recent surgery, immobilization [**3-1**] pain). CTA however did
   not show PE. Pt intubated for hypoxia, tachypnea to 50s, with concern
   for imminent fatigue.
   Etiology of resp failure is most likely sepsis and ARD. Restrictive
   physiology likely contributed, in setting of obesity and abdominal
   distention.   Progression to ARDS given severity of necrotizing
   pancreatitis.
   - maintain on AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc, goal
   Pa02>60, plateua pressure<30, permissive hypercapnea.  Esophageal
   balloon suggests under-PEEPing, can increase current PEEP of 18 to21
   - cont ARDSnet, switch settings to Pressure Control
   - will need replacement of a-line
   - cont paralysis with cisatracurium, sedation with fent and midaz
   .
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis:  Pt currently stable with decreasing LFTs
   and bili. Persistent abdominal pain may have been [**3-1**] narcotics causing
   sphincter of Oddi contractions vs. worsening of pancreatitis as seen on
   CT. Pt has distributive shock [**3-1**] 3rd spacing and likely sepsis.
   Patient also has significant leukocytosis and reactive thrombocytosis.
   Most likely due to severe necrotizing pancreatitis, possibly c/b
   bacterial translocation into bloodstream and sepsis. C. dif (-), no
   evidence of C. diff colitis on sigmoidoscopy.
   - cont aggressive IVF for goal UOP>50-100 cc/hr, MAP>65
   - trend lactate
   - appreciate surgery recs -> plan for bedside ultrasound-guided
   aspirate and possible drain placement
   - if gram stain (+), consideration for OR later today; if (-), likely

   - check urine lytes
   - cont to titrate fluid resuscitation to UOP
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins

   # Coagulopathy:  Likely due to vitamin K deficiency from poor nutrition
   and recent antibiotics.  No evidence of DIC.
   - monitor coags, including fibrinogen
   - vitamin K 10 mg IV x 1

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation, presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition is critical, and multiple complications are present.

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has acute onset tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia, which initially suggested shunt physiology. However, since there are no acute infiltrates or pneumothorax on chest X-ray, the etiology of respiratory failure is most likely sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The restrictive physiology likely contributed to the respiratory failure, especially considering the patient's obesity and abdominal distention.

2. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient has severe necrotizing pancreatitis with ongoing abdominal pain, decreasing liver function tests (LFTs), and biliary dilation. The persistent abdominal pain may have been caused by narcotics causing sphincter of Oddi contractions or worsening of pancreatitis as seen on CT.

3. Sepsis: The patient has distributive shock with third spacing and likely sepsis. This is supported by significant leukocytosis and reactive thrombocytosis. The most likely cause of sepsis is severe necrotizing pancreatitis with bacterial translocation into the bloodstream.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient likely has coagulopathy due to vitamin K deficiency from poor nutrition and recent antibiotics. No evidence of disseminated intrav"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with several significant medical conditions. The chief complaint includes hypoxic respiratory failure and necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient has a history of cholecystitis and is currently experiencing acute pancreatitis.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device, and their vital signs show a high heart rate (HR), low blood pressure (BP), increased respiratory rate (RR), and slightly low oxygen saturation (SpO2). They also have a fever with a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F).

The patient has multiple IV lines, including an arterial line, and is receiving various medications such as vasopressin, insulin, fentanyl, cisatracurium, norepinephrine, and midazolam. They are also receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), low hemoglobin (Hct), elevated platelet count (Plt), elevated creatinine (Cr), and abnormal liver function tests. The amylase and lipase levels are elevated, suggesting ongoing pancreatic inflammation.

The patient's abdomen is distended and tense, with a quiet bowel sound (BS), and they have bilateral lower extremity edema. They are sedated and paralyzed due to the use of medications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis due to the"

   tachypnea and hypoxia, with 02 sats in 80's on NC and NRB. Lack of
   improvement on 02 sat and low p02 on NRB intially suggested shunt
   physiology. CXR unremarkable for any acute infiltrate or PTX. Acute
   onset of these symptoms was concerning for PE, and patient does have
   risk factors (recent surgery, immobilization [**3-1**] pain). CTA however did
   not show PE. Pt intubated for hypoxia, tachypnea to 50s, with concern
   for imminent fatigue.
   Etiology of resp failure is most likely sepsis and ARD. Restrictive
   physiology likely contributed, in setting of obesity and abdominal
   distention.   Progression to ARDS given severity of necrotizing
   pancreatitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which was initially suspected to be due to a pulmonary embolism (PE). However, a computed tomography angiography (CTA) did not show any evidence of PE. The patient was intubated for hypoxia and tachypnea, with concerns for imminent fatigue. The etiology of respiratory failure is believed to be sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely secondary to severe necrotizing pancreatitis. 

The patient's abdominal pain may be related to the pancreatitis or potentially caused by narcotics leading to sphincter of Oddi contractions. There are signs of distributive shock and likely sepsis, indicated by leukocytosis and reactive thrombocytosis. The patient's lactate levels should be trended, and aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation is recommended to maintain a target urine output of 50-100 cc/hr and mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. 

The patient requires an ultrasound-guided aspiration and possible drain placement for the necrotizing pancreatitis. If gram stain is positive, consideration for surgical intervention in the operating room will be necessary. The patient is also at risk for renal failure, coagulopathy, and electrolyte imbalances, which should be monitored and managed appropriately."

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with necrotizing pancreatitis and acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient presented with acute onset of tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. Initial improvement on oxygen saturation and low P02 on nasal cannula suggested shunt physiology. However, a chest X-ray was unremarkable for any acute infiltrate or pneumothorax. Acute onset of these symptoms was concerning for pulmonary embolism, especially with the patient's recent surgery and immobilization. However, a CT angiogram did not show any pulmonary embolism. The patient was intubated for hypoxia and tachypnea due to concern for imminent fatigue.

Given the negative culture dates, the likely etiology of respiratory failure is most likely distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. Restrictive physiology likely contributed, considering the patient's obesity and abdominal distention. Progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is also likely due to the severity of necrotizing pancreatitis.

The patient's current plan includes maintaining on assisted control ventilation (AC) with ARDSnet settings, with a tidal volume of 6 cc/kg, goal PaO2 > 60, plateau pressure of 31, and permissive hypercapnia. Esophageal balloon suggested under-PEEPing, and PEEP is now at 21. The patient will continue to be weaned as tolerated.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and
   pseudocyst presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt had acute onset of tachycardia,
   tachypnea and hypoxia, with 02 sats in 80's on NC and NRB. Lack of
   improvement on 02 sat and low p02 on NRB intially suggested shunt
   physiology. CXR unremarkable for any acute infiltrate or PTX. Acute
   onset of these symptoms was concerning for PE, and patient does have
   risk factors (recent surgery, immobilization [**3-1**] pain). CTA however did
   not show PE. Pt intubated for hypoxia, tachypnea to 50s, with concern
   for imminent fatigue.
   Given (-) culture date to date, likely etiology of resp failure is most
   likely distributive shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.
   Restrictive physiology likely contributed, in setting of obesity and
   abdominal distention.   Progression to ARDS given severity of
   necrotizing pancreatitis.
   - maintain on AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc, goal
   Pa02>60, plateua pressure 31, permissive hypercapnea.  Esophageal
   balloon suggested under-PEEPing, PEEP now at 21
   - cont ARDSnet, Pressure Control settings
   - pt has axillary line in place
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz
   - will d/c paralysis, monitor for increasing PIP/plateau pressures
   given poor lung compliance, adjust minute ventilation accordingly
   .
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis:  Currently stable LFTs and bili. Persistent
   abdominal pain was likely [**3-1**] worsening of pancreatitis as seen on CT,
   with resultant distributive physiology in setting of inflammation.
   Suggestion of hemorrhage into pseudocyst given drainage.  Patient also
   has significant leukocytosis and reactive thrombocytosis. Most likely
   due to severe necrotizing pancreatitis, C. diff (-), no evidence of C.
   diff colitis on sigmoidoscopy.  Pt now s/p bedside abdominal drain
   placement.
   - cont aggressive IVF for goal UOP>50-100 cc/hr, MAP>65
   - trend lactate
   - appreciate surgery recs -> ? duration of drain placement given
   infectious risk
   - OGT to suction
   - trend LFTs
   - cont insulin gtt
   - monitor ionized Ca and replete prn
   - empiric Zosyn 4.5 gIV q8h, cont vanc, fluconazole -> vanc trough 14.5
   - trend WBC, diff -> bandemia improving
   - blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (-)
   .
   # Hypotension: currently on levophed, likely [**3-1**] sepsis, exacerbated
   slightly by narcotics and sedation.
   - IVF as above, wean levophed as tolerated for MAP>65
   - phenylephrine as second [**Doctor Last Name **] if needed; avoid dopa given tachycardia
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) **]
 likely prerenal given septic shock, hypotension.  Could have
   component of ATN
   - check urine lytes
   - cont to titrate fluid resuscitation to UOP
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely due to vitamin K deficiency from poor nutrition
   and recent antibiotics.  No evidence of DIC.
   - monitor coags, including fibrinogen
   - vitamin K 10 mg IV x 1
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - IVF, trend Na

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which was initially thought to be due to a pulmonary embolism (PE) but was later determined to be caused by distributive shock secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis and obesity-related restrictive physiology. The patient has been intubated and is being managed with ARDSnet settings, including low tidal volume ventilation and permissive hypercapnia. Other complications include necrotizing pancreatitis, septic shock, hypotension, acute kidney injury (AKI), coagulopathy, and hyponatremia. The patient is currently receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and targeted therapies for each complication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and the risk factors associated with ARDS, there is a potential for developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's necrotizing pancreatitis and presence of infectious complications increase the risk of developing sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's hypotension and potential hypovolemic hyponatremia may contribute to AKI.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's vitamin K deficiency and recent antibiotic use may further exacerbate his coagulopathy.
5. Deep vein thrombosis ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The likely etiology of respiratory failure is distributive shock due to necrotizing pancreatitis, with restrictive physiology contributing to low lung volumes and abdominal distention. The patient's current settings include assisted ventilation with ARDSnet settings, maintaining a tidal volume of 6cc/kg, goal PaO2 >60, plateau pressure of 31, and permissive hypercapnea. PEEP is being titrated based on esophageal balloon measurements and the patient is expected to be weaned off paralytics. The patient's axillary line is in place, and consideration will be given to discontinuing it in a few days if blood pressure remains stable. Sedation with fentanyl and midazolam will continue.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for hypoxia, with concern for imminent fatigue. The likely etiology is distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. Restrictive physiology likely contributed, in the setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal distention.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst. The patient presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The likely etiology of the respiratory failure is distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure of 100/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is sedated and paralyzed.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, necrotizing pancreatitis, septic shock, hypotension, pre-renal acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

The patient is currently receiving aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support with levophed, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The plan is to wean off the ventilator gradually and continue to monitor the patient's condition closely.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of the patient's respiratory status, worsening of kidney injury, development of new infections, and progression of the necrotizing pancreatitis."

   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt intubated for hypoxia, tachypnea to
   50s, with concern for imminent fatigue.
   Given (-) culture date to date, likely etiology of resp failure is
   distributive shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive
   physiology likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and
   abdominal distention.
   - maintain on AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc, goal
   Pa02>60, plateua pressure 31, permissive hypercapnea.  Was able to
   tolerate being off paralytics and weaning down PEEP. PIP remained
   elevated, with normal plateau pressures suggesting resistance problem.
   - maintain current settings, esophageal balloon in place showing
   adequate PEEP
   - pt has axillary line in place, will consider D/C in few days if BP
   stable
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst, who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. He was intubated for hypoxia, tachypnea, and concern for imminent fatigue. The likely etiology of respiratory failure is distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis, along with restrictive physiology due to low lung volumes and abdominal distention. The patient is currently on assisted ventilation with ARDSnet settings, and is tolerating being off paralytics with weaning down PEEP. PIP remains elevated, suggesting a resistance problem. An esophageal balloon is in place, showing adequate PEEP. The patient has an axillary line in place and will be considered for discharge in a few days if blood pressure remains stable.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis with a pseudocyst, which is causing systemic inflammation and distributive shock.
3. Septic shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to necrotizing pancreatitis, resulting in hypotension and urine electrolyte abnormalities.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient may have acute kidney injury, as indicated by oliguria (low urine output) and elevated creatinine levels.
5. Coagulopathy: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The likely etiology of respiratory failure is distributive shock due to necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient has been sedated with fentanyl and midazolam. He is being ventilated with ARDSnet settings, including a tidal volume of 6cc/kg, goal PaO2 >60, plateau pressure of 31, and permissive hypercapnea. The patient has an esophageal balloon in place, showing adequate PEEP. His axillary line is in place, and he will be considered for decannulation in a few days if his blood pressure remains stable. 

The patient also has necrotizing pancreatitis with a hemorrhage into the pseudocyst. A drain has been placed, and there are no signs of infection. However, the patient continues to spike fevers and has leukocytosis. His hemoglobin concentration is low, and he requires aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal therapy. His white blood cell count is improving. 

The patient is also experiencing hypotension and is off vasopressor support. His blood pressures are excellent, and he may not require an arterial line. 

There are concerns about renal dysfunction"

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt intubated for hypoxia, tachypnea to
   50s, with concern for imminent fatigue.
   Given (-) culture date to date, likely etiology of resp failure is
   distributive shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive
   physiology likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and
   abdominal distention.
   - maintain on AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc, goal
   Pa02>60, plateua pressure 31, permissive hypercapnea.  Was able to
   tolerate being off paralytics and weaning down PEEP. PIP remained
   elevated, with normal plateau pressures suggesting resistance problem.
   - maintain current settings, esophageal balloon in place showing
   adequate PEEP
   - trial weaning PEEP to 16
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz
   .
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis:  Pt initially decompensated [**3-1**] hemorrhage
   into pseudocyst . Drain in place. No e/o infection, has distributive
   shock picture with systemic inflammation. Continues to spike.
   Leukocytosis continues to improve. LFTS improving today.
   - q12 hour labs
   - Hct goal >21
   - cont IVF for goal UOP>50-100 cc/hr, MAP>65
   - appreciate surgery recs -> rec keeping drain for several weeks to
   allow better healing of pseudocyst and prevent future surgery
   - trend LFTs
   - cont insulin gtt
   - monitor Ca and replete prn
   - empiric Zosyn 4.5 gIV q8h, cont vanc, fluconazole
   - trend WBC, diff -> down today
   - blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (-)

   # Fevers: Pt continues to have daily fevers despite greatly improved
   hemodynamics and no culture data evident of infection. [**Month (only) 8**] be due to
   systemic inflammatory response to pancreatitis.
   - monitor fever curve

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has acute hypoxic respiratory failure and is intubated. The likely etiology of the respiratory failure is distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient's lung volumes are very low, and there is abdominal distention, which suggests a restrictive physiology contributing to the respiratory failure.

2. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient initially decompensated with hemorrhage into a pseudocyst. A drain has been placed, but there is concern for infection. The patient has systemic inflammation and continues to spike fevers. Leukocytosis is improving, and liver function tests (LFTs) are also improving.

3. Fevers: The patient continues to have daily fevers despite improved hemodynamics and no culture data evident of infection. These fevers may be due to a systemic inflammatory response to pancreatitis.

4. Hypotension: The patient is currently off levophed and not requiring intravenous fluid (IVF) boluses to maintain pressure. The IVF regimen should be continued, and the patient should be kept off levophed as tolerated for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 60s.

5. Renal failure: The patient likely has prerenal azotemia given septic shock, hypotension, and urine electrolytes consistent with this etiology. There"

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt intubated for hypoxia, tachypnea to
   50s, with concern for imminent fatigue.
   Given (-) culture date to date, likely etiology of resp failure is
   distributive shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive
   physiology likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and
   abdominal distention.
   - maintain on AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc, goal
   Pa02>60, plateua pressure 31, permissive hypercapnea.  Was able to
   tolerate being off paralytics and weaning down PEEP. PIP remained
   elevated, with normal plateau pressures suggesting resistance problem.
   - maintain current settings, esophageal balloon in place showing
   adequate PEEP
   - pt has axillary line in place, will consider D/C in few days if BP
   stable
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz
   .
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis:  Pt initially decompensated [**3-1**] hemorrhage
   into pseudocyst . Drain in place. No e/o infection, has distributive
   shock picture with systemic inflammation. Continues to spike.
   Leukocytosis continues to improve.
   - q12 hour labs
   - Hct goal >21
   - cont IVF for goal UOP>50-100 cc/hr, MAP>65
   - appreciate surgery recs -> rec keeping drain for several weeks to
   allow better healing of pseudocyst and prevent future surgery
   - OGT to suction
   - trend LFTs
   - cont insulin gtt
   - monitor ionized Ca and replete prn
   - empiric Zosyn 4.5 gIV q8h, cont vanc, fluconazole
   - trend WBC, diff -> down today
   - blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (-)
   .
   # Hypotension: currently off levophed and not requiring IVF boluses to
   maintain pressure
   - IVF as above, continue to keep off levophed as tolerated for MAP in
   the 60s
   - Pressures excellent, consider need for A-line
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) **]
 likely prerenal given septic shock, hypotension and urine lytes
   c/w this etiology. Could have component of ATN since continuing to
   worsen despite resusitation.  Nearly resolved today
   - cont to titrate fluid resuscitation to UOP
 (UOP ranging from 370 to
   120 per hour in last 12 hours!)
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely due to vitamin K deficiency from poor nutrition
   and recent antibiotics.  No evidence of DIC.
   - monitor coags, including fibrinogen
   -  INR of 1.9 today, would hold of on IV K, and consider oral once
   post-pyloric feeding tube is in place to reduce risk of anaphylactoid
   reaction.
   .
   #. Nutrition: Pt should be initiated of TPN and be considered for
   trophic feeds with post-pyloric feeding tube

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The likely etiology of respiratory failure is distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient's condition has been stabilized, and he is being maintained on assisted ventilation with ARDSnet settings.

The patient also has necrotizing pancreatitis, for which a drain has been placed in the pseudocyst. There are no signs of infection, but the patient continues to spike fevers and show systemic inflammation. Leukocytosis is improving, and the goal is to keep the drain in place for several weeks to allow better healing of the pseudocyst and prevent future surgery.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension, which is currently being managed with intravenous fluids and vasopressors. The blood pressure is stable, and the need for an arterial line is being considered.

There is evidence of acute kidney injury, likely prerenal due to septic shock, hypotension, and urine electrolyte abnormalities. Fluid resuscitation is being titrated to urine output.

The patient also has a coagulopathy, which is likely due to vitamin K deficiency from poor nutrition and recent antibiotic use. There is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and the INR is being monitored.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints include pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, and anemia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is diagnosed with ARDS, which is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. This condition can lead to difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis, which is inflammation of the pancreas. This condition can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and digestive issues.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, which means the lungs are not effectively exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. This can be a result of ARDS or other underlying respiratory conditions.

4. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which refers to low blood pressure. This can lead to inadequate blood flow to vital organs and may cause dizziness, fainting, or organ damage.

5. Anemia: The patient is diagnosed with anemia, a condition characterized by a decrease in red blood cell count or hemoglobin levels. Anemia can result in fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.

6. Pleural Effusion: The patient's chest X-ray shows haziness in the left hemithorax, suggesting a pleural effusion. This is an accumulation of fluid in the space between the lung and the chest wall.

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt intubated for hypoxia, tachypnea to
   50s, with concern for imminent fatigue.
   Given (-) culture date to date, likely etiology of resp failure is
   distributive shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive
   physiology likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and
   abdominal distention.
   - maintain on AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc, goal
   Pa02>60, plateua pressure 31, permissive hypercapnea.  Was able to
   tolerate being off paralytics and weaning down PEEP. PIP remained
   elevated, with normal plateau pressures suggesting resistance problem.
   - maintain current settings, esophageal balloon in place showing
   adequate PEEP
   - trial weaning PEEP to 16
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz
   .
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis:  Pt initially decompensated [**3-1**] hemorrhage
   into pseudocyst . Drain in place. No e/o infection, has distributive
   shock picture with systemic inflammation. Continues to spike.
   Leukocytosis continues to improve. LFTS improving today.
   - q12 hour labs
   - Hct goal >21
   - cont IVF for goal UOP>50-100 cc/hr, MAP>65
   - appreciate surgery recs -> rec keeping drain for several weeks to
   allow better healing of pseudocyst and prevent future surgery
   - trend LFTs
   - cont insulin gtt
   - monitor Ca and replete prn
   - empiric Zosyn 4.5 gIV q8h, cont vanc, fluconazole
   - trend WBC, diff -> down today
   - blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (-)
   .
   # Fevers: Pt continues to have daily fevers despite greatly improved
   hemodynamics and no culture data evident of infection. [**Month (only) 8**] be due to
   systemic inflammatory response to pancreatitis.
   - monitor fever curve
   - daily surveillance cultures
   - f/u sent blood and sputum cx
   .
   # Hypotension: currently off levophed and not requiring IVF boluses to
   maintain pressure
   - IVF as above, continue to keep off levophed as tolerated for MAP in
   the 60s
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) **]
 likely prerenal given septic shock, hypotension and urine lytes
   c/w this etiology. Could have component of ATN since continuing to
   worsen despite resusitation.  Nearly resolved today and autodiuresing
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely due to vitamin K deficiency from poor nutrition
   and recent antibiotics.  No evidence of DIC.
   - monitor coags, including fibrinogen
   -  consider PO vitamin K

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. The patient presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated due to hypoxia and tachypnea. The likely etiology of respiratory failure is distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis, along with restrictive physiology caused by very low lung volumes and abdominal distention.

The patient's current settings include assisted ventilation with ARDSnet settings (VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc, goal PaO2 >60, plateau pressure 31, permissive hypercapnea), and an esophageal balloon in place showing adequate PEEP. PIP remains elevated with normal plateau pressures suggesting a resistance problem.

The patient also has necrotizing pancreatitis, initially decompensated by hemorrhage into a pseudocyst. A drain has been placed, and there is no evidence of infection. The patient continues to spike with fever, leukocytosis, and improving liver function tests.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing management indicate the need for careful monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings to ensure adequate oxygenation.

2. Distributive shock: The patient's systemic inflammation and ongoing hypotension suggest ongoing distributive shock, which needs to be monitored and treated accordingly.

3. Renal dysfunction:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure and necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient's fever has spiked again, so a blood culture has been sent. The patient's PEEP was weaned to 16 cmH2O.

The patient has been on various infusions, including insulin, fentanyl, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications include fluconazole, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is intubated and sedated.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.8 C (101.9 F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/60 to 166/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, PEEP at 16 cmH2O, and FiO2 at 40%.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute pancreatitis, and acute respiratory failure. The patient also has a history of cholecystitis and calculous. The patient's blood glucose levels have been monitored, and they have been receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids.

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt intubated for hypoxia, tachypnea to
   50s, with concern for imminent fatigue.
   Given (-) culture date to date, likely etiology of resp failure is
   distributive shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive
   physiology likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and
   abdominal distention.
   - maintain on AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc, goal
   Pa02>60, plateua pressure 31, permissive hypercapnea.  Was able to
   tolerate being off paralytics and weaning down PEEP. PIP remained
   elevated, with normal plateau pressures suggesting resistance problem.
   [**Name (NI) **] of CPAP this morning, then will likely place back on PRVC.
   - esophageal balloon in place showing adequate PEEP
   - cont weaning settings as tolerated
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz, consider weaning midaz, converting
   fentanyl to methadone
   .
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis:  Pt initially decompensated [**3-1**] hemorrhage
   into pseudocyst . Drain in place. No e/o infection, has distributive
   shock picture with systemic inflammation. Continues to spike.
   Leukocytosis continues to improve. LFTS improving today.
   - q12 hour labs
   - Hct goal >21
   - cont IVF for goal UOP>50-100 cc/hr, MAP>65
   - appreciate surgery recs -> rec keeping drain for several weeks to
   allow better healing of pseudocyst and prevent future surgery
   - trend LFTs
   - cont insulin gtt
   - monitor Ca and replete prn
   - empiric Zosyn 4.5 gIV q8h, cont vanc, fluconazole
   - trend WBC, diff -> down today
   - blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (-)
   .
   # Fevers: Pt continues to have daily fevers despite greatly improved
   hemodynamics and no culture data evident of infection. [**Month (only) 8**] be due to
   systemic inflammatory response to pancreatitis.
   - monitor fever curve
   - daily surveillance cultures
   - f/u sent blood and sputum cx
   .
   # Hypotension: currently off levophed and not requiring IVF boluses to
   maintain pressure
   - IVF as above, continue to keep off levophed as tolerated for MAP in
   the 60s
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) **]
 likely prerenal given septic shock, hypotension and urine lytes
   c/w this etiology. Could have component of ATN since continuing to
   worsen despite resusitation.  Nearly resolved and autodiuresing
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely due to vitamin K deficiency from poor nutrition
   and recent antibiotics.  No evidence of DIC.
   - monitor coags, including fibrinogen
   -  consider IV vitamin K
   .
   #. Nutrition:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The underlying cause appears to be distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis, along with restrictive physiology due to low lung volumes and abdominal distention.

2. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient initially presented with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. There is a concern for infection in the pseudocyst, which is being monitored closely. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has a drain in place.

3. Fevers: The patient continues to have daily fevers despite improved hemodynamics and no evidence of infection on cultures. These fevers are likely due to the systemic inflammatory response to pancreatitis.

4. Hypotension: The patient was previously on vasopressor support but is now off levophed and maintaining a MAP in the 60s without the need for IVF boluses. This suggests improvement in the patient's hemodynamic status.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function appears to be compromised, indicated by the need for dose adjustment of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins. The AKI may be due to prerenal causes such as septic shock and hypotension, as well as a possible component of acute tubular nec"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute pancreatitis, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. They are receiving antibiotics and sedation. Fluid balance is positive, indicating fluid overload. The patient's WBC count is elevated, and there has been a drop in platelet count. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but there is concern for possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to calf swelling. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient's glycemic control is being managed with an insulin infusion. The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and acute respiratory failure put them at risk for worsening respiratory function, which could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pancreatitis complications: Acute pancreatitis can lead to complications such as necrosis, abscess formation, pseudocyst development, or systemic complications like sepsis.
3. DVT/PE: The patient's calf swelling raises concerns for a possible DVT, which, if not treated appropriately, could progress to a pulmonary embolism (PE), leading to further respiratory distress and potential fatality.
4. Infection: As the patient is critically ill and immunocompromised, they"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was initially intubated. The likely etiology of respiratory failure is distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient's lung volumes are very low due to abdominal distention. He is being maintained on assisted ventilation with ARDSnet settings, with a tidal volume of 450 cc, goal PaO2 >60, plateau pressure of 31, and permissive hypercapnea. He is tolerating being off paralytics and weaning down PEEP. The PIP remained elevated with normal plateau pressures, suggesting a resistance problem. He will be placed back on pressure-controlled ventilation mode.

The patient also has left lower leg swelling, which is currently inconclusive for deep vein thrombosis (LENI). There is a concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), especially since the patient's platelet count has dropped from 500 to 72 yesterday and is now 93. The patient is being monitored closely for HIT and will have further tests done.

The patient's condition is improving, with leukocytosis continuing to improve, and liver function tests (LFTS) showing improvement. The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum culture are all negative, so there is no evidence of infection. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue.
   Given (-) culture data to date, likely etiology of resp failure is
   distributive shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive
   physiology likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and
   abdominal distention.
   - maintain on AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc, goal
   Pa02>60, plateua pressure 31, permissive hypercapnea.  Was able to
   tolerate being off paralytics and weaning down PEEP. PIP remained
   elevated, with normal plateau pressures suggesting resistance problem.
   [**Name (NI) **] of CPAP this morning, then will likely place back on PRVC.
   - esophageal balloon in place showing adequate PEEP
   - cont weaning settings as tolerated
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz, consider weaning midaz, converting
   fentanyl to methadone
   .
   LLE Edema: Unfortunately Doppler was non-diagnostic [**3-1**] body habitus.
   - ? CT study today
   - f/u HIT ab study
   .
   Falling platelets:  patient
s plateletes were as high as 500 at one
   point, they were down to 72 yesterday, up to 93 today.  Suspect zosyn
   vs. HIT.  Concern for HIT increased if above is [**3-1**] thrombus.
   -trend
   -f/u HIT panel
   .
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis:  Pt initially decompensated [**3-1**] hemorrhage
   into pseudocyst . Drain in place. No e/o infection, has distributive
   shock picture with systemic inflammation. Continues to spike.
   Leukocytosis continues to improve. LFTS improving today.
   - QD labs
   - Hct goal >21
   - IVF unnecessary patient had been autodiuresing.
   - appreciate surgery recs -> rec keeping drain for several weeks to
   allow better healing of pseudocyst and prevent future surgery
   - trend LFTs
   - cont insulin gtt
   - monitor Ca and replete prn
   - empiric Zosyn 4.5 gIV q8h, cont vanc, fluconazole - ?
   - trend WBC, diff -> down today
   - blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx, C. diff (-)
   .
   # Fevers: Pt continues to have daily fevers despite greatly improved
   hemodynamics and no culture data evident of infection. [**Month (only) 8**] be due to
   systemic inflammatory response to pancreatitis.
   - monitor fever curve
   - daily surveillance cultures
   - f/u sent blood and sputum cx
   .
   # Hypotension: inactive
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) **]
 likely prerenal given septic shock, hypotension and urine lytes
   c/w this etiology. Could have component of ATN since continuing to
   worsen despite resusitation.  Nearly resolved and autodiuresing thought
   bumped a bit in the setting of lasix yesterday.
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely due to vitamin K deficiency from poor nutrition
   and recent antibiotics.  No evidence of DIC.
   - monitor coags, including fibrinogen
   -  avoid another dose of vitamin K as patient recently restarted feeds.

   Disposition:  [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The cause of respiratory failure is suspected to be distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient's restrictive physiology, low lung volumes, and abdominal distention contribute to the problem. The plan is to maintain the patient on assisted ventilation with ARDSnet settings, aiming for a PaO2 of >60 and permissive hypercapnea. The patient is being weaned off paralytics and PEEP, but the PIP remains elevated with normal plateau pressures, suggesting a resistance problem.

2. Falling Platelets: The patient's platelet count was initially high but has now dropped to 72, indicating thrombocytopenia. This could be due to Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) versus heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). There is concern for HIT, especially if there is evidence of thrombosis. Further investigation with a HIT panel and trend of platelets is recommended.

3. Necrotizing Pancreatitis: The patient initially had gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. The patient developed distributive shock and systemic inflammation. The plan includes continuing to monitor LFTs, maintaining a goal hematocrit of >21, and keeping the drain in"

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was initially intubated for hypoxia. The likely etiology of respiratory failure is distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient's restrictive physiology is likely due to low lung volumes and abdominal distention.

The plan is to maintain the patient on assisted control ventilation (AC) with ARDSnet settings, including a tidal volume of 6cc/kg, goal PaO2 of >60, plateau pressure of 31, and permissive hypercapnea. The patient tolerated being off paralytics and weaning down PEEP. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set at 14 cmH2O. The patient's esophageal balloon showed adequate PEEP, and settings will be continued as tolerated.

The patient has left lower leg edema, which was assessed using Doppler ultrasound. However, the Doppler was non-diagnostic due to the patient's body habitus. A computed tomography (CT) study is planned to further evaluate the edema. Additionally, the patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, and there is a concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis with a drain in place. There are no signs of infection, but the patient continues to spike fevers"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male who presented with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He initially required intubation for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which is believed to be caused by distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient's restrictive physiology may have contributed to his respiratory failure, given the very low lung volumes and abdominal distention.

Current management includes maintaining the patient on assisted ventilation with ARDSnet settings, with a target PaO2 of 60 and plateau pressure of 31. Permissive hypercapnia is allowed. The esophageal balloon is in place, showing adequate PEEP, and weaning settings are being continued as tolerated. Sedation with fentanyl and midazolam is being maintained, with consideration given to converting fentanyl to methadone.

The patient has a positive HIT antibody test and a confirmed DVT on CT venogram. Platelets are beginning to recover, and argatroban therapy is continued.

Daily fevers persist despite improved hemodynamics and lack of evidence of infection. These fevers may be due to a systemic inflammatory response to pancreatitis. A thoracentesis has been performed, and fluid from the pleural effusion has been sent for analysis. Additionally, a new pelvic fluid collection seen on CT may indicate occult infection, and discussion is ongoing regarding drainage options with surgery.

Necrotizing pancreatitis is ongoing, with a previous hemorrh"

   1. Focal nonocclusive thrombus in the inferior vena cava at the level
   of the
   confluence of the common iliac veins. Additionally, occlusive or
   near-occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein at the level of
   the
   greater saphenous vein, extending proximally for approximately 6 cm.
   Relatively increased size and subcutaneous edema of the left lower
   extremity
   compared to the right.
   2. Interval increase in left pleural effusion, now moderate. Increase
   in
   amount of dependent atelectasis bilaterally. However, superimposed
   consolidation cannot be excluded.
   3. Stable degree of nonenhancing pancreatic parenchyma consistent with
   necrotizing pancreatitis.
   4. Variable change in size of peripancreatic fluid collections.
   Collection
   surrounding the pancreatic body is smaller than the prior study, but a
   larger,
   well-circumscribed, rim-enhancing collection has developed more
   distally.
   Regions of hemorrhagic fluid within the collections is unchanged.
   5. Persistent marked narrowing of the superior mesenteric vein at the
   confluence with the splenic and portal veins. Good opacification of the
   arterial vessels surrounding the pancreas, without filling defect or
   pseudoaneurysm.
   6. Interval improvement in intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, now
   mild.
   7. Moderate ascites and anasarca.
   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue.
   Given (-) culture data to date, likely etiology of resp failure is
   distributive shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive
   physiology likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and
   abdominal distention.
   - maintain on AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc, goal
   Pa02>60, plateua pressure 31, permissive hypercapnea.
   - esophageal balloon in place showing adequate PEEP
   - cont weaning settings as tolerated
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz, consider weaning midaz, converting
   fentanyl to methadone
   .
   LLE Edema: DVT seen on CT venogram. HIT Ab positive so likely
   hypercoaguable due to HIT. Plts beginning to recover.
   - cont argatroban and monitor PTT
   - trend platelets
   - check serotonin assay at 3pm
   - consider IVC filter only if sugery determines there is sufficient
   contraindication to anitcoagulation
   .
   # Fevers: Pt continues to have daily fevers despite greatly improved
   hemodynamics and no culture data evident of infection. Most likely due
   to systemic inflammatory response to pancreatitis. Given pleural
   effusion and new pelvic fluid collection seen on CT, there may be
   occult infection.
   - consider thoracentesis if large enough effusion on bedside U/S, send
   fluid for chem, glucose, pH, GS, cx
   - discuss CT-guided drainage of pelvic fluid collection with surgery
   and send for gram stain/cx
   .
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis:  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst . Drain in place. No e/o infection, has
   distributive shock picture with systemic inflammation. Continues to
   spike. Leukocytosis continues to improve. LFTS improving. CT shows
   newly enlarged fluid collection in pelvis that is concerning since pt
   continues to spike daily fevers, and drain is not positioned in fluid
   collection.
   - QD labs
   - Hct stable for several days, transfuse for goal >21
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - will check amylase in drain output and D/C drain if low amylase
   - trend LFTs
   - cont insulin gtt
   - cont cipro/flagyl (D2), cont vancomycin, fluconazole (D8)
   - IR postpyloric feeding tube
   - OGT to suction
   .
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) **]
 likely prerenal given septic shock, hypotension and urine lytes
   c/w this etiology. Could have component of ATN since continuing to
   worsen despite resusitation.  Nearly resolved and autodiuresing thought
   bumped a bit in the setting of lasix.
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  INR increased when argatroban started, so this is most
   likely cause.
   .
   #. Nutrition:
   - holding trophic TF for high residuals
   - TPN, add insulin prn and continue insulin gtt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient is currently on assisted ventilation with ARDSnet settings. His lung volumes are very low due to abdominal distention, and he has moderate pleural effusion with dependent atelectasis bilaterally. There is a focal nonocclusive thrombus in the inferior vena cava and occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein. The patient has an increased size and subcutaneous edema of the left lower extremity compared to the right. There is also a well-circumscribed rim-enhancing fluid collection in the pelvis, which is concerning for possible infection. The patient's pancreatic parenchyma shows a stable degree of nonenhancing consistent with necrotizing pancreatitis. There is persistent marked narrowing of the superior mesenteric vein at the confluence with the splenic and portal veins, but arterial supply remains opacified without filling defects. The patient's intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation has improved, and he has moderate ascites and anasarca. The patient continues to have daily fevers, which are likely due to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) related to pancreatitis. There is concern for occult infection, and a thoracentesis or CT-guided drainage of the pelvic fluid collection may"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided information. However, the 24-hour events section mentions that blood cultures were taken from the left subclavian central line at 12:15 PM and 12:25 PM on [**2146-2-8**]. The patient also had a fever of 101.9°F at 8:00 PM on the same day.

The patient is currently receiving argatroban drip titrated to PTT 80, which indicates the use of this medication for anticoagulation. Serotonin assay has been sent, and all antibiotics have been discontinued except for vancomycin, which was started at 9:25 AM on [**2146-2-8**]. The patient's drain output still shows high amylase levels, and it is being left in place despite uncertainty about its correct placement. There is no mention of draining the pelvic collection.

The patient's allergies include morphine and hot sweating. The last doses of antibiotics were given on [**2146-2-6**] for piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and ciprofloxacin.

The patient is currently on several infusions, including argatroban at 0.25 mcg/kg/min, insulin at 3 units/hour, fentanyl (concentrate) at 500 mcg/hour, and midazolam (Versed) at 20 mg/hour. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) given at 7:29 AM on [**2146-2-8**], and fentanyl at 8:15 AM on the same day.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The vital signs indicate a maximum temperature of 38.8°C (101.9°F), current temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 146 bpm with a sinus tachycardia rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 148/87 mmHg to 173/156 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 137.2 kg, and the admission weight was 143 kg.

The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, and the bladder pressure is 9 mmHg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,952 mL and a total output of 4,040 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -88 mL. The patient has received a total of 1,952 mL of intravenous fluids, 911 mL of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), 333 mL of tube feedings, and 1,585 mL of blood products. The patient's urine output is 2,070 mL, and the NG output is 1,550 mL. St"

   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue.
   Given (-) culture data to date, likely etiology of resp failure is
   distributive shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive
   physiology likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and
   abdominal distention.
   - maintain on AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc, goal
   Pa02>60, plateua pressure 31, permissive hypercapnea.
   - esophageal balloon in place showing adequate PEEP
   - cont weaning settings as tolerated
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz, consider weaning midaz, converting
   fentanyl to methadone
   .
   LLE Edema: DVT seen on CT venogram. HIT Ab positive so likely
   hypercoaguable due to HIT. Plts beginning to recover.
   - cont argatroban and monitor PTT
   - trend platelets
   - check serotonin assay at 3pm
   - consider IVC filter only if sugery determines there is sufficient
   contraindication to anitcoagulation
   .
   # Fevers: Pt continues to have daily fevers despite greatly improved
   hemodynamics and no culture data evident of infection. Most likely due
   to systemic inflammatory response to pancreatitis. Given pleural
   effusion and new pelvic fluid collection seen on CT, there may be
   occult infection.
   - consider thoracentesis if large enough effusion on bedside U/S, send
   fluid for chem, glucose, pH, GS, cx
   - discuss CT-guided drainage of pelvic fluid collection with surgery
   and send for gram stain/cx
   .
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis:  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst . Drain in place. No e/o infection, has
   distributive shock picture with systemic inflammation. Continues to
   spike. Leukocytosis continues to improve. LFTS improving. CT shows
   newly enlarged fluid collection in pelvis that is concerning since pt
   continues to spike daily fevers, and drain is not positioned in fluid
   collection.
   - QD labs
   - Hct stable for several days, transfuse for goal >21

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient has a history of cholecystitis and presents with multiple medical complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and possible infection. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he requires mechanical ventilation to support his breathing. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may be necessary to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances and remove waste products.
3. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient has developed HIT, which is characterized by a decrease in platelet count due to an immune reaction to heparin. Argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has been initiated to prevent further clot formation. Monitoring of platelet count and coagulation parameters is important.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a"

   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue.
   Given (-) culture data to date, likely etiology of resp failure is
   distributive shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive
   physiology likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and
   abdominal distention.
   - maintain on AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc, goal
   Pa02>60, plateua pressure 31, permissive hypercapnea.
   - esophageal balloon in place showing adequate PEEP
   - cont weaning settings as tolerated
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz, consider weaning midaz, converting
   fentanyl to methadone
   .
   LLE Edema: DVT seen on CT venogram. HIT Ab positive so likely
   hypercoaguable due to HIT. Plts beginning to recover.
   - cont argatroban and monitor PTT
   - trend platelets
   - check serotonin assay at 3pm
   - consider IVC filter only if sugery determines there is sufficient
   contraindication to anitcoagulation
   .
   # Fevers: Pt continues to have daily fevers despite greatly improved
   hemodynamics and no culture data evident of infection. Most likely due
   to systemic inflammatory response to pancreatitis. Given pleural
   effusion and new pelvic fluid collection seen on CT, there may be
   occult infection.
   - consider thoracentesis if large enough effusion on bedside U/S, send
   fluid for chem, glucose, pH, GS, cx
   - discuss CT-guided drainage of pelvic fluid collection with surgery
   and send for gram stain/cx
   .
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis:

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. He was initially intubated for hypoxia and tachypnea, and later developed distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, pleural effusion, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He also has a positive HIT Ab and is receiving argatroban therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient is already diagnosed with ARDS, which is a severe form of lung injury that can lead to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's daily fevers and new pelvic fluid collection on CT raise concern for occult infection, which could lead to sepsis.
3. DVT: The patient has evidence of DVT on CT venogram, and his HIT Ab positivity increases the risk of thromboembolic events.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be due to pre-renal causes, septic shock, or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
5. Pleural effusion: The patient has an interval increase in left pleural effusion, which can lead to compromised lung function and further respiratory distress.
6. Pseudocyst complications: The patient has a persistent fluid collection surrounding the pancreatic body"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis who initially presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of necrotizing pancreatitis with a pseudocyst, which has been drained. The patient's current condition includes fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated amylase levels, and evidence of renal dysfunction. Imaging studies reveal a focal nonocclusive thrombus in the inferior vena cava, occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein, and persistent pancreatic inflammation. The patient's clinical picture is consistent with distributive shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures indicate a possible infection. The source of infection could be ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), abdominal infection, or line-associated infection. Antibiotics have been restarted, and cultures are pending.
2. Thromboembolic events: The presence of thrombi in the IVC and left common femoral vein suggests a risk for further thromboembolic events. The patient is receiving argatroban for anticoagulation.
3. Renal failure: The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, which may be due to prerenal causes secondary to septic shock and hypotension. Renal dos"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with necrotizing pancreatitis and a pseudocyst formation. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure, which is likely pre-renal in origin. The patient has developed thrombocytopenia with thrombosis, specifically a nonocclusive thrombus in the inferior vena cava and an occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein. He has been started on argatroban, an anticoagulant. The patient's fever and tachycardia may be due to infection or necrotizing pancreatitis. Blood, abdominal fluid, and sputum cultures have been sent. The patient's condition has improved, but he remains in the ICU for further monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for various infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), abdominal infection, and bloodstream infection due to the presence of multiple lines and tubes.
2. Pancreatitis Complications: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis, which can lead to further complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, or pseudocyst rupture.
3. Thromboembolic Events: The patient has developed thrombocytopenia with thrombosis,"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient has an increased bladder pressure and peak pressure, which may indicate abdominal compartment syndrome. This condition is a serious complication of pancreatitis and can lead to organ dysfunction.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis suggest a systemic inflammatory response, which could be indicative of sepsis. With the presence of necrotizing pancreatitis, there is a high risk of infection.

3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet settings. This indicates the possibility of ARDS, which is a known complication of severe pancreatitis.

4. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxia and tachypnea, suggesting respiratory failure. This could be due to the initial distributive shock caused by necrotizing pancreatitis.

5. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, which may be related to renal dysfunction or the use of certain medications.

6. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) with thrombosis: The patient's platelet count is trending up after discontinuing heparin and starting argatroban. There is a known significant clot burden in the common femoral and inferior vena cava (IVC)."

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst . Drain in place. No identified source of
   infection, has distributive shock picture with systemic inflammation.
   Continues to spike. Leukocytosis now trending up again. LFTS stable and
   normal. CT shows persistently enlarged fluid collection in pelvis on
   repeat abdomen, with amylase > [**Numeric Identifier 1804**] from drain.  Per Surgery, will
   continue to leave drain in place.  Suspect episode of tachypnea,
   tachycardia, and fever earlier this morning may be [**3-1**] pain from
   necrotizing pancreatitis +/- superimposed infection.   Bladder pressure
   has increased this morning,
   - Concern for abdominal compartment syndrome with LOS + 30L, dwindeling
   urine output, elevated bladder pressure (21), and peak pressure 30-35
   (unable to get plateau).
       - ask surgery re: surgical decompression
       - consult renal re: cvvh
   - QID Electrolytes
   - trend Hct, transfuse for goal >21
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - trend LFTs
   - cont insulin gtt
   - culture fluid, restart vanc, zosyn, flagyl for broad coverage (VAP)
   - IR postpyloric feeding tube -> will defer till tomorrow
   - OGT to suction
   .
   Systemic inflamatory response
   ?peri sepsis with decreased urine output, antibiotics have been
   upgraded to vanc and [**Last Name (un) **].
   - low threshold for pressors
   - bolus liberally
   .
   Hyperkalemia/[**Last Name (un) **]
 Concern for abdominal compartment leading to
   decreased perfusion, cre climbing, UOP dwindling, could also be
   hypoperfusion.  Patient is non-response to lasix.
   - consult renal re: CVVH
   - MAPs greater than 65
   .
 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.
   - maintain on PSVC/AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc,
   goal Pa02>60, plateua pressure 28, permissive hypercapnea, PEEP 14,
   FiO2 60%
   - will remove esophageal balloon
   - cont sedation with fent and [**Doctor Last Name 5451**], consider weaning [**Last Name (LF) 5451**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**]
   continue to convert fentanyl to methadone
   - concern for VAP given acute decompensation this morning off
   antibiotics, will send sputum for culture, start vanc/zosyn/flagyl
   - defer thoracentesis, low suspicion for empyema
   > FEVER/TACHYCARDIA- Infection vs. necrotizing pancreatitis vs. pain,
   or concomittant.  Possible etiologies of infection include VAP,
   abdomen, lines (bacteremia).  PE also a possibility, no hemodynamic
   compromise, unlikely to have such high fever with PE.
   - blood, abdominal fluid, sputum culture
   - treat fever with blanket
   - restart Abx as above
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS- Plt count trending
   up off heparin.  Left subclavian triple lumen cath is heparinized.  On
   argatroban.  Known significant clot burden in common femoral and IVC.
   No indication for IVC filter, as thrombus
   -  will cont argatroban, defer warfarin in short-term
   - cont to trend plts
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Resolved, likely [**3-1**] significant
   inflammation and distributive physiology.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE- Will monitor, empyema a less likely
   possibility of infection.  Will consider [**Female First Name (un) **] if current infectious
   work up is unrevealing.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely prerenal
   given septic shock, hypotension and urine lytes c/w this etiology.
   Could have component of ATN since continuing to worsen despite
   resusitation.  Nearly resolved and autodiuresing thought bumped a bit
   in the setting of lasix.
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
 .H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS- Resolved.

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal. CT shows enlarged fluid
   collection in pelvis on repeat abdomen.  Per Surgery, will continue to
   leave drain in place (draining amylase but not in fluid collection).
   - Concern for abdominal compartment syndrome with LOS + 30L, dwindling
   urine output, elevated bladder pressure (21), and peak pressure 30-35
   (unable to get plateau).
       - ask surgery re: surgical decompression vs CT-guided fluid

 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.
   - maintain on PSVC/AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc,
   goal Pa02>60, plateua pressure 28, permissive hypercapnea, PEEP 16,

   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal. CT shows enlarged fluid
   collection in pelvis on repeat abdomen.  Per Surgery, will continue to
   leave drain in place (draining amylase but not in fluid collection).
   - since we have alternate explanation for decompensation, surgery
   unlikely to place new drain in fluid collection, will hold off repeat
   imaging
   - QID Electrolytes
   - trend LFTs
   - cont insulin gtt
   - on  vanc for GMC, meropenem empirically (consider D/C when blood cx
   speciation known)
   - D/C Flagyl since C. dif less likely
   - IR postpyloric feeding tube -> will defer till break in CVVH

   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.

 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS- Plt count trending
   up off heparin.  On argatroban.  Known significant clot burden in
   common femoral and IVC.  No indication for IVC filter since pt has
   alternate explanation for fevers and tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at
   goal with only 0.125 argatroban.
   - curbside heme for argatroban dosing protocol

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which was initially thought to be due to hemorrhage into the pseudocyst or distributive shock with systemic inflammation. Laboratory findings show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. The patient has been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to acute renal failure, likely caused by contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). He also has hypoemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for which he is being ventilated with a low tidal volume strategy. The patient has anemia, with a drop in hemoglobin concentration, possibly due to blood loss during CVVH. He has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis and is currently on argatroban. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and he has a resolved pleural effusion. He is being managed with CVVH to address fluid overload and is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with insulin supplementation."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I have examined Mr [**Known lastname 10695**] and have reviewed his history and laboratory
   studies and imaging and was present for the key portions of the
   services provided today.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 659**]
s note and agree
   with her findings and plan of care.  This young man remains stably but
   critically ill, with necrotizing pancreatitis, resp failure, renal
   failure, and  HIT with ileofemoral clot.  We appreciate the input of
   medical and surgical consultants.  The patient
s resp failure now is as
   much due to  fluid overload as anything, and we will attempt to
   gradually keep him 1-2 L neg per day. We will try to utilize lasix for
   this as his kidneys allow, and meanwhile wean his Fentanyl, while
   keeping his pain under control with methadone.  Nutritiion is still via
   TPN.  He remains on argatroban for HIT. As he
s not showing any signs
   of worse sepsis, we will hold off on any IR attempts to drain any
   additional abdominal collections.
   45 min spent in the care of this critically ill patient.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient initially decompensated, possibly due to hemorrhage into a pseudocyst or distributive shock with systemic inflammation. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin concentration, increased creatinine level, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient is currently on various medications including antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Metronidazole, Vancomycin, Meropenem), sedatives (Midazolam, Fentanyl), insulin, Lasix, and argatroban. The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, but there are some concerning findings such as hypoxemia and a decreased platelet count.

The patient has several medical complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (likely caused by contrast-induced nephropathy), hypoxemic respiratory failure, anemia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis, and hypotension.

The potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis, further respiratory deterioration, worsening renal function, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, and potential thromboembolic events due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

In summary, the patient is critically ill with necrotizing pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and he"

   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, necrosis, and pseudocyst formation. The patient's condition has decompensated, possibly due to hemorrhage into the pseudocyst or distributive shock. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CoNS Bacteremia: The patient has a growth of CoNS (Candida Nosocomialis) from an anaerobic bottle, which may not have explained the patient's decompensation. However, the line had been placed emergently by surgery, so it may have been an infectious source.
2. Renal Failure, Acute: The patient likely has acute renal failure (ARF), possibly due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). He has been started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with improvement in electrolytes and creatinine levels.
3. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient initially intubated for hypoxia, tachypnea, and concern for imminent fatigue. Given the negative culture data to date, the likely etiology of initial respiratory failure is distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. Restrictive physiology likely contributed, in the setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was initially intubated. The patient's condition has decompensated multiple times, and he is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to acute renal failure, likely caused by contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/65 to 145/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 100% FiO2. He is sedated and unresponsive to voice but opens his eyes. Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen, 2+ edema on the right leg, and 3+ edema on the left leg.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (29.6 K/uL), low hemoglobin (8.0 g/dL), elevated blood glucose (123 mg/dL), and decreased platelet count (345 K/uL). Renal function tests indicate elevated creatinine (1.7 mg/dL) and BUN (54 mg/dL). Liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Metronidazole, Vancomycin, Meropenem), anticoagulants (Argatroban), insulin, fentanyl, and midazolam. He also receives potassium chloride, calcium gluconate, and other electrolytes through continuous renal replacement therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has been on various antibiotics due to suspected bacteremia and potential infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as necessary is important.
2. Renal failure: The patient is currently on CVVH for acute renal failure. Monitoring renal function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly is crucial.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis. Monitoring platelet count and continuing argatroban therapy is important.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient has ongoing respiratory support with mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of oxygenation parameters and adjusting ventilator settings as needed is essential.
5. Fluid overload: The patient has been receiving CVVH to address fluid overload. Monitoring fluid balance and adjusting diuretic therapy (Lasix) is necessary.
6. Anemia: The patient has experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin levels. Regular monitoring of hematocrit and transfusion as needed is important.
7. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a known clot burden in the common femoral and inferior vena cava. Monitoring for any signs of thrombo"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Mr [**Known lastname 10695**] and was present for the key portions of
   the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10932**]
s note above and
   agree with his findings and plan of care.
   [**Known firstname 884**] has done well in the past couple of days with hemodynamic
   stability, no evidence (on abx) of worse sepsis, and improving fluid
   status with the help of CVVH which  was able to make his I/O 4.5 L
   negative for yesterday.  His FiO2 is being decreased and his pleural
   effusions look a bit less on CXR.  He is still very sedated on
   methadone and fentanyl and the latter will continue to be decreased 20%
   daily.
   The issue of  antibiotic duration has been raised and I
ve spoken with
   Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 11063**], ID attending, who is understandably concerned about fungal
   superinfection in this young man who has been on abx for much of 3
   wks.  Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 11063**] agrees to continue current abx for [**3-2**] more days at
   which time ID, ICU, and surgery teams should confer to plan what to do
   if and when pt spikes fever when abx stopped (IR drainage of a
   pocket?).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which was initially thought to be due to hemorrhage into the pseudocyst or distributive shock. The patient's left-sided pleural effusion has resolved, and his right-sided pleural effusion is improving. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with PSVC/AC mode, using ARDSnet settings.

The patient has acute renal failure, likely caused by contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). He is being treated with continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and is tolerating fluid removal well. His blood pressure has been stable, and his heart rate has improved.

There is no evidence of active bleeding, but the patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has dropped significantly over the past 24 hours. This may be due to blood loss during CVVH and equilibrium changes with fluid shifts. The patient's platelet count is also low, likely due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) with thrombosis. He is currently on argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, and his PTT is at goal.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and his FiO2 is being decreased gradually. He is still sedated on methadone and fentanyl, which will continue to"

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal. Repeat CT shows increased ascites
   and stable sized fluid collection in pelvis, no source of bleeding.
   Per Surgery, will continue to leave drain in place (draining amylase
   but not in fluid collection). Drain fluid sent for cx, gram stain neg.
   Unlikely to have developed infection in abdomen at this point.
   - appreciate surgery recs, unlikely to drain fluid collection unless
   clinical indication of infection
   - QID Electrolytes
   - trend LFTs
   - cont insulin gtt
   - on  vanc for CoNS, meropenem empirically, would continue at least 10
   days given decompensation when D/Ced in past
   - IR postpyloric feeding Monday/Tuesday
   - OGT to suction
   .
   #. CoNS BACTEREMIA: Anaerobic bottle from [**2146-2-9**] growing CoNS, less
   convincing that this explaned patient
s decompensation that day. Line
   had been placed emergently by surgery, so it may have been an
   infectious source.
   - lines changed
   - cont vancomycin 1g q24 while on CVVH
   - check daily trough given changing renal function
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Patient currently more
   tachycardic, suggesting diuresis too aggressive or just too rapid.
   Currently 25L (down from 32) positive LOS, but largely this is not
   intravascular.
   - goal 2-4L negative today
   - Lasix prn to assist in fluid removal in addition to CVVH
   - appreciate renal recs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.
   - maintain on PSVC/AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc,
   goal Pa02>60, plateua pressure 28, permissive hypercapnea, PEEP 16,
   FiO2 60%
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz, wean fentanyl daily and continue
   methadone
   .
   > ANEMIA: Hct drop 10 pts over 24 hours without obvious source. Pt had
   non-bloody BM, no hematuria. CT did not show source of bleeding, no RP
   bleed. [**Month (only) 8**] be due to blood loss and hemolysis in tubing for CVVH and
   equilibrium changes with fluid shifts.  HCT stable throughout the day
   yesterday
   - guiaic OGT output
   - q6h Hct checks
   - transfusion goal >21
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS- Plt count trending
   up off heparin.  On argatroban.  Known significant clot burden in
   common femoral and IVC.  No indication for IVC filter since pt has
   alternate explanation for fevers and tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at
   goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Resolved, likely [**3-1**] significant
   inflammation and distributive physiology.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE- Will monitor, empyema a less likely
   possibility of infection.
   -CVVH to address fluid overload
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was initially intubated. The patient has multiple medical complications including:

1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's initial respiratory failure was likely due to distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. There is also a restrictive physiology contributing to low lung volumes and abdominal distention.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient likely experienced contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). He has been started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with improvement in electrolytes and creatinine levels. However, the patient remains tachycardic, suggesting diuresis may be too aggressive or too rapid.

3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for hypoxia, tachypnea, and concern for imminent fatigue. The etiology of initial respiratory failure is believed to be distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.

4. CoNS bacteremia: An anaerobic bottle from February 9th grew CoNS, but it is less convincing that this explained the patient's decompensation that day. The line had been placed emergently by surgery, so it may have been an infectious source. The patient's lines were changed, and vancomycin was"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned, but the note highlights several significant events and findings.

The patient's condition appears to be deteriorating, as indicated by the increasing firmness and tenderness in the epigastric region. This could be a sign of an underlying abdominal pathology or abscess, which has prompted the suggestion of a non-urgent CT scan by surgery.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (105 bpm) and normal blood pressure (142/78 mmHg). Respiratory rate is within normal limits (23 insp/min), and oxygen saturation is maintained at 98% with the use of an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation.

The patient is on various medications, including antibiotics (meropenem, metronidazole, and vancomycin), anticoagulant (argatroban), insulin, calcium gluconate (CRRT), midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and methadone.

The lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Kidney function appears to be compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine and BUN levels. Liver enzymes are slightly elevated, and electrolyte imbalances are present, including hypokalemia and"

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  Patient acutely worsened
   overnight with increased abdominal pain, distension and tenderness.  In
   addition his white count continues to rise and he continues to spike
   fevers.   Further he was fighting the vent and tachycardic overnight,
   all of which likely represent worsening abdominal pathology.  KUB was
   unfotunately unhelpful given habitus.  Suspicion for compartment
   syndrome is low  given unchanged PIPs and low bladder pressures.
   Suspicion for infected fluid collection is high, and patient continues
   to bump his white count and spike intermittently but is never culture
   positive.
   - Repeat abdominal CT today.
   - Discuss drainage with surgery.
   - Continue meropenem empirically, would continue at least 10 days given
   decompensation when D/Ced in past
   - QID Electrolytes

   - appreciate ID concerns however patient has clinically decompensated
   x2 when pseudomnoal coverage was decreased to anything less than
   zosyn.  At this point would continue meropenem until we can
   definitively r/o infected collection, which may have to be surgical.
   - Hold of on IR guided post-pyloric while we are still having high
   output from OGT.
   - OGT to suction

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was initially intubated for hypoxia. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical complications, including acute renal failure (likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy), hypoxemic respiratory failure, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis. He is currently receiving multiple medications and interventions in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infected fluid collection: The patient's rising white blood cell count and intermittent fever spikes suggest a possible infected fluid collection, such as an abscess or infected pseudocyst. A repeat abdominal CT scan has been ordered to further evaluate this possibility.

2. CoNS bacteremia: Although the source is uncertain, there is evidence of CoNS bacteremia from an anaerobic bottle culture. This may not be responsible for the patient's decompensation but should be treated appropriately.

3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's initial respiratory failure and subsequent need for mechanical ventilation suggest the possibility of ARDS. The patient's lungs are being managed with ARDSnet settings, including low tidal volumes and permissive hypercapnea.

4. Renal failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration"

   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  Patient acutely worsened
   overnight with increased abdominal pain, distension and tenderness.  In
   addition his white count continues to rise and he continues to spike
   fevers.   Further he was fighting the vent and tachycardic overnight,
   all of which likely represent worsening abdominal pathology.  KUB was
   unfotunately unhelpful given habitus.  Suspicion for compartment
   syndrome is low  given unchanged PIPs and low bladder pressures.
   Suspicion for infected fluid collection is high, and patient continues
   to bump his white count and spike intermittently but is never culture
   positive.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined [**Known firstname 884**] and also reviewed the 24hr events and
   lab/imaging data. I was present for the key portion of the services
   provided and have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10932**]
s note above. I agree with his
   findings and plan of care.
   The major event overnight has been epigastric protuberance and pain in
   the setting of fever and leukocytosis, all concerning for an
   intrabdominal (?retroperitoneal?) process.  CT scan done and results
   pending. We will collaborate with our surgical, radiological, and ID
   colleagues to decide if there is anything in the pt
s belly that needs
   drainage or a change in abx at this time.
   Meanwhile the patient has been otherwise quite stable, being able to
   hemodynamically  tolerate having over 10L removed via CVVH yesterday.
   Resp status unchanged, but with ETT now for over 2wks I think he will
   need a trache, as has been previously anticipated.  For now pain med
   reduction on hold in light of pt
s pain last night.  HIT ileofemoral
   thrombosis stable as best as we can tell, and pt has adequate
   anticoagulation on argatroban.

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient's condition has worsened overnight with increased abdominal pain, distension, and tenderness. His white blood cell count continues to rise, and he spikes fevers. The suspicion for abdominal compartment syndrome is low due to unchanged plateau pressures and low bladder pressures. There is a high suspicion for an infected fluid collection, and the patient continues to bump his white count and spike intermittently but remains culture-negative.

Assessment and plan:
1. Acute pancreatitis: The patient may have initially decompensated either due to hemorrhage into the pseudocyst or distributive shock with systemic inflammation. Left-sided flank pain may indicate a possible left-sided pleural effusion or pleuritis.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient was initially intubated for hypoxia, tachypnea, and concern for imminent fatigue. The likely etiology of initial respiratory failure is distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. Restrictive physiology likely contributed due to very low lung volumes and abdominal distention.
3. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): Likely caused by contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) with improvement in electrolytes and creat"

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  Patient acutely worsened
   overnight with increased abdominal pain, distension and tenderness.  In
   addition his white count continues to rise and he continues to spike
   fevers.   Further he was fighting the vent and tachycardic overnight,
   all of which likely represent worsening abdominal pathology.  KUB was
   unfotunately unhelpful given habitus.  Suspicion for compartment
   syndrome is low  given unchanged PIPs and low bladder pressures.
   Suspicion for infected fluid collection is high, and patient continues
   to bump his white count and spike intermittently but is never culture
   positive.
   - Repeat abdominal CT today.
   - Discuss drainage with surgery.
   - Continue meropenem empirically, would continue at least 10 days given
   decompensation when D/Ced in past
   - QID Electrolytes
   - cont insulin gtt
   - appreciate ID concerns however patient has clinically decompensated
   x2 when pseudomnoal coverage was decreased to anything less than
   zosyn.  At this point would continue meropenem until we can
   definitively r/o infected collection, which may have to be surgical.
   - Hold of on IR guided post-pyloric while we are still having high
   output from OGT.
   - OGT to suction
   .
   #. CoNS BACTEREMIA: Anaerobic bottle from [**2146-2-9**] growing CoNS, less
   convincing that this explaned patient
s decompensation that day. Line
   had been placed emergently by surgery, so it may have been an
   infectious source.
   - lines changed
   - cont vancomycin 1g q24 while on CVVH
   - check daily trough given changing renal function
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, heart rate is as low as it has been on this
   hospitalization and his SBP has held up very well. Unclear as to
   whether event yesterday was somehow related to fluid shifts so patient
   was kept even overnight.  As he has now clinically stabilized, we will
   restart diuresis.  Currently 19L (down from peak 32) positive LOS.
    - goal is more gentle today, max of
([**6-3**])
   - appreciate renal recs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.
   - maintain on PSVC/AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc,
   goal Pa02>50, plateua pressure 28, permissive hypercapnea, PEEP 16,
   FiO2 50%
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz.
   - Will attempt to wean fentanyl daily while titrating up methadone
   - As fluid balance becomes progressively more negative can consider
   dropping PEEP
   .
   > ANEMIA:HCT stabilized
   .
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS- Plt count trending
   up off heparin.  On argatroban.  Known significant clot burden in
   common femoral and IVC.  No indication for IVC filter since pt has
   alternate explanation for fevers and tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at
   goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Resolved, likely [**3-1**] significant
   inflammation and distributive physiology.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE- Will monitor, empyema a less likely
   possibility of infection.
   -CVVH to address fluid overload

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He has been admitted to the ICU for critical care management. The patient's clinical course has been complicated by several medical complications, including acute pancreatitis, possible hemorrhage into the pseudocyst, distributive shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure (likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy), hypoxemic respiratory failure, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis, and pleural effusion. The patient's current condition includes an elevated white blood cell count, fever, abdominal pain, and tenderness. Surgical consultation has been requested for further evaluation and management, including the possibility of drainage of an infected fluid collection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infected fluid collection: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, tenderness, and fever, along with the rising white blood cell count, suggest the possibility of an infected fluid collection. Surgical drainage may be necessary for appropriate management.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and the need for continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) indicate acute kidney injury. Continued monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly are essential.
3. ARDS: The patient's initial hypoxemic respiratory failure and subsequent development of ARDS necessitate careful monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications including acute pancreatitis, renal failure (likely caused by contrast-induced nephropathy), hypoxemic respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), anemia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis, hypotension (previously resolved), acute pleural effusion, resolved cholecystitis, and potential complications such as infected fluid collection, infected line, and pulmonary embolism.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 142/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of PRVC/AC, tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 16 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  Patient acutely worsened
   overnight with increased abdominal pain, distension and tenderness.  In
   addition his white count continues to rise and he continues to spike
   fevers.   Further he was fighting the vent and tachycardic overnight,
   all of which likely represent worsening abdominal pathology.  KUB was
   unfotunately unhelpful given habitus.  Suspicion for compartment
   syndrome is low given unchanged PIPs and low bladder pressures.
   Suspicion for infected fluid collection is high, and patient continues
   to bump his white count and spike intermittently but is never culture
   positive.  Despite a CT that only showed interval resolution, he
   continues to be distended with frank tenderness on exam.
   - Surgery refused drainage yesterday, would readdress today.  Abscess
   is very high in the differential, given known standing fluid
   collections, white count and fever refractory to antibiotics.  The only
   definitive treatment for an abscess is obviously drainage and we can
   never know if he has an abscess without draining it.
   - Continue meropenem empirically, would continue at least 10 days given
   decompensation when D/Ced in past
   - QID Electrolytes
   - cont insulin gtt
   - continue switching pain meds over to methadone, increase to 40mg q4,
   wean down fentanyl.
   - would place an OG tube to suction
   - appreciate ID concerns however patient has clinically decompensated
   x2 when pseudomnoal coverage was decreased to anything less than
   zosyn.  At this point would continue meropenem until we can
   definitively r/o infected collection, which may have to be surgical.
   - resume running negative on CVVH

   output from OGT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and has since developed multiple medical complications, including acute renal failure, hypoxemic respiratory failure (ARDS), coagulopathy, anemia, and hypotension. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH), and is receiving multiple medications for pain management, infection prophylaxis, and blood thinning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infected fluid collection: The patient's white blood cell count continues to rise, and he spikes intermittent fevers despite being on antibiotics. There is suspicion for an abscess or infected fluid collection, which could be the cause of his worsening condition.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient initially required intubation for hypoxia and has a history of acute respiratory failure. He is currently on ARDSnet settings, indicating severe lung injury.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has experienced a significant decline in renal function, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). He is currently on CVVH, which has helped improve his electrolyte levels and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) with thrombosis. His platelet count is trending up after discontinuing"

   necrotizing pancreatitis. Slight interval decrease in size of
   pancreatic fluid
   collection. Slight interval decrease in size of heterogenous left
   abdominal
   fluid collection with enhancing rim, slightly more homogenous in

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  Patient acutely worsened
   overnight with increased abdominal pain, distension and tenderness.  In
   addition his white count continues to rise and he continues to spike
   fevers.   Further he was fighting the vent and tachycardic overnight,
   all of which likely represent worsening abdominal pathology.  KUB was
   unfotunately unhelpful given habitus.  Suspicion for compartment
   syndrome is low  given unchanged PIPs and low bladder pressures.
   Suspicion for infected fluid collection is high, and patient continues
   to bump his white count and spike intermittently but is never culture
   positive.  Despite a CT that only showed interval resolution, he
   continues to be distended with frank tenderness on exam.
   - Surgery refused drainage yesterday, would readdress today.
   - Continue meropenem empirically, would continue at least 10 days given
   decompensation when D/Ced in past
   - QID Electrolytes
   - cont insulin gtt
   - continue switching pain meds over to methadone, increase to 40mg q4,
   wean down fentanyl.
   - consider diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis
   - appreciate ID concerns however patient has clinically decompensated
   x2 when pseudomnoal coverage was decreased to anything less than
   zosyn.  At this point would continue meropenem until we can
   definitively r/o infected collection, which may have to be surgical.
   - resume running negative on CVVH
   - Hold off on IR guided post-pyloric while we are still having high
   output from OGT.
   - OGT to suction
   .
   #. CoNS BACTEREMIA: Anaerobic bottle from [**2146-2-9**] growing CoNS, less
   convincing that this explaned patient
s decompensation that day. Line
   had been placed emergently by surgery, so it may have been an
   infectious source.
   - lines changed
   - cont vancomycin 1g q12 while on CVVH
   - check daily trough given changing renal function
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, heart rate is as low as it has been on this
   hospitalization and his SBP has held up very well. Unclear as to
   whether event yesterday was somehow related to fluid shifts so patient
   was kept even overnight.  As he has now clinically stabilized, we will
   restart diuresis.  Currently 20L (down from peak 32) positive LOS.
    - goal is as negative as his hemodynamics will tolerate today
   - appreciate renal recs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.
   - maintain on PSVC/AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc,
   goal Pa02>50, plateua pressure 28, permissive hypercapnea, PEEP 16,
   FiO2 50%
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz.
   - Will attempt to wean fentanyl daily while titrating up methadone
   - As fluid balance becomes progressively more negative can consider
   dropping PEEP
   .
   > ANEMIA:HCT stabilized
   .
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS- Plt count trending
   up off heparin.  On argatroban.  Known significant clot burden in
   common femoral and IVC.  No indication for IVC filter since pt has
   alternate explanation for fevers and tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at
   goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Resolved, likely [**3-1**] significant
   inflammation and distributive physiology.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE- Will monitor, empyema a less likely
   possibility of infection.
   -CVVH to address fluid overload

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was initially intubated. The patient has been experiencing increased abdominal pain, distension, and tenderness, as well as rising white blood cell count and intermittent fevers. These symptoms suggest worsening abdominal pathology, potentially due to an infected fluid collection.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 115/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 50% FiO2. He is on mechanical ventilation in PSVC/AC mode with ARDSnet settings.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal renal function tests. Imaging studies reveal stable findings consistent with necrotizing pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, and other complications.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing meropenem empirically, considering diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis, holding off on IR-guided post-pyloric feeding due to high output from the OGT, and restarting diuresis. He is also on CVVH for renal support and anticoagulation with argatroban.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening infection leading to sepsis, further deterioration"

   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  Patient acutely worsened
   overnight with increased abdominal pain, distension and tenderness.  In
   addition his white count continues to rise and he continues to spike
   fevers.   Further he was fighting the vent and tachycardic overnight,
   all of which likely represent worsening abdominal pathology.  KUB was
   unfotunately unhelpful given habitus.  Suspicion for compartment
   syndrome is low  given unchanged PIPs and low bladder pressures.
   Suspicion for infected fluid collection is high, and patient continues
   to bump his white count and spike intermittently but is never culture
   positive.
   - Repeat abdominal CT today.
   - Discuss drainage with surgery.
   - Continue meropenem empirically, would continue at least 10 days given
   decompensation when D/Ced in past
   - QID Electrolytes
   - cont insulin gtt
   - appreciate ID concerns however patient has clinically decompensated
   x2 when pseudomnoal coverage was decreased to anything less than
   zosyn.  At this point would continue meropenem until we can
   definitively r/o infected collection, which may have to be surgical.
   - Hold of on IR guided post-pyloric while we are still having high
   output from OGT.
   - OGT to suction

   #. CoNS BACTEREMIA: Anaerobic bottle from [**2146-2-9**] growing CoNS, less
   convincing that this explaned patient
s decompensation that day. Line
   had been placed emergently by surgery, so it may have been an
   infectious source.
   - lines changed
   - cont vancomycin 1g q24 while on CVVH
   - check daily trough given changing renal function
   - appreciate ID recs

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, heart rate is as low as it has been on this
   hospitalization and his SBP has held up very well. Unclear as to
   whether event yesterday was somehow related to fluid shifts so patient
   was kept even overnight.  As he has now clinically stabilized, we will
   restart diuresis.  Currently 19L (down from peak 32) positive LOS.
    - goal is more gentle today, max of
([**6-3**])
   - appreciate renal recs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins

 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.
   - maintain on PSVC/AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc,
   goal Pa02>50, plateua pressure 28, permissive hypercapnea, PEEP 16,
   FiO2 50%
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz.
   - Will attempt to wean fentanyl daily while titrating up methadone
   - As fluid balance becomes progressively more negative can consider
   dropping PEEP

 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS- Plt count trending
   up off heparin.  On argatroban.  Known significant clot burden in
   common femoral and IVC.  No indication for IVC filter since pt has
   alternate explanation for fevers and tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's clinical course has been complicated by several issues including acute renal failure likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), hypoxemic respiratory failure consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis, anemia, hypotension, pleural effusion, and cholecystitis.

The patient's vital signs are currently stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 115/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 50% FiO2. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in assist-control mode with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a plateau pressure of 28 cmH2O.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 34.7 thousand/mm3, elevated lactate levels at 1.5 mmol/L, and evidence of renal dysfunction with a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal stable findings consistent with necrotizing pancreatitis, including heterogeneous enhancement of the pancreas with lack of enhancement involving the pancreatic head, neck, and proximal body. There is also evidence of a stable"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst, as well as hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has persistent respiratory failure likely attributed to acute pancreatitis. There is a plan to continue mechanical ventilation and proceed with tracheostomy. The patient's chest wall may contribute to restrictive mechanics, increasing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Infection: The patient has a documented line-related coagulase-negative bacteremia. Central line removal and replacement with new lines have been done. This indicates the need for careful monitoring and prompt management of any signs of infection, such as fever or worsening leukocytosis.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to renal failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels will be necessary to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

4. Fluid Balance: The patient has a positive net volume resuscitation fluid balance, indicating ongoing fluid administration. Efforts should be made to optimize fluid management and achieve fluid balance.

5. Nutritional Support: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and is planned for trophic tube feeds once a post-pyloric ("

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  Patient acutely worsened
   overnight with increased abdominal pain, distension and tenderness.  In
   addition his white count continues to rise and he continues to spike
   fevers.   Further he was fighting the vent and tachycardic overnight,
   all of which likely represent worsening abdominal pathology.  KUB was
   unfotunately unhelpful given habitus.  Suspicion for compartment
   syndrome is low given unchanged PIPs and low bladder pressures.
   Suspicion for infected fluid collection is high, and patient continues
   to bump his white count and spike intermittently but is never culture
   positive.  Despite a CT that only showed interval resolution, he
   continues to be distended with frank tenderness on exam.
   - Surgery has refused drainage, would readdress this daily.  Abscess is
   very high in the differential, given known standing fluid collections,
   white count and fever refractory to antibiotics.  The only definitive
   treatment for an abscess is obviously drainage and we can never know if
   he has an abscess without draining it.  However today white count has
   dropped 10 points, and would defer while clinically improving as our
   evidence for abscess will remain clinical.
   - Continue meropenem empirically, would continue at least 10 days given
   decompensation when D/Ced in past
   - QID Electrolytes
   - cont insulin gtt
   - continue switching pain meds over to methadone, increase to 40mg q4,
   wean down fentanyl.
   - IR to place postpyloric feeding tube, and pull back current tube for
   stomach decompression.
   - appreciate ID concerns however patient has clinically decompensated
   x2 when pseudomnoal coverage was decreased to anything less than
   zosyn.  At this point would continue meropenem until we can
   definitively r/o infected collection, which may have to be surgical.
   - resume running negative on CVVH (15L + LOS currently)
   .
   #. CoNS BACTEREMIA: Anaerobic bottle from [**2146-2-9**] growing CoNS, less
   convincing that this explaned patient
s decompensation that day. Line
   had been placed emergently by surgery, so it may have been an
   infectious source.
   - lines changed
   - cont vancomycin 1g q12 while on CVVH
   - check daily trough given changing renal function
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, heart rate is as low as it has been on this
   hospitalization and his SBP has held up very well. Unclear as to
   whether event yesterday was somehow related to fluid shifts so patient
   was kept even overnight.  As he has now clinically stabilized, we will
   restart diuresis.  Currently 20L (down from peak 32) positive LOS.
    - goal is as negative as his hemodynamics will tolerate today
   - appreciate renal recs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.
   - maintain on PSVC/AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc,
   goal Pa02>50, plateua pressure 28, permissive hypercapnea, PEEP 16,
   FiO2 50%
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz.
   - Will attempt to wean fentanyl daily while titrating up methadone
   - As fluid balance becomes progressively more negative can consider
   dropping PEEP
   - Trach?
   .
   > ANEMIA:HCT stabilized
   .
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS- Plt count trending
   up off heparin.  On argatroban.  Known significant clot burden in
   common femoral and IVC.  No indication for IVC filter since pt has
   alternate explanation for fevers and tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at
   goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Resolved, likely [**3-1**] significant
   inflammation and distributive physiology.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE- Will monitor, empyema a less likely
   possibility of infection.
   -CVVH to address fluid overload
   .
 .H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS- Resolved.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and has been in the ICU for an extended period.

The patient's recent events include plan for radiology-guided post-pyloric NG tube placement while withdrawing the current OG tube for continuous suction, continuing CVVH, and receiving one unit of PRBC overnight for Hct 21.3.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including acute pancreatitis with necrosis and pseudocyst, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure (likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy), hypoxemic respiratory failure, coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, and possible anemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening abdominal pathology, infected fluid collection or abscess, continued bacteremia, fluid overload, and further complications related to his existing conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  Patient acutely worsened
   overnight with increased abdominal pain, distension and tenderness.  In
   addition his white count continues to rise and he continues to spike
   fevers.   Further he was fighting the vent and tachycardic overnight,
   all of which likely represent worsening abdominal pathology.  KUB was
   unfotunately unhelpful given habitus.  Suspicion for compartment
   syndrome is low given unchanged PIPs and low bladder pressures.
   Suspicion for infected fluid collection is high, and patient continues
   to bump his white count and spike intermittently but is never culture
   positive.  Despite a CT that only showed interval resolution, he
   continues to be distended with frank tenderness on exam.
   - Surgery has refused drainage, would readdress this daily.  Abscess is
   very high in the differential, given known standing fluid collections,
   white count and fever refractory to antibiotics.  The only definitive
   treatment for an abscess is obviously drainage and we can never know if
   he has an abscess without draining it.  However today white count has
   dropped 10 points, and would defer while clinically improving as our
   evidence for abscess will remain clinical.
   - Continue meropenem empirically, would continue at least 10 days given
   decompensation when D/Ced in past
   - QID Electrolytes
   - cont insulin gtt
   - continue switching pain meds over to methadone, increase to 40mg q4,
   wean down fentanyl.
   - IR to place postpyloric feeding tube, and pull back current tube for
   stomach decompression.
   - appreciate ID concerns however patient has clinically decompensated
   x2 when pseudomnoal coverage was decreased to anything less than
   zosyn.  At this point would continue meropenem until we can
   definitively r/o infected collection, which may have to be surgical.
   - resume running negative on CVVH (15L + LOS currently)
   .
   #. CoNS BACTEREMIA: Anaerobic bottle from [**2146-2-9**] growing CoNS, less
   convincing that this explaned patient
s decompensation that day. Line
   had been placed emergently by surgery, so it may have been an
   infectious source.
   - lines changed
   - cont vancomycin 1g q12 while on CVVH
   - check daily trough given changing renal function
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, heart rate is as low as it has been on this
   hospitalization and his SBP has held up very well. Unclear as to
   whether event yesterday was somehow related to fluid shifts so patient
   was kept even overnight.  As he has now clinically stabilized, we will
   restart diuresis.  Currently 20L (down from peak 32) positive LOS.
    - goal is as negative as his hemodynamics will tolerate today
   - appreciate renal recs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins

 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.
   - maintain on PSVC/AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc,
   goal Pa02>50, plateua pressure 28, permissive hypercapnea, PEEP 16,
   FiO2 50%
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz.
   - Will attempt to wean fentanyl daily while titrating up methadone
   - As fluid balance becomes progressively more negative can consider
   dropping PEEP

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of hemorrhage into the pseudocyst and distributive shock. The patient has had multiple complications including acute renal failure, ARDS, anemia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis, hypotension, pleural effusion, and resolved cholecystitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count continues to rise, and he is experiencing intermittent fevers despite being on antibiotics. This raises suspicion for an infected fluid collection, possibly an abscess. The patient's clinical decompensation when off pseudomonal coverage suggests a need for continued coverage until an abscess can be ruled out or managed.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH), which is helping to improve his electrolyte levels and reduce creatinine. However, close monitoring of renal function and daily fluid balance is necessary to avoid fluid shifts.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation for hypoxia and has been diagnosed with ARDS. His restrictive physiology is contributing to low lung volumes and abdominal distention. Careful management of"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yom gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and
   pseudocyst, hypoxic respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent, multifactorial likely predominately
   attributed to acute pancreatitis.  Chest wall contributing to
   restrictive mechanics.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to
   wean PEEP.  Would plan to proceed with trach.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS --   severe, necrotic, complicated with pseudocyst.
   Repeat CT scan without dramatic change.  Active inflammation persists.
   Maintain percutaneous drain.  Maintain OGT to suction (may need to
   reposition to decompress stomach).  General Surgery to follow.
   BACTEREMIA -- coagulase negative, likely line related.  Central line
   d/c'd --> new lines in place.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- continue to optimize.  Fentanyl, now slowly
   tapering.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy;  continue
   CVVH as tolerated.
   FLUIDS -- net volume resussitation fluid positive.  Plan to continue to
   net diurese.
   HYPOTKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- continue TPN.  Hope to iniitate trophic TF once
   post-pyloric (?jejunal) tube placed.
   HIT+ -- continue argatroban.
   DVT -- line-related.  Continue anticoagulation.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE -- attributed to acute pancreatitis.
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS -- Resolved.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to acute pancreatitis and chest wall restrictive mechanics. The patient has severe necrotic pancreatitis with a pseudocyst and active inflammation. He also has bacteremia, likely line-related, and renal failure attributed to contrast dye nephropathy. The patient is hypotonic and requires fluid resuscitation. He requires nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a positive HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). The patient is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has an acute pleural effusion attributed to acute pancreatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, primarily attributed to acute pancreatitis and chest wall restrictive mechanics. Continuing mechanical ventilation and planning to wean PEEP are part of the management plan.
2. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has severe necrotic pancreatitis with a pseudocyst formation. Active inflammation persists despite treatment. Maintaining percutaneous drain and optimizing pain management are essential.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has coagulase-negative bacteremia, likely line-related. Central line removal and new lines placement have been done.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is attributed"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yom gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and
   pseudocyst, hypoxic respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent, multifactorial likely predominately
   attributed to acute pancreatitis.  Chest wall contributing to
   restrictive mechanics.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to
   wean PEEP.  Would plan to proceed with trach.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS --   severe, necrotic, complicated with pseudocyst.
   Repeat CT scan without dramatic change.  Active inflammation persists.
   Maintain percutaneous drain.  Maintain OGT to suction (may need to
   reposition to decompress stomach).  General Surgery to follow.
   BACTEREMIA -- coagulase negative, likely line related.  Central line
   d/c'd --> new lines in place.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- continue to optimize.  Fentanyl, now slowly
   tapering.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy;  continue
   CVVH as tolerated.
   FLUIDS -- net volume resussitation fluid positive.  Plan to continue to
   net diurese.
   HYPOTKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- continue TPN.  Hope to iniitate trophic TF once
   post-pyloric (?jejunal) tube placed.
   HIT+ -- continue argatroban.
   DVT -- line-related.  Continue anticoagulation.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE -- attributed to acute pancreatitis.
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS -- Resolved.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to acute pancreatitis and chest wall restrictive mechanics. The patient also has severe, necrotic acute pancreatitis with a persistent pseudocyst and ongoing inflammation. He is on mechanical ventilation and has a percutaneous drain in place. The patient has bacteremia, likely line-related, and central lines have been changed. He requires optimized pain management, renal replacement therapy for renal failure attributed to contrast dye nephropathy, and continues to have positive net volume resuscitation. His potassium levels need to be monitored and repleted if necessary. Nutritional support is provided through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and he is also receiving anticoagulation therapy for HIT+ and line-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Additionally, the patient has an acute pleural effusion attributed to acute pancreatitis and a history of cholecystitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and likely attributed to acute pancreatitis and chest wall restrictive mechanics. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential. Intensifying PEEP and weaning off sedation should be considered. Proceeding with tracheostomy may be planned.

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  Patient acutely worsened
   overnight with increased abdominal pain, distension and tenderness.  In
   addition his white count continues to rise and he continues to spike
   fevers.   Further he was fighting the vent and tachycardic overnight,
   all of which likely represent worsening abdominal pathology.  KUB was
   unfotunately unhelpful given habitus.  Suspicion for compartment
   syndrome is low given unchanged PIPs and low bladder pressures.
   Suspicion for infected fluid collection is high, and patient continues
   to bump his white count and spike intermittently but is never culture
   positive.  Despite a CT that only showed interval resolution, he
   continues to be distended with frank tenderness on exam.
   - Surgery has refused drainage, would readdress this daily.  Abscess is
   very high in the differential, given known standing fluid collections,
   white count and fever refractory to antibiotics.  The only definitive
   treatment for an abscess is obviously drainage and we can never know if
   he has an abscess without draining it.  However white count continues
   to drop, and would defer while clinically improving as our evidence for
   abscess will remain clinical.
   - Continue meropenem empirically, would continue at least 10 days given
   decompensation when D/Ced in past
   - QID Electrolytes
   - cont insulin gtt
   - continue switching pain meds over to methadone, increase to 40mg q4,
   wean down fentanyl.
   - Post-pyloric feeding tube placed, gastric decompression initiated
   - appreciate ID concerns however patient has clinically decompensated
   x2 when pseudomnoal coverage was decreased to anything less than
   zosyn.  At this point would continue meropenem until we can
   definitively r/o infected collection, which may have to be surgical.
   - resume running negative on CVVH (10.9L + LOS currently)

   #. CoNS BACTEREMIA: Anaerobic bottle from [**2146-2-9**] growing CoNS, less
   convincing that this explaned patient
s decompensation that day. Line
   had been placed emergently by surgery, so it may have been an
   infectious source.
   - lines changed
   - cont vancomycin 1g q12 while on CVVH
   - check daily trough given changing renal function
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, heart rate is as low as it has been on this
   hospitalization and his SBP has held up very well. Unclear as to
   whether event yesterday was somehow related to fluid shifts so patient
   was kept even overnight.  As he has now clinically stabilized, we will
   restart diuresis.  Currently 10.9L (down from peak 32) positive LOS.
    - goal is as negative as his hemodynamics will tolerate today
   - appreciate renal recs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.
   - maintain on PSVC/AC with ARDSnet settings: VT 6cc/kg now at 450 cc,
   goal Pa02>50, plateua pressure 28, permissive hypercapnea, PEEP 10,
   FiO2 50%
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz.
   - Will attempt to wean fentanyl daily while titrating up methadone
   - PEEP is now 10 which would be acceptable for trach
   - Trach?

 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS- Plt count trending
   up off heparin.  On argatroban.  Known significant clot burden in
   common femoral and IVC.  No indication for IVC filter since pt has
   alternate explanation for fevers and tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at
   goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Resolved, likely [**3-1**] significant

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and has been in the ICU for an extended period. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (possibly due to contrast-induced nephropathy), coagulopathy (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis), and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abscess formation: The patient has persistent fever, elevated white blood cell count, and tenderness in the abdomen despite antibiotic therapy. There is a high suspicion for an abscess, and surgical drainage may be necessary.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxemia and respiratory distress. He is currently on assist-control ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy to minimize lung injury.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient developed acute renal failure, which is likely related to contrast-induced nephropathy. He has been placed on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) to manage fluid overload and correct electrolyte imbalances.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis, leading to a significant drop in platelet count. He is currently being treated with argatroban, an"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation.
- He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated.
- The patient's condition worsened overnight with increased abdominal pain, distension, and tenderness, along with a rising white blood cell count and intermittent fever spikes.
- The suspicion for compartment syndrome is low, but there is a high suspicion for an infected fluid collection.
- Surgery has refused drainage, so it will be readdressed daily. The patient continues to bump his white count and spike intermittently but is never culture positive.
- The patient is on meropenem empirically and will continue at least 10 days due to previous decompensation when the antibiotic was decreased.
- Post-pyloric feeding tube placement and gastric decompression have been initiated.
- The patient has a history of renal failure, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been started with improvement in electrolytes and creatinine. Fluid removal is well-tolerated.
- The patient initially had hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been weaned down to 10/10 of pressure support with 40% FiO2 and continues to be sedated with f"

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  Patient acutely worsened
   overnight with increased abdominal pain, distension and tenderness.  In
   addition his white count continues to rise and he continues to spike
   fevers.   Further he was fighting the vent and tachycardic overnight,
   all of which likely represent worsening abdominal pathology.  KUB was
   unfotunately unhelpful given habitus.  Suspicion for compartment
   syndrome is low given unchanged PIPs and low bladder pressures.
   Suspicion for infected fluid collection is high, and patient continues
   to bump his white count and spike intermittently but is never culture
   positive.  Despite a CT that only showed interval resolution, he
   continues to be distended with frank tenderness on exam.
   - Surgery has refused drainage, would readdress this daily.  Abscess is
   very high in the differential, given known standing fluid collections,
   white count and fever refractory to antibiotics.  The only definitive
   treatment for an abscess is obviously drainage and we can never know if
   he has an abscess without draining it.  However white count continues
   to drop, and would defer while clinically improving as our evidence for
   abscess will remain clinical.
   - Continue meropenem empirically, would continue at least 10 days
   ([**11-20**] last day) given decompensation when D/Ced in past
   - QID Electrolytes
   - cont insulin gtt
   - continue switching pain meds over to methadone, increase to 60mg q4,
   wean down fentanyl.
   - wean down midaz,switch to seroquel PRN
   - Post-pyloric feeding tube placed, gastric decompression initiated
   (-1.2L)
   - appreciate ID concerns however patient has clinically decompensated
   x2 when pseudomnoal coverage was decreased to anything less than
   zosyn.  At this point would continue meropenem until we can
   definitively r/o infected collection, which may have to be surgical.
   - resume running negative on CVVH (10.9L + LOS currently)
   .
   #. CoNS BACTEREMIA: Anaerobic bottle from [**2146-2-9**] growing CoNS, less
   convincing that this explaned patient
s decompensation that day. Line
   had been placed emergently by surgery, so it may have been an
   infectious source.
   - lines changed
   - cont vancomycin 1500g q12 while on CVVH
   - check daily trough given changing renal function
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, heart rate is as low as it has been on this
   hospitalization and his SBP has held up very well. Unclear as to
   whether event yesterday was somehow related to fluid shifts so patient
   was kept even overnight.  As he has now clinically stabilized, we will
   restart diuresis.  Currently 10.9L (down from peak 32) positive LOS.
    - goal is as negative as his hemodynamics will tolerate today
   -  Would not consider stopping CVVH until at least back to admission
   weight
   - appreciate renal recs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.
   - weaned down to 10/10 of pressure support with 40% FI O2 this morning
 would continue to wean as tolerated
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz. Weaning as tolerated, this will be
   major barrier.
   - Will attempt to wean fentanyl daily while titrating up methadone
   - Given strides over past 24 hours, would hold off on trach decision
   until the weekend.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was diagnosed with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He experienced a series of complications including infected fluid collection, renal failure (likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy), hypoxemic respiratory failure (ARDS), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis, and pleural effusion. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He is also on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) for acute renal failure. The patient has multiple lines and tubes in place, including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, multi-lumen catheter, and post-pyloric feeding tube. His current medications include meropenem, vancomycin, fentanyl, midazolam, methadone, pantoprazole, and argatroban. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infected fluid collection: The patient has a known infected fluid collection, which is suspected to be an abscess. The only definitive treatment for an abscess is drainage. The patient's white blood cell count continues to rise, indicating ongoing infection.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy. He is currently on CVVH, which is helping"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yom gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and
   pseudocyst, hypoxic respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, multifactorial likely predominately
   attributed to acute pancreatitis.  Chest wall contributing to
   restrictive mechanics.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to
   wean PEEP.  Continue to work towards SBT, and hope for extubation
   trial.  Main obstacle to extubation is intraabdominal inflammation,
   pain.  [**Month (only) 8**] require trach.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS --   severe, necrotic, complicated with pseudocyst.
   Recent repeat CT scan without dramatic change.  Active inflammation
   persists.  Maintain percutaneous drain.  Maintain OGT to suction.
   General Surgery to follow.
   BACTEREMIA -- coagulase negative, likely line related.  Central line
   d/c'd --> new lines in place.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- continue to optimize.  Fentanyl, now slowly
   tapering.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy;  continue
   CVVH as tolerated.
   FLUIDS -- net volume resussitation fluid positive.  Plan to continue to
   net diurese, approaching dry weight.
   HYPOTKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- continue TPN.  Continue TF with post-pyloric
   (jejunal) tube --> advance as tolerated.
   HIT+ -- continue argatroban.
   DVT -- line-related.  Continue anticoagulation.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE -- left side; attributed to acute pancreatitis.
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS -- Resolved.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely due to acute pancreatitis and restrictive chest wall mechanics. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and work towards weaning PEEP and performing spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) for the possibility of extubation. However, intraabdominal inflammation and pain are major obstacles to extubation, and a tracheostomy may be required in month 8.

The patient also has severe, necrotic acute pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation. A recent repeat CT scan shows persistent active inflammation, so percutaneous drain maintenance and OGT to suction will continue. General Surgery will follow up on this condition.

The patient is also diagnosed with bacteremia, likely caused by coagulase-negative bacteria associated with a central line. The central line has been removed and new lines have been placed.

Pain management is ongoing, with optimization of fentanyl dosage and slow tapering. Renal failure is attributed to contrast dye nephropathy, and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is being performed as tolerated.

Fluid management shows a positive net volume resuscitation, with plans to continue net diuresis and approach dry weight.

Nutritional support continues with total parenteral nutrition (TPN)"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yom gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and
   pseudocyst, hypoxic respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, multifactorial likely predominately
   attributed to acute pancreatitis.  Chest wall contributing to
   restrictive mechanics.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to
   wean PEEP.  Continue to work towards SBT, and hope for extubation
   trial.  Main obstacle to extubation is intraabdominal inflammation,
   pain.  [**Month (only) 8**] require trach.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS --   severe, necrotic, complicated with pseudocyst.
   Recent repeat CT scan without dramatic change.  Active inflammation
   persists.  Maintain percutaneous drain.  Maintain OGT to suction.
   General Surgery to follow.
   BACTEREMIA -- coagulase negative, likely line related.  Central line
   d/c'd --> new lines in place.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- continue to optimize.  Fentanyl, now slowly
   tapering.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy;  continue
   CVVH as tolerated.
   FLUIDS -- net volume resussitation fluid positive.  Plan to continue to
   net diurese, approaching dry weight.
   HYPOTKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- continue TPN.  Continue TF with post-pyloric
   (jejunal) tube --> advance as tolerated.
   HIT+ -- continue argatroban.
   DVT -- line-related.  Continue anticoagulation.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE -- left side; attributed to acute pancreatitis.
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS -- Resolved.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation, hypoxic respiratory failure, severe acute pancreatitis, renal failure, bacteremia, pain management issues, hypokalemia, nutritional support, HIT+ status, DVT, pleural effusion, and a history of cholecystitis.

The patient's current condition includes being intubated and mechanically ventilated, tolerating a reduction in PEEP from 16 to 10 cmH2O and IPS mode. He remains sedated but able to open his eyes to name. Post-pyloric feeding tube placement was done, and gastric tube drainage is bilious material. The patient has allergies to morphine and heparin agents.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
- Heart rate: 115 bpm (with a range of 101-120 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 135/69 mmHg (with a range of 92-149/63-82 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (with a range of 14-27 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 6.7 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 20.9 K/uL
- Blood glucose: 109 mg/dL
- Sodium: 138 mEq/L
- Potassium: 3.1 mEq/L
- Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
- Total bilirubin: 1.8 mg/dL
- Albumin: 1.8 g/dL

The patient's medical plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation, attempting to wean PEEP, working towards spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and hoping for extubation trial. The main obstacle to extubation is intraabdominal inflammation and pain. The patient's acute pancreatitis is severe, necrotic, and complicated by pseudocyst formation. Active inflammation persists, so maintaining percutaneous drain and open gastric tube to suction is advised. General surgery will follow up on the patient's condition.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple complications, including respiratory failure, acute pancreatitis, renal failure, bacteremia, pain management issues, hypokalemia, and others."

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  Patient acutely worsened with
   increased abdominal pain, distension and tenderness.  In addition his
   white count rose and he continued to spiked fevers.  Suspicion for
   compartment syndrome was low given unchanged PIPs and low bladder
   pressures.  Suspicion for infected fluid collection is high, and
   patient continues to bump his white count and spike intermittently but
   is never culture positive.  Despite a CT that only showed interval
   resolution, he continues to be distended.
   - Surgery did not support drainage, will readdress this daily.  Abscess
   is very high in the differential, given known standing fluid
   collections, white count and fever refractory to antibiotics.  The only
   definitive treatment for an abscess is obviously drainage and we can
   never know if he has an abscess without draining it.  However white
   count continues to drop, and would defer while clinically improving as
   our evidence for abscess will remain clinical.
   - Continue meropenem and vancomycin empirically, would continue at
   least 10 days ([**2-20**] last day) given decompensation when D/Ced in past
   - QID Electrolytes
   - cont insulin gtt
   - continue switching pain meds over to methadone, increase to 40 mg q3,
   wean down fentanyl.
   - wean down midaz,switch to seroquel PRN
   - Post-pyloric feeding tube placed, gastric decompression initiated,
   cont to have copious output from stomach, bilious
   - appreciate ID concerns however patient has clinically decompensated
   x2 when pseudomnoal coverage was decreased to anything less than
   zosyn.  At this point would continue meropenem and vancomycin until we
   can definitively r/o infected collection, which may have to be
   surgical.
   - resume running negative on CVVH
   .
   #. CoNS BACTEREMIA: Anaerobic bottle from [**2146-2-9**] growing CoNS, less
   convincing that this explaned patient
s decompensation that day. Line
   had been placed emergently by surgery, so it may have been an
   infectious source.
   - lines changed
   - cont vancomycin 1500g q12 while on CVVH, trough adequate, today day
   [**11-10**]
   - check daily trough given changing renal function
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, heart rate is as low as it has been on this
   hospitalization and his SBP has held up very well. Unclear as to
   whether event was somehow related to fluid shifts so patient was kept
   even overnight.  As he has now clinically stabilized, we will cont
   diuresis.
    - goal is as negative as his hemodynamics will tolerate today
   -  Would not consider stopping CVVH until at least back to admission
   weight
   - appreciate renal recs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.  Tachypnea overnight likely [**3-1**] secretion/mucous plus, ABG
   unchanged, rested on AC overnight.
   - weaned down to 10/10 of pressure support with 40% FI O2 yesterday
   would continue to wean as tolerated
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz. Weaning as tolerated, this will be
   major barrier.
   - Will attempt to wean fentanyl daily while titrating up methadone
   - Given strides over past 48 hours, would hold off on trach decision
   until the weekend.
   .
   > ANEMIA:HCT stabilized PM crit xfuse to 21
   .
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS-  On argatroban.
   Known significant clot burden in common femoral and IVC.  No indication
   for IVC filter since pt has alternate explanation for fevers and
   tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Resolved, likely [**3-1**] significant
   inflammation and distributive physiology.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE- Will monitor, empyema a less likely
   possibility of infection.
   -CVVH to address fluid overload
   - would not tap, as will introduce new source of infection

","The patient is a 28-year-old male who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to gallstone pancreatitis with necrosis and pseudocyst formation. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), renal failure, hypoxemic respiratory failure, pleural effusion, and cholecystitis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 138/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV).

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.0 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 1.2 mmol/L, and acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) of 31.2 seconds, prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 76.3 seconds, and low platelet count of 204 K/uL.

The patient's abdominal examination reveals firm masses in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant (RUQ), consistent with the presence of a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of obesity, hypertension, and cholecystitis, currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, acute pancreatitis, and acute renal failure. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He is being treated with multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, analgesics, and sedatives. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 110-120 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117-138 mmHg, respiratory rate between 13-18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 12,609 mL and output of 19,907 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of 7,298 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum culture are pending. The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and is being closely monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP"

   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  Patient acutely worsened with
   increased abdominal pain, distension and tenderness.  In addition his
   white count rose and he continued to spiked fevers.  Suspicion for
   compartment syndrome was low given unchanged PIPs and low bladder
   pressures.  Suspicion for infected fluid collection is high, and
   patient continues to bump his white count and spike intermittently but
   is never culture positive.  Despite a CT that only showed interval
   resolution, he continues to be distended.
   - Surgery did not support drainage, will readdress this daily.  Abscess
   is very high in the differential, given known standing fluid
   collections, white count and fever refractory to antibiotics.  The only
   definitive treatment for an abscess is obviously drainage and we can
   never know if he has an abscess without draining it.  However white
   count continues to drop, and would defer while clinically improving as
   our evidence for abscess will remain clinical.
   - Continue meropenem and vancomycin empirically, would continue at
   least 10 days ([**2-20**] last day) given decompensation when D/Ced in past
   - QID Electrolytes
   - cont insulin gtt

   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.  Tachypnea overnight likely [**3-1**] secretion/mucous plus, ABG
   unchanged, rested on AC overnight.
   - weaned down to 10/10 of pressure support with 40% FI O2 yesterday
   would continue to wean as tolerated
   - cont sedation with fent and midaz. Weaning as tolerated, this will be
   major barrier.
   - Will attempt to wean fentanyl daily while titrating up methadone

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis, hypotension, pleural effusion, and a history of cholecystitis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C), heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 138/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV).

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.0 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 1.2 mmol/L, and renal dysfunction with a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. Blood cultures have been obtained, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including meropenem and vancomycin.

The patient's abdominal drain continues to show bilious output, and there is concern for an abscess or infected fluid collection. A post-pyloric feeding tube has been placed, and gastric decompression has"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yom gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and
   pseudocyst, hypoxic respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, multifactorial likely predominately
   attributed to acute pancreatitis.  Chest wall contributing to
   restrictive mechanics.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to
   wean PEEP.  Continue to work towards SBT, and hope for extubation
   trial.  Main obstacle to extubation is intraabdominal inflammation,
   pain.  [**Month (only) 8**] require trach.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS --   severe, necrotic, complicated with pseudocyst.
   Recent repeat CT scan without dramatic change.  Active inflammation
   persists.  Maintain percutaneous drain.  Maintain OGT to suction.
   General Surgery to follow.
   FEVER
 attributed to intraabdominal inflammation.  Need to monitor
   closely for new infection:  line-related, hepatobiliary, infected
   pancreatic pseudocyst.
   BACTEREMIA -- coagulase negative, likely line related.  Central line
   d/c'd --> new lines in place.   Complete course of Vanco.
   ELEVATED TBILI -- repeat RUQ U/S.  Continue to follow exam and LFTs.
   General surgery to f/u.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- continue to optimize.  Fentanyl, now slowly
   tapering.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy;  consider
   discontinuing CVVH and monitor.
   FLUIDS -- net volume resussitation fluid positive.  Plan to continue to
   net diurese, approaching dry weight.
   HYPOTKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- continue TPN.  Continue TF with post-pyloric
   (jejunal) tube --> advance as tolerated.
   HIT+ -- continue argatroban.
   DVT -- line-related.  Continue anticoagulation.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE -- left side; attributed to acute pancreatitis.
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS -- Resolved.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely attributed to acute pancreatitis and chest wall restrictive mechanics. The patient's respiratory failure is persistent and multifactorial, making mechanical ventilation necessary. The main obstacle to extubation is intraabdominal inflammation and pain.

The patient also has severe, necrotic acute pancreatitis with a pseudocyst. Recent repeat CT scans show no dramatic change, and active inflammation persists. A percutaneous drain will be maintained, and the patient will continue to have OGT to suction. General surgery will follow up on the patient's condition.

The patient is also experiencing fever, which is attributed to intraabdominal inflammation. Monitoring for new infection is crucial, especially line-related, hepatobiliary, or infected pancreatic pseudocyst infections. Bacteremia, likely line-related, has been identified, and central line discontinuation has been done with new lines in place. The patient has completed the course of Vancomycin.

Elevated total bilirubin levels indicate a need for repeat RUQ ultrasound and continued follow-up of liver function tests. General surgery will be involved in further management.

Pain management is ongoing, with optimization of fentanyl administration and slow tapering. Renal failure has been attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy, and consideration"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yom gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and
   pseudocyst, hypoxic respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, multifactorial likely predominately
   attributed to acute pancreatitis.  Chest wall contributing to
   restrictive mechanics.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to
   wean PEEP.  Continue to work towards SBT, and hope for extubation
   trial.  Main obstacle to extubation is intraabdominal inflammation,
   pain.  [**Month (only) 8**] require trach.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS --   severe, necrotic, complicated with pseudocyst.
   Recent repeat CT scan without dramatic change.  Active inflammation
   persists.  Maintain percutaneous drain.  Maintain OGT to suction.
   General Surgery to follow.
   FEVER
 attributed to intraabdominal inflammation.  Need to monitor
   closely for new infection:  line-related, hepatobiliary, infected
   pancreatic pseudocyst.
   BACTEREMIA -- coagulase negative, likely line related.  Central line
   d/c'd --> new lines in place.   Complete course of Vanco.
   ELEVATED TBILI -- repeat RUQ U/S.  Continue to follow exam and LFTs.
   General surgery to f/u.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- continue to optimize.  Fentanyl, now slowly
   tapering.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy;  consider
   discontinuing CVVH and monitor.
   FLUIDS -- net volume resussitation fluid positive.  Plan to continue to
   net diurese, approaching dry weight.
   HYPOTKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- continue TPN.  Continue TF with post-pyloric
   (jejunal) tube --> advance as tolerated.
   HIT+ -- continue argatroban.
   DVT -- line-related.  Continue anticoagulation.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE -- left side; attributed to acute pancreatitis.
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS -- Resolved.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst, as well as hypoxic respiratory failure.
- He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.
- The patient is sedated and tolerating tube feeds (TF) at goal.
- There are ongoing efforts to wean PEEP and work towards a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for potential extubation.
- The main obstacle to extubation is intraabdominal inflammation and pain.
- The patient has severe, necrotic acute pancreatitis with a pseudocyst and active inflammation.
- He has an elevated temperature, likely due to intraabdominal inflammation, and there is a concern for new infections such as line-related, hepatobiliary, or infected pancreatic pseudocyst infections.
- The patient has bacteremia, which is likely line-related, and central lines have been changed.
- There is an elevated total bilirubin level, and a repeat RUQ ultrasound has been ordered.
- Pain management is being optimized, and the patient is slowly tapering off fentanyl.
- The patient has renal failure attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy, and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is being considered for discontinuation.

 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  Patient acutely worsened with
   increased abdominal pain, distension and tenderness.  In addition his
   white count rose and he continued to spiked fevers.  Suspicion for
   compartment syndrome was low given unchanged PIPs and low bladder
   pressures.  Suspicion for infected fluid collection is high, and
   patient continues to bump his white count and spike intermittently but
   is never culture positive.  Despite a CT that only showed interval
   resolution, he continues to be distended.
   - Surgery did not support drainage, will readdress this daily.  Abscess
   is very high in the differential, given known standing fluid
   collections, white count and fever refractory to antibiotics.  The only
   definitive treatment for an abscess is obviously drainage and we can
   never know if he has an abscess without draining it.  Patient did spike
   to 102 overnight on [**2146-2-18**] on CVVH and [**2146-2-19**] off CVVH.  Concern for
   abscess remains high.  Pan-cultured, NTD.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient developed fever, tachycardia, and worsening abdominal pain, suggesting a possible infected fluid collection or abscess. His white blood cell count increased, and he continued to spike fevers despite antibiotic therapy.

The patient's renal function deteriorated, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy. He was started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with improvement in electrolytes and creatinine levels. However, his CVVH filter clotted overnight, and he required fluid removal through diuresis.

The patient's respiratory status improved, allowing for weaning off mechanical ventilation. He developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis, for which he was placed on argatroban. His pleural effusion was monitored, and there were no signs of empyema.

The patient's hypotension resolved, likely due to significant inflammation and distributive physiology. He had a history of calculous cholecystitis, which has resolved.

The patient's nutritional status is being addressed with post-pyloric tube feeds. His access lines include a left internal jugular (IJ) line, right hand (HD) line, axillary arterial line (A-line), and peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines. Code status is full code."

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including septic shock, acute pancreatitis, fever, tachycardia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, pleural effusion, and cholecystitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension indicate a possible systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to an infection. Immediate management should focus on identifying the source of infection and initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Acute pancreatitis: The patient's initial presentation of abdominal pain and elevated pancreatic enzyme levels suggest acute pancreatitis. It is essential to monitor his condition closely for any signs of complications such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation.

3. ARDS: The patient's acute respiratory distress requires careful monitoring and management. Supportive measures like mechanical ventilation may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation. It is crucial to avoid ventilator-induced lung injury and prevent further complications.

4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and urea levels indicate renal impairment. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, such as CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), should be considered to prevent further deterioration.

5. Heparin-induced"

   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   >  FEVER/TACHYCARDIA- fever likely [**3-1**] inflammatory response from
   pancreatitis.  Tachycardia likely [**3-1**] fever, pain, possible
   intravascular volume depletion.  Received IVF overnight with modest
   improvement.  Also improved with fever control.  Withdrawal from benzo
   could also be contributing.
   - cont to treat fever
   - f/u pan-culture data
   .
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  Patient acutely worsened with
   increased abdominal pain, distension and tenderness.  In addition his
   white count rose and he continued to spiked fevers.  Suspicion for
   compartment syndrome was low given unchanged PIPs and low bladder
   pressures.  Suspicion for infected fluid collection is high, and
   patient continues to bump his white count and spike intermittently but
   is never culture positive.  Despite a CT that only showed interval
   resolution, he continues to be distended.
   - Surgery did not support drainage, will readdress this today.  Abscess
   is very high in the differential, given known standing fluid
   collections, white count and fever refractory to antibiotics.  Patient
   did spike to 102 overnight on [**2146-2-18**] on CVVH and [**2146-2-19**] off CVVH.
   Concern for abscess remains high.  Pan-cultured, NTD.
   - Continue meropenem empirically, would continue at least 10 days ([**2-20**]
   last day) given decompensation when D/Ced in past
   - QID Electrolytes on CVVH
   - continue switching pain meds over to methadone, increase to 40 mg q2,
   wean down fentanyl and versed, convert seroquel to standing and
   continue ketamine
   - Post-pyloric feeding tube placed, gastric decompression initiated,
   cont to have copious output from stomach, bilious -> determine today if
   methylene blue is in TFs, suggesting residuals
   - appreciate ID concerns however patient has clinically decompensated
   x2 when pseudomnoal coverage was decreased to anything less than
   zosyn.  At this point would continue meropenem until we can
   definitively r/o infected collection, which may have to be surgical
   - ? Surgery re: abscess drainage
   - f/u RUQ u/s

   #. CoNS BACTEREMIA: Anaerobic bottle from [**2146-2-9**] growing CoNS, less
   convincing that this explaned patient
s decompensation that day. Line
   had been placed emergently by surgery, so it may have been an
   infectious source.
   - lines changed
   - d/c vancomycin
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, heart rate is as low as it has been on this
   hospitalization and his SBP has held up very well. Unclear as to
   whether event was somehow related to fluid shifts so patient was kept
   even overnight.  As he has now clinically stabilized, we will cont
   diuresis.  CVVH filter clotted overnight, stopped.  Lytes this morning
   suggest need for CVVH, K trending up
   - volume goal is pre-admission weight
   - appreciate renal recs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - restart CVVH, goal 1-2 liters (-) today, will d/w family re:
   patient
s pre-admission weight
   .
 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.  Tachypnea overnight likely [**3-1**] secretion/mucous plus, ABG
   unchanged, rested on AC overnight.
   - weaned down to 10/8 of pressure support with 40% FI O2
 would
   continue to wean as tolerated
   - wean sedation as above
   .
   > ANEMIA:HCT stabilized PM crit xfuse to 21
   .
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS-  On argatroban.
   Known significant clot burden in common femoral and IVC.  No indication
   for IVC filter since pt has alternate explanation for fevers and
   tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Resolved, likely [**3-1**] significant
   inflammation and distributive physiology.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE- Will monitor, empyema a less likely
   possibility of infection.
   - CVVH to address fluid overload
   - would not tap, as will introduce new source of infection
   .
 .H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS- Resolved.  Cont to trend LFTs.
   .
   #. Nutrition:
   - Post-pyloric tubefeeds -> will stain with methylene blue to determine
   if copious NG output is TFs
   - will d/c TPN, TFs at goal, methylene blue experiement as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and worsening abdominal pain. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood cultures negative to date, and evidence of renal failure. The patient has been treated with various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and sedatives. He is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) and receiving post-pyloric feeds. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's fever and tachycardia could indicate a possible septic shock due to an infection.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient initially required intubation for hypoxia and tachypnea, suggesting a possibility of ARDS.
3. Hepatitis-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis: The patient is on argatroban, an anticoagulant, which indicates a concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and urea levels suggest acute renal failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with gallstone pancreatitis. He has a history of allergies to morphine and heparin agents. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode, FiO2 of 40%, and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C), heart rate of 134 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/71 to 152/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient has been sedated and not fully assessed neurologically. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds anteriorly, and distended abdomen with right lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, while liver enzymes are slightly elevated. Imaging and microbiology results are pending. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including septic shock, acute pancreatitis, fever, tachycardia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, hypotension,"

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  Patient acutely worsened with
   increased abdominal pain, distension and tenderness.  In addition his
   white count rose and he continued to spiked fevers.  Suspicion for
   compartment syndrome was low given unchanged PIPs and low bladder
   pressures.  Suspicion for infected fluid collection is high, and
   patient continues to bump his white count and spike intermittently but
   is never culture positive.  Despite a CT that only showed interval
   resolution, he continues to be distended.
   - Surgery did not support drainage, will readdress this daily.  Abscess
   is very high in the differential, given known standing fluid
   collections, white count and fever refractory to antibiotics.  The only
   definitive treatment for an abscess is obviously drainage and we can
   never know if he has an abscess without draining it.  Patient did spike
   to 102 overnight on [**2146-2-18**] on CVVH and [**2146-2-19**] off CVVH.  Concern for
   abscess remains high.  Pan-cultured, NTD.
   - Continue meropenem empirically, would continue at least 10 days ([**2-20**]
   last day) given decompensation when D/Ced in past
   - QID Electrolytes
   - continue switching pain meds over to methadone, increase to 40 mg q2,
   wean down fentanyl and versed, convert seroquel to standing and
   continue ketamine
   - Post-pyloric feeding tube placed, gastric decompression initiated,
   cont to have copious output from stomach, bilious -> determine today if
   methylene blue is in TFs, suggesting residuals
   - appreciate ID concerns however patient has clinically decompensated
   x2 when pseudomnoal coverage was decreased to anything less than
   zosyn.  At this point would continue meropenem until we can
   definitively r/o infected collection, which may have to be surgical
   - ? Surgery re: abscess drainage
   - f/u RUQ u/s
   .
   >  FEVER/TACHYCARDIA- fever likely [**3-1**] inflammatory response from
   pancreatitis.  Tachycardia likely [**3-1**] fever, pain, possible
   intravascular volume depletion.  Received IVF overnight with modest
   improvement.
   - cont to treat fever
   - f/u pan-culture data
   .
   #. CoNS BACTEREMIA: Anaerobic bottle from [**2146-2-9**] growing CoNS, less
   convincing that this explaned patient
s decompensation that day. Line
   had been placed emergently by surgery, so it may have been an
   infectious source.
   - lines changed
   - d/c vancomycin
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, heart rate is as low as it has been on this
   hospitalization and his SBP has held up very well. Unclear as to
   whether event was somehow related to fluid shifts so patient was kept
   even overnight.  As he has now clinically stabilized, we will cont
   diuresis.  CVVH filter clotted overnight, stopped.  Lytes this morning
   suggest need for CVVH, K trending up

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 28-year-old male who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to gallstone pancreatitis with necrosis and pseudocyst. The patient initially decompensated with hemorrhage into the pseudocyst versus distributive shock picture with systemic inflammation. Laboratory findings include elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging studies show evidence of necrotizing pancreatitis with fluid collections.

The patient's current condition is complicated by septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), and aggressive fluid resuscitation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing intermittent fevers and has positive blood cultures for CoNS bacteremia. There is a suspicion of infected fluid collection or abscess, which may require drainage.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has developed acute renal failure, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). CVVH has been initiated, and the patient's electrolytes and creatinine levels are being closely monitored.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation and mechanical ventilation for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator will be determined based on the patient's clinical response and ABG results.

4. Hepatic enceph"

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME/RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Improving
   CXR, doing well on PSV.  Will continue to optimize volume status with
   CVVH, decrease vent support as tolerated.
   - Continue fluid removal as hemodynamically tolerated
   - Working to optimize mental status
   - If not in a position to be extubated by Monday, would proceed for
   tracheostomy
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA/DVT

   positive, extensive LE clot burden, on argatroban.
   - Continue argatroban, PTT at goal.
 LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION
 Possibly improved by CXR, has never been
   tapped.
   - Follow daily CXR
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely [**3-1**] CIN, started on CVVH for
   hyperkalemia and volume overload.  Per wife baseline weight is ~235lbs,
   currently ~260, but has gotten to being approximately even for LOS.
   Has had increasing potassium off of CVVH, will restart.
   - Follow lytes
   - Continue to run negative as BP tolerates
   - Restart CVVH
   - Appreciate renal input
 Pain/Sedation
 Switching from fent/versed to
   methadone/ketamine/seroquel, will try to wean fent/versed to off,
   monitor for possible benzo withdrawal.  Will discuss with pharmacy as
   to ketamin dosing, optimal sedation regimen.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with severe pancreatitis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has several medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

1. Fever: The patient's fever has worsened overnight despite being off CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration). There is concern for ongoing intraabdominal inflammation or infection, as indicated by the presence of extensive abdominal drain output. Culturing the abdominal fluid is recommended to identify any potential infection.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is in the 140s to 150s range off of CVVH. This could be due to fever or ongoing inflammation. Close monitoring of the heart rate and temperature is necessary. Transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) may be required to maintain adequate oxygen carrying capacity.

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)/Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition has improved, as shown by the improvement in the chest X-ray (CXR). Optimizing fluid status with CVVH and decreasing ventilator support as tolerated is recommended. If extubation is not possible by Monday, a tracheostomy may be considered.

4. Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT)/Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has tested positive for serotonin release assay, indicating HIT. Argatroban,"

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with severe pancreatitis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate in the 140s to 150s, and he has a fever of 39.3 degrees Celsius. His blood pressure is within normal limits, but his respiratory rate is slightly elevated.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. His liver enzymes are elevated, and there are signs of kidney dysfunction with increased creatinine levels. The patient also has an electrolyte imbalance with high potassium levels.

The patient's imaging studies show multiple intrabdominal fluid collections, biliary dilatation, and a layering pleural effusion on the left side. 

The patient's current medications include argatroban (for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), pantoprazole (for stress ulcer prophylaxis), and various other medications for pain management, sedation, and glycemic control.

The patient's medical complications include necrotizing pancreatitis, fever, tachycardia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), left pleural effusion, acute renal failure, and potential complications related to his mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pancreatitis, sepsis due to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with severe pancreatitis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include necrotizing pancreatitis with multiple intrabdominal fluid collections, fever with no clear evidence of infection, tachycardia, acute respiratory distress syndrome/respiratory failure, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia/DVT, renal failure, and pain/sedation issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient has severe pancreatitis with multiple intrabdominal fluid collections. This can lead to infection and further complications if not managed properly.
2. Fever: The patient's fever has worsened overnight, despite being off CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration). There is concern for ongoing intraabdominal inflammation or infection.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is in the 140s to 150s, which is above normal. This could be due to fever, pain, or other factors.
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome/respiratory failure: The patient is improving on pressure support ventilation (PSV), but still requires assistance with breathing. This condition requires close monitoring and management.
5. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia/DVT: The patient has tested positive for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a serious complication of hepar"

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
      Further incubation required to determine the presence or absence of
      commensal respiratory flora.
         GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    SPARSE GROWTH.
   RUQ U/S:
   Persistent mild intrahepatic biliary
   dilatation, within limitations of cross comparison between studies, not
   significantly changed since CT examination from [**2146-2-14**].

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   >  FEVER/TACHYCARDIA-  Continues to spike fevers, there is some concern
   for abscess, however fevers more likely to represent non-infectious,
   inflammatory response. RUQ U/S negative for abscess.Tachycardia likely
   [**3-1**] fever, pain.  Withdrawal from benzo could also be contributing, and
   rate improved with increased versed. Will cont to follow pharm
   recommended weaning plan for versed and fentanyl. Will continue to
   trend WBC and rule out infection, CIS.
   - attempt to taper benzos very gradually
   - cont to treat fever
   - f/u pan-culture data
   .
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  CT showed stable fluid
   collections. Ab distention improved with OGT to suction. Now tolerated
   TFs at goal. Moving bowels after lactulose.
   - discuss need for pancreatic enzyme replacement with GI since on TF at
   goal and having diarrhea
   - cont to pan-cx for fevers
   - peritoneal drain fluid with no cells or organisms, likely necrotic
   debris since no cells present
   - Continue meropenem empirically, [**11-10**] empiric course, will review
   literature for further guidance
   - QID Electrolytes on CVVH
   - continue switching pain meds over to methadone, seroquel, ketamine
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, now negative LOS but not at baseline weight. Was trialed
   off CVVH due to clotting off, and electrolytes increased.
   - plan is to continue aggressive diuresis until next time filter
   clots/expires, then stop CVVH
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - goal neg as much as possible
   .
 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.  Doing well on PSV.
   - continue to wean PSV as tolerated, attempt to gradually wean to [**6-1**]
   today
   - consult IP vs [**Doctor First Name 91**] tomororw for trach, will make this decision
   mid-week, but trach is likely the way to go for safe extubation and
   wife seems to agree at this point
   .
   > ANEMIA: Transfued 1 unit PRBC yesterday, and HCT stabilized since.
   - cont [**Hospital1 **] Hct checks and transfuse >21
   .
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS-  On argatroban.
   Known significant clot burden in common femoral and IVC.  No indication
   for IVC filter since pt has alternate explanation for fevers and
   tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Resolved, likely [**3-1**] significant
   inflammation and distributive physiology.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE- appears significantly improved on CXR
   - CVVH to address fluid overload

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was initially intubated. The patient's current health progress includes:

1. Fever and tachycardia: The patient continues to have fevers, which may be due to an inflammatory response rather than an infectious cause. Tachycardia is likely attributed to fever, pain, and possible withdrawal from benzodiazepines. The plan is to continue monitoring the patient's temperature and heart rate.

2. Renal failure: The patient likely has acute kidney injury (AKI) due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). He is being treated with continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH), which has improved his electrolyte levels and creatinine. The plan is to continue CVVH until the next filter change, then stop it. The patient will be aggressively diuresed, and medications will be renally dosed to avoid nephrotoxins.

3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for hypoxia and tachypnea. The likely etiology of the respiratory failure is distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. The restrictive physiology may be contributing to his condition. The patient is currently doing well on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The plan is to continue"

      Further incubation required to determine the presence or absence of
      commensal respiratory flora.
         GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    SPARSE GROWTH.
   RUQ U/S:
   Persistent mild intrahepatic biliary
   dilatation, within limitations of cross comparison between studies, not
   significantly changed since CT examination from [**2146-2-14**].
   2. Partially imaged organizing fluid collections as seen on recent CT
   from
   [**2146-2-14**].
   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   >  FEVER/TACHYCARDIA- fever likely [**3-1**] inflammatory response from
   pancreatitis.  Tachycardia likely [**3-1**] fever, pain.  Withdrawal from
   benzo could also be contributing, and rate improved with increased
   versed.
   - attempt to taper benzos very gradually
   - cont to treat fever
   - f/u pan-culture data
   .
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  CT showed stable fluid
   collections. Ab distention improved with OGT to suction. Now tolerated
   TFs at goal. Continues to spike fevers, there is some concern for
   abscess, however fevers may continue to represent non-infectious,
   inflammatory response. RUQ U/S negative.
   - cont to pan-cx for fevers
   - peritoneal drain fluid with no cells or organisms
   - Continue meropenem empirically, would continue at least 10 days ([**2-20**]
   last day) given decompensation when D/Ced in past
   - QID Electrolytes on CVVH
   - continue switching pain meds over to methadone, seroquel, ketamine
   - Post-pyloric feeds restarted and tolerating well, moving bowels
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, now negative LOS but not at baseline weight. Was trialed
   off CVVH due to clotting off, and electrolytes increased.
   - volume goal is pre-admission weight
   - appreciate renal recs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - goal 1-2 liters (-) today
   .
 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.  Doing well on PSV. One episode of hypoxia overnight after
   turning, may have been splinting [**3-1**] pain, or mucous plug. Resolved
   spontaneously.
   - continue to wean PSV as tolerated
   - wean sedation as above, however pt will likely continue to require
   high doses of sedating meds, and extubation may not be realistic at
   this point, may need to discuss trach tomorrow
   .
   > ANEMIA: Transfued 1 unit PRBC yesterday, and HCT stabilized since.
   - cont [**Hospital1 **] Hct checks and transfuse >21
   .
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS-  On argatroban.
   Known significant clot burden in common femoral and IVC.  No indication
   for IVC filter since pt has alternate explanation for fevers and
   tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Resolved, likely [**3-1**] significant
   inflammation and distributive physiology.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE- appears significantly improved on CXR
   - CVVH to address fluid overload

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst. The patient presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated.

The patient has multiple medical complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), hypoxemic respiratory failure, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis, anemia, pleural effusion, and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.3°C (102.8°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 132/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver enzymes. Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Imaging studies reveal persistent mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation and partially imaged organizing fluid collections.

The plan includes continuing treatment for fever, monitoring pancreatic culture data, tapering benzodiazepines gradually, switching pain medications to methadone, restarting post-pyloric feeds, and continuing CVVH with fluid removal goal set at pre-admission weight. The patient"

These include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), pleural effusion, acute renal failure, and a history of cholecystitis.

The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. He is on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) and sedation with midazolam (Versed). His respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV+ApnVol ventilation mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 35%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. His blood cultures were taken on 02/19/20 at 03:51 AM, 04:12 AM, 05:44 AM, and so on.

The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, diminished breath sounds on the left base, and a firm abdomen with soft bowel sounds and mild tenderness in the mid-epigastrium. Neurologically, he is sedated and responds to verbal stimuli with minimal movement.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, worsening respiratory status, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and potential infections due"

   Assessment and Plan
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
 Improving, but still has fevers and multiple
   intra-abdominal fluid collections.  Surgery has been following, feel no
   drainage currently indicated.  Had been aggressively fluid
   resuscitated, now doing well with fluid removal.  Had jejunal feeding
   tube placed, now stooling.
   - Continue tube feeds
   - Monitor intra-abdominal drain output
   - Discuss with GI if he requires pancreatic enzyme replacement
 FEVER
 Unclear etiology, concern for sterile inflammation secondary
   to pancreatitis vs superinfection vs iatrogenic infection.  Line sites
   look fine, cultures unrevealing.  Has been on meropenem for 10days, has
   decompensated when stopped prior.
   - Continue surveillance cultures
   - Monitor abdominal exam
   - Plan empiric 14d course of meropenem
 TACHYCARDIA
 Markedly tachycardic yesterday in the setting of
   stopping CVVH, rapid weaning of versed, and high fever.  Now improved
   with restarting versed and CVVH.
   - Slower versed taper, current pain regimen
   - Continue to remove fluid w/CVVH
   - Control fevers as needed
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 CXR improving w/fluid removal, will continue to
   decrease ventilator support as tolerated.  Mental status improved, but
   overall may still require tracheostomy.
   - Will try to decrease PEEP and PS over the day
   - AM RSBI, SBT
   - Obtain IP consult in AM for possible trach
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA/DVT
 On argatroban, will need at
   least 6 months of anticoagulation for DVT.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE
 Large L-sided effusion, appears improved
   w/fluid removal.  Follow CXR, respiratory status.  If still febrile,
   could consider tapping, particularly if extubated or on minimal PEEP.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 Had worsening
   fever, tachycardia, increasing potassium off of CVVH.  Will try to
   aggressively remove volume while still on CVVH, but if it goes down,
   will likely transition to HD if still requiring RRT.
   - Appreciate renal input
   - CVVH today, run as negative as tolerated
   - Monitor lytes, especially K

","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a chief complaint of necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing fevers, tachycardia, and hypertension. The patient has been aggressively fluid resuscitated and is now doing well with fluid removal. He also has multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections.

Assessment and plan:
1. Acute pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is improving, but he still has fevers and intra-abdominal fluid collections. Surgery has been following the situation, and drainage is not currently indicated.
2. Fever: The etiology of the fever is unclear, with concerns for sterile inflammation secondary to pancreatitis, superinfection, or iatrogenic infection. The patient's line sites look fine, cultures are unrevealing, and he has been on meropenem for 10 days. Empiric treatment with meropenem will continue.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia has improved with restarting versed and CVVH. Slower tapering of versed, continuing fluid removal with CVVH, and controlling fevers as needed will be continued.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving with fluid removal, and ventilator support will be decreased as tolerated. Mental status has improved, but tracheostomy may still be required.
5. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia/D"

   - Obtain IP consult in AM for possible trach
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA/DVT
 On argatroban, will need at
   least 6 months of anticoagulation for DVT.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE
 Large L-sided effusion, appears improved
   w/fluid removal.  Follow CXR, respiratory status.  If still febrile,
   could consider tapping, particularly if extubated or on minimal PEEP.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 Had worsening
   fever, tachycardia, increasing potassium off of CVVH.  Will try to
   aggressively remove volume while still on CVVH, but if it goes down,
   will likely transition to HD if still requiring RRT.
   - Appreciate renal input
   - CVVH today, run as negative as tolerated
   - Monitor lytes, especially K

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient's condition is improving, but they still have fevers and multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections. Surgery has determined that no drainage is currently indicated. The patient has been aggressively fluid resuscitated and is now doing well with fluid removal. A jejunal feeding tube has been placed, and the patient is now stooling.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers, and the etiology is unclear. There is concern for sterile inflammation secondary to pancreatitis, superinfection, or iatrogenic infection. The patient is already on meropenem, which has been effective, but there is a plan for continued surveillance cultures and monitoring of the abdominal exam.
2. Tachycardia: The patient experienced markedly tachycardic yesterday when stopping CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), rapid weaning of versed, and high fever. However, the tachycardia has improved with restarting versed and CVVH.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving with fluid removal, as evident by the improving CXR (chest X-ray). There is a plan to decrease ventilator support as tolerated. Mental status has improved, but the patient may still require a tracheostomy.
4. Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia/DVT"

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   >  FEVER/TACHYCARDIA-  Continues to spike fevers, there is some concern
   for abscess, however fevers more likely to represent non-infectious,
   inflammatory response. RUQ U/S negative for abscess.Tachycardia likely
   [**3-1**] fever, pain.  Withdrawal from benzo could also be contributing, and
   rate improved with increased versed. Will cont to follow pharm
   recommended weaning plan for versed and fentanyl. Will continue to
   trend WBC and rule out infection, CIS.
   - attempt to taper benzos very gradually
   - cont to treat fever
   - f/u pan-culture data
   - post-pyloric NG tube blocked with methadone, not able to deliver any
   meds enterally, will need to pass guide wire at bedside or IR to open
   NG tube
   .
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  CT showed stable fluid
   collections. Ab distention improved with OGT to suction. Now tolerated
   TFs at goal. Moving bowels after lactulose.
   - will hold on pancreatic enzymes while delivering TFs
   - cont to pan-cx for fevers
   - peritoneal drain fluid with no cells or organisms, likely necrotic
   debris since no cells present
   - Continue meropenem empirically, [**12-11**] empiric course, will review
   literature for further guidance
   - QID Electrolytes on CVVH
   - continue switching pain meds over to methadone, seroquel, ketamine ->
   will cont methadone IV given blocked NG tube
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, now negative LOS but not at baseline weight.  Recnet
   trial off CVVH due to clotting off, and electrolytes increased.
   - plan is to continue aggressive diuresis until next time filter
   clots/expires, then stop CVVH
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - goal neg as much as possible
   .
 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.  Doing well on PSV.
   - continue to wean PSV as tolerated, attempt to gradually wean to [**6-1**]
   today
   - consult IP vs [**Doctor First Name 91**] tomororw for trach, will make this decision
   mid-week, but trach is likely the way to go for safe extubation and
   wife seems to agree at this point, as sedation continues to be limiting
   factor
   .
   > ANEMIA: Transfued 1 unit PRBC yesterday, and HCT stabilized since.
   - cont [**Hospital1 **] Hct checks and transfuse >21
   .
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS-  On argatroban.
   Known significant clot burden in common femoral and IVC.  No indication
   for IVC filter since pt has alternate explanation for fevers and
   tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Resolved, likely [**3-1**] significant
   inflammation and distributive physiology.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE- appears significantly improved on CXR
   - CVVH to address fluid overload
   .
 .H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS- Resolved.  Cont to trend LFTs.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 32-year-old male with necrotizing pancreatitis and hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been in the ICU since admission. The patient's arterial line was removed at 10:10 PM on 02/20/2146, and he was successfully weaned off the ventilator to assist control mode. Pancreatic enzyme supplementation with nutrition was discussed, but due to the patient's inability to tolerate oral medications, it was decided to hold off on using tablets and instead provide low-fat/elemental feeds that do not require much pancreatic enzymes. The postpyloric tube became clogged, and interventional radiology (IR) was called for assistance. Renal recommendations include continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) at maximum until the filter is done.

The patient has a history of allergies to morphine, hot sweating, and heparin agents due to HIT. His last dose of antibiotics, meropenem, was given on 02/20/2146 at 09:24 PM. The patient is currently receiving argatroban at a rate of 0.4 mcg/kg/min, midazolam (Versed) at 8 mg/hour, KCl (CRRT) at 2 mEq/hour, and ketamine at 0.3 mg/kg/hour. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) given on 02/20/2146 at 08:14 AM and methadone hydrochloride given on 02/21/2146 at 03:59 AM. Midazolam (Versed) was also given on 02/21/2146 at 04:46 AM.

The patient is sedated this morning and follows commands but does not answer yes/no questions. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Vital signs:
- Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
- Heart rate: 117 bpm (105-138 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 126/75 mmHg (87-151/65-128 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (13-24 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 97%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's weight is currently 112 kg, with an admission weight of 143 kg. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 3 mmHg (3-35 mmHg). Fluid balance shows an intake of 10,590 mL, with an output of 16,590 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -6"

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   >  FEVER/TACHYCARDIA-  Continues to spike fevers, there is some concern
   for abscess, however fevers more likely to represent non-infectious,
   inflammatory response. RUQ U/S negative for abscess.Tachycardia likely
   [**3-1**] fever, pain.  Withdrawal from benzo could also be contributing, and
   rate improved with increased versed. Will cont to follow pharm
   recommended weaning plan for versed and fentanyl. Will continue to
   trend WBC and rule out infection, CIS.
   - attempt to taper benzos very gradually
   - cont to treat fever
   - f/u pan-culture data
   - post-pyloric NG tube blocked with methadone, not able to deliver any
   meds enterally, will call IR to replace post-pyloric NG tube
   - cont to treat agitation with PRN boluses of midaz, limit as able
   given possible extubation today
   .
 PANCREATITIS, [**Name (NI) 11141**]  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  CT showed stable fluid
   collections. Ab distention improved with OGT to suction. Now tolerated
   TFs at goal. Moving bowels after lactulose.
   - will hold on pancreatic enzymes while delivering TFs
   - cont to pan-cx for fevers
   - peritoneal drain fluid with no cells or organisms, likely necrotic
   debris since no cells present
   - Continue meropenem empirically, [**12-11**] empiric course, will review
   literature for further guidance
   - TID Electrolytes
   - continue switching pain meds over to methadone, seroquel, ketamine ->
   will cont methadone IV given blocked NG tube
   -  will d/w pharm re: abrupt cessation of ketamine and possible
   withdrawal; ideally would treat pain PRN pain meds following
   extubation, consider dilaudid PCA
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, now negative LOS but not at baseline weight.  Recnet
   trial off CVVH due to clotting off, and electrolytes increased.   CVVH
   filter clotted this a.m., now off CVVH.
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - goal even today
   .
 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.  Doing well on PSV.
   - continue to wean PSV as tolerated, attempt to extubate today
   following replacement of post-pyloric NG tube
   - consult IP vs [**Doctor First Name 91**] for trach if patient fails extubation, will make
   this decision mid-week, but trach is likely the way to go for safe
   extubation and wife seems to agree at this point, as sedation continues
   to be limiting factor
   .
   > ANEMIA: Transfued 1 unit PRBC yesterday, and HCT stabilized since.
   - cont [**Hospital1 **] Hct checks and transfuse >21
   .
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS-  On argatroban.
   Known significant clot burden in common femoral and IVC.  No indication
   for IVC filter since pt has alternate explanation for fevers and
   tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Resolved, likely [**3-1**] significant
   inflammation and distributive physiology.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE- appears significantly improved on CXR
   - CVVH to address fluid overload
   .
 .H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS- Resolved.  Cont to trend LFTs.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications and conditions. These include necrotizing pancreatitis, hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis, pleural effusion, and cholecystitis.

1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and has a history of gallstone pancreatitis with necrosis and pseudocyst formation. The patient continues to have fever spikes, which could indicate an inflammatory response rather than an infectious cause. The plan is to continue monitoring the patient's white blood cell count and rule out infection.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation due to hypoxia and tachypnea. The likely etiology of the initial respiratory failure is distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient is currently doing well on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and the plan is to continue weaning PSV as tolerated and attempt extubation today.

3. ARDS: The patient has evidence of ARDS, which is a known complication of severe pancreatitis. The restrictive physiology likely contributed to the respiratory failure, along with very low lung volumes and abdominal distention. The plan is to continue weaning PSV as tolerated and attempt extubation today.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure secondary to contrast-induced"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yom gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and
   pseudocyst, hypoxic respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, multifactorial likely predominately
   attributed to acute pancreatitis.  Chest wall contributing to
   restrictive mechanics.  Tolerating SBT, and hope for extubation trial.
   Main obstacle to extubation has been intraabdomininal inflammation,
   pain and level of sedation.  Reduce sedatives.  [**Month (only) 8**] require trach if
   not able to extubate.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- severe, necrotic, complicated with pseudocyst.
   Maintain percutaneous drain.  Maintain OGT to suction.  General Surgery
   following.
   FEVER
 attributed to intraabdominal inflammation.  Need to monitor
   closely for new infection:  line-related, hepatobiliary, infected
   pancreatic pseudocyst.
   BACTEREMIA -- coagulase negative, likely line related.  Central line
   d/c'd --> new lines in place.   Completed course of Vanco.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- continue to optimize.  Fentanyl now off.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy.  Monitor
   off CVVH.
   FLUIDS -- net volume resussitation fluid positive.  Plan to continue to
   net diurese, approaching dry weight.
   HYPOTKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- continue TPN.  Continue TF with post-pyloric
   (jejunal) tube --> advance as tolerated.
   HIT+ -- continue argatroban.
   DVT -- line-related.  Continue anticoagulation.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE -- left side; attributed to acute pancreatitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely attributed to acute pancreatitis. The main obstacles to extubation are intraabdominal inflammation, pain, and the level of sedation. The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, bacteremia (likely line-related), renal failure (attributed to contrast dye nephropathy), hypokalemia, and a pleural effusion on the left side (attributed to acute pancreatitis). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely attributed to acute pancreatitis. This condition can lead to further complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has severe necrotic pancreatitis complicated by pseudocyst formation. This condition can lead to ongoing inflammation, infection, and potential complications like abscess formation or pancreatic ductal obstruction.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has a coagulase-negative bacteremia, which is likely line-related. This condition can progress to sepsis or septic shock if not promptly treated.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy. Proper management is required to prevent further deterioration of kidney function"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yom gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and
   pseudocyst, hypoxic respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, multifactorial likely predominately
   attributed to acute pancreatitis.  Chest wall contributing to
   restrictive mechanics.  Tolerating SBT, and hope for extubation trial.
   Main obstacle to extubation has been intraabdomininal inflammation,
   pain and level of sedation.  Reduce sedatives.  [**Month (only) 8**] require trach if
   not able to extubate.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- severe, necrotic, complicated with pseudocyst.
   Maintain percutaneous drain.  Maintain OGT to suction.  General Surgery
   following.
   FEVER
 attributed to intraabdominal inflammation.  Need to monitor
   closely for new infection:  line-related, hepatobiliary, infected
   pancreatic pseudocyst.
   BACTEREMIA -- coagulase negative, likely line related.  Central line
   d/c'd --> new lines in place.   Completed course of Vanco.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- continue to optimize.  Fentanyl now off.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy.  Monitor
   off CVVH.
   FLUIDS -- net volume resussitation fluid positive.  Plan to continue to
   net diurese, approaching dry weight.
   HYPOTKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- continue TPN.  Continue TF with post-pyloric
   (jejunal) tube --> advance as tolerated.
   HIT+ -- continue argatroban.
   DVT -- line-related.  Continue anticoagulation.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE -- left side; attributed to acute pancreatitis.
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS -- Resolved.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old individual with a history of gallstone pancreatitis that has now complicated into necrosis and pseudocyst formation, as well as hypoxic respiratory failure. 

The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated but is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). The main obstacles to extubation are intraabdominal inflammation, pain, and sedation levels. The plan is to reduce sedatives and consider tracheostomy if extubation is not successful.

The patient has severe necrotic pancreatitis with a pseudocyst formation. A percutaneous drain will be maintained, and the OGT will continue to be kept to suction. General Surgery will be following up on this case.

The patient is also experiencing fever, which is likely due to intraabdominal inflammation. It is important to closely monitor for new infections, such as line-related infections, hepatobiliary infections, or infected pancreatic pseudocyst.

There is also evidence of bacteremia, likely line-related. The central line has been discontinued and replaced with new lines. The patient has completed a course of Vancomycin.

Optimal pain management should be continued, with the discontinuation of fentanyl. The patient has renal failure attributed to IV contrast dye nephropathy. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) should be monitored and continued.

The patient's fluids are showing a positive net volume resuss"

   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.  Doing well on PSV.  Transitioned sedation overnight to
   propofol.
   -  will attempt to extubate this morning
   - will need to monitor vital signs post-extubation given significant
   sedation in past few weeks
   - agitation managed with olanzapine, can add lorazepam IV PRN
   .
   >  FEVER/TACHYCARDIA-  Continues to spike fevers, there is some concern
   for abscess, however fevers more likely to represent non-infectious,
   inflammatory response. RUQ U/S negative for abscess.Tachycardia likely
   [**3-1**] fever, pain.  Withdrawal from benzo could also be contributing, and
   rate improved with increased versed. Will cont to follow pharm
   recommended weaning plan for versed and fentanyl. Will continue to
   trend WBC and rule out infection, CIS.
   - attempt to taper benzos very gradually, replace midaz with lorazepam
   post-extubation
   - cont to treat fever
   - f/u pan-culture data
   .
 PANCREATITIS, [**Name (NI) 11141**]  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  CT showed stable fluid
   collections. Ab distention improved with OGT to suction. Now tolerated
   TFs at goal. Moving bowels after lactulose.
   - will hold on pancreatic enzymes while delivering TFs
   - cont to pan-cx for fevers
   - peritoneal drain fluid with no cells or organisms, likely necrotic
   debris since no cells present
   - Continue meropenem empirically, [**1-10**] empiric course
   - TID Electrolytes
   - pain control with methadone IV, can add morphine or dilaudid if
   needed; benzo/atypical anti-psychotic as above
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, now negative LOS but not at baseline weight.  Recnet
   trial off CVVH due to clotting off, and electrolytes increased.   CVVH
   filter clotted yesterday., now off CVVH.
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - monitor UOP, TID lytes
   .
   > ANEMIA: Hct drop to 18 this morning, confirmed on repeat.
   -  will check DIC, hemolysis labs
   - one unit PRBCs, post-Hct check
   - CT non-con A/P
   .
   >  Diarrhea- increased over past 24 hours.  Has received long course of
   Abx.  Guaiac (-).
   -  will check C. diff, stool studies
   .
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS-  On argatroban.
   Known significant clot burden in common femoral and IVC.  No indication
   for IVC filter since pt has alternate explanation for fevers and
   tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with necrotizing pancreatitis and hypoxic respiratory failure. He was initially intubated for hypoxia and tachypnea, with concern for imminent fatigue. The likely etiology of the initial respiratory failure is distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient has been doing well on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has transitioned sedation overnight to propofol. The plan is to attempt extubation in the morning.

The patient continues to spike fevers, which may be due to an inflammatory response rather than infection. Tachycardia is likely related to fever, pain, and withdrawal from benzodiazepines. The patient's withdrawal from benzodiazepines should be tapered gradually, and lorazepam can be used as a replacement. Cultures are being trended, and infection is being ruled out.

The patient's pancreatitis may have initially decompensated into hemorrhage into the pseudocyst or distributive shock with systemic inflammation. Liver function tests (LFTs) are stable and normal. A CT scan showed stable fluid collections. Abdominal distention has improved with oral gastric tube (OGT) to suction. The patient is now tolerating tube feeds at goal and moving bowels after lactulose. Pancreatic enzymes will be held while delivering tube feeds. Cultures for fevers will continue to be monitored."

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   >  FEVER/TACHYCARDIA-  Continues to spike fevers, there is some concern
   for abscess, however fevers more likely to represent non-infectious,
   inflammatory response. RUQ U/S negative for abscess.Tachycardia likely
   [**3-1**] fever, pain.  Withdrawal from benzo could also be contributing, and
   rate improved with increased versed. Will cont to follow pharm
   recommended weaning plan for versed and fentanyl. Will continue to
   trend WBC and rule out infection, CIS.
   - attempt to taper benzos very gradually
   - cont to treat fever
   - f/u pan-culture data
   - post-pyloric NG tube blocked with methadone, not able to deliver any
   meds enterally, will call IR to replace post-pyloric NG tube
   - cont to treat agitation with PRN boluses of midaz, limit as able
   given possible extubation today
   .
 PANCREATITIS, [**Name (NI) 11141**]  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  CT showed stable fluid
   collections. Ab distention improved with OGT to suction. Now tolerated
   TFs at goal. Moving bowels after lactulose.
   - will hold on pancreatic enzymes while delivering TFs
   - cont to pan-cx for fevers
   - peritoneal drain fluid with no cells or organisms, likely necrotic
   debris since no cells present
   - Continue meropenem empirically, [**12-11**] empiric course, will review
   literature for further guidance
   - TID Electrolytes
   - continue switching pain meds over to methadone, seroquel, ketamine ->
   will cont methadone IV given blocked NG tube
   -  will d/w pharm re: abrupt cessation of ketamine and possible
   withdrawal; ideally would treat pain PRN pain meds following
   extubation, consider dilaudid PCA
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, now negative LOS but not at baseline weight.  Recnet
   trial off CVVH due to clotting off, and electrolytes increased.   CVVH
   filter clotted this a.m., now off CVVH.
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - goal even today
   .
 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.  Doing well on PSV.
   - continue to wean PSV as tolerated, attempt to extubate today
   following replacement of post-pyloric NG tube
   - consult IP vs [**Doctor First Name 91**] for trach if patient fails extubation, will make
   this decision mid-week, but trach is likely the way to go for safe
   extubation and wife seems to agree at this point, as sedation continues
   to be limiting factor
   .
   > ANEMIA: Transfued 1 unit PRBC yesterday, and HCT stabilized since.
   - cont [**Hospital1 **] Hct checks and transfuse >21
   .
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS-  On argatroban.
   Known significant clot burden in common femoral and IVC.  No indication
   for IVC filter since pt has alternate explanation for fevers and
   tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Resolved, likely [**3-1**] significant
   inflammation and distributive physiology.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE- appears significantly improved on CXR
   - CVVH to address fluid overload

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and has been admitted to the ICU.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Fever and tachycardia, which may be due to non-infectious inflammatory response or withdrawal from benzodiazepines.
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely secondary to distributive shock in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.
- Acute renal failure (ARF), likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).
- Hypoxemic respiratory failure, initially intubated for hypoxia and tachypnea.
- Hepatic involvement with elevated liver enzymes.
- Thrombocytopenia with thrombosis, on argatroban.
- Anemia, transfused 1 unit packed red blood cells (PRBC) yesterday, and hematocrit stabilized since.
- Pleural effusion, appears significantly improved on chest X-ray.
- Cholecystitis, resolved.
- Acute necrotizing pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure-controlled assisted ventilation (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is tolerating fluid removal well. He has been weaned off continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to clotting of the filter.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male admitted to the ICU with necrotizing pancreatitis and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.7°F, heart rate of 142 bpm, blood pressure of 137/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has been sedated but remains alert and agitated at times.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and vasopressors. The cultures from blood, sputum, and urine have shown no growth so far. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's renal function is also impaired.

The patient's medical complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, and alteration in elimination related to constipation. The patient has a history of cholecystitis.

The patient's care in the ICU involves nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, dialysis, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and there is no mention of disposition.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yom gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and
   pseudocyst, hypoxic respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, multifactorial likely predominately
   attributed to acute pancreatitis.  Chest wall contributing to
   restrictive mechanics, but improved.  Tolerating reduced PEEP.
   Tolerating SBT, and hope for extubation trial.  Main obstacle to
   extubation has been intraabdomininal inflammation, pain and level of
   sedation.  Tolerated reduction of sedatives.  Plan to proceed with
   extubation trial today, may require trach if not able to extubate
   successfully.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- severe, necrotic, complicated with pseudocysts.
   Maintain percutaneous drain of one pseudocyst.  Maintain OGT to
   suction.  General Surgery following.
   FEVER
 attributed to intraabdominal inflammation.  Need to monitor
   closely for new infection:  line-related, hepatobiliary, infected
   pancreatic pseudocyst.
   BACTEREMIA -- coagulase negative, likely line related.  Central line
   d/c'd --> new lines in place.   Completed course of Vanco.
   DIARRHEA -- concern for C. diff --> check stool for C. diff toxin.
   ANEMIA -- persistent, likely in part to phlebotomy.  With most recent
   decline, will plan reimaging to assess for intraabdominal bleed (esp
   while receiving anticoagulation).
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- continue to optimize.  Fentanyl now off.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy.  Monitor
   off CVVH.
   FLUIDS -- net volume resussitation fluid positive.  Plan to continue to
   net diurese, approaching dry weight.
   HYPOTKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- continue TPN.  TF with post-pyloric (jejunal)
   tube --> tolerated.  TF on hold pending extubation trial.
   HIT+ -- continue argatroban.
   DVT -- line-related.  Continue anticoagulation.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE -- left side; attributed to acute
   pancreatitis.  Resolving.
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS -- Resolved.

","The patient is a 28-year-old individual with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation.

They are tolerating reduced PEEP and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and an extubation trial is planned for today. If unsuccessful, a tracheostomy may be required.

The patient also has severe necrotic acute pancreatitis with pseudocysts, for which percutaneous drainage of one pseudocyst is maintained. An open gastric tube (OGT) to suction is also in place. General Surgery will be following up on this condition.

The patient has been experiencing fever, attributed to intraabdominal inflammation. There is a concern for new infection, including line-related infections, hepatobiliary infections, or infected pancreatic pseudocysts. Bacteremia, likely line-related, has been identified as coagulase-negative. Central lines have been changed, and a completed course of Vancomycin has been administered.

The patient is also presenting with diarrhea, and there is a concern for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Stool testing for C. diff toxin is pending. Anemia is persistent and is partly due to phlebotomy. Reimaging will be done to assess for intraabdominal bleeding, especially while"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yom gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and
   pseudocyst, hypoxic respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, multifactorial likely predominately
   attributed to acute pancreatitis.  Chest wall contributing to
   restrictive mechanics, but improved.  Tolerating reduced PEEP.
   Tolerating SBT, and hope for extubation trial.  Main obstacle to
   extubation has been intraabdomininal inflammation, pain and level of
   sedation.  Tolerated reduction of sedatives.  Plan to proceed with
   extubation trial today, may require trach if not able to extubate
   successfully.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- severe, necrotic, complicated with pseudocysts.
   Maintain percutaneous drain of one pseudocyst.  Maintain OGT to
   suction.  General Surgery following.
   FEVER
 attributed to intraabdominal inflammation.  Need to monitor
   closely for new infection:  line-related, hepatobiliary, infected
   pancreatic pseudocyst.
   BACTEREMIA -- coagulase negative, likely line related.  Central line
   d/c'd --> new lines in place.   Completed course of Vanco.
   DIARRHEA -- concern for C. diff --> check stool for C. diff toxin.
   ANEMIA -- persistent, likely in part to phlebotomy.  With most recent
   decline, will plan reimaging to assess for intraabdominal bleed (esp
   while receiving anticoagulation).
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- continue to optimize.  Fentanyl now off.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy.  Monitor
   off CVVH.
   FLUIDS -- net volume resussitation fluid positive.  Plan to continue to
   net diurese, approaching dry weight.
   HYPOTKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- continue TPN.  TF with post-pyloric (jejunal)
   tube --> tolerated.  TF on hold pending extubation trial.
   HIT+ -- continue argatroban.
   DVT -- line-related.  Continue anticoagulation.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE -- left side; attributed to acute
   pancreatitis.  Resolving.
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS -- Resolved.

The patient continues to have lots of stool and was extubated, sitting well on room air. His hematocrit (HCT) increased by 1 unit, dropping from 22 to 21, and he received a blood transfusion.

The patient is currently being treated with various medications, including GPC's on BCX, started on vanc, placed 2 18G peripheral lines, and re-transfused. He has allergies to morphine and heparin agents due to HIT.

His vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C (102°F), heart rate of 128 bpm, blood pressure of 133/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and he has lost a significant amount of weight since admission.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,457 mL, including 348 mL of IV fluids, and an output of 2,180 mL, including 580 mL of urine. He has also had 600 mL of NG drainage.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and they require mechanical ventilation. ARDS is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the lungs become inflamed and filled with fluid.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis with necrosis and pseudocyst formation. This condition can lead to abdominal pain, organ dysfunction, and potential complications such as infection or abscess formation.

4. Hepatitis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating possible liver inflammation or damage. This could be due to various causes, including infection or drug-induced liver injury.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, likely caused by contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). AKI can result in impaired kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding. In this case, it is likely due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a serious adverse reaction to heparin therapy.

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Gram Positive Cocci  Bacteremia
 Patient with multiple long standing
   IV
s as a possible risk factor for GPC
s in his blood. Likely
   contributing to fever.
   - placed two peripheral 18G IV
   - Pulled central lines
   - started vancomycin, check through before 4^th dose
   .
   Gram Negative rods in sputum
 These started growing on the 22^nd, and
   occurred despite meropenem.  Gram negative rods that are known to be
   resitant to meropenem include AE Bacter, Legionella, and
   Stenotrophomonas.  Likely contributing to fever.
   - Would call down to lab later today and see if we can get better
   speciation as there is no single [**Doctor Last Name **] for all three.
   - f/u urine legionella ag
   - Woul hold off on empiric abx as would require broad coverage with
   varied side effects.
   .
   >  TACHYCARDIA-  Continues to spike fevers, there is some concern for
   abscess, fevers are likely multifactorial and represent both infectious
   and non-infectious, inflammatory responses. RUQ U/S negative for
   abscess.Tachycardia likely [**3-1**] fever, pain.  Withdrawal from benzo
   could also be contributing, and rate improved with increased versed.
   Will cont to follow pharm
s recommended weaning plan for versed and
   fentanyl.
   - attempt to taper benzos very gradually, with lorazepam, zyprexa prn
   post-extubation
   - cont to treat fever
   - f/u pan-culture data
   .
 PANCREATITIS, [**Name (NI) 11141**]  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  CT showed stable fluid
   collections. Ab distention improved with OGT to suction. Now tolerated
   TFs at goal. Moving bowels after lactulose.  CT scan showed only
   improvement yesterday.
   - will hold on pancreatic enzymes while delivering TFs
   - cont to pan-cx for fevers
   - peritoneal drain fluid with no cells or organisms, likely necrotic
   debris since no cells present
   - Would d/c meropenem at this point as new infectious sources have been
   isolated on meropenem.
   - TID Electrolytes
   - pain control with methadone liquid, dilaudid IV PRN;
   .
   > ANEMIA: Hct drop to 18 yesterday morning, up to 22.7 after two units,
   22.1 this AM.
   -  will check DIC, hemolysis labs negative so far
   -  q6h hematocrit today, HCT>21
   -  CT non-con A/P showed no source of bleeding.
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, now negative LOS but not at baseline weight.  Recnet
   trial off CVVH due to clotting off, and electrolytes increased.   Off
   CVVH, continues to improve
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - monitor UOP, TID lytes
   .
   >  Diarrhea- increased over past 24 hours.  Has received long course of
   Abx.  Guaiac (-), C. Diff (-)
   - stool studies
   .
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS-  On argatroban.
   Known significant clot burden in common femoral and IVC.  No indication
   for IVC filter since pt has alternate explanation for fevers and
   tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80
   .
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE- appears significantly improved on CXR
   - CVVH to address fluid overload

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was found to have bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci, likely due to long-standing intravenous catheters. Additionally, he developed a respiratory infection with Gram-negative rods, which were resistant to meropenem. The patient also showed signs of tachycardia, fever, and anemia. He experienced renal failure, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy, and required continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with improvement in electrolyte levels and clearance of waste products.

Furthermore, the patient had diarrhea despite receiving a prolonged course of antibiotics, and stool studies were ordered to investigate further. He also had heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis and was placed on argatroban to manage this condition. The patient's pleural effusion significantly improved, and he was receiving total parenteral nutrition (TFs). His access lines included two 18G peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines.

Overall, the patient's medical complications include gallstone pancreatitis with necrosis and pseudocyst, bacteremia, respiratory infection with antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative rods, tachycardia, anemia, renal failure, diarrhea, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis, and a resolved"

 HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
   (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])  Pt initially intubated for hypoxia,
   tachypnea to 50s, with concern for imminent fatigue. Given (-) culture
   data to date, likely etiology of initial resp failure is distributive
   shock in setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Restrictive physiology
   likely contributed, in setting of very low lung volumes and abdominal
   distention.  Doing well on PSV.  Transitioned sedation overnight to
   propofol.
   -  will attempt to extubate this morning
   - will need to monitor vital signs post-extubation given significant
   sedation in past few weeks
   - agitation managed with olanzapine, can add lorazepam IV PRN
   .
   >  FEVER/TACHYCARDIA-  Continues to spike fevers, there is some concern
   for abscess, however fevers more likely to represent non-infectious,
   inflammatory response. RUQ U/S negative for abscess.Tachycardia likely
   [**3-1**] fever, pain.  Withdrawal from benzo could also be contributing, and
   rate improved with increased versed. Will cont to follow pharm
   recommended weaning plan for versed and fentanyl. Will continue to
   trend WBC and rule out infection, CIS.
   - attempt to taper benzos very gradually, replace midaz with lorazepam
   post-extubation
   - cont to treat fever
   - f/u pan-culture data
   .
 PANCREATITIS, [**Name (NI) 11141**]  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  CT showed stable fluid
   collections. Ab distention improved with OGT to suction. Now tolerated
   TFs at goal. Moving bowels after lactulose.
   - will hold on pancreatic enzymes while delivering TFs
   - cont to pan-cx for fevers
   - peritoneal drain fluid with no cells or organisms, likely necrotic
   debris since no cells present
   - Continue meropenem empirically, [**1-10**] empiric course
   - TID Electrolytes
   - pain control with methadone IV, can add morphine or dilaudid if
   needed; benzo/atypical anti-psychotic as above
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, now negative LOS but not at baseline weight.  Recnet
   trial off CVVH due to clotting off, and electrolytes increased.   CVVH
   filter clotted yesterday., now off CVVH.
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - monitor UOP, TID lytes
   .
   > ANEMIA: Hct drop to 18 this morning, confirmed on repeat.
   -  will check DIC, hemolysis labs
   - one unit PRBCs, post-Hct check
   - CT non-con A/P
   .
   >  Diarrhea- increased over past 24 hours.  Has received long course of
   Abx.  Guaiac (-).
   -  will check C. diff, stool studies
   .
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS-  On argatroban.
   Known significant clot burden in common femoral and IVC.  No indication
   for IVC filter since pt has alternate explanation for fevers and
   tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
Resolved, likely [**3-1**] significant
   inflammation and distributive physiology.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE- appears significantly improved on CXR

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. 

1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers and tachycardia, which could be signs of an infection. It is important to continue monitoring for signs of infection and ruling out infectious causes.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis with necrosis and pseudocyst. This condition can lead to complications such as abscess formation or persistent inflammation.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). It is crucial to monitor kidney function and adjust medication dosages accordingly.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have decreased significantly, indicating anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has been diagnosed with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and is currently on argatroban, an anticoagulant. Close monitoring of platelet levels and PTT (partial thromboplastin time) is necessary.

6. Pleural effusion: Although the pleural effusion appears improved on the chest X-ray, it is essential to continue monitoring for any signs of fluid accumulation.

7. Delirium/confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which needs to be managed with appropriate medications"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yom gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and
   pseudocyst, hypoxic respiratory failure.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- severe, necrotic, complicated with pseudocysts.
   Maintain percutaneous drain of one pseudocyst.  Maintain OGT to
   suction.  General Surgery following.
   DELERIUM -- drug related, and ICU.  Monitor for clearing of medications
   and for evidence for withdrawal.
   FEVER
 attributed to intraabdominal inflammation.  Need to monitor
   closely for new infection:  line-related, hepatobiliary, infected
   pancreatic pseudocyst.
   BACTEREMIA -- coagulase negative, likely line related.  Central line
   d/c'd --> new lines in place.   Completed course of Vanco.
   DIARRHEA -- concern for C. diff --> check stool for C. diff toxin.
   ANEMIA -- persistent, likely in part to phlebotomy.  With most recent
   decline, will plan reimaging to assess for intraabdominal bleed (esp
   while receiving anticoagulation).
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- continue to optimize.  Fentanyl now off.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy.  Stable off
   CVVH.  Plan remove dialysis catheter.
   FLUIDS -- euvolemic, perhaps somewhat hypovolemic.  Monitor I/O.
   HYPOKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- continue TPN.  TF with post-pyloric (jejunal)
   tube --> tolerated.
   HIT+ -- continue argatroban.
   DVT -- line-related.  Continue anticoagulation.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE -- left side; attributed to acute
   pancreatitis.  Resolving.
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS -- Resolved.
   ACTIVITY -- PT consult.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and pseudocysts. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications including delirium, fever, bacteremia, anemia, renal failure, hypokalemia, and a pleural effusion. He also has a history of cholecystitis and is currently receiving nutritional support through TPN and a post-pyloric (jejunal) tube.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has severe necrotic pancreatitis with pseudocysts. This condition requires careful monitoring and management to prevent further complications.

2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing drug-related delirium, likely due to medications and ICU stay. It is important to monitor for clearing of medications and evidence of withdrawal.

3. Fever: The patient has a fever attributed to intraabdominal inflammation. Close monitoring is necessary to identify any new infections, such as line-related, hepatobiliary, or infected pancreatic pseudocyst.

4. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, likely caused by a central line infection. The central line has been discontinued, and the patient has completed a course of Vancomycin.

5. Diarrhea: There is concern for Clostridium difficile infection, so stool testing for C. diff toxin is recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yom gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and
   pseudocyst, hypoxic respiratory failure.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- severe, necrotic, complicated with pseudocysts.
   Maintain percutaneous drain of one pseudocyst.  Maintain OGT to
   suction.  General Surgery following.
   DELERIUM -- drug related, and ICU.  Monitor for clearing of medications
   and for evidence for withdrawal.
   FEVER
 attributed to intraabdominal inflammation.  Need to monitor
   closely for new infection:  line-related, hepatobiliary, infected
   pancreatic pseudocyst.
   BACTEREMIA -- coagulase negative, likely line related.  Central line
   d/c'd --> new lines in place.   Completed course of Vanco.
   DIARRHEA -- concern for C. diff --> check stool for C. diff toxin.
   ANEMIA -- persistent, likely in part to phlebotomy.  With most recent
   decline, will plan reimaging to assess for intraabdominal bleed (esp
   while receiving anticoagulation).
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- continue to optimize.  Fentanyl now off.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy.  Stable off
   CVVH.  Plan remove dialysis catheter.
   FLUIDS -- euvolemic, perhaps somewhat hypovolemic.  Monitor I/O.
   HYPOKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- continue TPN.  TF with post-pyloric (jejunal)
   tube --> tolerated.

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   -AMS:  Suspect delerium/drug effect with some small component of benzo
   withdrawl.  Would begin to taper methadone, taper ativan daily and
weather the storm
 from benzo withdrawl.  Would want to reset sleep
   wake cycle as severly off.
   - day/night orientation, constant redirection
   - PM standing Zyprexa for sleep
   - Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   Gram Positive Cocci  Bacteremia
 Patient with multiple long standing
   IV
s as a possible risk factor for GPC
s in his blood. Likely
   contributing to fever. (Coag-Negative Staph)
   - placed two peripheral 18G IV
   - Pulled central lines
   - started vancomycin, check through before 4^th dose
 5 day course
   .
   Gram Negative rods in sputum
 These started growing on the 22^nd, and
   occurred despite meropenem.  Gram negative rods that are known to be
   resitant to meropenem include AE Bacter, and Stenotrophomonas.  Likely
   contributing to fever.
   - Would call down to lab later today and see if we can get better
   speciation as there is no single [**Doctor Last Name **] for all three.
   - f/u urine legionella ag (-)
   - Woul hold off on empiric abx as would require broad coverage with
   varied side effects.
   .
   >  TACHYCARDIA-  Continues to spike fevers, there is some concern for
   abscess, fevers are likely multifactorial and represent both infectious
   and non-infectious, inflammatory responses. RUQ U/S negative for
   abscess.Tachycardia likely [**3-1**] fever, pain.  Withdrawal from benzo
   could also be contributing, and rate improved with increased versed.
   Will cont to follow pharm
s recommended weaning plan for versed and
   fentanyl.
   - attempt to taper benzos very gradually, with lorazepam, zyprexa prn
   post-extubation
   - cont to treat fever
   - f/u pan-culture data
   .
 PANCREATITIS, [**Name (NI) 11141**]  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  CT showed stable fluid
   collections. Ab distention improved with OGT to suction. Now tolerated
   TFs at goal. Moving bowels after lactulose.  CT scan showed only
   improvement yesterday.
   - will hold on pancreatic enzymes while delivering TFs
   - cont to pan-cx for fevers
   - peritoneal drain fluid with no cells or organisms, likely necrotic
   debris since no cells present
   - Would d/c meropenem at this point as new infectious sources have been
   isolated on meropenem.
   - TID Electrolytes
   - pain control with methadone liquid, dilaudid IV PRN;
   .
   > ANEMIA: Hct drop to 18 yesterday morning, up to 22.7 after two units,
   22.1 this AM.
   -  will check DIC, hemolysis labs negative so far
   -  q6h hematocrit today, HCT>21
   -  CT non-con A/P showed no source of bleeding.
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, now negative LOS but not at baseline weight.  Recnet
   trial off CVVH due to clotting off, and electrolytes increased.   Off
   CVVH, continues to improve
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - monitor UOP, TID lytes
   .
   >  Diarrhea- increased over past 24 hours.  Has received long course of
   Abx.  Guaiac (-), C. Diff (-)
   - stool studies
   .
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS-  On argatroban.
   Known significant clot burden in common femoral and IVC.  No indication
   for IVC filter since pt has alternate explanation for fevers and
   tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80
   .
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE- appears significantly improved on CXR
   - CVVH to address fluid overload
   .
 .H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS- Resolved.  Cont to trend LFTs.

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was found to have multiple long-standing IV lines as a possible risk factor for Gram-positive cocci bacteremia. The patient also had Gram-negative rods in his sputum, which were resistant to meropenem. 

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Tachycardia: The patient continues to spike fevers, and there is concern for abscess. The tachycardia is likely multifactorial and represents both infectious and non-infectious inflammatory responses. RUQ ultrasound was negative for abscess.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient might have initially decompensated into hemorrhage into pseudocyst versus distributive shock picture with systemic inflammation. Laboratory findings and CT scan showed stable fluid collections.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct dropped to 18 yesterday morning but improved to 22.7 after receiving two units of blood. The cause of anemia is still being investigated.
4. Renal failure: The patient likely experienced acute renal failure due to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). He was started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with improvement in electrolytes and creatinine levels.

   28yo M w/ gallstone pancreatitis c/b necrosis and pseudocyst presented
   with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Gram Positive Cocci  Bacteremia
 Patient with multiple long standing
   IV
s as a possible risk factor for GPC
s in his blood. Likely
   contributing to fever.
   - placed two peripheral 18G IV
   - Pulled central lines
   - started vancomycin, check through before 4^th dose
   .
   Gram Negative rods in sputum
 These started growing on the 22^nd, and
   occurred despite meropenem.  Gram negative rods that are known to be
   resitant to meropenem include AE Bacter, and Stenotrophomonas.  Likely
   contributing to fever.
   - Would call down to lab later today and see if we can get better
   speciation as there is no single [**Doctor Last Name **] for all three.
   - f/u urine legionella ag (-)
   - Woul hold off on empiric abx as would require broad coverage with
   varied side effects.
   .
   >  TACHYCARDIA-  Continues to spike fevers, there is some concern for
   abscess, fevers are likely multifactorial and represent both infectious
   and non-infectious, inflammatory responses. RUQ U/S negative for
   abscess.Tachycardia likely [**3-1**] fever, pain.  Withdrawal from benzo
   could also be contributing, and rate improved with increased versed.
   Will cont to follow pharm
s recommended weaning plan for versed and
   fentanyl.
   - attempt to taper benzos very gradually, with lorazepam, zyprexa prn
   post-extubation
   - cont to treat fever
   - f/u pan-culture data
   .
 PANCREATITIS, [**Name (NI) 11141**]  Pt might have initially decompensated [**3-1**]
   hemorrhage into pseudocyst vs. distributive shock picture with systemic
   inflammation. LFTS stable and normal.  CT showed stable fluid
   collections. Ab distention improved with OGT to suction. Now tolerated
   TFs at goal. Moving bowels after lactulose.  CT scan showed only
   improvement yesterday.
   - will hold on pancreatic enzymes while delivering TFs
   - cont to pan-cx for fevers
   - peritoneal drain fluid with no cells or organisms, likely necrotic
   debris since no cells present
   - Would d/c meropenem at this point as new infectious sources have been
   isolated on meropenem.
   - TID Electrolytes
   - pain control with methadone liquid, dilaudid IV PRN;
   .
   > ANEMIA: Hct drop to 18 yesterday morning, up to 22.7 after two units,
   22.1 this AM.
   -  will check DIC, hemolysis labs negative so far
   -  q6h hematocrit today, HCT>21
   -  CT non-con A/P showed no source of bleeding.
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- likely CIN. Started
   on CVVH with improvement in lytes and Cr. Currently tolerating fluid
   removal well, now negative LOS but not at baseline weight.  Recnet
   trial off CVVH due to clotting off, and electrolytes increased.   Off
   CVVH, continues to improve
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - monitor UOP, TID lytes
   .
   >  Diarrhea- increased over past 24 hours.  Has received long course of
   Abx.  Guaiac (-), C. Diff (-)
   - stool studies
   .
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH THROMBOSIS-  On argatroban.
   Known significant clot burden in common femoral and IVC.  No indication
   for IVC filter since pt has alternate explanation for fevers and
   tachycardia (bacteremia). PTT at goal
   -  will cont argatroban and monitor PTT, goal 60-80
   .
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE- appears significantly improved on CXR
   - CVVH to address fluid overload
   .
 .H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS- Resolved.  Cont to trend LFTs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been in the ICU for an extended period and has multiple long-standing IV lines, which may have contributed to Gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia. The patient also has Gram-negative rods in his sputum, which have been resistant to meropenem. His fever is likely multifactorial and represents both infectious and non-infectious inflammatory responses. 

The patient's tachycardia is likely due to fever, pain, and potential withdrawal from benzodiazepines. His pancreatitis has led to the development of a pseudocyst, and he may have hemorrhaged into it or experienced distributive shock. Laboratory findings show stable liver function tests, and imaging shows improvement in fluid collections. 

The patient has acute renal failure, likely caused by contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). He has been started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with improvement in electrolytes and creatinine. 

The patient's diarrhea has increased over the past 24 hours, but stool studies have been negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff). He is on argatroban for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis, and his PTT is at goal. 

The patient also has an acute pleural effusion, which appears significantly improved on chest"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He has hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently intubated. The patient's delirium is believed to be drug-related and related to ICU stay. He also has a fever attributed to intraabdominal inflammation. There is evidence of bacteremia, likely line-related, which has been treated with antibiotics. The patient is experiencing diarrhea, and there is concern for Clostridium difficile infection. He has persistent anemia, possibly due to phlebotomy, and imaging will be planned to assess for intraabdominal bleed. The patient's pain management is being optimized, and he is no longer receiving fentanyl. He has renal failure attributed to contrast dye nephropathy and is stable off continuous veno-venous hemofiltration. The plan is to remove the dialysis catheter. The patient's fluid status is euvolemic to hypovolemic, and his electrolytes are being monitored. Nutritional support continues with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and tube feeding through a post-pyloric (jejunal) tube. The patient has a diagnosis of HIT+ (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) and is receiving argatroban. He also has a line-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and continues on anticoagulation. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and pseudocysts. He has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include severe, necrotic acute pancreatitis with pseudocysts, delirium (drug-related and ICU-related), fever attributed to intraabdominal inflammation, bacteremia likely line-related, diarrhea with concerns for Clostridium difficile infection, anemia likely due to phlebotomy, pain management issues, renal failure attributed to IV contrast dye nephropathy, euvolemic to hypovolemic fluids, hypokalemia, nutritional support via total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with post-pyloric (jejunal) tube feeding, HIT+ status requiring argatroban, line-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and an acute pleural effusion on the left side attributed to acute pancreatitis. Other medical history includes resolved cholecystitis and cholelithiasis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his compromised immune system, prolonged ICU stay, and presence of indwelling lines and tubes. There is a concern for line-related infections, hepatobiliary infections, and infected pancreatic pseudocysts.

2. Delirium: The patient is currently experiencing delirium, which may be caused by drug-related"

Summary:
- The patient is a 28-year-old male with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation.
- He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was suspected to have delirium or drug-induced effects with some small component of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
- The patient has multiple long-standing IV lines as a possible risk factor for Gram-positive cocci bacteremia.
- Gram-negative rods were found in the sputum, which are known to be resistant to meropenem.
- The patient continues to spike fevers, and there is concern for abscess formation or other infectious causes.
- Tachycardia is likely related to fever, pain, and possible distributive shock.
- The patient may have initially decompensated due to hemorrhage into a pseudocyst or distributive shock with systemic inflammation.
- Pancreatitis is stable with normal LFTs and improvement in fluid collections on CT scan.
- The patient is tolerating tube feeds at goal and moving bowels after lactulose.
- Peritoneal drain fluid showed no cells or organisms, suggesting necrotic debris.
- The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased but has improved after receiving blood transfusions.
- Acute renal failure is suspected to be caused by contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).

He presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and is suspected to have delirium or drug effect with some small component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. The patient has multiple long-standing IV lines, which may have contributed to Gram-positive cocci bacteremia. He also has Gram-negative rods in his sputum, resistant to meropenem. The patient's fever is likely multifactorial and represents both infectious and non-infectious inflammatory responses.

Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient continues to have spikes in temperature and tachycardia, which could be due to abscess, fever, or pain. The RUQ ultrasound was negative for abscess, and the tachycardia is likely related to fever and pain.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient may have initially decompensated with hemorrhage into the pseudocyst or distributive shock picture with systemic inflammation. Laboratory findings are stable and normal, and the CT scan showed stable fluid collections. Abdominal distention improved with OGT to suction, and the patient is now tolerating tube feedings at goal. Moving bowels after lactulose, and the CT scan showed improvement yesterday.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct dropped to 18 yesterday morning but increased to 22.7 after receiving"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yom gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and
   pseudocyst, hypoxic respiratory failure.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- severe, necrotic, complicated with pseudocysts.
   Maintain percutaneous drain of one pseudocyst.  Maintain OGT to
   suction.  General Surgery following.
   DELERIUM -- drug related, and ICU.  Much improved.
   FEVER
 attributed to intraabdominal inflammation.  Need to monitor
   closely for new infection:  line-related, hepatobiliary, infected
   pancreatic pseudocyst.
   BACTEREMIA -- coagulase negative, likely line related.  Central lines
   d/c'd.   Completed course of Vanco.
   DIARRHEA -- concern for C. diff --> check stool for C. diff toxin.
   ANEMIA -- persistent, likely in part to phlebotomy.  With most recent
   decline, will plan reimaging to assess for intraabdominal bleed (esp
   while receiving anticoagulation).
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- continue to optimize.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy.  Stable off
   CVVH.  Plan remove dialysis catheter.
   FLUIDS -- euvolemic, perhaps somewhat hypovolemic.  Monitor I/O.
   HYPOKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- continue TPN.  TF with post-pyloric (jejunal)
   tube --> tolerated.
   HIT+ -- continue argatroban.
   DVT -- line-related.  Continue anticoagulation.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE -- left side; attributed to acute
   pancreatitis.  Resolving.
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS -- Resolved.
   ACTIVITY -- PT consult.  Up in chair.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and pseudocysts. He also has hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is currently being managed in the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation. He has multiple medical complications, including delirium, fever, bacteremia, diarrhea, anemia, renal failure, fluids/electrolyte imbalance, and hypoalbuminemia. He has been diagnosed with HIT+ and DVT, and is receiving anticoagulation therapy with argatroban. The patient has a pleural effusion due to acute pancreatitis, which is resolving. He has a history of cholecystitis but it has resolved. The patient's nutritional support includes TPN and a post-pyloric (jejunal) tube.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for new infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay. Close monitoring is needed for signs of line-related infections, hepatobiliary infections, and infected pancreatic pseudocysts.
2. Pancreatitis complications: The patient's pancreatitis has progressed to necrosis and pseudocysts. Complications such as abscess formation, fistula, or pancreatic ductal obstruction may occur.
3. Delirium: The patient is still experiencing delirium, which can be attributed to drug-related causes and ICU stay. It is important to optimize pain management and consider other contributing"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yom gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and
   pseudocyst, hypoxic respiratory failure.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- severe, necrotic, complicated with pseudocysts.
   Maintain percutaneous drain of one pseudocyst.  Maintain OGT to
   suction.  General Surgery following.
   DELERIUM -- drug related, and ICU.  Monitor for clearing of medications
   and for evidence for withdrawal.
   FEVER
 attributed to intraabdominal inflammation.  Need to monitor
   closely for new infection:  line-related, hepatobiliary, infected
   pancreatic pseudocyst.
   BACTEREMIA -- coagulase negative, likely line related.  Central line
   d/c'd --> new lines in place.   Completed course of Vanco.
   DIARRHEA -- concern for C. diff --> check stool for C. diff toxin.
   ANEMIA -- persistent, likely in part to phlebotomy.  With most recent
   decline, will plan reimaging to assess for intraabdominal bleed (esp
   while receiving anticoagulation).
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- continue to optimize.  Fentanyl now off.
   RENAL FAILURE -- attributed to iv contrast dye nephropathy.  Stable off
   CVVH.  Plan remove dialysis catheter.
   FLUIDS -- euvolemic, perhaps somewhat hypovolemic.  Monitor I/O.
   HYPOKALEMIA
 replete to K> 4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- continue TPN.  TF with post-pyloric (jejunal)
   tube --> tolerated.
   HIT+ -- continue argatroban.
   DVT -- line-related.  Continue anticoagulation.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE -- left side; attributed to acute
   pancreatitis.  Resolving.
   h/o CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS -- Resolved.
   ACTIVITY -- PT consult.  Up in chair.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, now complicated by necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure. He has severe acute pancreatitis that is necrotic and complicated with pseudocysts. A percutaneous drain has been maintained for one pseudocyst, and an OGT tube is in place for suction. General surgery will be following up on his case.

The patient has also been experiencing delirium, which is believed to be drug-related and possibly due to ICU stay. Monitoring for clearing of medications and evidence of withdrawal is ongoing.

He has had fever attributed to intraabdominal inflammation. Close monitoring is needed for new infection, including line-related, hepatobiliary, or infected pancreatic pseudocyst.

The patient has bacteremia caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus, likely line-related. The central line has been discontinued, and new lines have been placed. He has completed a course of vancomycin.

He is also experiencing diarrhea, and there is concern for Clostridium difficile infection. Stool testing for C. difficile toxin will be conducted.

The patient has persistent anemia, likely due in part to phlebotomy. With the most recent decline, plans are being made to reassess with imaging to determine if there is intraabdominal bleeding, especially while receiving anticoagulation.

Pain management continues to be"
