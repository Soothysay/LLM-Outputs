","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, an 85-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, cholecystectomy, and ampullar stenosis, is currently in the ICU for cholangitis post stent placement. She has been diagnosed with GNR bacteremia, as indicated by positive blood cultures overnight. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/56 to 156/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on nasal cannula. 

Physical examination reveals jaundice and scleral icterus, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and supple neck without jugular venous distention or carotid bruits. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no masses or hepato-splenomegaly. Extremities show warm and well-perfused pulses, and there are no rashes or lesions on the skin.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, platelet count of 100 K/uL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 109 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 128/268, Alk Phos/T Bili: 76/3.4). Other lab values include PT/PTT/INR: 15.7/35.5/1.4, lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L, LDH: 202 IU/L, calcium: 7.3 mg/dL, magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL, and phosphate: 2.9 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment includes GNR bacteremia, cholangitis, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, hypoxic episode, GERD, pancreatic insufficiency, Parkinson's disease, and diverticulosis.

","The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a significant past medical history of hypertension, cholecystectomy, and ampullary stenosis. She is currently in the ICU with cholangitis following stent placement due to GNR bacteremia.

Assessment and plan:
1. GNR bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures for GNRs, likely from biliary infection. She is currently afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Blood culture speciation/sensitivities should be followed up, and she should continue on Zosyn and Flagyl, with surveillance blood cultures for now. Her WBC and fever curve should be trended, and Tylenol should be given as needed for fever.
2. Cholangitis: The patient had RUQ pain and positive Boas' sign, indicating cholangitis. She underwent ERCP and drainage with a plastic stent in place. Blood cultures overnight returned positive for GNRs. Her lactate level is normal at 1.6, and she remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile overnight. Her LFTs are significantly improved this morning. Her UOP dropped off early this morning but improved this morning. Follow-up blood culture speciation/sensitivities should be done, and she should continue on Zosyn 4.5mg q8hrs (with ID approval) and Flagyl. Trend her LFTs, and hold ASA for possible sphincterotomy"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old woman with significant medical history, including hypertension, cholecystectomy, and ampullar stenosis. She is currently admitted with cholangitis secondary to stent placement and bacteremia caused by Gram-Negative Rods (GNR). 

The patient has shown improvement overnight, as she remains hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Her lactate level is within normal range at 1.6. Blood cultures have returned positive for GNRs, likely from a biliary infection. 

The plan includes following up with blood culture speciation/sensitivities, discontinuing Vancomycin and Flagyl, and continuing Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). Surveillance blood cultures will be done, along with trending white blood cell count and fever curve. Acetaminophen will be given as needed for fever.

Other assessments and plans include cholangitis, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, hypoxic episode, GERD, pancreatic insufficiency, Parkinson's disease, and diverticulosis. 

The patient's ICU care includes advanced diet, insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and appropriate prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   initial presentation with worsening abdominal pain with associated
   nausea and vomiting where she was found to have fever, elevated BILI,
   URQ pain and on CT patient had pneumobilia and then to ERCP for
   evaluation following administration of Unasyn.  Pus drained, stent
   placed and retained stone left given patient with instability of
   oxygenation during procedure.
   1) Sepsis--secondary to cholangitis-
   -Pt on
 Zosyn/Flagyl/Vanco
will move to Zosyn alone with GNR
s in place
   -Will have to pursue repeat procedure as guided by GI team for removal
   of stent and removal of stone
   -Return to po diet with clears if GI in agreement
   -IVF to be maintenance fluids for now as sepsis appears to be improving
   but we have maintained borderline urine output at this time.  IVF bolus
   at 500cc this morning
   -Follow LFT
s at this time and follow Lipase in the setting of modest

","The patient is an 85-year-old female who was admitted with cholangitis. She presented with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, elevated bilirubin levels, and right upper quadrant pain. A CT scan showed pneumobilia, and she underwent an ERCP procedure where pus was drained, a stent was placed, and a retained stone was left behind due to instability during the procedure.

The patient has sepsis secondary to cholangitis and is currently on antibiotics including Zosyn, Flagyl, and Vancomycin. She will be switched to Zosyn alone with gram-negative rods in place. A repeat procedure will be pursued by the GI team for the removal of the stent and removal of the stone. The patient is expected to return to a regular diet with clears if agreed upon by the GI team. IV fluids will be maintained for now, as sepsis appears to be improving but with borderline urine output. The patient's blood work will be followed closely, including liver function tests and lipase levels in the setting of modest epigastric discomfort.

In the ICU, the patient will receive nutrition support through IV fluids and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. She has multiple lines including a presep catheter. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with boots and stress ulcer prevention with PPI. VAP precautions will also be taken. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be transferred to the floor once her"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with significant past medical history of hypertension, chronic pancreatitis, cholecystectomy, and ampullary stenosis. She presented with cholangitis and was found to have GNR bacteremia. The patient underwent stent placement and is currently on Zosyn antibiotics. Her lactate levels are normal, and she remains hemodynamically stable. Other issues include leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, hypoxic episode, GERD, pancreatic insufficiency, Parkinson's disease, and diverticulosis. The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU, with plans for advancement of diet and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's GNR bacteremia and previous cholangitis, there is a risk of developing sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and lactate levels is essential.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient received a significant amount of IV fluids, which could potentially lead to fluid overload and AKI. Monitoring urine output and adjusting fluid administration is crucial.
3. Hepatitis: Although the patient's hepatitis serologies are negative, it is important to monitor liver function tests regularly due to her history of chronic pancreatitis and recent cholangitis.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a significant medical history of hypertension, chronic pancreatitis, cholecystectomy, and ampullary stenosis. She was admitted with cholangitis and placed on antibiotics. Blood cultures showed growth of gram-negative rods (GNR), likely from a biliary infection. She underwent an ERCP procedure and had a plastic stent placed. Her lactate level is normal, and she remains hemodynamically stable and afebrile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GNR bacteremia: The patient has a confirmed GNR bacteremia, likely originating from a biliary infection. She is currently being treated with antibiotics, but close monitoring and follow-up blood cultures are necessary to ensure appropriate treatment.
2. Cholangitis: The patient had signs of cholangitis, including RUQ pain and positive Boas' sign, which resolved after an ERCP procedure and stent placement. Continued monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is essential to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient initially had leukocytosis, which resolved. However, since she has a confirmed bacteremia, it is important to continue monitoring her white blood cell count.
4. Anemia: The patient experienced a drop in hematocrit (Hct) overnight on admission but stabilized at 30.2. This could be due to dilutional effects from receiving continuous intravenous fluids."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis admitted to the ICU with cholangitis and GNR bacteremia. A stent has been placed, and the patient is currently receiving Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) for antibiotic coverage. The patient also has respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia, and a new right-sided pleural effusion on imaging. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 153/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. Imaging reveals a moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis is currently being managed with stent placement and antibiotic therapy. However, there is a risk of persistent or recurrent cholangitis if the underlying cause, such as biliary stones, is not addressed.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to fluid overload, as indicated by the trace lower extremity edema and the need for diuretic therapy. Close monitoring of fluid balance and further optimization of respiratory support may be necessary.

3. Thrombocyt"
