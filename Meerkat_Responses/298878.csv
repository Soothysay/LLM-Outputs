   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with h/o DM receiving no medical care over the past 2
   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion and likely PNA
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to large pleural
   effusion and pneumonia. Unclear chronicity, but per the ED notes, he
   has been having at least 1-3 weeks of SOB. Could be an underlying
   malignancy given the large size of the effusion which is complicated by
   post-obstructive pneumonia. Also, consider aspiration pneumonia with
   complicated parapneumonic effusion versus empyema. Also, consider heart
   failure given elevated BNP and bilateral ground glass opacities and
   recent history of ? orthopnea/PND.  Unclear history in terms of
   exposures, but also consider TB, but less likely.
   - IP versus radiology to mark site for diagnostic/therapeutic
   thoracentesis
   - Would cover for community acquired PNA and possible aspiration
   pneumonia with ceftriaxone/azithromycin/flagyl
   - Send pleural fluid for cell count, cytology, pH, LDH, protein,
   glucose, cytology, AFB
   - wean down FiO2
   - Give FFP and plan for [**Female First Name (un) **] in AM
   .
   # Pleural effusion: Per above, most likely malignancy versus infection
   versus heart failure, but also consider parapneumonic effusion,
   empyema.
   - get diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis
   - echocardiogram to evaluate EF
   .
   # Sepsis: On presentation, was mildly tachycardic, but not hypotensive.
   Does have elevated WBC, fever 101.8 and likely PNA.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - Send sputum culture
   - Keep MAP >65
   - ScVo2>70
   - wean off levophed
   - send [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   .
   # ARF: Most likely prerenal in the setting of sepsis.
   - continue IVF boluses as need to keep CVP > [**9-10**]
   - monitor creatinine and UOP
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver in the setting of hypotension
   and sepsis. Also, consider hepatitis, toxins, ETOH, right sided
   congestion from heart failure. First sample was a grossly hemolyzed
   sample, so needs to be resent.
   - check hep A, B and C serologies, and consider further work-up for
   autoimmune and other causung pending these resultes and trend of LFTs
   - Urine and serum tox screen
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: Unlikely to be ischemic given no evidence
   of ischemic ECG changes and flat MB with only mildly elevated troponin
   in the setting of renal failure. Does have low voltage, large heart,
   and elevated BNP
   - Check echocardiogram
   - trend cardiac enzymes x 3
   - start ASA after thoracentesis
   - Check ECG in AM
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation. Plts and HCT are WNL. Could be nutritional component.
   Unknown if he has underlying liver disease.
   - Repeat LFTs as last specimen was hemolyzed
   - Give vitamin k 5 mg SC x1
   - FFP prior to thoracentesis
   .
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash underlying this that may be related to his
   coagulopathy.
   - miconazole powder TID
   - monitor rash for signs of superinfection or spread
   .
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations: Appear to be chronic venous stasis ulcers,
   that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Wound care consult
   - monitor exam
   .
   # Possible head trauma: Has a healing wound on his nose with ecchymoses
   under right eye. He may have had a recent fall, although his family is
   not aware of this.
   - Check head CT given evidence of trauma and coagulopathy and recent
   change in mental status
   .
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.
   - monitor FS Q6H
   - RISS, but if persistently elevated FS>200 would consider string on
   insulin drip
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes
   .
   # PPX: Has elevated INR so will hold on SC heparin, pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # Contact: brother [**Name (NI) 3326**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3327**]. Oldest sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3328**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3329**] will be in tomorrow and most likely would be the one to
   make decisions per his brother, but he has no HCP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion and likely pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing at least 1-3 weeks of SOB and there is uncertainty about the chronicity of his symptoms. He has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to the large pleural effusion and pneumonia. Other potential causes include aspiration pneumonia with complicated parapneumonic effusion, empyema, or heart failure. The patient is also suspected to have sepsis, acute kidney injury (ARF), elevated liver function tests (LFTs), coagulopathy, pannus rash, bilateral lower extremity ulcerations, and possible head trauma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised due to the large pleural effusion and pneumonia. Immediate intervention is necessary to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection including fever, elevated white blood cell count, and suspected pneumonia. Prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics is essential to prevent further deterioration.
3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria. Close monitoring of fluid balance and renal function is required. Fluid administration should be cautious to maintain adequate perfusion.
4. Elevated liver function"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with h/o DM receiving no medical care over the past 2
   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion and likely PNA.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to combination of
   parapneumonic vs malignant vs CHF-related effusion.
   - Correct INR to <1.8 and then page Pulm IP fellow.  4 units FFP
   ordered.
   - Continue azithro and ceftriaxone, d/c flagyl as unlikely to be
   aneorobic source.
   - Send pleural fluid for cell count, cytology, pH, LDH, protein,
   glucose, cytology, AFB
   - wean down FiO2
   .
   # Pleural effusion: Per above, most likely malignancy versus infection
   versus heart failure, but also consider parapneumonic effusion,
   empyema.
   - get diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis
   - echocardiogram today to eval for CHF and est EF.
   .
   # Sepsis:
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - Sputum culture today or consider [**Last Name (un) 1340**] and BAL.
   - Cosyntropin stim test results pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes who presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion and likely pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, acute kidney injury, elevated liver function tests, coagulopathy, pannus rash, bilateral lower extremity ulcerations, possible head trauma, and uncontrolled diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2) and respiratory rate indicate a compromised respiratory system. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential organ damage.

2. Sepsis: The patient shows signs of systemic infection with elevated white blood cell count, fever, and positive cultures. If left untreated, sepsis can progress to septic shock, organ failure, and death.

3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest impaired renal function. ARF can be caused by various factors such as dehydration, medication toxicity, or sepsis. If not addressed, it may lead to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.

4. Elevated liver function tests: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels indicate liver dysfunction. This can be due to multiple factors including shock, infection, medication toxicity, or underlying liver disease. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with h/o DM receiving no medical care over the past 2
   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion and likely PNA.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to combination of
   parapneumonic vs malignant vs CHF-related effusion.
   - Correct INR to <1.8 and then page Pulm IP fellow.  4 units FFP
   ordered.
   - Continue azithro and ceftriaxone, d/c flagyl as unlikely to be
   aneorobic source.
   - Send pleural fluid for cell count, cytology, pH, LDH, protein,
   glucose, cytology, AFB
   - wean down FiO2
   .
   # Pleural effusion: Per above, most likely malignancy versus infection
   versus heart failure, but also consider parapneumonic effusion,
   empyema.
   - get diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis
   - echocardiogram today to eval for CHF and est EF.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented with one week of shortness of breath and was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion. The patient is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, elevated cardiac enzymes, coagulopathy, pannus rash, bilateral lower extremity ulcerations, possible head trauma, and poorly controlled diabetes.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 94/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and unable to communicate review of systems.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. The ABG results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 184, indicating some improvement but still requires further monitoring and adjustment of oxygenation support.

2. Sepsis: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (azithromycin and ceftriaxone), and blood cultures have been obtained. The elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels suggest ongoing infection and systemic inflammatory response.

3. Acute renal failure:"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   1.  Hypercapneic and hypoxic respiratory failure without known prior
   lung disease.  Large right layering pleural effusion with compression
   atelectasis vs. pneumonia underlying fluid.  Given fever and elevated
   WBC concerned about underlying infection with parapneumonic effusion.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have some component of CHF given cardiomegaly/underlying diabetes
   at risk for silent ischemia, also given low albumin and likely
   malnutrition also component of low oncotic pressure.  Risk for
   aspiration given reported mental status changes.  Cover broadly for
   community acquired organisms.  Wean Fi02 to maintain Sa02 > 93%.  Send
   sputum for gram stain/C & S if available.   Also concerned about
   possible underlying malignancy.
   Team spoke with IP service, plan for FFP and diagnostic/therapeutic
   thorocentesis today.
   2.  Hypotension:  Only declared itself once intubated/sedated
   suggesting intravascular volume depletion. Volume resusitation, off
   pressors
   3.  Acute renal failure without knowledge of baseline.  Is a chronic
   diabetic.  Likley prerenal component given intravascular depletion.  IV
   fluids.  Urine electrolytes.
   4.  Transaminitis:  Could be related to right sided congestion vs.
   shock liver albeit latter doesn't seem likely given only hypotensive as
   above after intubation.  Denies alcohol.  Also has coagulopathy.  Liver
   doesn't appear cirrhotic/fatty infiltrated/any mass on CT.  Need
   hepatitis serologies.  Nutritional component to coagulopathy - will
   give vitamin K and trend.  [**Month (only) 60**] get worse on broad spectrum abx.
   Check DIC panel albeit platelet count normal, seems unlikely.
   5.  Diabetes: NPO overnight, SSRI.
   6. Cardiac: Large heart on imaging.  Given diabetes concerned about
   possible underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy.  No evidence of acute
   ischemia albeit cycle enzymes to be sure trending downward.  Echo in
   am.  Can't assess JVD given neck line.  CVP 11-16.  Monitor notable for
   occasional PVC, once 6-beat run VT.  K/Mg in normal range. Will repeat.
   Not hypoxic or acidotic.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and confusion. He has bilateral effusions, with the right effusion being larger. The patient was agitated during the CT scan and subsequently intubated due to hypotension. 

The patient's medical history includes uncontrolled diabetes, no medication for two years, and a quit date for smoking 20 years ago. There is no known history of ethanol abuse. 

On admission, the patient received invasive ventilation, a presep catheter, and an arterial line. He was also administered antibiotics (azithromycin and metronidazole) and received Fentanyl and midazolam infusions for pain and sedation, respectively. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/50 to 92/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The patient has elevated coagulation levels and was given vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma. His review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of confusion and shortness of breath. 

Flowsheet data shows the patient's fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and respiratory rate of 16"

   A/P: 68 yo male with h/o DM receiving no medical care over the past 2
   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now presenting
   with thrombocytopenia of unknown origin.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - Continue azithro and ceftriaxone
   - wean down FiO2
   -Check vasculitis labs
   # Sepsis:
   - f/u blood Cx
   -Requiring pressors -- check vasculitis labs
   - Cosyntropin stim test results pending.
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation. Possible vitamin k defiency and/or liver disease..
   - Continue to follow coags
   -Continue to follow plt count
   # ARF: Most likely prerenal in the setting of sepsis.
   - continue IVF boluses as need to keep CVP > [**9-10**]
   - monitor creatinine and UOP
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations: Appear to be chronic venous stasis ulcers,
   that do not appear to be actively infected
   - F/U skin cultures as per derm consult
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver in the setting of hypotension
   and sepsis. Also, consider hepatitis, toxins, ETOH, right sided
   congestion from heart failure. First sample was a grossly hemolyzed
   sample, so needs to be resent.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   .
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: Unlikely to be ischemic given no evidence
   of ischemic ECG changes and flat MB with only mildly elevated troponin
   in the setting of renal failure. Does have low voltage, large heart,
   and elevated BNP
   - Unlikely to be ACS given flat MB and EKG changes.
   .
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash underlying this that may be related to his
   coagulopathy.
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   .
   .
   # Possible head trauma: Has a healing wound on his nose with ecchymoses
   under right eye. He may have had a recent fall, although his family is
   not aware of this.
   - CTH for r/o intracranial bleed.  Will check for final read.
   .
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.
   - monitor FS Q6H
   - RISS, but if persistently elevated FS>200 would consider string on
   insulin drip
   .
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   .
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt count so will hold on SC
   heparin, pneumoboots, PPI
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with h/o DM receiving no medical care over the past 2
   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now presenting
   with thrombocytopenia of unknown origin.
   #Shock
   -Titrate down levaphed, start Dopamine trial.
   -Administer fluid boluses if necessary
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - Continue azithro and ceftriaxone
   - wean down FiO2 to 40%, decrease sedation
   -Check vasculitis labs
   # Sepsis:
   - f/u blood Cx
   -Requiring pressors -- check vasculitis labs
   - Cosyntropin stim test results pending.
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue to follow coags
   -Continue to follow plt count
   -Monitor CBC q8H
   # Oliguria
   - monitor creatinine and UOP
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - F/U skin cultures as per derm consult
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Also, consider hepatitis, toxins.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hep serologies were negative for infection
   # Hypotension with Hypokinetic heart
   -  Check EKG
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   .
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.
   - monitor FS Q6H
   - RISS, but if persistently elevated FS>200 would consider string on
   insulin drip
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt count so will hold on SC
   heparin, pneumoboots, PPI
   # Contact: brother [**Name (NI) 3326**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3327**]. Oldest sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3328**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus presenting with one week of shortness of breath. He was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient now presents with thrombocytopenia of unknown origin. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications including shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, coagulopathy, oliguria, elevated liver function tests, hypotension with hypokinetic heart, and pannus rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension and requires pressors, indicating possible shock. Titration of levaphed and initiation of dopamine trial have been ordered to manage this condition.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to sanguinous lung tissue. Continuous azithromycin and ceftriaxone administration, weaning down FiO2 to 40%, and decreasing sedation have been planned to address this complication.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and positive Gram stain of pleural fluid with polymorphonuclear leukocytes suggest sepsis. Follow-up blood cultures and vasculitis labs have been ordered.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.  Hypercapneic and hypoxic respiratory failure without known prior
   lung disease.  Large right layering pleural effusion with compression
   atelectasis vs. pneumonia underlying fluid.  Given fever and elevated
   WBC concerned about underlying infection with parapneumonic effusion.
   Cover broadly for community acquired organisms.  Wean Fi02 to maintain
   Sa02 > 93. Remain concerned about possible underlying malignancy.
   Effusion is exudate with high pH - will not put in chest tube
   2. CHF given cardiomegaly/underlying diabetes at risk for silent
   ischemia and ECHO findings of mural thrombus low EF. Check enzymes,
   EKG. Needs to keep even or diurese today as BP allows
   3. Thrombocytopenia - ? DIC also concerned about vasculitis, ANCA,
   Anti-GBM, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], Antiphospholipid AB pending
   4.  Hypotension:  Now on pressors, concerned about new MI; possible
   sepsis
   5.  Acute renal failure without knowledge of baseline.  Is a chronic
   diabetic.  Likley prerenal component given intravascular depletion.  IV
   fluids.  Urine electrolytes.
   6. Transaminitis:  Could be related to right sided congestion vs. shock
   liver .  Denies alcohol.  Also has coagulopathy.  hepatitis serologies

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. They have undergone several procedures, including thoracentesis, bronchoscopy, and trans-thoracic echo. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and an elevated temperature. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure of 14 mmHg and a cardiac output of 5.1 L/min. Fluid balance shows an input of 4,918 mL and an output of 2,066 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's respiratory support includes CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 48 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 308.

Physical examination reveals obesity, bilateral radial and digital pulses, symmetric chest expansion with resonant percussion notes, and rhonchorous breath sounds. The patient is sedated and responds to noxious stimuli, with non-purposeful movements. Neurologic assessment is impaired due to sedation.

Laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia with platelet counts ranging from 81 to 93 K/uL. Other lab findings include elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with h/o DM receiving no medical care over the past 2
   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now pressor and
   vent dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and
   coagulopathic.  Differential includes combination of sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.
   #Shock - Wide differential includes septic, cardiogenic, or other form
   of distributive shock.
   - Currently on neo at 0.03 mcg.  Consider restarting levophed and
   continuing to titrate down neo.
   - Administer fluid boluses if necessary
   - Continue to monitor CVP and SVO2.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx pending
   - Send fungal cx
   - continue ceftriaxone and azithro
   - consider adding fungal coverage or additional gram positive coverage
   for beta streptococcus group G
    - Per cards, very unlikely to be cardiogenic shock and much more
   likely to be distributive shock.  Patient tolerated neo overnight,
   which substantiates cardiogenic shock as a less likely etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - wean down FiO2 to X%, decrease sedation.
   - Last ABG 7.39/42/83
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.  Less likely to be DIC given stable plt count,
   although consider ordering AT III level.
   - Continue to follow coags
   - Continue to follow plt count
   - Monitor CBC q8H
   - continue to follow plt, this AM 87
   # Oliguria
   - monitor creatinine and UOP
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Fluid challenge during day
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G
   - Given reports of strep group G sepsis in diabetic patients, consider
   additional gram + coverage.
   -
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs have been stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # Hypotension with Hypokinetic heart
   -  Per cardiology, patient has dead heart.
    # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.  Serum glucose
   ranging between 202-266.
   - monitor FS Q6H and ISS.
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt count so will hold on SC
   heparin.  Pneumoboots, PPI
    # Contact: brother [**Name (NI) 3326**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3327**]. Oldest sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3328**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3329**] will be in tomorrow and most likely would be the one to

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with h/o DM receiving no medical care over the past 2
   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now pressor and
   vent dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and
   coagulopathic.  Differential includes combination of sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.
   #Shock - Wide differential includes septic, cardiogenic, or other form
   of distributive shock.
   - Currently on neo at 0.03 mcg.  Will continue and attempt to titrate
   down.
   - Patient may be volume overloaded (CVP 18) and off his starling curve,
   diurese with lasix 20 mg IV.
   - Continue to monitor CVP.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx pending
   - Send fungal cx
   - continue ceftriaxone and azithro
    - Per cards, very unlikely to be cardiogenic shock and much more
   likely to be distributive shock.  Patient tolerated neo overnight,
   which substantiates cardiogenic shock as a less likely etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - wean down FiO2 to 30%.
   - Last ABG 7.39/42/83
   # Nonsustained VT
 Most likely etiology is pressor support.  Unlikely
   to be left IJ.  Will continue to monitor, but will need to have code
   status discussion with family.
   # Sedation: Attempted to wean yesterday and patient became agitated.
   Will add haldol Q4H prn and recheck EKG in the afternoon.
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.  Less likely to be DIC given stable plt count,
   although consider ordering AT III level.
   - Continue to follow coags
   - Continue to follow plt count
   - continue to follow plt, this AM 87
   # Oliguria
   - monitor creatinine and UOP
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Urine lytes pending
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G
   - Given reports of strep group G sepsis in diabetic patients, consider
   additional gram + coverage.
   - Awaiting ACL Ab and LAC results
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs have been stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # Hypotension with Hypokinetic heart
   -  Per cardiology, patient had CO of about 5 prior to his
   hospitalization.  Current hemodynamic status unlikely to be due to
   cardiogenic shock primarily.
    # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.  Serum glucose
   ranging between 202-266.
   - Switch to insuling drip and continu to monitor serum glucose with
   accuchecks.
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt counts.  Discussed with team
   and feel that currently should not anticoagulate for DVT prophylaxis.
   SCDs also not warranted secondary to patient
s leg ulcers.  PPI.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes who presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). He is currently on mechanical ventilation and vasoactive medications for hemodynamic support. The patient has thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and evidence of coagulopathy. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's sanguinous lung tissue may lead to ongoing hypoxia and respiratory failure.
2. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced an episode of nonsustained VT, which may be related to his underlying condition or the use of vasoactive medications.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT and PTT and INR, indicating a bleeding risk. This could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or other causes.
4. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is low, indicating potential kidney dysfunction.
5. Bilateral lower extremity ulcerations: The patient has chronic venous stasis ulcers on his legs, which may be prone to infection.
6. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient has stable transaminitis, which"

   - Weakly positive [**Doctor First Name 1205**] titer at 1:40, ANCA NEGative.
   - Lower extremity tissue from biopsy prelim shows beta strep group G.
   - Failed trial of DOPA due to tachycardia and hypoxia. Is back on
   Levophed with dose being tapered down.
   -Cards consult feels that he is NOT in cardiogenic shock and favors
   distributive shock. Asked for ferritin draw as hemochromatosis could
   account for cadiomyopathy and elevated LFTs. Pt had CK-MB of 3 and
   troponin of 0.04. Also had shifting EKG access resulting from changes
   due to large volume thoracentesis (either mechanical or electrical).
   -Was off vasoactive meds from 1600 until ~2300. Had tachycardia with

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with h/o DM receiving no medical care over the past 2
   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now pressor and
   vent dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and
   coagulopathic.  Differential includes combination of sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.
   #Shock - Wide differential includes septic, cardiogenic, or other form
   of distributive shock.
   - Currently on neo at 0.03 mcg.  Consider restarting levophed and
   continuing to titrate down neo.
   - Administer fluid boluses if necessary
   - Continue to monitor CVP and SVO2.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx pending
   - Send fungal cx
   - continue ceftriaxone and azithro
   - consider adding fungal coverage or additional gram positive coverage
   for beta streptococcus group G
    - Per cards, very unlikely to be cardiogenic shock and much more
   likely to be distributive shock.  Patient tolerated neo overnight,
   which substantiates cardiogenic shock as a less likely etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - wean down FiO2 to X%, decrease sedation.
   - Last ABG 7.39/42/83
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.  Less likely to be DIC given stable plt count,
   although consider ordering AT III level.
   - Continue to follow coags
   - Continue to follow plt count
   - Monitor CBC q8H
   - continue to follow plt, this AM 87
   # Oliguria
   - monitor creatinine and UOP
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Fluid challenge during day
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G
   - Given reports of strep group G sepsis in diabetic patients, consider
   additional gram + coverage.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes who presented with one week of shortness of breath. He was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient is now dependent on pressors and mechanical ventilation, with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and coagulopathy. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's sanguinous lung tissue may be contributing to his hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT and PTT levels, indicating a possible coagulopathy. However, his platelet count is stable.
3. Oliguria: The patient has been oliguric, with a urine output of 8-20 cc/hr. This could indicate renal dysfunction.
4. Bilateral lower extremity ulcerations and nasal lesion: These appear to be chronic venous stasis ulcers, but there is a concern for possible infection due to the presence of beta streptococcus group G.
5. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient has stable transaminitis, likely due to ""shock liver"" or congestive hepatopathy.
6. Hypotension with hypokinetic heart: Cardiology believes the patient has a"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with h/o DM receiving no medical care over the past 2
   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now pressor and
   vent dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and
   coagulopathic.  Differential includes combination of sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.
   #Shock - Wide differential includes septic, cardiogenic, or other form
   of distributive shock.
   - Currently on neo at 0.03 mcg.  Consider restarting levophed and
   continuing to titrate down neo.
   - Administer fluid boluses if necessary
   - Continue to monitor CVP and SVO2.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx pending
   - Send fungal cx
   - continue ceftriaxone and azithro
   - consider adding fungal coverage or additional gram positive coverage
   for beta streptococcus group G
    - Per cards, very unlikely to be cardiogenic shock and much more
   likely to be distributive shock.  Patient tolerated neo overnight,
   which substantiates cardiogenic shock as a less likely etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - wean down FiO2 to X%, decrease sedation.
   - Last ABG 7.39/42/83
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.  Less likely to be DIC given stable plt count,
   although consider ordering AT III level.
   - Continue to follow coags
   - Continue to follow plt count
   - Monitor CBC q8H
   - continue to follow plt, this AM 87
   # Oliguria
   - monitor creatinine and UOP
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Fluid challenge during day
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G
   - Given reports of strep group G sepsis in diabetic patients, consider
   additional gram + coverage.
   - Awaiting ACL Ab and LAC results
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs have been stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # Hypotension with Hypokinetic heart
   -  Per cardiology, patient has dead heart.
    # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.  Serum glucose
   ranging between 202-266.
   - monitor FS Q6H and ISS.
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt count so will hold on SC
   heparin.  Pneumoboots, PPI
    # Contact: brother [**Name (NI) 3326**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3327**]. Oldest sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3328**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3329**] will be in tomorrow and most likely would be the one to

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented with one week of shortness of breath. He was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient is currently pressor and ventilator dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and coagulopathy. The differential includes sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock - The patient is currently on neo (norepinephrine) at 0.03 mcg and may need to restart levophed and continue titrating down neo. Fluid boluses may be necessary, and monitoring CVP and SVO2 is important.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure - The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure is likely secondary to sanguinous lung tissue. Weaning down FiO2 and decreasing sedation can be considered.
3. Coagulopathy - The patient has elevated PT and PTT with INR. He is not on any known anticoagulation, and less likely to be disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) given the stable platelet count. AT III level should be ordered, and coagulation should be monitored.
4. Oliguria - Monitoring creatinine and urine output is important. Renal dosing of medications should be continued, and a fluid challenge"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Weakly positive [**Doctor First Name 1205**] titer at 1:40, ANCA NEGative.
   - Lower extremity tissue from biopsy prelim shows beta strep group G.
   - Failed trial of DOPA due to tachycardia and hypoxia. Is back on
   Levophed with dose being tapered down.
   -Cards consult feels that he is NOT in cardiogenic shock and favors
   distributive shock. Asked for ferritin draw as hemochromatosis could
   account for cadiomyopathy and elevated LFTs. Pt had CK-MB of 3 and
   troponin of 0.04. Also had shifting EKG access resulting from changes
   due to large volume thoracentesis (either mechanical or electrical).
   -Was off vasoactive meds from 1600 until ~2300. Had tachycardia with

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with h/o DM receiving no medical care over the past 2
   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now pressor and
   vent dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and
   coagulopathic.  Differential includes combination of sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.
   #Shock - Wide differential includes septic, cardiogenic, or other form
   of distributive shock.
   - Currently on neo at 0.03 mcg.  Consider restarting levophed and
   continuing to titrate down neo.
   - Administer fluid boluses if necessary
   - Continue to monitor CVP and SVO2.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx pending
   - Send fungal cx
   - continue ceftriaxone and azithro
   - consider adding fungal coverage or additional gram positive coverage
   for beta streptococcus group G
    - Per cards, very unlikely to be cardiogenic shock and much more
   likely to be distributive shock.  Patient tolerated neo overnight,
   which substantiates cardiogenic shock as a less likely etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - wean down FiO2 to X%, decrease sedation.
   - Last ABG 7.39/42/83
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.  Less likely to be DIC given stable plt count,
   although consider ordering AT III level.
   - Continue to follow coags
   - Continue to follow plt count
   - Monitor CBC q8H
   - continue to follow plt, this AM 87
   # Oliguria
   - monitor creatinine and UOP
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Fluid challenge during day
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G
   - Given reports of strep group G sepsis in diabetic patients, consider
   additional gram + coverage.
   - Awaiting ACL Ab and LAC results
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs have been stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # Hypotension with Hypokinetic heart
   -  Per cardiology, patient has dead heart.
    # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.  Serum glucose
   ranging between 202-266.
   - monitor FS Q6H and ISS.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). He is now dependent on pressors and mechanical ventilation, with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and coagulopathy. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis. The patient's condition is complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure, oliguria, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), hypotension with hypokinetic heart, pannus rash, diabetes, and a negative pleural effusion culture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's sanguinous lung tissue may contribute to ongoing hypoxia, requiring careful monitoring and adjustment of FiO2 levels.
2. Oliguria: The patient's low urine output should be closely monitored, along with creatinine levels. Fluid challenges and renal dosing of medications may be necessary.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) indicate a bleeding tendency. Platelet count should be monitored, and consideration should be given to ordering antithrombin III levels.
4. Bilateral lower extremity (LE) ulcer"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and shock. 

1. Hypercapneic and hypoxic respiratory failure without known prior lung disease. The patient has a large right layering pleural effusion with compression atelectasis versus pneumonia underlying fluid. Given the fever and elevated white blood cell count, there is concern about an underlying infection with parapneumonic effusion. Broad coverage for community-acquired organisms is recommended, and FiO2 should be weaned to maintain SaO2 > 93. There is also concern about possible underlying malignancy.

2. Congestive heart failure (CHF) given cardiomegaly/underlying diabetes at risk for silent ischemia and ECHO findings of mural thrombus low EF. The patient needs to keep even or diurese today as BP allows.

3. Thrombocytopenia - possibly disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), also concerned about vasculitis, ANCA negative. Antiphospholipid AB pending.

4. Hypotension: Continuing on pressors, concerned about new myocardial infarction (MI); possible sepsis no clear source.

5. Acute renal failure without knowledge of baseline. Likely pre-renal component given intravascular depletion, creatinine stable but urine output diminishing.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with h/o DM receiving no medical care over the past 2
   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now pressor and
   vent dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and
   coagulopathic.  Differential includes combination of sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.
   #Shock - Wide differential includes septic, cardiogenic, or other form
   of distributive shock.
   - Currently on neo at 0.05 mcg.  Will continue and attempt to titrate
   down.
   - Diuresed 1900 cc at midnight but still was net positive.  CVP now
   [**7-6**], bolus 1000cc NSS.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G and staph aureus
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx pending
   - Send fungal cx
   - continue ceftriaxone and azithro
   - Started solumedrol 80mg Q8H for possible Sweet's Syndrome.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - Weaned down FiO2 to 30% for most of day, back up to 40% overnight.
   - Attempt to  wean again to 30%
   # Nonsustained VT
 Most likely etiology is pressor support.  Unlikely
   to be left IJ.  Will continue to monitor, but will need to have code
   status discussion with family.
   # Sedation: Patient was off sedation for much of yesterday. Added
   haldol Q4H prn, but did not receive any yesterday.  Will again attempt
   to take patient off sedation today.
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.  Less likely to be DIC given stable plt count,
   although consider ordering AT III level.
   - Continue to follow coags (INR 2.2)
   - Continue to follow plt count 79
   - continue to follow plt, this AM
   # Oliguria
   - UOP increased  yesterday 24h 1900cc.
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Continue to trend UOP and Cr.
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G and Staph aureus
   - LAC results negative, ACL still pending.
   - Derm suspects Sweet's, started solumedrol
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs have been stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # Hypotension with Hypokinetic heart
   -  Per cardiology, patient had CO of about 5 prior to his
   hospitalization.  Current hemodynamic status unlikely to be due to
   cardiogenic shock primarily.
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.
   - Switched to insuling drip and continu to monitor serum glucose with
   accuchecks. Serum glucose ranging between 90-249.
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt counts.  Discussed with team
   and feel that currently should not anticoagulate for DVT prophylaxis.
   SCDs also not warranted secondary to patient
s leg ulcers.  PPI.
   # Contact: brother [**Name (NI) 3326**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3327**]. Oldest sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3328**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3329**] will be in tomorrow and most likely would be the one to
   make decisions per his brother, but he has no HCP.
   # Code: Currently DNR.  Will continue to have discussion with family
   regarding treatment goals.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes who presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient is now pressor and ventilator-dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and coagulopathy. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, cardiogenic shock, vasculitis, and other forms of distributive shock.

The patient has been on neorubicin at 0.05 mcg and will continue to titrate down. He has received a total of 1900 cc of fluid but is still net positive. The central venous pressure (CVP) is currently 7-6, and he has been bolused with 1000 cc normal saline solution (NSS). Blood cultures are still pending, and the pleural culture is negative. A biopsy culture is pending, and fungal cultures have been sent. The patient is being continued on ceftriaxone and azithromycin, and he has started receiving solumedrol 80 mg IV every 8 hours for possible Sweet's Syndrome.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to sanguinous lung tissue. He has been weaned down to FiO2 of 30% for most of the day but has been increased back to 40% overnight."

   24 Hour Events:
   - Was weaned off pressors for most of yesterday and remained
   hemodynamically stable until around 0430 was placed back on 0.5 neo
   because he became hypotensive with CVP 6-7, bolused 500cc NS.
   - Was noted to have increased bloody secretions on ET suction, checking
   coags.
   - Was off sedation for most of the day but overnight was put back on
   his drip as patient was getting agitated.
   - Started on solumedrol 80mg IV Q8H.
   - After family meeting yesterday he is now DNR.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with h/o DM receiving no medical care over the past 2
   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now pressor and
   vent dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and
   coagulopathic.  Differential includes combination of sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.
   #Shock - Wide differential includes septic, cardiogenic, or other form
   of distributive shock.
   - Currently on neo at 0.4 mcg.  Will continue and attempt to titrate
   down.
   - Diuresed 1900 cc at midnight but still was net positive.  CVP now
   [**7-6**], bolus 1000cc NSS.  Continue to diurese with Lasix with goal of
   keeping net fluid balance neutral with optimal CVP.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G and staph aureus
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx pending
   - Send fungal cx
   - continue ceftriaxone and azithro
   - Started solumedrol 80mg Q8H for possible Sweet's Syndrome.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - Weaned down FiO2 to 30% for most of day, back up to 40% overnight.
   - Attempt to  wean again to 30%
   # Nonsustained VT
 Most likely etiology is pressor support.  Unlikely
   to be left IJ.
   # Sedation: Patient was off sedation for much of yesterday.  Received
   haldol this AM for agitation.  EKG ordered for this afternoon.
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.  Less likely to be DIC given stable plt count,
   although consider ordering AT III level.
   - Continue to follow coags (INR 2.2)
   - Continue to follow plt count 79
   # Oliguria
   - UOP increased  yesterday 24h 1900cc.
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Continue to trend UOP and Cr.
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G and Staph aureus
   - LAC results negative, ACL still pending.
   - Derm suspects Sweet's, started solumedrol
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs have been stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # Hypotension with Hypokinetic heart
   -  Per cardiology, patient had CO of about 5 prior to his
   hospitalization.  Current hemodynamic status unlikely to be due to
   cardiogenic shock primarily.
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.
   - Switched to insuling drip and continue to monitor serum glucose with
   accuchecks. Serum glucose ranging between 90-249.
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt counts.  Discussed with team
   and feel that currently should not anticoagulate for DVT prophylaxis.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage. He is currently pressor and ventilator-dependent, with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and coagulopathy. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock - Wide differential includes septic, cardiogenic, or other forms of distributive shock.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure - Likely secondary to sanguinous lung tissue.
3. Nonsustained VT - Most likely etiology is pressor support. Unlikely to be left IJ.
4. Sedation - Patient was off sedation for much of yesterday. Received haloperidol this AM for agitation. EKG ordered for this afternoon.
5. Coagulopathy - Elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known anticoagulation. Less likely to be disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) given stable platelet count, although consider ordering antithrombin III level.
6. Oliguria - UOP increased yesterday 24h 1900cc. Continue to renally dose meds. Continue to trend UOP and creatinine.
7. Bilateral lower extremity ulcerations"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Was weaned off pressors for most of yesterday and remained
   hemodynamically stable until around 0430 was placed back on 0.5 neo
   because he became hypotensive with CVP 6-7, bolused 500cc NS.
   - Was noted to have increased bloody secretions on ET suction, checking
   coags.
   - Was off sedation for most of the day but overnight was put back on
   his drip as patient was getting agitated.
   - Started on solumedrol 80mg IV Q8H.
   - After family meeting yesterday he is now DNR.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes who presented with one week of shortness of breath. He was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient is now dependent on vasopressors and mechanical ventilation, with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and coagulopathy. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure is likely secondary to sanguinous lung tissue.
2. Nonsustained VT: The most likely etiology of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia is pressor support. It is unlikely to be related to left internal jugular vein catheterization. Monitoring and discussion with the family regarding code status are necessary.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating a coagulopathy. He is not on any known anticoagulation, making disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) less likely. The platelet count is stable, although consideration should be given to ordering antithrombin III level. Coagulation parameters should continue to be monitored.
4. Oliguria: The patient's urine output"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with h/o DM receiving no medical care over the past 2
   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now pressor and
   vent dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and
   coagulopathic.  Differential includes combination of sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.
   #Shock - Wide differential includes septic, cardiogenic, or other form
   of distributive shock.
   - Currently on neo at 0.4 mcg.  Will continue and attempt to titrate
   down.
   - Diuresed 1900 cc at midnight but still was net positive.  CVP now
   [**7-6**], bolus 1000cc NSS.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G and staph aureus
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx pending
   - Send fungal cx
   - continue ceftriaxone and azithro
   - Started solumedrol 80mg Q8H for possible Sweet's Syndrome.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   - Weaned down FiO2 to 30% for most of day, back up to 40% overnight.
   - Attempt to  wean again to 30%
   # Nonsustained VT
 Most likely etiology is pressor support.  Unlikely
   to be left IJ.  Will continue to monitor, but will need to have code
   status discussion with family.
   # Sedation: Patient was off sedation for much of yesterday. Added
   haldol Q4H prn, received one dose last PM. Will  attempt to keep
   patient off sedating meds today.
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.  Less likely to be DIC given stable plt count,
   although consider ordering AT III level.
   - Continue to follow coags (INR 2.2)
   - Continue to follow plt count 79
   - continue to follow plt, this AM
   # Oliguria
   - UOP increased  yesterday 24h 1900cc.
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Continue to trend UOP and Cr.
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G and Staph aureus
   - LAC results negative, ACL still pending.
   - Derm suspects Sweet's, started solumedrol
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs have been stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # Hypotension with Hypokinetic heart
   -  Per cardiology, patient had CO of about 5 prior to his
   hospitalization.  Current hemodynamic status unlikely to be due to
   cardiogenic shock primarily.
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.
   - Switched to insuling drip and continu to monitor serum glucose with
   accuchecks. Serum glucose ranging between 90-249.
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt counts.  Discussed with team
   and feel that currently should not anticoagulate for DVT prophylaxis.
   SCDs also not warranted secondary to patient

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes who presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient is currently dependent on vasopressor support and mechanical ventilation, and has thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and coagulopathy. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, cardiogenic shock, vasculitis, and other forms of distributive shock.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (likely due to pressor support), coagulopathy with elevated PT and PTT, oliguria with increased urine output, chronic venous stasis ulcers on bilateral lower extremities and nasal lesion, elevated liver function tests (most likely due to congestive hepatopathy), hypotension with hypokinetic heart, and a fungal infection on the nasal area.

The patient has a history of diabetes and was previously on oral medications but has not been adherent to the treatment. Insulin therapy has been started, and serum glucose levels are being monitored. The patient is not currently anticoagulated for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and the code status is currently do not resuscitate (DNR).

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with h/o DM receiving no medical care over the past 2
   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now pressor and
   vent dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and
   coagulopathic.  Differential includes combination of sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.
   #Shock - Wide differential includes septic, cardiogenic, or other form
   of distributive shock.
   - Currently on neo at 0.4 mcg.  Will continue and attempt to titrate
   down.
   - Diuresed 1900 cc at midnight but still was net positive.  CVP now
   [**7-6**], bolus 1000cc NSS.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G and staph aureus
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx pending
   - Send fungal cx
   - continue ceftriaxone and azithro
   - Started solumedrol 80mg Q8H for possible Sweet's Syndrome.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   - Weaned down FiO2 to 30% for most of day, back up to 40% overnight.
   - Attempt to  wean again to 30%
   # Nonsustained VT
 Most likely etiology is pressor support.  Unlikely
   to be left IJ.  Will continue to monitor, but will need to have code
   status discussion with family.
   # Sedation: Patient was off sedation for much of yesterday. Added
   haldol Q4H prn, received one dose last PM. Will  attempt to keep
   patient off sedating meds today.
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.  Less likely to be DIC given stable plt count,
   although consider ordering AT III level.
   - Continue to follow coags (INR 2.2)
   - Continue to follow plt count 79
   - continue to follow plt, this AM
   # Oliguria
   - UOP increased  yesterday 24h 1900cc.
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Continue to trend UOP and Cr.
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G and Staph aureus
   - LAC results negative, ACL still pending.
   - Derm suspects Sweet's, started solumedrol
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs have been stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # Hypotension with Hypokinetic heart
   -  Per cardiology, patient had CO of about 5 prior to his
   hospitalization.  Current hemodynamic status unlikely to be due to
   cardiogenic shock primarily.
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.
   - Switched to insuling drip and continu to monitor serum glucose with
   accuchecks. Serum glucose ranging between 90-249.
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt counts.  Discussed with team
   and feel that currently should not anticoagulate for DVT prophylaxis.
   SCDs also not warranted secondary to patient
s leg ulcers.  PPI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who presented with shock, respiratory failure, and coagulopathy. He has a history of diabetes and has not been taking his medications regularly. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, nonsustained VT, oliguria, bilateral leg ulcerations, nasal lesion, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), hypotension with hypokinetic heart, pannus rash, and diabetes. The patient is currently on pressor support, mechanical ventilation, and receiving insulin, pantoprazole, furosemide, midazolam, and fentanyl among other medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's hypotension and the need for pressor support indicate ongoing shock. The differential includes septic, cardiogenic, or other forms of distributive shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. There may be a need for continued weaning off FiO2 and monitoring for any signs of improvement or deterioration.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT, PTT, and INR levels, indicating coagulation abnormalities. Further monitoring and management of coagulation parameters are necessary.
4. Oliguria: The patient's urine output has been low, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of urine output and renal function tests is essential.
5. Bilateral Leg Ulcer"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented with one week of shortness of breath. He was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient is currently receiving no medical care and is pressor and ventilator-dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and coagulopathy. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis. The patient is off phenylephrine, but still tachycardic, and has a fever. He is sedated and agitated, with an elevated white blood cell count. The patient has chronic venous stasis ulcers and a nasal lesion, stable transaminitis, coagulopathy, hypoxic respiratory failure, sinus tachycardia, oliguria, and elevated liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock - The patient may be at risk for shock, possibly due to cardiogenic or septic causes. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is essential.
2. Infection - The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and is receiving antibiotics. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, or positive cultures, is important.
3. Thrombocytopenia - The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a potential risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with h/o DM receiving no medical care over the past 2
   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now pressor and
   vent dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and
   coagulopathic.  Differential includes combination of sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.
   #Shock - Most likely due to cardiogenic or septic shock.
   - Currently off phenylephrine.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G and staph aureus
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx pending
   - continue ceftriaxone and azithro
   - Started solumedrol 80mg Q8H for possible Sweet's Syndrome.
   - AM CXR shows persistent right pleural effusion, consider pigtail
   catheter placement.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - Weaned down FiO2 to 30% for most of day, currently at 40%
   - ABG this 4 AM - 7.44/46/71, 8a 7.45/42/71 both at FiO2 30%
   - Plan to wean to 30% again today.
   # Sinus tach with continued PVCs
 Baseline in the 90-100.  Likely
   etiologies include infectious, persistent pleural effusion, and
   agitation.  Has been afebrile and normotensive off pressors with WBC
   unchanged this AM at 15.7.  Unlikely to be infectious in etiology, he
   is currently on ceftriaxone and azithro.
   - Fentanyl dropped sats, RR, and BP but did not improve tachy
 making
   agitation/pain unlikely etiology.
   - EKG this AM.
   # Sedation: Became agitated overnight requiring sedation.
   - Currently on versed drip
   - Patient moves to stimulation but unable to follow commands
   - Plan to wean off sedation
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue to follow coags (INR 2.0)
   - Continue to trend coags
   #Thrombocytopenia
 Plt today at 70.  Were 219 on [**7-22**] at 70 on [**7-27**].
   He has not received heparin or LMWH.  Possible etiologies include DIC,
   liver failure, or drug related (ceftriaxone, less likely azithro).
   - Check fibrinogen, split products
   - Continue to trend plt
   # Oliguria
   - UOP increased  yesterday 24h 2270cc.
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Continue to trend UOP and Cr.
   - Attempt to keep fluid balance even.
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G and Staph aureus
   - LAC results negative, ACL negative.
   - Derm suspects Sweet's, continue solumedrol.
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs this AM trending down at  ALT, AST 156/130.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CHF
   -  Per cardiology, patient had CO of about 5 prior to his
   hospitalization.  Current hemodynamic status unlikely to be due to
   cardiogenic shock primarily.
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.
   - Switched to insuling drip and continu to monitor serum glucose with
   accuchecks. Serum glucose ranging between 90-249.
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt counts.  Discussed with team
   and feel that currently should not anticoagulate for DVT prophylaxis.
   SCDs also not warranted secondary to patient
s leg ulcers.  PPI.
   # Contact: brother [**Name (NI) 3326**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3327**]. Oldest sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3328**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3329**] will be in tomorrow and most likely would be the one to
   make decisions per his brother, but he has no HCP.
   # Code: Currently DNR.
   # Dispo: ICU

   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now pressor and
   vent dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and
   coagulopathic.  Differential includes combination of sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.
   #Shock - Most likely due to cardiogenic or septic shock.
   - Fluid challenge with 1-2L LR do assess if volume responsive.
   - Currently off phenylephrine.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G and staph aureus
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx pending
   - Hold ceftriaxone and azithromycin
   - Started solumedrol 80mg Q8H for possible Sweet's Syndrome with little
   improvement.
   - AM CXR shows persistent right pleural effusion, consider pigtail
   catheter placement.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - Weaned down FiO2 to 30% for most of day, currently at 40%
   - ABG this 4 AM - 7.44/46/71, 8a 7.45/42/71 both at FiO2 30%
   - Plan to wean to 30% again today.
   # Sinus tach with continued PVCs
 Baseline in the 90-100.  Likely
   etiologies include infectious, persistent pleural effusion, and
   agitation.  Has been afebrile and normotensive off pressors with WBC
   unchanged this AM at 15.7.  Unlikely to be infectious in etiology, he
   is currently on ceftriaxone and azithro.
   - Continue fetanyl for possible analgesia.
   - EKG this AM.
   # Sedation: Became agitated overnight requiring sedation.
   - Currently on midazolam drip
   - Patient moves to stimulation but unable to follow commands
   - Plan to wean off sedation
   - Consider MRI for possible brain pathology as he is minimally
   responsive when off sedation.
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue to follow coags (INR 2.0)
   - Continue to trend coags
   #Thrombocytopenia
 Plt today at 70.  Were 219 on [**7-22**] at 70 on [**7-27**].
   He has not received heparin or LMWH.  Possible etiologies include DIC,
   liver failure, or drug related (ceftriaxone, less likely azithro).
   - Check fibrinogen, split products to rule out DIC.
   - Continue to trend plt
   # Oliguria
   - UOP increased  yesterday 24h 2270cc.
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Continue to trend UOP and Cr.
   - Attempt to keep fluid balance even.
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G and Staph aureus
   - LAC results negative, ACL negative.
   - Derm suspects Sweet's, continue solumedrol.
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs this AM trending down at  ALT, AST 156/130.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CHF
   -  Per cardiology, patient had CO of about 5 prior to his
   hospitalization.  Current hemodynamic status unlikely to be due to
   cardiogenic shock primarily.
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.
   - Switched to insuling drip and continu to monitor serum glucose with
   accuchecks. Serum glucose ranging between 90-249.
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt counts.  Discussed with team
   and feel that currently should not anticoagulate for DVT prophylaxis.
   SCDs also not warranted secondary to patient
s leg ulcers.  PPI.
   # Contact: brother [**Name (NI) 3326**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3327**]. Oldest sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3328**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3329**] will be in tomorrow and most likely would be the one to

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes who presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). He is now pressor and ventilator dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and coagulopathy. The differential diagnosis includes a combination of sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock - Most likely due to cardiogenic or septic shock. The patient is currently off phenylephrine and requires further assessment for volume responsiveness.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure - Likely secondary to sanguinous lung tissue. The patient's FiO2 has been weaned down to 30%, but the ABG results indicate ongoing hypoxemia.
3. Sinus tachycardia with continued PVCs - Etiologies include infectious, persistent pleural effusion, and agitation. The patient is currently on midazolam drip for sedation.
4. Coagulopathy - Elevated PT and PTT and INR. The patient is not on any known anticoagulation.
5. Thrombocytopenia - Platelet count of 70. Possible etiologies include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver failure, or drug-related causes.

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes who presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL. He is currently receiving no medical care and has been off medical treatment for the past two years. The patient is pressor and vent-dependent, with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and coagulopathy. His differential includes sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, sinus tachycardia with continued PVCs, agitation, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, oliguria, bilateral leg ulcerations and nasal lesion, elevated liver function tests, congestive heart failure, and a fungal infection. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and his disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and reliance on mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk for further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Coagulopathy: The elevated PT and PTT with INR suggest a bleeding tendency, which may increase the risk of internal bleeding or hemorrhage.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding or bruising, particularly if the coagulopathy worsens.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with h/o DM receiving no medical care over the past 2
   years presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided
   pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now pressor and
   vent dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and
   coagulopathic.  Differential includes combination of sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.
   #Shock - Most likely due to cardiogenic or septic shock.
   - Currently off phenylephrine.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G and staph aureus
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx pending
   - continue ceftriaxone and azithro
   - Started solumedrol 80mg Q8H for possible Sweet's Syndrome.
   - AM CXR shows persistent right pleural effusion, consider pigtail
   catheter placement.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - Weaned down FiO2 to 30% for most of day, currently at 40%
   - ABG this 4 AM - 7.44/46/71, 8a 7.45/42/71 both at FiO2 30%
   - Plan to wean to 30% again today.
   # Sinus tach with continued PVCs
 Baseline in the 90-100.  Likely
   etiologies include infectious, persistent pleural effusion, and
   agitation.  Has been afebrile and normotensive off pressors with WBC
   unchanged this AM at 15.7.  Unlikely to be infectious in etiology, he
   is currently on ceftriaxone and azithro.
   - Fentanyl dropped sats, RR, and BP but did not improve tachy
 making
   agitation/pain unlikely etiology.
   - EKG this AM.
   # Sedation: Became agitated overnight requiring sedation.
   - Currently on versed drip
   - Patient moves to stimulation but unable to follow commands
   - Plan to wean off sedation
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue to follow coags (INR 2.0)
   - Continue to trend coags
   #Thrombocytopenia
 Plt today at 70.  Were 219 on [**7-22**] at 70 on [**7-27**].
   He has not received heparin or LMWH.  Possible etiologies include DIC,
   liver failure, or drug related (ceftriaxone, less likely azithro).
   - Check fibrinogen, split products
   - Continue to trend plt
   # Oliguria
   - UOP increased  yesterday 24h 2270cc.
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Continue to trend UOP and Cr.
   - Attempt to keep fluid balance even.
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G and Staph aureus
   - LAC results negative, ACL negative.
   - Derm suspects Sweet's, continue solumedrol.
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs this AM trending down at  ALT, AST 156/130.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CHF
   -  Per cardiology, patient had CO of about 5 prior to his
   hospitalization.  Current hemodynamic status unlikely to be due to
   cardiogenic shock primarily.
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.
   - Switched to insuling drip and continu to monitor serum glucose with
   accuchecks. Serum glucose ranging between 90-249.
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt counts.  Discussed with team
   and feel that currently should not anticoagulate for DVT prophylaxis.
   SCDs also not warranted secondary to patient
s leg ulcers.  PPI.
   # Contact: brother [**Name (NI) 3326**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3327**]. Oldest sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3328**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3329**] will be in tomorrow and most likely would be the one to
   make decisions per his brother, but he has no HCP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes who presents with shortness of breath and is found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient is now pressor and ventilator-dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and coagulopathy. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis. The patient's condition remains critical, and multiple complications are present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient may be experiencing cardiogenic or septic shock, as indicated by the need for pressors and ventilator support.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to sanguinous lung tissue, which has caused persistent right pleural effusion. This may require further intervention, such as pigtail catheter placement.
3. Sinus tachycardia with continued PVCs: The patient has a baseline heart rate in the 90-100 range with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Etiologies include infectious, persistent pleural effusion, and agitation.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT and PTT and INR levels. Possible etiologies include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver failure, or drug-related causes.

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented with one week of shortness of breath and was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). He is currently pressor and ventilator-dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and coagulopathy. Differential diagnosis includes sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis. The patient has been on ceftriaxone and azithromycin, and steroids have been started for possible Sweet's Syndrome. A pigtail catheter placement is considered for persistent right pleural effusion. The patient is also experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, sinus tachycardia, agitation, coagulopathy, oliguria, bilateral lower extremity ulcerations, elevated liver function tests, congestive heart failure (CHF), and a fungal infection on the pannus rash. He has a history of diabetes and is now on insulin. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with DM receiving no medical care over the past 2 years
   presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided pleural
   effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now pressor and vent
   dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and
   coagulopathic.  Differential includes combination of sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.
   # Shock - Most likely due to cardiogenic or septic shock.
   - Hyptotension was not fluid responsive.  Received 3+ liters IVF
   yesterday and was net +>4 liters with no improvement in MAPs.
   - Consider restarting neo if necessary for hypotension.
   - Unclear if sedation with midazolam, fentanyl, and haldol have caused
   hypotension, as he his intermitently hypotensive.  It appears as if he
   becomes hypotensive when sedated and then normotensive when agitated.
   Increased O2 requirement likely due to agitated movement and breathing
   over his vent settings. Concern would be that he pulls out his ET tube
   or push it out with his tongue.  Would also need additional sedation if
   further diagnostic work-up is performed.  Consider restarting midazolam
   drip with fentaynl bolus or etomidate drip.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G and staph aureus
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx negative
   - Ceftriaxone and azithromycin restarted yesterday after PM rounds.
   - Solumedrol 80mg Q8H for possible Sweet's Syndrome with little
   improvement.  Will continue and follow-up with derm recs.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - ABG AM - 4.42/48/62 at FiO2 of 40%.
   - Plan to wean to 30% today.
   # Sedation: Became agitated overnight requiring sedation.
   - Consider switch etomidate drip.
   - Patient moves to stimulation but unable to follow commands
   - Consider MRI for possible brain pathology as he is minimally
   responsive when off sedation.
   - As neuro status is uncertain due to sedation, would consider goal
   today to assess status and follow-up with LP or MRI if necessary.
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue to follow coags (INR 1.8)
   - Continue to trend coags
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Plt today at 62.  Were 219 on [**7-22**] at 70 on [**7-27**].
   He has not received heparin or LMWH.  Possible etiologies include DIC,
   liver failure, or drug related (ceftriaxone, less likely azithro).
   - Fibrinogen 221, FDP 160-220, D-dimer 7224, cannot rule out DIC.
   - Continue to trend plt
   # Oliguria - AM creatinine 0.6.
   - 24 hour UOP 812 cc.
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Continue to trend UOP and Cr.
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G and Staph aureus
   - LAC results negative, ACL negative.
   - Derm suspects Sweet's, continue solumedrol. Will follow-up as there
   has been little improvement in systemic symptoms on solumedrol.
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs this AM trending down at  ALT, AST 121/98.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CHF
   -  Per cardiology, patient had CO of about 5 prior to his
   hospitalization.  Current hemodynamic status unlikely to be due to
   cardiogenic shock primarily.
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.
   - Switched to insuling drip and continu to monitor serum glucose with
   accuchecks. Serum glucose ranging between 79-160.
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt counts.  Discussed with team
   and feel that currently should not anticoagulate for DVT prophylaxis.
   SCDs also not warranted secondary to patient

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with DM receiving no medical care over the past 2 years
   presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided pleural
   effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now pressor and vent
   dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and
   coagulopathic.  Differential includes combination of sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.
   # Shock - Most likely due to cardiogenic or septic shock.
   - Hyptotension was not fluid responsive.  Received 3+ liters IVF
   yesterday and was net +>4 liters with no improvement in MAPs.
   - Consider restarting neo if necessary for hypotension.
   - Unclear if sedation with midazolam, fentanyl, and haldol have caused
   hypotension, as he his intermitently hypotensive.  It appears as if he
   becomes hypotensive when sedated and then normotensive when agitated.
   Increased O2 requirement likely due to agitated movement and breathing
   over his vent settings. Concern would be that he pulls out his ET tube
   or push it out with his tongue.  Would also need additional sedation if
   further diagnostic work-up is performed.  Consider restarting midazolam
   drip with fentaynl bolus or etomidate drip.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G and staph aureus
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx negative
   - Ceftriaxone and azithromycin restarted yesterday after PM rounds.
   - Solumedrol 80mg Q8H for possible Sweet's Syndrome with little
   improvement.  Will continue and follow-up with derm recs.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - ABG AM - 4.42/48/62 at FiO2 of 40%.
   - Plan to wean to 30% today.
   # Sedation: Became agitated overnight requiring sedation.
   - Consider switch etomidate drip.
   - Patient moves to stimulation but unable to follow commands
   - Consider MRI for possible brain pathology as he is minimally
   responsive when off sedation.
   - As neuro status is uncertain due to sedation, would consider goal
   today to assess status and follow-up with LP or MRI if necessary.
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue to follow coags (INR 1.8)
   - Continue to trend coags
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Plt today at 62.  Were 219 on [**7-22**] at 70 on [**7-27**].
   He has not received heparin or LMWH.  Possible etiologies include DIC,
   liver failure, or drug related (ceftriaxone, less likely azithro).
   - Fibrinogen 221, FDP 160-220, D-dimer 7224, cannot rule out DIC.
   - Continue to trend plt
   # Oliguria - AM creatinine 0.6.
   - 24 hour UOP 812 cc.
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Continue to trend UOP and Cr.
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G and Staph aureus
   - LAC results negative, ACL negative.
   - Derm suspects Sweet's, continue solumedrol. Will follow-up as there
   has been little improvement in systemic symptoms on solumedrol.
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs this AM trending down at  ALT, AST 121/98.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CHF
   -  Per cardiology, patient had CO of about 5 prior to his
   hospitalization.  Current hemodynamic status unlikely to be due to
   cardiogenic shock primarily.
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.
   - Switched to insuling drip and continu to monitor serum glucose with
   accuchecks. Serum glucose ranging between 79-160.
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt counts.  Discussed with team
   and feel that currently should not anticoagulate for DVT prophylaxis.
   SCDs also not warranted secondary to patient
s leg ulcers.  PPI.
   # Contact: brother [**Name (NI) 3326**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3327**]. Oldest sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3328**]

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented with one week of shortness of breath. He was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient is now pressor and ventilator-dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and coagulopathy. 

The patient's condition is complex and can be summarized as follows:
- Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to sanguinous lung tissue.
- Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic or septic shock. His hypotension was not fluid-responsive, indicating that the shock may be due to an underlying cardiac issue or infection.
- Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver failure, or drug-related causes.
- Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT and PTT and INR, indicating a bleeding tendency. Possible causes include DIC, liver failure, or drug-related effects.
- Oliguria: The patient has decreased urine output, which could be related to renal dysfunction.
- Bilateral lower extremity ulcerations and nasal lesion: These appear to be chronic venous stasis ulcers, not actively infected.
- Elevated liver function tests: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, likely due to shock"

   24 Hour Events:
   - 2.5 L fluid given, +4L total balance with no apparent change in
   hemodynamic or urine output.
   - Became agitated at night requiring frequent fentanyl boluses.
   Midazolam drip was discontinued, and fentanyl drip was started at 25
   mcg, but patient became hypotensive with MAPs in the mid 50s to 60.
   Fentanyl drip reduced to 12.5 with no change in hypotension. Fentanyl
   drip discontinued. Patient became agitated and pressure [**Known lastname **] rapidly.
   Was given 5 mg IV haldol with no apparent effect. Still thrashing with
   increased BP. Given bolus of 12.5 mcg of fentanyl, and patient calmed,
   then pressure dropped to MAPs of 55. Then patient became agitated with
   elevated pressures again. Fentanyl drip restarted at 12.5 mcg/h.
   - O2 requirement up to FiO2 50%, possible due to increased movement.
   - Neuro status improved today with purposeful movement and +corneal
   reflex although still unable to follow commands.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented with one week of shortness of breath and was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage. He is now pressor-dependent and ventilator-dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and coagulopathy. The differential diagnosis includes a combination of sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Shock: Most likely due to cardiogenic or septic shock. Hypotension was not fluid-responsive, indicating the need for further evaluation and management.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung tissue. ABG results show hypoxemia at a FiO2 of 40%. Weaning from the ventilator should be considered if possible.
3. Sedation: The patient became agitated overnight requiring sedation. Etomidate drip may be considered as an alternative to midazolam and fentanyl.
4. Coagulopathy: Elevated PT, PTT, and INR indicate a coagulation disorder. This could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver failure, or drug-related causes (such as ceftriaxone). Fibrinogen, FDP, and D-dimer levels support the possibility of DIC.

   Fentanyl drip reduced to 12.5 with no change in hypotension. Fentanyl
   drip discontinued. Patient became agitated and pressure [**Known lastname **] rapidly.
   Was given 5 mg IV haldol with no apparent effect. Still thrashing with
   increased BP. Given bolus of 12.5 mcg of fentanyl, and patient calmed,
   then pressure dropped to MAPs of 55. Then patient became agitated with
   elevated pressures again. Fentanyl drip restarted at 12.5 mcg/h.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with DM receiving no medical care over the past 2 years
   presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided pleural
   effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now pressor and vent
   dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and
   coagulopathic.  Differential includes combination of sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.
   # Shock - Most likely due to cardiogenic or septic shock.
   - Hyptotension was not fluid responsive.  Received 3+ liters IVF
   yesterday and was net +>4 liters with no improvement in MAPs.
   - Consider restarting neo if necessary for hypotension.
   - Unclear if sedation with midazolam, fentanyl, and haldol have caused
   hypotension, as he his intermitently hypotensive.  It appears as if he
   becomes hypotensive when sedated and then normotensive when agitated.
   Increased O2 requirement likely due to agitated movement and breathing
   over his vent settings. Concern would be that he pulls out his ET tube
   or push it out with his tongue.  Would also need additional sedation if
   further diagnostic work-up is performed.  Consider restarting midazolam
   drip with fentaynl bolus or etomidate drip.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G and staph aureus
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx negative
   - Ceftriaxone and azithromycin restarted yesterday after PM rounds.
   - Solumedrol 80mg Q8H for possible Sweet's Syndrome with little
   improvement.  Will continue and follow-up with derm recs.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - ABG AM - 4.42/48/62 at FiO2 of 40%.
   - Wean if possible.
   # Sedation: Became agitated overnight requiring sedation.
   - Consider switch etomidate drip.
   - Patient moves to stimulation but unable to follow commands
   - Consider MRI for possible brain pathology as he is minimally
   responsive when off sedation.
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue to follow coags (INR 1.8)
   - Continue to trend coags
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Plt today at 62.  Were 219 on [**7-22**] at 70 on [**7-27**].
   He has not received heparin or LMWH.  Possible etiologies include DIC,
   liver failure, or drug related (ceftriaxone, less likely azithro).
   - Fibrinogen 221, FDP 160-220, D-dimer 7224, cannot rule out DIC.
   - Continue to trend plt
   # Oliguria - AM creatinine 0.6.
   - 24 hour UOP 812 cc.
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Continue to trend UOP and Cr.
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G and Staph aureus
   - LAC results negative, ACL negative.
   - Derm suspects Sweet's, continue solumedrol. Will follow-up as there
   has been little improvement in systemic symptoms on solumedrol.
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs this AM trending down at  ALT, AST 121/98.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CHF
   -  Per cardiology, patient had CO of about 5 prior to his
   hospitalization.  Current hemodynamic status unlikely to be due to
   cardiogenic shock primarily.
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, presenting with one week of shortness of breath and found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient is currently pressor-dependent and ventilator-dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and coagulopathy. Differential diagnoses include sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is hypotensive and not fluid-responsive, indicating a possible shock state. This could be due to cardiogenic or septic shock. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure and consider restarting neo (norepinephrine) if necessary for hypotension.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of sanguinous lung tissue, which may contribute to his hypoxic respiratory failure. Weaning off ventilator support should be considered if possible.
3. Sedation: The patient became agitated overnight and required sedation. Considering switching to etomidate drip for sedation, as it allows for better neurological assessment compared to fentanyl and midazolam.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR), indicating a coagulopathy. This may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver failure, or drug-related causes. Monitoring coagulation parameters and considering the need for anticoagulation therapy.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be due to DIC, liver failure, or drug-related causes. Trending platelet counts and considering the need for platelet transfusion if necessary.
6. Oliguria: The patient has reduced urine output, and his creatinine level is elevated. Monitoring urine output and renal function, and adjusting medication dosages accordingly.
7. Bilateral lower extremity ulcerations and nasal lesion: These appear to be chronic venous stasis ulcers. Dermatology recommendations should be followed, and Sweet's syndrome should be considered.
8. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient has elevated LFTs, likely due to shock liver or congestive hepatopathy. Monitoring LFTs and considering the need for liver support.
9. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient had a cardiac output of about 5 prior to hospitalization, but his current hemodynamic status does not primarily indicate cardiogenic shock.
10. Pannus rash: This appears to be a chronic fungal infection with a purple petechial rash. Applying miconazole powder and considering wound care recommendations.
11. Diabetes: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, previously managed with oral medications, but not adherent to treatment. Insulin drip has been started to manage serum glucose levels.

Overall, the patient presents with multiple complex medical conditions requiring careful management and monitoring. The potential medical complications include shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, sedation, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, oliguria, chronic venous stasis ulcers, elevated LFTs, CHF, fungal infection, and diabetes."

   24 Hour Events:
   - Received 2 L NSS during the day/evening for decreased UOP, which was
   mildly responsive.  He was normotensive (for him). When sedated he
   would drop down into the SBP 90s, which is normal for him at night.  He
   did start getting a little edematous in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] fluid was held,
   continued to have UOP ~50cc/hr.
   - Back on fentaynl and midaz drips.  He became a little hypotensive
   (MAPs in the 60s), cut both versed and fentaynl drips in half.  Woke up
   a bit and BP came back up.
   - Consider EtOH withdrawl.  Received 10 mg valium x2 yesterday with the

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male who is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. He has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 96/52 mmHg and tachycardia with a heart rate of 121 bpm. Oxygen saturation is 94% on 40% FiO2. 

The patient has received 2 liters of normal saline (NSS) during the day/evening for decreased urine output, which was mildly responsive. His blood pressure drops into the 90s when sedated, which is normal for him at night. The patient becomes a little edematous, and his fluid intake and output are being closely monitored. 

The patient's sedation is managed with midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl drips. Due to hypotension, the sedation is cut in half, and the patient wakes up briefly with an improvement in blood pressure. EtOH withdrawal is considered, and the patient receives 10 mg of valium twice yesterday as part of the treatment. 

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. He is on various medications including ceftriaxone, azithromycin, midazolam, fentanyl, insulin, haloperidol, and famotidine. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with DM receiving no medical care over the past 2 years
   presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided pleural
   effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now pressor and vent
   dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and
   coagulopathic.  Differential includes combination of sepsis,
   cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.
   # Shock - Most likely due to cardiogenic or septic shock.
   - Hyptotension was not fluid responsive.  Received 3+ liters IVF
   yesterday and was net +>4 liters with no improvement in MAPs.
   - Consider restarting neo if necessary for hypotension.
   - Unclear if sedation with midazolam, fentanyl, and haldol have caused
   hypotension, as he his intermitently hypotensive.  It appears as if he
   becomes hypotensive when sedated and then normotensive when agitated.
   Increased O2 requirement likely due to agitated movement and breathing
   over his vent settings. Concern would be that he pulls out his ET tube
   or push it out with his tongue.  Would also need additional sedation if
   further diagnostic work-up is performed.  Consider restarting midazolam
   drip with fentaynl bolus or etomidate drip.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G and staph aureus
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx negative
   - Ceftriaxone and azithromycin restarted yesterday after PM rounds.
   - Solumedrol 80mg Q8H for possible Sweet's Syndrome with little
   improvement.  Will continue and follow-up with derm recs.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - ABG AM - 4.42/48/62 at FiO2 of 40%.
   - Wean if possible.
   # Sedation: Became agitated overnight requiring sedation.
   - Consider switch etomidate drip.
   - Patient moves to stimulation but unable to follow commands
   - Consider MRI for possible brain pathology as he is minimally
   responsive when off sedation.
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue to follow coags (INR 1.8)
   - Continue to trend coags
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Plt today at 62.  Were 219 on [**7-22**] at 70 on [**7-27**].
   He has not received heparin or LMWH.  Possible etiologies include DIC,
   liver failure, or drug related (ceftriaxone, less likely azithro).
   - Fibrinogen 221, FDP 160-220, D-dimer 7224, cannot rule out DIC.
   - Continue to trend plt
   # Oliguria - AM creatinine 0.6.
   - 24 hour UOP 812 cc.
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Continue to trend UOP and Cr.
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G and Staph aureus
   - LAC results negative, ACL negative.
   - Derm suspects Sweet's, continue solumedrol. Will follow-up as there
   has been little improvement in systemic symptoms on solumedrol.
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs this AM trending down at  ALT, AST 121/98.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CHF
   -  Per cardiology, patient had CO of about 5 prior to his
   hospitalization.  Current hemodynamic status unlikely to be due to
   cardiogenic shock primarily.
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.
   - Switched to insuling drip and continu to monitor serum glucose with
   accuchecks. Serum glucose ranging between 79-160.
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt counts.  Discussed with team
   and feel that currently should not anticoagulate for DVT prophylaxis.
   SCDs also not warranted secondary to patient
s leg ulcers.  PPI.
   # Contact: brother [**Name (NI) 3326**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3327**]. Oldest sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3328**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3329**] will be in tomorrow and most likely would be the one to
   make decisions per his brother, but he has no HCP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus presenting with one week of shortness of breath. He was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient is now pressor-dependent and ventilator-dependent with thrombocytopenia, stable transaminitis, and coagulopathy. The differential includes sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to cardiogenic or septic shock. The patient has received IV fluids and sedation but remains hypotensive. Further evaluation and management are required.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's ABG results show a low oxygen level (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) indicating hypoxic respiratory failure. This could be secondary to the sanguinous lung tissue. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging, and further respiratory support may be needed.

3. Sedation: The patient became agitated overnight and required sedation. Etomidate drip may be considered as an alternative to midazolam and fentanyl. MRI for possible brain pathology should be considered given the minimal responsiveness when off sedation.

   CXR done [**7-29**]: Final Report
   CLINICAL HISTORY: 68-year-old male with sepsis. Evaluate for interval
   change.
   Single AP chest radiograph compared to [**2143-7-28**] shows persistent
   bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusions, large on the
   right and
   small on the left. Compared to prior exam, there is slightly improved
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. ET tube terminates 5.5 cm
   above
   the carina. NG tube enters the stomach, the tip has been excluded.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with DM receiving no medical care over the past 2 years
   presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided pleural
   effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now vent dependent with
   resolving thrombocytopenia and transaminitis.  It seems most likely
   that his shock was cardiogenic in origin.
   # Shock - Most likely cardiogenic in nature.  Likely secondary to
   silent MIs in the setting of DM automic neuropathy.  Blood cultures to
   date have shown no growth.
   - hypotension and decreased urine output.
   - Unclear if sedation with midazolam, fentanyl, and haldol have caused
   hypotension, as he his intermitently hypotensive.  It appears as if he
   becomes hypotensive when sedated and then normotensive when agitated.
   Increased O2 requirement likely due to agitated movement and breathing
   over his vent settings. Concern would be that he pulls out his ET tube
   or push it out with his tongue.  Would also need additional sedation if
   further diagnostic work-up is performed.  Consider restarting midazolam
   drip with fentaynl bolus or etomidate drip.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Bx cs prelim is beta streptococcus group G and staph aureus
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx negative
   - Ceftriaxone and azithromycin restarted yesterday after PM rounds.
   - Solumedrol 80mg Q8H for possible Sweet's Syndrome with little
   improvement.  Will continue and follow-up with derm recs.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.
   - ABG AM - 4.42/48/62 at FiO2 of 40%.
   - Wean if possible.
   # Sedation: Became agitated overnight requiring sedation.
   - Consider switch etomidate drip.
   - Patient moves to stimulation but unable to follow commands
   - Consider MRI for possible brain pathology as he is minimally
   responsive when off sedation.
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue to follow coags (INR 1.8)
   - Continue to trend coags
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Plt today at 62.  Were 219 on [**7-22**] at 70 on [**7-27**].
   He has not received heparin or LMWH.  Possible etiologies include DIC,
   liver failure, or drug related (ceftriaxone, less likely azithro).
   - Fibrinogen 221, FDP 160-220, D-dimer 7224, cannot rule out DIC.
   - Continue to trend plt
   # Oliguria - AM creatinine 0.6.
   - 24 hour UOP 812 cc.
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Continue to trend UOP and Cr.
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations and nasal lesion: Appear to be chronic
   venous stasis ulcers, that do not appear to be actively infected
   - Prelim skin cx grew out beta streptococcus group G and Staph aureus
   - LAC results negative, ACL negative.
   - Derm suspects Sweet's, continue solumedrol. Will follow-up as there
   has been little improvement in systemic symptoms on solumedrol.
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs this AM trending down at  ALT, AST 121/98.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CHF
   -  Per cardiology, patient had CO of about 5 prior to his
   hospitalization.  Current hemodynamic status unlikely to be due to
   cardiogenic shock primarily.
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
 looks less purpuric
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: Was on oral meds in the past, but has not been taking these
   meds for some time. Never been on insulin per family.
   - Switched to insuling drip and continu to monitor serum glucose with
   accuchecks. Serum glucose ranging between 79-160.
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt counts.  Discussed with team
   and feel that currently should not anticoagulate for DVT prophylaxis.
   SCDs also not warranted secondary to patient
s leg ulcers.  PPI.
   # Contact: brother [**Name (NI) 3326**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3327**]. Oldest sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3328**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3329**] will be in tomorrow and most likely would be the one to
   make decisions per his brother, but he has no HCP.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented with one week of shortness of breath. He was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient is currently intubated and sedated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. 

The patient's medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus, for which he was receiving no medical care over the past two years. He has a history of myocardial infarctions and autonomic neuropathy, which could have contributed to cardiogenic shock. 

The patient's current condition includes shock (most likely cardiogenic), hypoxic respiratory failure, oliguria, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver function tests, chronic venous stasis ulcers, and congestive heart failure. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 96/52 mmHg, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on ventilator support. 

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including ceftriaxone, azithromycin, midazolam, fentanyl, haldol, solumedrol, and insulin. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The blood cultures have shown no growth, and"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Received 2 L NSS during the day/evening for decreased UOP, which was
   mildly responsive.  He was normotensive (for him). When sedated he
   would drop down into the SBP 90s, which is normal for him at night.  He
   did start getting a little edematous in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] fluid was held,
   continued to have UOP ~50cc/hr.
   - Back on fentaynl and midaz drips.  He became a little hypotensive
   (MAPs in the 60s), cut both versed and fentaynl drips in half.  Woke up
   a bit and BP came back up.
   - Consider EtOH withdrawl.  Received 10 mg valium x2 yesterday with the
   idea that he is withdrawing.  Would continue valium and then pull back
   on the rest of sedation and observe.

   CXR done [**7-29**]: Final Report
   CLINICAL HISTORY: 68-year-old male with sepsis. Evaluate for interval
   change.
   Single AP chest radiograph compared to [**2143-7-28**] shows persistent
   bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusions, large on the
   right and
   small on the left. Compared to prior exam, there is slightly improved
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. ET tube terminates 5.5 cm
   above
   the carina. NG tube enters the stomach, the tip has been excluded.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with DM receiving no medical care over the past 2 years
   presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided pleural
   effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now vent dependent with
   resolving thrombocytopenia and transaminitis.  It seems most likely
   that his shock was cardiogenic in origin.
   # Shock - Most likely cardiogenic in nature.  Likely secondary to
   silent MIs in the setting of DM automic neuropathy.  Blood cultures to
   date have shown no growth.  Continuing to support patient in hopes that
   some of his myocardium is stunned from ischemic insult and will have
   functional improvement.  Patient
s myocardial function has not
   improved, and he is currently 2 weeks out from initial insult.
   Unlikely that he will regain much function.  Family discussion planned
   for tomorrow.  Discussed need for discussion of goals of care with
   patient
s sister, and she said the family would make an effort to come
   in tomorrow.
   - hypotension and decreased urine output which have been reponsive to
   fluid over the past 24 hours.  Patient is 18 L positive over admission
   and third spacing much of fluid.  Would like to start diuresis but BP
   won
t tolerate.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx negative
   - Ceftriaxone and azithromycin restarted yesterday after PM rounds.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.  Continue on vent.
   # Sedation: Became agitated overnight requiring sedation.
   - Continue Versed and fentanyl drips and Haldol PRN for sedation.
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation. Most likely due to shock liver.
   - Continue to follow coags (INR 1.7)
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Plt today at 68.  Were 219 on [**7-22**] at 62 on [**7-28**].
   He has not received heparin or LMWH.  Possible etiologies include DIC,
   liver failure, or drug related (ceftriaxone, less likely azithro).
   Continue to follow.
   # Oliguria - AM creatinine 0.6.
   - 24 hour UOP 840cc
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Continue to trend UOP and Cr.
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations:  diagnosed by tissue bx as pyoderma
   gangrenosum.  Derm recommends treating once his more actue issues have
   resolved.   Tx is  high dose steroids Prednisone 100mg PO daily for [**1-30**]
   weeks and then slow taper.  PG is typically associated with UC, certain
   rheum conditions and certain maligancies.  He is not known to have any
   of these conditions.
   # nasal lesion: likely basal cell.  Can be treated as outpatient once
   acute issues resolved.
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs this AM trending down at  ALT, AST 121/98.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CHF
   - Per cardiology, patient had CO of about 5 prior to his
   hospitalization.
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: D/C insulin drip and switch to NPH and insulin sliding
   scale.   Serum glucose ranging between 79-160.
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt counts.  Discussed with team
   and feel that currently should not anticoagulate for DVT prophylaxis.
   SCDs also not warranted secondary to patient
s leg ulcers.  PPI.
   # Contact: brother [**Name (NI) 3326**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3327**]. Oldest sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3328**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3329**] will be in tomorrow and most likely would be the one to
   make decisions per his brother, but he has no HCP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's shock was most likely cardiogenic in origin, possibly secondary to silent myocardial infarctions in the setting of autonomic neuropathy. His myocardial function has not improved, and he is 2 weeks out from the initial insult. The patient's medical history includes sepsis, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, thrombocytopenia, oliguria, bilateral lower extremity ulcerations diagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum, a nasal lesion likely basal cell carcinoma, elevated liver function tests likely due to shock liver, chronic fungal infection with a purple petechial rash, and a pannus rash. The patient has been receiving sedation, antibiotics, diuretics, insulin, and other medications as needed. He has been monitored closely for various complications, including coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, oliguria, and liver function tests. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he is currently being managed in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing lack of myocardial function"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU. He has a history of hypertension and is currently sedated with midazolam and fentanyl infusions. The patient received 2 liters of normal saline solution (NSS) during the day/evening for decreased urine output (UOP), which was mildly responsive. He was normotensive but experienced hypotension when sedated, which is normal for him at night. The patient's UOP remains low at approximately 50cc/hr. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,782 mL and output of 2,931 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 851 mL. His weight is currently 95.7 kg, which is slightly lower than his admission weight of 96.9 kg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension when sedated, which could be a sign of septic shock or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
2. Decreased Urine Output: The patient's UOP is low, which may indicate renal dysfunction or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 851 mL, indicating potential fluid overload. This can increase the risk of pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory status.
4. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk of developing pneumonia due to being intubated and immobile. Close monitoring of respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of decreased urine output (UOP). He received 2 liters of normal saline solution (NSS) during the day/evening, which was mildly responsive. The patient was normotensive but dropped into systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 90s when sedated, which is normal for him at night. He started getting a little edematous, and [**Last Name (LF)**] fluid was held. The patient continued to have UOP of approximately 50 cc/hr. He was put back on fentanyl and midazolam drips. The patient became a little hypotensive (mean arterial pressure [MAP] in the 60s), so the doses of both versed and fentanyl were cut in half. The patient woke up a bit, and his blood pressure came back up. EtOH withdrawal was considered, and he received 10 mg of valium twice yesterday with the idea that he is withdrawing. It was planned to continue valium and then pull back on the rest of sedation and observe.

The patient has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were ceftriaxone on 07/27/2143 at 04:15 PM and azithromycin on 07/28/2143 at 10:00 PM.

The patient is currently receiving midazolam (versed) at 4 mg/hour, fentanyl at 50 mcg/hour, and insulin - regular at 3 units/hour. Other medications given include haloperidol (Haldol) on 07/28/2143 at 02:15 PM, famotidine (Pepcid) on 07/28/2143 at 08:00 PM, midazolam (versed) on 07/28/2143 at 11:20 PM, and fentanyl on 07/29/2143 at 06:00 AM.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data as of 07/29/2143 at 07:50 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other pertinent information.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, neurologic assessment, and lab results.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Fluid overload: The patient is showing signs of edema and has received a significant amount of fluid, which may lead to fluid overload.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which can be concerning, especially during periods of sedation.
3. Decreased urine output: The patient's UOP is still low, indicating possible kidney dysfunction or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
4. EtOH withdrawal: The patient may be experiencing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, which can include agitation, tremors, seizures, and hallucinations.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection.
6. Respiratory issues: The patient is still on mechanical ventilation, indicating that he may have difficulty breathing on his own."

   24 Hour Events:
   - Received 2 L NSS during the day/evening for decreased UOP, which was
   mildly responsive.  He was normotensive (for him). When sedated he
   would drop down into the SBP 90s, which is normal for him at night.  He
   did start getting a little edematous in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] fluid was held,
   continued to have UOP ~50cc/hr.
   - Back on fentaynl and midaz drips.  He became a little hypotensive
   (MAPs in the 60s), cut both versed and fentaynl drips in half.  Woke up
   a bit and BP came back up.
   - Consider EtOH withdrawl.  Received 10 mg valium x2 yesterday with the
   idea that he is withdrawing.  Would continue valium and then pull back
   on the rest of sedation and observe.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 68 yo male with DM receiving no medical care over the past 2 years
   presents with 1 week SOB found to have a large right sided pleural
   effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via BAL, now vent dependent with
   resolving thrombocytopenia and transaminitis.  It seems most likely
   that his shock was cardiogenic in origin.
   # Shock - Most likely cardiogenic in nature.  Likely secondary to
   silent MIs in the setting of DM automic neuropathy.  Blood cultures to
   date have shown no growth.  Continuing to support patient in hopes that
   some of his myocardium is stunned from ischemic insult and will have
   functional improvement.  Patient
s myocardial function has not
   improved, and he is currently 2 weeks out from initial insult.
   Unlikely that he will regain much function.  Family discussion planned
   for tomorrow.  Discussed need for discussion of goals of care with
   patient
s sister, and she said the family would make an effort to come
   in tomorrow.
   - hypotension and decreased urine output which have been reponsive to
   fluid over the past 24 hours.  Patient is 18 L positive over admission
   and third spacing much of fluid.  Would like to start diuresis but BP
   won
t tolerate.
   - f/u blood Cx ([**7-22**]) still pending
   - Pleural cx negative
   - BAL cx negative
   - Ceftriaxone and azithromycin restarted yesterday after PM rounds.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to sanguinous lung
   tissue.  Continue on vent.
   # Sedation: Became agitated overnight requiring sedation.
   - Continue Versed and fentanyl drips and Haldol PRN for sedation.
   # Coagulopathy: Has elevated PT and PTT and INR. He is not on any known
   anticoagulation. Most likely due to shock liver.
   - Continue to follow coags (INR 1.7)
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Plt today at 68.  Were 219 on [**7-22**] at 62 on [**7-28**].
   He has not received heparin or LMWH.  Possible etiologies include DIC,
   liver failure, or drug related (ceftriaxone, less likely azithro).
   Continue to follow.
   # Oliguria - AM creatinine 0.6.
   - 24 hour UOP 840cc
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Continue to trend UOP and Cr.
   # Bilateral LE ulcerations:  diagnosed by tissue bx as pyoderma
   gangrenosum.  Derm recommends treating once his more actue issues have
   resolved.   Tx is  high dose steroids Prednisone 100mg PO daily for [**1-30**]
   weeks and then slow taper.  PG is typically associated with UC, certain
   rheum conditions and certain maligancies.  He is not known to have any
   of these conditions.
   # nasal lesion: likely basal cell.  Can be treated as outpatient once
   acute issues resolved.
   # Elevated LFTS: Most likely shock liver (congestive hepatopathy) in
   the setting of hypotension and CHF. Hep serologies negative except for
   Hep A Ab.  LFTs this AM trending down at  ALT, AST 121/98.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CHF
   - Per cardiology, patient had CO of about 5 prior to his
   hospitalization.
   # Pannus rash: Appears to have chronic fungal infection with purple
   petechial appearing rash
   - miconazole powder TID
   - Check for wound care recs
   # Diabetes: D/C insulin drip and switch to NPH and insulin sliding
   scale.   Serum glucose ranging between 79-160.
   # FEN: NG Tube, oral meds.
   # PPX: Has elevated INR and dropping Plt counts.  Discussed with team
   and feel that currently should not anticoagulate for DVT prophylaxis.
   SCDs also not warranted secondary to patient
s leg ulcers.  PPI.
   # Contact: brother [**Name (NI) 3326**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3327**]. Oldest sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3328**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3329**] will be in tomorrow and most likely would be the one to
   make decisions per his brother, but he has no HCP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented with one week of shortness of breath and was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion with sanguinous lung tissue via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). He is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation (vent) and has resolving thrombocytopenia and transaminitis. The patient's myocardial function has not improved after two weeks from the initial insult, and it is unlikely that he will regain much function. The family will be discussed for tomorrow, and the need for discussing goals of care with the patient's sister has been communicated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock - Most likely cardiogenic in nature, possibly secondary to silent myocardial infarctions (MIs) in the setting of diabetes mellitus autonomic neuropathy.
2. Hypotension and decreased urine output - Hypotension has been responsive to fluid administration, but the patient is third spacing much of the fluid. It is planned to start diuresis but the patient's blood pressure cannot tolerate it.
3. Hypoxic respiratory failure - Likely secondary to sanguinous lung tissue. The patient will continue on ventilatory support.
4. Sedation - The patient became agitated overnight and required sedation. He will continue on midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl drips and haloperidol PRN for sedation.
5. Coagulopathy - The"
