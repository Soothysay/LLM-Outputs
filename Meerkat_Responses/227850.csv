   Assessment and Plan
   .
   25 year old man with ESRD on HD, DM, recent PE who presented with
   hyperkalemia, CP and hypertensive urgency.
   .
   #Hypertensive urgency:  Slowly improving. Likely related to his
   longstanding medication noncompliance.  Also seems to be anxiety and
   agitation component. Additional volume overload also may contribute as
   patient has ESRD and is on HD.  Neuro exam continues to be non-focal
   and head CT negative. Recent  cardiac enzymes negative.
   .
   - continue labetolol drip, and combination of current ACE, [**Last Name (un) 239**],
   clonidine, hydralazine
   - add back home Norvasc dose
   - wean labetolol drip
 switch to PO labetolol
   - SBP goals 160-180s now
   - continue with HD today
   - Social work consult for med compliance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  Resolved issue now. Was likely from ESRD and possible
   shifts in setting of poor glucose control.
   EKG showed peaked Ts. Initially given calcium, insulin/glucose,
   kayexalate.
   - trending daily K, continue hemodialysis sessions
   - continue with Telemetry
   -f/up renal recs
   .
    #Chest pain: Resolved now. Although  + nonspecific ST/T changes on EKG
   , cardiac enzymes showed flat CK levels. Most likely due to small
   pulmonary emboli  vs. anxiety as opposed to true  ACS issue.  Imaging
   r/o dissection.
   on CTA .
   - telemetry
   - aspirin 325mg for now
   .
   #Right sub-segmental PE :  No evidence of recurrent clot on CTA on this
   admission.  Confirmed at recent [**Hospital1 183**] admission, reviewed discharge
   records.
   - Heparin drip with coag monitoring for goal PTT 60-80
   - holding  warfarin while in ICU setting
   .
   #Somnolence: Improved. Occurred yesterday in setting of Benadryl,
   dilaudid and ativan. Meds probably lingered in setting of ESRD.  CT
   head negative and no e/o hypercarbia on ABG.
   -          decrease dose Ativan, only give PRN
   -          d/c dilaudid
   .
   # ESRD on HD
   - f/up renal recs
   - HD today
   - Continue sevelemer, nephrocaps
   - dosed nephrocaps and Vit D at HD sessions
   .
   # DM:  Erratic glucose control even on SSI and Glargine.  FSGs ranging
   from 30-480s and patient managed on insulin drip and then got 1 AMP
   dextrose for sudden drops.
   - keep lower dose 12Units Glargine with SSI for now
   - will call formal [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult
   - anion gap closing now, no e/o DKA at this time
   - diabetic diet , following fingersticks QID
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct appears near baseline in 23-25 range.
   - Check in with renal regarding epo schedule
   - recheck iron stores
   .
   # Thrombocytosis: Most likely  reactive to iron deficiency and ESRD
   - continue to follow daily labs
   .
   # Pruritis
 possible uremia related vs. prurigo nodularis
   - continue Sarna lotion, hydroxyzine and PRN Benadryl

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and a recent pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient presented with hyperkalemia, chest pain, and hypertensive urgency.

From the 24-hour events, the patient's anion gap improved overnight, and he was placed on an insulin drip for fluctuating blood glucose levels. The patient experienced hypoglycemia requiring administration of 1AMP dextrose, and his blood glucose levels normalized. His Coumadin was held, and he is now on heparin for the PE. The patient was somnolent after receiving dilaudid and Ativan but improved with a negative head CT and no evidence of hypercarbia on ABG. He required IV Ativan and Haldol for agitation and demanded to see a psychiatrist overnight.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 171/101 mmHg to 126/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination findings are unremarkable except for several tattoos, small scabs over a tunneled HD catheter, and limited vision.

Laboratory results show elevated potassium levels, mildly decreased hemoglobin, elevated white blood cell"

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   25 year old man with ESRD on HD, DM, recent PE who presented with
   hyperkalemia, CP and hypertensive urgency.
   .
   * Hypertensive urgency
   He has a history of medication noncompliance. It is unclear whether he
   is actually taking any of his blood pressure medicatiosn currently.
   Anxiety may also be contributing, as could volume though he does not
   appear markedly volume overloaded on exam. Neuro exam without any focal
   deficits, cardiac enzymes negative - he has nonspecific ST/T changes on
   EKG that are more likely due to strain than ACS
   - Resume home PO and transdermal meds (use [**10/2185**] DC summary as guide).
   Will need to confirm with pharmacy in the AM
   - Continue labetalol drip for now, wean as tolerated, goal SBP<180
   - Dialysis tomorrow AM
   - Hold on CT head - INR only 1 and no focal deficits on exam worrisome
   for bleed
   - Check urine tox (pt makes small amount of urine) with his bruxism
   wonder about meth use
   - Social work consult for med compliance
   .
   * Hyperkalemia
   EKG showed peaked Ts. Given calcium, insulin/glucose, kayexalate
   already.
   - Repeat K
   - Telemetry
   - HD in the AM
   .
   * Chest pain
   Now resolved. No evidence of dissection or PE on CTA chest. Very low
   suspicion for ACS in this young man; his tropns are at historical
   baseline and CKs are flat. Suspect secondary to anxiety.
   - Cycle enzymes, telemetry, aspirin 325mg for now
   - Will not give any further IV dilaudid
   .
   * History of PE
   No evidence of recurrent clot on CTA
   - Heparin bridge and restart warfarin
   - Would attempt to obtain [**Hospital1 183**] records in AM
   .
   * ESRD on HD
   - HD tomorrow, renal recs appreciated
   - Continue sevelemer, nephrocaps
   - Checking PTH per renal request
   .
   * DM
   - Continue home insulin, following fingersticks
   .
   * Anemia
   - Check in with renal regarding epo schedule
   - recheck iron stores
   .
   * Thrombocytosis
   Suspect reactive, perhaps iron deficiency
   - continue to follow
   .
   * Pruritis
   Likely prurigo nodularis. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to uremia.
   - ok to continue benadryl holding for excess sedation
   - also check lfts. with his multiple tattoos consider hepB, but
   serology negative [**5-12**], hepB Sag negative

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (9.4), potassium (5.4), and lactate acid (1.2 mmol/L). The white blood cell count is within normal range (7.9), platelet count is slightly elevated (515), and troponin-T level is normal (0.32). Other lab values such as glucose, albumin, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers are within normal limits or show no significant abnormalities.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild pulmonary hypertension, mild mitral regurgitation, mild mitral valve prolapse, and left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 70%. Neurological examination is not assessed.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's history of medication noncompliance may contribute to his high blood pressure. Anxiety could also be a factor. The patient will continue on labetalol drip, which will be weaned as tolerated, aiming for a systolic blood pressure below 180 mmHg.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has been given calcium, insulin/glucose, and kayexalate. Repeat potassium levels, telemetry monitoring, and hemodialysis in the morning are planned.
3. Chest pain: The patient's chest pain has resolved, and there is no evidence of dissection or PE on CTA chest. The pain is likely secondary to anxiety. Enzymes will be cycled, telemetry will continue, and aspirin 325mg will be given.
4. History of PE: There is no evidence of recurrent clot on CTA. The patient will be bridged to warfarin, and records from Hospital1 will be obtained in the morning.
5. ESRD on HD: Hemodialysis tomorrow, renal recommendations appreciated. Continue sevelemer and nephrocaps. PTH will be checked per renal request.
6. DM: Continue home insulin and fingerstick monitoring.
7. Anemia: Check in with renal regarding epo schedule. Recheck iron stores.
8. Thrombocytosis: Suspect reactive, perhaps iron deficiency. Continue"

   * Hypertensive urgency
   He has a history of medication noncompliance. It is unclear whether he
   is actually taking any of his blood pressure medicatiosn currently.
   Anxiety may also be contributing, as could volume though he does not
   appear markedly volume overloaded on exam. Neuro exam without any focal

   EKG that are more likely due to strain than ACS
   - Resume home PO and transdermal meds (use [**10/2185**] DC summary as guide).
   Will need to confirm with pharmacy in the AM
   - Continue labetalol drip for now, wean as tolerated, goal SBP<180
   - Dialysis tomorrow AM
   - Hold on CT head - INR only 1 and no focal deficits on exam worrisome
   for bleed
   - Check urine tox (pt makes small amount of urine) with his bruxism
   wonder about meth use
   - Social work consult for med compliance

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and a recent pulmonary embolism (PE). He presented with hyperkalemia, chest pain, and hypertensive urgency. His current medications include Hydralazine, Lorazepam (Ativan), and Dextrose. He is also on a heparin drip for his PE. The patient's vital signs include a blood pressure of 171/101 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for anxiety. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient has a history of medication noncompliance, and it is unclear whether he is currently taking his blood pressure medications. Anxiety may also be contributing to his hypertension, as well as potential volume overload although he does not appear markedly volume overloaded on exam. Neuro exam without any focal deficits, cardiac enzymes negative - he has nonspecific ST/T changes on EKG that are more likely due to strain than acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 
   - Resume home PO and transdermal meds (use DC summary as guide).
   - Continue labetalol drip for now, wean as tolerated, goal SBP < 180.
   - Dialysis tomorrow AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9190**] is a 25 year old man with ESRD on HD, DM, recent PE who
   presents with hyperkalemia, CP and hypertensive urgency.
   .
   * Hypertensive urgency
   He has a history of medication noncompliance. It is unclear whether he
   is actually taking any of his blood pressure medicatiosn currently.
   Anxiety may also be contributing, as could volume though he does not
   appear markedly volume overloaded on exam. Neuro exam without any focal
   deficits, cardiac enzymes negative - he has nonspecific ST/T changes on
   EKG that are more likely due to strain than ACS
   - Resume home PO and transdermal meds (use [**10/2185**] DC summary as guide).
   Will need to confirm with pharmacy in the AM
   - Continue labetalol drip for now, wean as tolerated, goal SBP<180
   - Dialysis tomorrow AM
   - Hold on CT head - INR only 1 and no focal deficits on exam worrisome
   for bleed
   - Check urine tox (pt makes small amount of urine) with his bruxism
   wonder about meth use
   - Social work consult for med compliance
   .
   * Hyperkalemia
   EKG showed peaked Ts. Given calcium, insulin/glucose, kayexalate
   already.
   - Repeat K
   - Telemetry
   - HD in the AM
   .
   * Chest pain
   Now resolved. No evidence of dissection or PE on CTA chest. Very low
   suspicion for ACS in this young man; his tropns are at historical
   baseline and CKs are flat. Suspect secondary to anxiety.
   - Cycle enzymes, telemetry, aspirin 325mg for now
   - Will not give any further IV dilaudid
   .
   * History of PE
   No evidence of recurrent clot on CTA
   - Heparin bridge and restart warfarin
   - Would attempt to obtain [**Hospital1 183**] records in AM
   .
   * ESRD on HD
   - HD tomorrow, renal recs appreciated
   - Continue sevelemer, nephrocaps
   - Checking PTH per renal request
   .
   * DM
   - Continue home insulin, following fingersticks
   .
   * Anemia
   - Check in with renal regarding epo schedule
   - recheck iron stores
   .
   * Thrombocytosis
   Suspect reactive, perhaps iron deficiency
   - continue to follow
   .
   * Pruritis
   Likely prurigo nodularis. [**Month (only) 60**] be related to uremia.
   - ok to continue benadryl holding for excess sedation
   - also check lfts. with his multiple tattoos consider hepB, but
   serology negative [**5-12**], hepB Sag negative

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and recent pulmonary embolism (PE). He presents with hyperkalemia, chest pain, and hypertensive urgency. His lab results show elevated potassium levels, nonspecific ST/T changes on EKG, and negative cardiac enzymes. The patient's anxiety may be contributing to his symptoms, and there is no evidence of recurrent clot on CTA. The assessment plan includes resuming home PO and transdermal medications, continuing labetalol drip for blood pressure control, dialysis tomorrow morning, holding on CT head, checking urine tox, and consulting social work for medication compliance. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels require immediate attention as high levels can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. Treatment involves repeating K levels, monitoring on telemetry, and providing hemodialysis in the morning.
2. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be managed to prevent complications such as stroke or heart attack. Continuing labetalol drip and gradually weaning it off while monitoring blood pressure is recommended.
3. Chest pain: Although the patient's chest pain has resolved, further evaluation is necessary to rule out any cardiac issues. Cycling enzymes, telemetry, and administering aspirin are part of the management plan.
4. History of PE: No evidence of recurrent clot on"

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, elevated troponin T level, and elevated levels of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, lactic acid, LDH, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. 

The patient's renal function is impaired as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. 

The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin sodium, dextrose, hydralazine, and lorazepam (Ativan).

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 25-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted to the ICU for hypertensive urgency and behavioral issues. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to control, reaching as high as 260s/130s despite multiple medications including labetalol, lisinopril, and clonidine. The goal is to transition from intravenous labetalol to oral labetalol and add other antihypertensive medications such as norvasc, lisinopril, and clonidine patch. If the patient refuses oral medications, intravenous labetalol, hydralazine, and clonidine will be continued. Blood pressure should be monitored closely, with a target range of 160-180 mmHg.

2. Chest pain: The patient presented with chest pain, but no evidence of myocardial infarction was found. Continuous monitoring of the patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) should be performed.

3. Agitation: The patient has been intermittently agitated and refusing medical care. He has been given ativan and haldol as needed to manage his agitation.

4. Hyper/hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced fluctuations in blood glucose levels, with readings as high as 400s and as low as 30s"

The patient is a 25-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is currently in the ICU for hypertensive urgency and behavioral issues. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with high blood pressure that has been difficult to control despite medication. He has experienced episodes of agitation, hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia. A head CT scan showed no abnormalities. The patient is also dealing with anemia and pruritus related to ESRD. He is receiving dialysis, insulin, and various medications to manage his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite treatment, putting him at risk for end-organ damage.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels have been elevated, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or other complications related to uncontrolled diabetes.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels have also been low, indicating a risk of hypoglycemic episodes that can cause neurological complications.
4. Agitation and behavioral issues: The patient's agitation may be due to his medical conditions, but it can also increase the risk of injury or worsening of his overall status.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay.
6. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is off, with"

   Assessment and Plan
   25 year old man with ESRD on HD, DM, recent PE who presented with
   hyperkalemia, CP and hypertensive urgency.
   .
   #Hypertensive urgency:  Improved, off labetalol gtt. Likely related to
   his longstanding medication noncompliance.  Also seems to be anxiety
   and agitation component. Additional volume overload also may contribute
   as patient has ESRD and is on HD.  Neuro exam continues to be non-focal
   and head CT negative. Recent  cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue labetalol 600mg TID, and combination of current ACE, [**Last Name (un) 239**],
   clonidine, hydralazine, amlodipine
   - SBP goals 140-160 today
   - Social work consult for med compliance
   .  .
   #Right sub-segmental PE :  No evidence of recurrent clot on CTA on this
   admission.  Confirmed at recent [**Hospital1 183**] admission, reviewed discharge
   records.
   - Heparin drip with coag monitoring for goal PTT 60-80
   - restart coumadin today at 7.5mg daily
   .
   #Agitation: Improved on ativan and home hydroxyzine.
   - switch ativan to PO, dc haldol, change hydroxyzine to prn
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  Resolved issue now. Was likely from ESRD and possible
   shifts in setting of poor glucose control.
   EKG showed peaked Ts. Initially given calcium, insulin/glucose,
   kayexalate.
   - trending daily K, continue hemodialysis sessions
   - continue with Telemetry
   -f/up renal recs
   # ESRD on HD
   - f/up renal recs
   - HD - M,W,F
   - Continue sevelemer, nephrocaps
   - dosed nephrocaps and Vit D at HD sessions
   .
   # DM:  Erratic glucose control even on SSI and Glargine.  FSGs ranging
   from 30-480s and patient managed on insulin drip and then got 1 AMP
   dextrose for sudden drops.
   - keep lower dose 20Units Glargine with SSI for now
   - appreciate [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs
   - diabetic diet , following fingersticks QID
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct appears near baseline in 23-25 range.
   - Check in with renal regarding epo schedule
   - recheck iron stores
   .
   # Thrombocytosis: Most likely  reactive to iron deficiency and ESRD
   - continue to follow daily labs
   .
   # Pruritis
 possible uremia related vs. prurigo nodularis
   - continue Sarna lotion, hydroxyzine and PRN Benadryl

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and a recent pulmonary embolism (PE). He presented with hyperkalemia, chest pain, and hypertensive urgency. His blood pressure was initially high, but it has been controlled with medication adjustments. The patient is currently agitated but responding to lorazepam. His neurological exam is non-focal, and his head CT scan is negative. His cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating no ongoing cardiac damage. The patient's lab results show elevated potassium levels, which have been managed with dialysis and medication adjustments. His glucose control has been erratic, and his HbA1c levels are high. He has anemia with a hematocrit level of 23-25%. He also has thrombocytosis, likely reactive to iron deficiency and ESRD. The patient's pruritus may be related to uremia or prurigo nodularis. He is currently on multiple medications for his conditions, including antihypertensives, antidiabetics, and anticoagulants. He is being closely monitored in the ICU with regular lab tests and follow-up appointments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's history of non-compliance with medication, anxiety, and volume overload may contribute to his hypertensive urgency. It is crucial to monitor"

   25 year old man with ESRD on HD, DM, recent PE who presented with
   hyperkalemia, CP and hypertensive urgency.
   .
   #Hypertensive urgency:  Slowly improving. Likely related to his
   longstanding medication noncompliance.  Also seems to be anxiety and
   agitation component. Additional volume overload also may contribute as
   patient has ESRD and is on HD.  Neuro exam continues to be non-focal
   and head CT negative. Recent  cardiac enzymes negative.
   .
   - continue labetolol drip, and combination of current ACE, [**Last Name (un) 239**],
   clonidine, hydralazine
   - add back home Norvasc dose
   - wean labetolol drip
 switch to PO labetolol
   - SBP goals 160-180s now
   - continue with HD today
   - Social work consult for med compliance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  Resolved issue now. Was likely from ESRD and possible
   shifts in setting of poor glucose control.
   EKG showed peaked Ts. Initially given calcium, insulin/glucose,
   kayexalate.
   - trending daily K, continue hemodialysis sessions
   - continue with Telemetry
   -f/up renal recs
   .
    #Chest pain: Resolved now. Although  + nonspecific ST/T changes on EKG
   , cardiac enzymes showed flat CK levels. Most likely due to small
   pulmonary emboli  vs. anxiety as opposed to true  ACS issue.  Imaging
   r/o dissection.
   on CTA .
   - telemetry
   - aspirin 325mg for now
   .
   #Right sub-segmental PE :  No evidence of recurrent clot on CTA on this
   admission.  Confirmed at recent [**Hospital1 183**] admission, reviewed discharge
   records.
   - Heparin drip with coag monitoring for goal PTT 60-80
   - holding  warfarin while in ICU setting
   .
   #Somnolence: Improved. Occurred yesterday in setting of Benadryl,
   dilaudid and ativan. Meds probably lingered in setting of ESRD.  CT
   head negative and no e/o hypercarbia on ABG.
   -          decrease dose Ativan, only give PRN

   # DM:  Erratic glucose control even on SSI and Glargine.  FSGs ranging
   from 30-480s and patient managed on insulin drip and then got 1 AMP
   dextrose for sudden drops.
   - keep lower dose 12Units Glargine with SSI for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), type I diabetes mellitus (DM), and a recent pulmonary embolism (PE). He presented with hyperkalemia, chest pain, and hypertensive urgency. His current conditions include hypertension, hyperkalemia, acute PE, and anxiety. He is receiving multiple medications including labetalol, norvasc, heparin, omeprazole, lorazepam, and various other ICU medications. His vital signs are stable, and he is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, indicating ongoing high blood pressure. This could lead to further complications such as stroke, heart attack, or organ damage.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high levels of potassium in his blood, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias and other heart problems if not managed properly.
3. Acute Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of PE, which is a serious condition that can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and even death if not treated promptly.
4. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes is poorly controlled, putting him at risk for complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and long-term complications like nephropathy and retinopathy.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels"

","The patient is a 25-year-old man with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and a witnessed cardiac arrest secondary to hypertensive urgency. He is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

From the progress note, we can gather the following information:

1. The patient has been receiving labetalol infusion for hypertension, which was discontinued and replaced with oral medications.
2. He is also being treated for atrial fibrillation, for which he is on rate-controlled medication and receiving intravenous heparin, with plans to transition to warfarin.
3. The patient has chronic kidney disease (CRF) and tolerated hemodialysis (HD), with a net removal of fluid. It is planned to resume the usual HD schedule.
4. His insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is improving, with continued monitoring of glucose levels and scheduled insulin administration.
5. The patient has an underlying anxiety disorder and has been evaluated by psychiatry. Haldol is being used as needed for anxiety.
6. The patient's nutrition is being provided through a regular oral diet.
7. He has two central venous lines inserted on different days.
8. Prophylactic measures include systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
9. The patient's ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is being managed accordingly.

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old man with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and anxiety disorder. He presented to the ICU with hypertensive urgency and is currently well-controlled on oral medications. His past medical history includes retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. The patient underwent hemodialysis yesterday and was seen by a psychiatrist yesterday as well. He is receiving continuous heparin infusion and has been given lorazepam for anxiety. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure reading of 159/93 mmHg. His respiratory rate is within normal limits, and he has an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological assessment indicates that he is attentive, responsive to commands, and follows simple commands. His extremities show no edema, and his skin and respiratory systems are clear. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite being on oral medications. If not managed properly, there is a risk of complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.
2. Infection: The patient is in the ICU, which increases the risk of acquiring infections. Close monitoring for any signs of infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count, is essential.
3. Diabetic complications: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus with associated complications like retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. These conditions can lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.
4. Anxiety disorder: The patient has an anxiety disorder, for which he is receiving benzodiazepine (Ativan) as needed. It is important to monitor his mental status and provide appropriate support and treatment for his anxiety.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet indicates a negative balance of 2,813 mL, suggesting potential fluid loss. Close monitoring of his fluid status is necessary to prevent dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.
6. Renal function: The patient's history of nephropathy and recent hemodialysis indicate underlying renal dysfunction. Ongoing monitoring of renal function and adjusting the treatment accordingly are crucial.

Overall, the patient's current condition appears stable, but vigilant monitoring and appropriate management of these potential complications are necessary to ensure his well-being."
