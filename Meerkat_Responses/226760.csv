","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and atrial fibrillation. She presents with lightheadedness and was found to be in complete heart block (CHB). The etiology of CHB is unclear, but possible causes include degeneration of the conduction system, calcific valvular disease, or infiltration from prior lymphoma. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and is being monitored on telemetry with pacer pads on.

Assessment and Plan:
1. CHB: Unclear etiology. Possible degeneration of her conduction system, possibly from calcific valvular disease. Less likely to be acute ischemia given normal CEZ. Unlikely to be Lyme as she has no exposures. No signs of viral myocarditis on exam. Could be infiltration from prior lymphoma. Digoxin or metoprolol could be contributing but digoxin level normal. Currently hemodynamically stable, intermittently in CHB vs. AFib.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, AS REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN MULTIDISCIPLINARY
   ROUNDS
   Patient is an 88 yo female with history of HTN, Hypercholesterolemia,
   and atrial fibrillation who presents with lightheadedness and found to
   be in complete heart block.
   .
   #. COMPLETE HEART BLOCK. Heart block was thought to be secondary
   medication effects and/or poor conduction system, possibly from
   calcific valvular disease. Digoxin or metoprolol could be contributing
   but digoxin level normal. A chest xray showed calicfications. Acute
   ischemia is unlikely given normal cardiac enzymes. Also, unlikely to be
   Lyme as she has no exposures. No signs of viral myocarditis on exam.
   Infiltration from prior lymphoma would be rare but possible. She has
   been hemodynamically stable since admission with rhythms alternating
   between intermittent CHB and A.fib. Plan to observe until [**12-11**] to [**Month/Year (2) **]
   for medication effects and then consider for pacemaker placement.
   -Telemetry with pacer pads on
   -Hold coumadin for likely PPM once INR reaches 2
   -Hold all nodal agents, including digoxin and metoprolol
   -Will do Echo today to rule out infiltrative disease and establish
   baseline. If negative, will consider cardiac MRI.
   .
   #. Pump: No signs of volume overload currently.
   -Con't home lasix
   -Con't ASA
   -Cardiac Echo
   .
   #. Afib: She was previously controlled on digoxin and metoprolol, with
   coumadin for anticoagulation. Her rhythm agents were held given
   presentation with CHB. Coumadin was held for possible pacemaker
   placment. Would do rate control for rapid ventricular response.
   .
   #. HTN: She had low blood pressures and heart block on admission, so
   metoprolol
   -If becomes severely hypertensive, consider ACE for BP control
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Con't Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Dementia: Con't Aricept
   .
   # GERD: Con't PPI
   .
   #. FEN: Low salt, cardiac diet
   .
   #. Access: PIV
   .
   #. PPx: Coumadin, PPI
   .
   #. Code: Patient states DNR/DNI but given dementia, will confirm with
   HCP first. Attempted to contact again on [**12-11**] but no one answered.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 88 yo female with history of HTN, Hypercholesterolemia,
   and atrial fibrillation who presents with lightheadedness and found to
   be in complete heart block.
   .
   #. CHB: Unclear etiology. Possible degeneration of her conduction
   system, ? from calcific valvular disease. Less likely to be acute
   ischemia given normal CEZ. Unlikely to be Lyme as she has no exposures.
   No signs of viral myocarditis on exam. Could be infiltration from prior
   lymphoma. Digoxin or metoprolol could be contributing but digoxin level
   normal. Currently hemodynamically stable, intermittently in CHB vs.
   A.fib.
   -Telemetry with pacer pads on
   -Hold coumadin for likely PPM once INR reaches 2
   -Hold all nodal agents, including digoxin and metoprolol
   -Cycle CEZ
   -Consider TTE or Cardiac MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for infiltrative disease
   .
   #. Pump: No signs of volume overload currently.
   -Con't home lasix
   -Con't ASA
   .
   #. Afib: Hold digoxin and metoprolol given CHB. Gentle rate control if
   starts going very fast.
   -Hold coumadin
   .
   #. HTN: Hold metoprol given CHB.
   -If becomes severely hypertensive, consider hydral or ACE for BP
   control
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Con't Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Dementia: Con't Aricept
   .
   # GERD: Con't PPI
   .
   #. FEN: Low salt, cardiac diet
   .
   #. Access:  PIV
   .
   #. PPx: Coumadin, PPI
   .
   #. Code:  Patient states DNR/DNI but given dementia, will confirm with
   HCP first.
   .
   #. Dispo:  CCU for now.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and atrial fibrillation. She presented with lightheadedness and was found to be in complete heart block (CHB). The etiology of CHB is unclear, with possibilities including degeneration of the conduction system, calcific valvular disease, acute ischemia, Lyme disease, infiltration from prior lymphoma, or medication effects (such as digoxin or metoprolol). The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, intermittently experiencing CHB and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 67 bpm with a range of 40-75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/68mmHg to 180/93mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute with a range of 14-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is not receiving respiratory support.

The physical examination reveals an elderly female in no acute distress, oriented x3, with appropriate mood and affect. There are no signs of pallor or cyanosis in the oral mucosa. The patient's neck is supple, and the jugular venous pressure (JVP) is not visible. The point of maximal impulse (PMI) is located in the 5"
