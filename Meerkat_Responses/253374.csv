   Assessment and Plan
   55F with multiple myeloma, undergoing active treatment, currently
   neutropenic, now with persistent fevers of unknown source and new
   respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea
   CXR concerning for pulmonary edema. Presumed to be cardiogenic but also
   concern for ARDS. Sats improved with repositioning of oxygen, diuresis
   and treatment of anxiety/tachypnea. Also treating for PCP though unable
   to get  induced sputum.
   -- cont primaquine and clinda for PCP
 [**Name9 (PRE) 11645**] course is 14 days,
   today is day 2. could consider stopping if continues to improve as
   would not expect improvement that quickly from PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] continue diuresis, goal net negative 2L
   -- f/u blood gases
   # Acid/base: mixed disorder. Primary respiratory alkalosis and
   metabolic acidosis [**1-22**] RTA and lactate.
   -- monitor blood gases
   # Febrile neutropenia: Abx restarted on [**2-7**] for recurrent temps.
   Workup extensive and neg to date including cultures, pan scans. Husband
   adds that pt recently had dental work and needs a cavity filled. Has
   been afebrile >24h.
   -- Continue acyclovir, cefepime, voriconazole, vancomycin, primaquine
   and clinda
   -- [**Month (only) 8**] need dental/sinus imaging, given head CT several days ago not
   protocolled to look at this
   -- consider reducing abx as improves
   # Tachycardia: Correlates with respiratory rate, decreases when
   sleeping, decreases when relaxed. Sinus.
   -- diurese as planned
   -- consider beta-blocker but better to treat underlying problem
   #  Multiple myeloma:
   -- continue treatment per oncologist.
   -- line placed for pharesis for protein removal.
   # Renal failure: much worse since admission, type 1 RTA likely due to
   MM..
   -- renal following
   -- has access for dialysis if necessary
   -- no IVF

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple myeloma who is currently undergoing active treatment. She is neutropenic and presents with persistent fevers of unknown origin and new respiratory distress. The patient's chief complaint is dyspnea, and she has been experiencing tachycardia and tachypnea. Her CXR shows signs of pulmonary edema, which could be cardiogenic or due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's oxygen saturation has improved with repositioning of oxygen, diuresis, and treatment for anxiety/tachypnea. She is also being treated for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), although induced sputum could not be obtained.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Dyspnea: The patient's respiratory distress and dyspnea may lead to inadequate oxygenation, resulting in hypoxia.
2. Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema could be cardiogenic in nature, which can worsen over time if not appropriately managed.
3. ARDS: The patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary edema raise concerns for ARDS, a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure.
4. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient's persistent fevers in the setting of neutropenia indicate febrile neutropenia, which is a medical emergency and requires prompt antibiotic treatment.
5. Renal Failure: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple myeloma undergoing active treatment, currently neutropenic, and presenting with persistent fevers of unknown origin and new respiratory distress. She is experiencing hypoxia and dyspnea, and her chest X-ray suggests pulmonary edema, potentially cardiogenic but also concerning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's sats have improved with repositioning of oxygen, diuresis, and treatment of anxiety/tachypnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-ray shows signs of pulmonary edema, which may be cardiogenic in nature. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential cardiac complications if not properly managed.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): ARDS is a severe condition characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs. It can be caused by various factors, including infections, trauma, and inhalation injuries. In this case, the patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary edema raise concern for the development of ARDS.

   # Hypoxia/dyspnea
   Presumed to be cardiogenic but also concern for ARDS; however, CXR
   improved with diuresis. Overnight, vitals improved with resp rates
   around 12, heart rate 110, O2 sats 97 (see chart). Upon awakening and
   with people in room, BP elevated with diastolics > 100, desats to 80s,

  pulmonary edema
   desats/tachypnea/more tachycardia
   -- continue diuresis (5mg metolazone and lasix 120)
   -- limit external stimuli that cause agitation

   # Altered mental status
   Originally presented with AMS, but acutely worse this am. C/w delirium.
   Also with disorganized thought. Ativan had been helping with keep BPs
   and resp rates under control but may be worsening delirium.
   -- zyprexa for agitation
   -- morphine for tachypnea
   # Tachycardia/Tachypnea: Correlates with respiratory rate, decreases
   when sleeping, and decreases when relaxed. Sinus. Had V/Q that was low
   prob on [**2-8**], but PE still on differential, although resolution while

   -- optimize environment/reduce stimuli
   -- diurese as planned
   -- consider beta-blocker but better to treat underlying problem
   # Acid/base: mixed disorder. Primary respiratory alkalosis and

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple myeloma undergoing active treatment, currently neutropenic. She presented with fevers of unknown origin and new respiratory distress. The patient has dyspnea, tachycardia, and altered mental status. There are concerns about cardiogenic hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pulmonary edema. The patient's vital signs have improved with reduced respiratory rates, increased oxygen saturation, and controlled blood pressure. The patient is being treated with diuretics, medication to manage agitation and delirium, and antibiotics. Imaging and lab results are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Dyspnea: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Cardiogenic Hypoxia: The patient may develop further cardiac dysfunction, exacerbating the hypoxia and potentially leading to cardiogenic shock.
3. ARDS: The patient may progress to severe ARDS, which can result in acute respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation.
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's fluid balance needs close monitoring to prevent or manage worsening pulmonary edema.
5. Altered Mental Status/Delirium: The patient's mental status could deteriorate, leading to increased agitation and potential complications such as falls or self-harm.
6. Neutropenia/Febrile Neutropenia: The patient remains at risk for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple myeloma, currently undergoing active treatment and experiencing neutropenia. She presents with persistent fevers of unknown source, respiratory distress, and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. Laboratory results indicate pancytopenia, hypernatremia, and a mixed acid-base disorder. Imaging reveals diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with edema. The patient has been treated with various medications including diuretics, antibiotics, and analgesics. She has also undergone pheresis for her underlying malignancy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory distress could be due to flash pulmonary edema secondary to extensive hydration and systolic heart failure. This condition can lead to severe hypoxia and respiratory failure.
2. Cardiogenic shock: Given the estimated ejection fraction of 40% on most recent echo, there is a concern for cardiogenic shock contributing to the patient's hypotension and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates seen on imaging raise concern for ARDS, which can result in severe hypoxia and respiratory failure.
4. Infection: Despite ongoing antibiotic therapy, the patient's persistent fevers suggest a possible ongoing infection, which may require further evaluation and management.

   55F with multiple myeloma, undergoing active treatment, currently
   neutropenic, now with persistent fevers of unknown source and new
   respiratory distress.
   1.       Pulmonary edema: improved radiographically and with decreased
   oxygen requirement. Plan further diuresis with lasix 120 mg IV and 5 mg
   metolazole
   2.       Sinus tachycardia: some component of anxiety as P decreases to
   100
s while sleeping, up to 150
s with multiple people in rm. On abx
   for presumed sepsis, lung scan low probability for PE. Avoid beta
   blockers due to concern of further aggravating decompensated heart
   failure
   3.       Delirium: Pt requiring frequent re-directing and attempting to
   get OOB. Recent eval has included [**2-8**] LP; [**2-6**] head CT, [**1-30**] head MRI.
   Suspect toxic metabolic/delirium  - will dc ativan and try zyprexa;
   minimize stimuli
   4.       Neutropenia: currently afebrile. Remains on broad spectrum abx
   with acyclovir, cefepime, voriconazole, vancomycin; including empiric
   PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1679**]
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: Secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
   extensive hydration and systolic heart failure (EF estimated ~40% on
   most recent echo).  She is now s/p diuresis with some improvement on
   CXR and reduction in O2 requirement.  Anxiety component to her O2
   requirement, suspect that she become agitated easily becomes
   hypertensive, tachycardic and desats.
   Presumed to be cardiogenic but also concern for ARDS; however, CXR
   improved with diuresis. Overnight, vitals improved with resp rates
   around 12, heart rate 110, O2 sats 97 (see chart). Upon awakening and
   with people in room, BP elevated with diastolics > 100, desats to 80s,
   HR up to 150.  Mental status/delirium/agitation have large impact on
   vitals. Suspect that agitation

   -- continue diuresis (5mg metolazone and lasix 120)
   -- limit external stimuli that cause agitation
   -- treat delirium with zyprexa, agitation/tachypnea with morphine
   -- repeat ABG
   -- low suspicion for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] will continue primaquine/clinda pending

   -- Continue cefepime, vanc for nosocomial coverage, and

   # Altered mental status
   Ddx includes ICU delirium, infectious process, central CNS process.
   CSF has shown no growth thus far, and MRI of head w/o evidence of acute
   process to explain mentation. Patient has received ativan for
   anxiety/tachypnea, though this has likely worsened her delirium.
   -- zyprexa for agitation
   -- morphine for tachypnea
   # Tachycardia/Tachypnea: Correlates with respiratory rate, decreases
   when sleeping, and decreases when relaxed. Sinus. Had V/Q that was low
   prob on [**2-8**], but PE still on differential, although resolution while
   sleeping is reassuring
   -- optimize environment/reduce stimuli
   -- diurese as planned
   -- consider beta-blocker though would hold off while in acute CHF
   # Acid/base: mixed disorder. Primary respiratory alkalosis and
   metabolic acidosis [**1-22**] RTA and lactate.
   -- monitor blood gases
   # Febrile neutropenia: Abx restarted on [**2-7**] for recurrent temps.

   adds that pt recently had dental work and needs a cavity filled. Has
   been afebrile >24h.

   -- [**Month (only) 8**] need dental/sinus imaging, given head CT several days ago not

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple myeloma undergoing active treatment. She is currently neutropenic and presents with persistent fevers of unknown source and new respiratory distress. The patient has multiple medical complications including tachycardia, dyspnea, renal failure, neutropenia, hypoxemia, hypertension, pulmonary edema, altered mental status, and acid/base imbalance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia/Tachypnea: The patient's sinus tachycardia correlates with agitation, oxygen requirement, and tachypnea. Anti-anxiety medications have been given with limited improvement. There is a concern for underlying pulmonary embolism or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), although the chest X-ray improved with diuresis.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels, which can be a result of her respiratory distress and potential pulmonary edema.

3. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on imaging suggests the possibility of pulmonary edema, which is further supported by the patient's symptoms of dyspnea and hypoxemia.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has significantly worsened since admission, likely due to her multiple myeloma. Type 1 renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is suspected.

5. Neutropenia: The patient is neutropenic, indicating a decreased number of neutrophils, which puts"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has been admitted to the ICU and started on several medications including zyprexa, metolazone, and lasix.
- The patient's ABG results show improved PaO2 but worsening respiratory alkalosis.
- The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia, which correlates with agitation, oxygen requirement, and tachypnea. Anti-anxiety medications were given with little improvement, and lopressor was administered.
- Induction of sputum was unsuccessful, and the patient's PO medications were changed to IV medications.
- The patient has a history of multiple myeloma (cancer) and acute renal failure.
- The patient is neutropenic and hypoxic.
- Imaging shows diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with edema, with no significant changes in the heart and mediastinal structures.
- The patient has multiple medical complications including tachycardia, dyspnea, acute renal failure, neutropenia, and hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The presence of diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and worsening respiratory alkalosis may indicate respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia. These conditions can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially require mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac Complications: Sinus tachycardia and the underlying medical history of multiple myeloma may increase the risk of cardiac complications like arrhythmias or heart failure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, currently undergoing active treatment and experiencing neutropenia. She presents with persistent fevers of unknown source and new respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with tachycardia, dyspnea, renal failure, neutropenia, hypoxemia, and altered mental status. She is also experiencing pancytopenia, hypernatremia, and an acid-base disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Dyspnea: The patient's respiratory distress could lead to further hypoxia and dyspnea. This may require ongoing monitoring and intervention to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The extensive hydration and systolic heart failure could lead to flash pulmonary edema, which can compromise lung function and worsen respiratory distress.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's estimated ejection fraction of 40%, there is a concern for cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters is essential.
4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The presence of diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with edema raises concerns for ARDS. This can result in severe respiratory compromise and may require mechanical ventilation.
5. Infections: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient continues to have fevers. There is a concern for ongoing infection, including possibilities such as pneumonia or bloodstream infection.
6. Renal Failure:"

   55F with multiple myeloma, undergoing active treatment, currently
   neutropenic, now with persistent fevers of unknown source and new
   respiratory distress.
   1.       Pulmonary edema: improved radiographically and with decreased
   oxygen requirement. Plan further diuresis with lasix 120 mg IV and 5 mg
   metolazole
   2.       Sinus tachycardia: some component of anxiety as P decreases to
   100
s while sleeping, up to 150
s with multiple people in rm. On abx
   for presumed sepsis, lung scan low probability for PE. Avoid beta
   blockers due to concern of further aggravating decompensated heart
   failure
   3.       Delirium: Pt requiring frequent re-directing and attempting to
   get OOB. Recent eval has included [**2-8**] LP; [**2-6**] head CT, [**1-30**] head MRI.
   Suspect toxic metabolic/delirium  - will dc ativan and try zyprexa;
   minimize stimuli
   4.       Neutropenia: currently afebrile. Remains on broad spectrum abx
   with acyclovir, cefepime, voriconazole, vancomycin; including empiric
   PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1679**]
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: Secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
   extensive hydration and systolic heart failure (EF estimated ~40% on
   most recent echo).  She is now s/p diuresis with some improvement on
   CXR and reduction in O2 requirement.  Anxiety component to her O2
   requirement, suspect that she become agitated easily becomes
   hypertensive, tachycardic and desats.
   Presumed to be cardiogenic but also concern for ARDS; however, CXR
   improved with diuresis. Overnight, vitals improved with resp rates
   around 12, heart rate 110, O2 sats 97 (see chart). Upon awakening and
   with people in room, BP elevated with diastolics > 100, desats to 80s,
   HR up to 150.  Mental status/delirium/agitation have large impact on
   vitals. Suspect that agitation

   -- continue diuresis (5mg metolazone and lasix 120)
   -- limit external stimuli that cause agitation
   -- treat delirium with zyprexa, agitation/tachypnea with morphine
   -- repeat ABG
   -- low suspicion for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] will continue primaquine/clinda pending

   CSF has shown no growth thus far, and MRI of head w/o evidence of acute
   process to explain mentation. Patient has received ativan for
   anxiety/tachypnea, though this has likely worsened her delirium.
   -- zyprexa for agitation
   -- morphine for tachypnea
   # Tachycardia/Tachypnea: Correlates with respiratory rate, decreases
   when sleeping, and decreases when relaxed. Sinus. Had V/Q that was low
   prob on [**2-8**], but PE still on differential, although resolution while
   sleeping is reassuring
   -- optimize environment/reduce stimuli
   -- diurese as planned
   -- consider beta-blocker though would hold off while in acute CHF
   # Acid/base: mixed disorder. Primary respiratory alkalosis and
   metabolic acidosis [**1-22**] RTA and lactate.
   -- monitor blood gases
   # Febrile neutropenia: Abx restarted on [**2-7**] for recurrent temps.

   adds that pt recently had dental work and needs a cavity filled. Has

   and clinda
   -- [**Month (only) 8**] need dental/sinus imaging, given head CT several days ago not

   -- consider reducing abx as improves
   #  Multiple myeloma:
   -- continue treatment per oncologist.
   -- line placed for pheresis for protein removal.
   # Renal failure: much worse since admission, type 1 RTA likely due to

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple myeloma undergoing active treatment.
- She is currently neutropenic, with persistent fevers of unknown origin and new respiratory distress.
- The patient has a history of cancer, malignancy, renal failure, acute renal failure, and neutropenia.
- She is experiencing sinus tachycardia, delirium, hypoxemia, and pulmonary edema.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure of 114/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated potassium levels, and abnormal kidney function.
- Imaging reveals diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with edema, unchanged heart and mediastinal structures, and a right internal jugular catheter in place.
- The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for tachycardia, dyspnea, multiple myeloma, acute renal failure, and neutropenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Complications:
- The patient has signs of pulmonary edema and respiratory distress, which could lead to further respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates suggests the possibility of pneumonia or other lung infections.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma undergoing active treatment. She presented with persistent fevers of unknown origin, respiratory distress, and neutropenia. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including acyclovir, cefepime, voriconazole, and vancomycin. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure of 114/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. Her physical examination reveals delirium, dry mucous membranes, bibasilar rales, and no rash or edema. 

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.3 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 37 K/uL. Blood cultures have been negative so far. Imaging shows diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with edema, which has improved with diuretics. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pulmonary edema: Improved radiographically and with decreased oxygen requirement. Plan further diuresis with lasix 120 mg IV and 5 mg metolazole.
2. Sinus tachycardia: Some component"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple myeloma undergoing active treatment. She is currently neutropenic, with persistent fevers of unknown source and new respiratory distress. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note are:

1. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient may experience worsening respiratory distress due to flash pulmonary edema caused by extensive hydration and possible systolic heart failure.

2. Systolic heart failure: The estimated ejection fraction (EF) of the patient's heart is around 40%, indicating mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function. This could lead to systolic heart failure if not managed properly.

3. Infection: The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers of unknown source, which may indicate an underlying infection. Further investigation and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to control and treat any potential infections.

4. Delirium: The patient is also experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to ICU delirium, an infectious process, or a central nervous system process. It is important to manage and treat the underlying cause of delirium.

5. Hypoxemia: The patient is hypoxic, requiring supplemental oxygen. This could be secondary to the flash pulmonary edema, respiratory distress, or an underlying lung condition.

6. Renal failure: The patient's renal function has worsened since admission, and she has acute renal failure (ARF) with type 1 renal tubular"

   No deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.
   CXR:
   As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs suggesting
   centralized pulmonary edema have minimally increased. The size of the
   cardiac silhouette is stable. There is no evidence of pleural
   effusions.
   CT Chest:
   1. Simple cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis.
   2. Unchanged bilateral breast silicone granulomata.
   3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
   4. Nonspecific patchy tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 2717**] appearance in the anterior portion of
   the upper lobe of the lungs, unchanged from ten days ago, could
   represent inflammatory or early infection.
   5. Multiple osteolytic lesions along the spine, left fifth rib, right
   scapular and pelvic and acetabulum, compatible with history of multiple
   myeloma.
   Echo:
   Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular systolic function is
   difficult to assess given fast heart rate and poor acoustic windows but
   appears at least mildly depressed (LVEF~40%). Very small posterior
   pericardial effusion. Resting tachycardia.
   MRI head:
   1. Limited evaluation without administration of intravenous gadolinium.
   If the EGFR is greater than 60, a contrast enhanced MRI may be
   obtained.
   2. Stable microangiopathic ischemic white matter disease.
   3. Heterogeneous low signal intensity within the bone marrow with
   progression of infiltration in the C2 vertebral body, compatible with
   the patient's history of multiple myeloma. Recommend bone scan for
   further evaluation

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple myeloma undergoing active treatment. She is currently neutropenic, experiencing persistent fevers of unknown source, and presenting with new respiratory distress. The patient's hypoxia and dyspnea are secondary to flash pulmonary edema due to extensive hydration and possible systolic heart failure. She has improved with diuresis, although her O2 requirement and tachypnea worsen with agitation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to ICU delirium, an infectious process, or a central nervous system process. CSF culture is negative, and an MRI head with low signal intensity within the bone marrow and progression of infiltration is recommended.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be related to hypoxia, malignancy, agitation, or diuresis. Optimizing the environment, reducing stimuli, holding diuresis, and continuing metoprolol IV q6 are advised.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has stable pancytopenia with negative hemolysis labs. Transfusion for hct <24, plt <10, and if signs of bleed, as well as continuing Neupogen, are recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple myeloma undergoing active treatment. She is currently neutropenic with persistent fevers and new respiratory distress. The patient has several medical complications including altered mental status, tachycardia, dyspnea, renal failure, anemia, hypernatremia, acid-base imbalance, and febrile neutropenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to delirium. It is important to continue treating delirium and optimize the environment to reduce stimuli.
2. Infection: The patient is neutropenic and has persistent fevers of unknown source. There is a need for ongoing surveillance and evaluation for potential infections. Empirical antibiotic coverage has been initiated.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient may have flash pulmonary edema secondary to extensive hydration and possible systolic heart failure. Diuretics have been used to improve symptoms, but ongoing monitoring and management are required.
4. Heart Failure: The patient's estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is ~40%, indicating mild depression of left ventricular systolic function. Close monitoring of cardiac status and consideration of heart failure management are necessary.
5. Multiple Myeloma: The patient has a history of multiple myeloma, and treatment per oncologist recommendations should continue. Pheresis for protein removal has been initiated.

   MRI head:
   1. Limited evaluation without administration of intravenous gadolinium.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple myeloma undergoing active treatment, currently neutropenic, and presenting with persistent fevers of unknown source and new respiratory distress. She has altered mental status, tachycardia, dyspnea, renal failure, and hypoxemia. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, antivirals, and diuretics. Her condition remains stable with ongoing management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers and respiratory distress could indicate an ongoing infection, potentially leading to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemia and bilateral pleural effusions may suggest the development of ARDS, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
3. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's mildly depressed left ventricular ejection fraction and signs of centralized pulmonary edema indicate possible cardiac involvement. Close monitoring of cardiac function is necessary.
4. Renal failure exacerbation: The patient's worsening renal function, particularly the development of type 1 RTA, needs careful attention. Measures to optimize renal function and prevent further deterioration should be implemented.
5. Multiple myeloma progression: As the patient has a history of multiple myeloma, there is a risk of disease progression, which can impact her overall prognosis and treatment outcomes.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary emb"

   I saw and examined the patient with the [**Hospital **] medical team.  The
   assessment and plan was discussed and is detailed in Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11565**]
s note.
   I would emphasize the following. Mental status unchanged.  On exam
   opens eyes to voice, not responding meaningfully, moaning.  PERRL
   Tachy, regular  Lungs with dependent crackles, occasional wheeze  no
   edema.
   Labs as above LENIs negative
   Tolerating pheresis.  Discussed with renal service who also plans to
   dialyze her given that uremia may also be contributing to altered
   mental status.  Follow up  on MM CSF workup as above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple myeloma undergoing active treatment, currently neutropenic, with persistent fevers of unknown source and new respiratory distress. The patient has multiple medical complications including altered mental status, tachycardia, dyspnea, renal failure, anemia, and hypernatremia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to delirium, which is common in ICU patients. It can be caused by various factors such as medications, infections, or systemic inflammation.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing shortness of breath and has crackles in the lungs, indicating pulmonary edema. This can lead to hypoxemia and respiratory failure if not managed promptly.

3. Renal failure: The patient has worsening renal function, likely exacerbated by extensive hydration and treatment-related kidney injury. Acute kidney injury can progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.

4. Neutropenia: The patient is neutropenic due to chemotherapy, making her more susceptible to infections. Fever in neutropenic patients is considered an emergency as it may indicate a severe infection.

5. Multiple myeloma: The patient has a history of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. Complications related to the disease itself, such as bone lesions and infections, need to be monitored and managed.

   Imaging: LENIs:
   No deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.
   CXR:
   As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs suggesting
   centralized pulmonary edema have minimally increased. The size of the
   cardiac silhouette is stable. There is no evidence of pleural
   effusions.
   CT Chest:
   1. Simple cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis.
   2. Unchanged bilateral breast silicone granulomata.
   3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
   4. Nonspecific patchy tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 2717**] appearance in the anterior portion of
   the upper lobe of the lungs, unchanged from ten days ago, could
   represent inflammatory or early infection.
   5. Multiple osteolytic lesions along the spine, left fifth rib, right
   scapular and pelvic and acetabulum, compatible with history of multiple
   myeloma.
   Echo:
   Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular systolic function is
   difficult to assess given fast heart rate and poor acoustic windows but
   appears at least mildly depressed (LVEF~40%). Very small posterior
   pericardial effusion. Resting tachycardia.
   MRI head:
   1. Limited evaluation without administration of intravenous gadolinium.
   If the EGFR is greater than 60, a contrast enhanced MRI may be
   obtained.
   2. Stable microangiopathic ischemic white matter disease.
   3. Heterogeneous low signal intensity within the bone marrow with
   progression of infiltration in the C2 vertebral body, compatible with
   the patient's history of multiple myeloma. Recommend bone scan for
   further evaluation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple myeloma undergoing active treatment. She is currently neutropenic and experiencing persistent fevers of unknown source along with new respiratory distress. The patient's hypoxia and dyspnea are likely due to flash pulmonary edema caused by extensive hydration and possible systolic heart failure. She has shown improvement with diuresis, but her O2 requirement and tachypnea worsen with agitation.

The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to her CSF showing monoclonal IgG in the past, with current CSF results pending. The patient's MRI head revealed low signal intensity within the bone marrow and progression of infiltration. Uremia remains a possibility as well.

The patient's tachycardia is likely related to hypoxia, diuresis, malignancy, and agitation. She had a V/Q scan that was low probability on 02/08, and her LENIs were negative. Optimizing her environment, reducing stimuli, matching intake and output, and continuing metoprolol IV q6 are recommended.

The patient's pancytopenia is evident with a platelet count of 9 today. Hemolysis labs were negative, so she requires a transfusion of 1 unit platelets today. She should also be transfused for a hematocrit (Hct) less than 24, platelet count less than 10, and if there are"

   Imaging: LENIs:
   No deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.
   CXR:
   As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs suggesting
   centralized pulmonary edema have minimally increased. The size of the
   cardiac silhouette is stable. There is no evidence of pleural
   effusions.
   CT Chest:
   1. Simple cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis.
   2. Unchanged bilateral breast silicone granulomata.
   3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
   4. Nonspecific patchy tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 2717**] appearance in the anterior portion of
   the upper lobe of the lungs, unchanged from ten days ago, could
   represent inflammatory or early infection.
   5. Multiple osteolytic lesions along the spine, left fifth rib, right
   scapular and pelvic and acetabulum, compatible with history of multiple
   myeloma.
   Echo:
   Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular systolic function is
   difficult to assess given fast heart rate and poor acoustic windows but
   appears at least mildly depressed (LVEF~40%). Very small posterior
   pericardial effusion. Resting tachycardia.
   MRI head:
   1. Limited evaluation without administration of intravenous gadolinium.
   If the EGFR is greater than 60, a contrast enhanced MRI may be
   obtained.
   2. Stable microangiopathic ischemic white matter disease.
   3. Heterogeneous low signal intensity within the bone marrow with
   progression of infiltration in the C2 vertebral body, compatible with
   the patient's history of multiple myeloma. Recommend bone scan for
   further evaluation

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical issues. The patient has a history of multiple myeloma, which is a type of cancer that affects plasma cells in the bone marrow. This can lead to complications such as bone pain, anemia, and increased risk of infections.

The patient is also experiencing renal failure, as indicated by elevated levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen in the blood. Renal failure can result from the multiple myeloma itself or from complications related to treatment.

The patient is neutropenic, meaning they have a low white blood cell count, which increases the risk of infection. They are also hypoxic, indicating low oxygen levels in the blood.

Other issues mentioned in the progress note include altered mental status, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), dyspnea (shortness of breath), and potential complications like deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition, manage their multiple myeloma treatment, address the renal failure, and prevent and manage any potential infections or complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient tolerated pheresis well and has been scheduled for hemodialysis (HD) tomorrow. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 121/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications including metoprolol and antibiotics such as voriconazole, vancomycin, clindamycin, acyclovir, and cefepime. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for altered mental status, tachycardia, and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of acute renal failure, neutropenia, and hypoxemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics indicating a concern for infection. The microbiology results show no growth in the fluid culture, but further monitoring is necessary to rule out any potential infections.
2. Renal failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and close monitoring of renal function is essential.
3. Neutropenia: The patient has neutropenia, which increases the risk of infections. Monitoring for signs of infection and taking appropriate preventive measures is important.

   Imaging: LENIs:
   No deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.
   CXR:
   As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs suggesting
   centralized pulmonary edema have minimally increased. The size of the
   cardiac silhouette is stable. There is no evidence of pleural
   effusions.
   CT Chest:
   1. Simple cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis.
   2. Unchanged bilateral breast silicone granulomata.
   3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
   4. Nonspecific patchy tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 2717**] appearance in the anterior portion of
   the upper lobe of the lungs, unchanged from ten days ago, could
   represent inflammatory or early infection.
   5. Multiple osteolytic lesions along the spine, left fifth rib, right
   scapular and pelvic and acetabulum, compatible with history of multiple
   myeloma.
   Echo:
   Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular systolic function is
   difficult to assess given fast heart rate and poor acoustic windows but
   appears at least mildly depressed (LVEF~40%). Very small posterior
   pericardial effusion. Resting tachycardia.
   MRI head:
   1. Limited evaluation without administration of intravenous gadolinium.
   If the EGFR is greater than 60, a contrast enhanced MRI may be
   obtained.
   2. Stable microangiopathic ischemic white matter disease.
   3. Heterogeneous low signal intensity within the bone marrow with
   progression of infiltration in the C2 vertebral body, compatible with
   the patient's history of multiple myeloma. Recommend bone scan for
   further evaluation

   55F with multiple myeloma, undergoing active treatment, currently
   neutropenic, now with persistent fevers of unknown source and new
   respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: Secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
   extensive hydration and possible systolic heart failure (EF estimated
   ~40% on most recent echo though this was a suboptimal study).  She has
   improved with diuresis, though O2 requirement/tachypnea worsens with
   agitation.
   -- Goal is for net even
   -- Plasmapharesis/HD (see below)
   -- Continue cefepime, vanc for nosocomial coverage, and
   voriconazole/acyclovir emperically
   # Altered mental status: Improved today . CSF w/ monoclonal IgG in the
   past, most current CSF pep pending.  CSF cx has been negative.  MRI
   head w/ low signal intensity w/in bone marrow and progression of
   infiltration.  Also in the setting of RF, uremia remains a possibility.
   -- Pheresis today
   -- HD today
   -- Cont zyprexa for agitation
   # Tachycardia:  Likely related to hypoxia, diuresis, malignancy,
   agitation.  Had V/Q that was low prob on [**2-8**], and LENIs negative.
   -- Optimize environment/reduce stimuli
   -- Try to match in
s and out
   -- Cont metoprolol iv q6
   # Pancytopenia: Plts 9 today. Hemolysis labs negative.
   -- Transfuse 1 unit platelets today
   -- Transfuse for hct < 24, plt <10, and if signs of bleed
   -- Cont neupogen
   # Hypernatremia: Resume D5W and monitor.
   # Acid/base: mixed disorder. Respiratory alkalosis and metabolic
   acidosis [**1-22**] RTA and lactate.  Monitor blood gas as needed.
   # Febrile neutropenia: Abx restarted on [**2-7**] for recurrent temps.
   Workup extensive and neg to date including cultures, pan scans. Has not
   been febrile in the ICU.
   -- Continue acyclovir, cefepime, voriconazole, vancomycin
   #  Multiple myeloma:
   -- continue treatment per oncologist.
   -- pheresis today.
   -- If needing dialysis, may no longer need pheresis as the point of
   pheresis was to save the kidneys
   -- Will d/w hem/onc whether will be receiving treatment for MM given
   that pheresis alone is not sustainable tx
   # Renal failure: much worse since admission, type 1 RTA likely due to
   MM also probably worsened by diuresis.
   -- appreciate renal recs
   -- HD today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple myeloma, currently undergoing active treatment. She is neutropenic and presents with persistent fevers of unknown source and new respiratory distress. The patient has altered mental status, tachycardia, dyspnea, pancytopenia, hypernatremia, acid/base imbalance, febrile neutropenia, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing shortness of breath and requires oxygen supplementation. This could be due to flash pulmonary edema secondary to extensive hydration and possible systolic heart failure.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened since admission, and she likely has type 1 RTA (Renal Tubular Acidosis) due to multiple myeloma, which may be exacerbated by diuresis.
3. Febrile Neutropenia: Despite extensive workup, the patient's recurrent fever remains unexplained. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count (9 today), and hemolysis labs are negative. She requires platelet transfusion and continues to receive Neupogen.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to uremia, infection, or malignancy. CSF analysis is pending.
6. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, likely related to hypoxia, diuresis, malignancy, and agitation.
7. Multiple Myeloma: The patient's cancer continues to be treated, and plasmapheresis is planned today.
8. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and she is receiving D5W to correct it.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation and management plan."

   Imaging: LENIs:
   No deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.
   CXR:
   As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs suggesting
   centralized pulmonary edema have minimally increased. The size of the
   cardiac silhouette is stable. There is no evidence of pleural
   effusions.
   CT Chest:
   1. Simple cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis.
   2. Unchanged bilateral breast silicone granulomata.
   3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
   4. Nonspecific patchy tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 2717**] appearance in the anterior portion of
   the upper lobe of the lungs, unchanged from ten days ago, could
   represent inflammatory or early infection.
   5. Multiple osteolytic lesions along the spine, left fifth rib, right
   scapular and pelvic and acetabulum, compatible with history of multiple
   myeloma.
   Echo:
   Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular systolic function is
   difficult to assess given fast heart rate and poor acoustic windows but
   appears at least mildly depressed (LVEF~40%). Very small posterior
   pericardial effusion. Resting tachycardia.
   MRI head:
   1. Limited evaluation without administration of intravenous gadolinium.
   If the EGFR is greater than 60, a contrast enhanced MRI may be
   obtained.
   2. Stable microangiopathic ischemic white matter disease.
   3. Heterogeneous low signal intensity within the bone marrow with
   progression of infiltration in the C2 vertebral body, compatible with
   the patient's history of multiple myeloma. Recommend bone scan for
   further evaluation

 [**Last Name 9**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   55F with multiple myeloma, undergoing active treatment, currently
   neutropenic, now with persistent fevers of unknown source and new
   respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: Secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
   extensive hydration and possible systolic heart failure (EF estimated
   ~40% on most recent echo though this was a suboptimal study).  She has
   improved with diuresis, though O2 requirement/tachypnea worsens with
   agitation.
   -- Plasmapharesis/HD (see below)
   -- Continue cefepime, vanc for nosocomial coverage, and
   voriconazole/acyclovir
   # Altered mental status: Improved today . CSF w/ monoclonal IgG in the
   past, most current CSF pep pending.  CSF cx has been negative.  MRI
   head w/ low signal intensity w/in bone marrow and progression of
   infiltration.  Also in the setting of RF, uremia remains a possibility.
   -- Pheresis today
   -- HD today
   -- Cont zyprexa for agitation
   # Tachycardia:  Likely related to hypoxia, diuresis, malignancy,
   agitation.  Had V/Q that was low prob on [**2-8**], and LENIs negative.
   -- Optimize environment/reduce stimuli
   -- Try to match in
s and out
   -- Cont metoprolol iv q6
   # Pancytopenia: Plts 9 today. Hemolysis labs negative.
   -- Transfuse 1 unit platelets today
   -- Transfuse for hct < 24, plt <10, and if signs of bleed
   -- Cont neupogen
   # Hypernatremia: Continue to monitor, can resume free water if trends
   up again.
   # Acid/base: mixed disorder. Respiratory alkalosis and metabolic
   acidosis [**1-22**] RTA and lactate.  Monitor blood gas as needed.
   # Febrile neutropenia: Abx restarted on [**2-7**] for recurrent temps.
   Workup extensive and neg to date including cultures, pan scans. Has not
   been febrile in the ICU.
   -- Continue acyclovir, cefepime, voriconazole, vancomycin
   #  Multiple myeloma:
   -- continue treatment per oncologist.
   -- pheresis today.
   -- If needing dialysis, may no longer need pheresis as the point of
   pheresis was to save the kidneys
   -- Will d/w hem/onc whether will be receiving treatment for MM given
   that pheresis alone is not sustainable tx
   # Renal failure: much worse since admission, type 1 RTA likely due to
   MM also probably worsened by diuresis.
   -- appreciate renal recs
   -- HD today

   I saw and examined the patient with the medical resident and was
   present for key portions of the services provided.  The assessment and
   plan was discussed and is detailed above.  I would emphasize and add
   the following.  Perhaps slightly more awake this morning albeit only
   oriented to place.  She received pheresis this morning.
   Hemodynamically stable.
   Lungs with crackles at bases abdomen soft, nontender
   CXR with hilar fullness
   No significant change in mental status on pheresis. Plan for
   hemodialysis this afternoon. Will request volume removal.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with multiple myeloma, currently undergoing active treatment. She is neutropenic and experiencing persistent fevers of unknown origin along with new respiratory distress. The patient has altered mental status, tachycardia, and dyspnea. She has shown improvement with diuresis but requires oxygen due to hypoxia. The patient has acute renal failure, anemia, and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 121/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal dysfunction. Imaging studies reveal pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and multiple osteolytic lesions consistent with multiple myeloma. The patient's CSF analysis shows monoclonal IgG. She is currently receiving multiple antibiotics, antivirals, and plasmapheresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to her neutropenic state and ongoing fevers. Monitoring for signs of infection and administering appropriate antibiotics is crucial.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's dyspnea and hypoxia may indicate respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary. Further evaluation of the lungs, such"

   difficult to assess given fast heart rate and poor acoustic windows but
   appears at least mildly depressed (LVEF~40%). Very small posterior
   pericardial effusion. Resting tachycardia.
   MRI head:
   1. Limited evaluation without administration of intravenous gadolinium.
   If the EGFR is greater than 60, a contrast enhanced MRI may be
   obtained.
   2. Stable microangiopathic ischemic white matter disease.
   3. Heterogeneous low signal intensity within the bone marrow with
   progression of infiltration in the C2 vertebral body, compatible with
   the patient's history of multiple myeloma. Recommend bone scan for
   further evaluation

 [**Last Name 9**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   55F with multiple myeloma, undergoing active treatment, currently
   neutropenic, now with persistent fevers of unknown source and new
   respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia/dyspnea: Secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
   extensive hydration and possible systolic heart failure (EF estimated
   ~40% on most recent echo though this was a suboptimal study).  She has
   improved with diuresis, though O2 requirement/tachypnea worsens with
   agitation.
   -- Plasmapharesis/HD (see below)
   -- Continue cefepime, vanc for nosocomial coverage, and
   voriconazole/acyclovir
   # Altered mental status: Improved today . CSF w/ monoclonal IgG in the
   past, most current CSF pep pending.  CSF cx has been negative.  MRI
   head w/ low signal intensity w/in bone marrow and progression of
   infiltration.  Also in the setting of RF, uremia remains a possibility.
   -- Pheresis today
   -- HD today
   -- Cont zyprexa for agitation
   # Tachycardia:  Likely related to hypoxia, diuresis, malignancy,
   agitation.  Had V/Q that was low prob on [**2-8**], and LENIs negative.
   -- Optimize environment/reduce stimuli
   -- Try to match in
s and out
   -- Cont metoprolol iv q6
   # Pancytopenia: Plts 9 today. Hemolysis labs negative.
   -- Transfuse 1 unit platelets today
   -- Transfuse for hct < 24, plt <10, and if signs of bleed
   -- Cont neupogen
   # Hypernatremia: Continue to monitor, can resume free water if trends
   up again.
   # Acid/base: mixed disorder. Respiratory alkalosis and metabolic
   acidosis [**1-22**] RTA and lactate.  Monitor blood gas as needed.
   # Febrile neutropenia: Abx restarted on [**2-7**] for recurrent temps.
   Workup extensive and neg to date including cultures, pan scans. Has not
   been febrile in the ICU.
   -- Continue acyclovir, cefepime, voriconazole, vancomycin
   #  Multiple myeloma:
   -- continue treatment per oncologist.
   -- pheresis today.
   -- If needing dialysis, may no longer need pheresis as the point of
   pheresis was to save the kidneys
   -- Will d/w hem/onc whether will be receiving treatment for MM given
   that pheresis alone is not sustainable tx
   # Renal failure: much worse since admission, type 1 RTA likely due to
   MM also probably worsened by diuresis.
   -- appreciate renal recs
   -- HD today
