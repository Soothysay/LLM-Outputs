","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia and smoking. She presented with a STEMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the omohyoid artery. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but there are small T wave inversions on the EKG. She has been experiencing anxiety, difficulty sleeping, and nausea, for which she has been given lorazepam and compazine. The patient's lab results show elevated troponin levels, but resolution of ST changes on the ECG post-intervention. The plan includes continued antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, statins, monitoring of cardiac enzymes, an echocardiogram, and counseling on smoking cessation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial infarction (MI) - The patient presented with a STEMI and underwent PCI, indicating ongoing cardiac issues.
2. Arrhythmias - Small T wave inversions on the EKG may suggest potential arrhythmias.
3. Anxiety and sleep disturbances - The patient's symptoms of high anxiety, difficulty sleeping, and nausea may indicate an underlying psychological response to the recent cardiac event.
4. Medication interactions - It is important to monitor for any potential drug interactions, especially considering the patient's use of multiple medications.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobilization in the"

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia and smoking, who presented with a STEMI. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the occluded marginal branch. The EKG this morning shows no ST changes, myocardial band (MB) peaked in the 300s, and cardiac enzymes are trending down.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's recent STEMI and PCI, there is a risk of recurrent myocardial ischemia or infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias, or stent thrombosis.

2. Bleeding complications: Due to the use of anticoagulant medications such as eptifibatide, there is a risk of bleeding, especially with procedures like a nasal swab or arterial blood gas sampling.

3. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections like ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prophylactic measures have been taken with subcutaneous heparin to reduce the risk of DVT, but there is still a possibility of developing a clot.

5. Medication side effects: The patient is on multiple medications including statins, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and antiplatelet agents, which can have their own side effects.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia and smoking who presented with a STEMI. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the occluded marginal (OM) artery. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, and she is experiencing no further chest pain or shortness of breath. 

The echocardiogram showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferolateral hypokinesis/akinesis, while the right ventricular chamber size and motion were normal. There were no significant changes in the aortic or mitral valve leaflets.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/65 mmHg to 105/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. The creatinine level is within normal range, while the troponin-T levels are decreasing. Other lab values, including potassium, sodium, chloride, magnesium, and calcium, are within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,581 mL and output of 2,925 mL, resulting in a negative balance"

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia and smoking, who presented with a STEMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the omotorium (OM). She is currently in the ICU for further management. 

On the latest progress note, the patient complained of persistent nausea yesterday, but it resolved by this morning. She also had mid-low back pain, but there was no suspicion of retroperitoneal bleed. An EKG was done without any change. An ultrasound of the right groin showed no fistula, pseudoaneurysm, or other abnormalities. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is stable. 

The patient continues to experience some groin bleeding, but her hemoglobin (Hct) level is now 36.2, which is stable. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) was performed yesterday, showing normal left atrium size, normal left ventricular wall thickness, and normal left ventricular cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid-inferolateral hypokinesis/akinesis, but overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF > 55%).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia and smoking who presented with a STEMI. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the omohyoid artery. Her cardiac enzymes continue to trend downward, indicating improvement. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis/akinesis in the basal to mid inferolateral wall, but overall left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is normal (>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and motion are normal. The patient has no aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation and mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. She has been receiving eftifibatide, aspirin, clopidogrel, low-dose metoprolol, and statin therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and her beta blocker has been held. She may require IV fluids and encouragement of oral intake to maintain blood pressure.
2. Tobacco Abuse: Both the patient and her husband have significant smoking histories and are current smokers. Smoking cessation counseling and a social work consult are recommended.
3. Anxiety: The patient continues to experience anxiety, for which she is prescribed lorazepam to be taken at home as needed. Nausea and anxiety are managed with compazine.
4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a medical history of hyperlipidemia and smoking. She presented with a STEMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the occluded marginal (OM) artery. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, and she has no further chest pain or shortness of breath. An echocardiogram showed mild regional left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction with basal to mid-inferolateral hypokinesis/akinesis. The patient is currently being treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, low-dose metoprolol, statin, and eftifibatide (which has been completed). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's recent STEMI and the presence of regional LV systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis/akinesis indicate a potential complication related to her heart attack.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to experience persistent hypotension despite IV fluid boluses. This could lead to complications such as organ hypoperfusion and shock.
3. Tobacco Abuse: The patient and her husband have significant smoking histories and are current smokers. Continued tobacco use increases the risk of future cardiovascular events and worsens the patient's current condition.
4. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety, for which she is receiving lorazepam and compazine as needed. If not properly managed, anxiety can contribute to increased"

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old woman with past medical history significant for
   hyperlipidemia, smoking, who presented with STEMI, now s/p PCI with
   stent to OM.
   # Hypotension
   Patient with persistent hypotension, particularly while sleeping,
   despite 3L of IVFs in last 24hrs.  Systolic pressures in upper 70s
   while sleeping, increased to 90s while awake.  Has not been able to get
   metoprolol doses due to low blood pressures.  Patient w increased po
   intake in last 24 hrs though still not significant.  Denies symptoms of
   lightheadedness of dizziness while standing or walking.
   - hold metoprolol for SBP<100
   # Posterior STEMI
   s/p PTCA and DES placed in OM.  Cardiac enzymes continue to trend
   down.  No further chest pain. No shortness of breath.    Finished 18hrs
   eftifibatide after cath.  Echo showed mild regional LV systolic
   dysfunction w basal to mid inferolateral hypokinesis/akinesis with
   normal RV wall motion and chamber size.
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin
   - holding metoprolol while BPs still low, but will start as outpatient
   - start low dose ACE inhibitor as outpatient if BP tolerates
   - outpt f/u w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3494**] 2 weeks
   # Tobacco Abuse
   Both patient and her husband have significant smoking history; pt has
   been counseled significantly by CCU staff and housestaff about the
   importance of smoking cessation.
   -          counsel on smoking cessation
   -          Social Work consult
   # Anxiety
   -          continue home dose lorazepam as needed
   # Hyperlipidemia
   - continue simvastatin
   - fluids IV

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia, smoking, and previous STEMI. She presented with STEMI and underwent PCI with stent placement in the OM. She continues to show decreasing cardiac enzymes and has no further chest pain or shortness of breath. An echocardiogram revealed mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferolateral hypokinesis/akinesis, normal RV wall motion, and chamber size. 

The patient's vital signs show persistent hypotension, particularly while sleeping, despite receiving 3 liters of IV fluids in the last 24 hours. Her systolic pressures range from the upper 70s while sleeping to the 90s while awake. She denies symptoms of lightheadedness or dizziness while standing or walking. 

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 7.8-8.1 thousand/mm3, Hct of 34.9-36.2%, Plt of 249-241 thousand/mm3, Cr of 0.5-0.6 mg/dL, and Troponin-T levels decreasing from 10.60 to 3.19 ng/mL. 

The patient's current medications include aspirin, Plavix, simvastatin, and lorazepam as needed for anxiety. She is also receiving IV fluids.
