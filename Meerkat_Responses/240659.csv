   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 75 yo F with PMHx of CAD s/p CABG & MVRin [**2168**], PVD, CKD,
   past TIA, and HTN s/p right common and external illiac stent placement,
   left CEA, and left fem-[**Doctor Last Name 114**] presents with hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt with hypoxic respiratory distress
   requiring intubation.  Likely multifactorial in the setting pulmonary
   edema, pneumonia, anemia she also was having thick secretions
   concerning for acute mucus plugging. Pt with large A-a gradient ~460.
   Given patient acute decompensation also concerning for PE given pt is
   post-sugical, but has been on DVT ppx.
   -- change abx regimen for HAP to vanco/zosyn (cover for aspiration)/
   cipro (double cover). Pt previously on Vanco/Cefepime since [**1-24**] even
   though unlikely this represents failure given that she continues to
   spike and given acute decompensation will change regimen
   -- sputum cx
   -- cont lasix gtt & metolazone with goal -1-2L
   -- albuterol/atrovent MDI
   -- aggressive pulm toleit
   -- ABG and will cont current vent setting. Wean as tolerated
   -- sedation with propofol
   -- consider CTA if hypoxia does not improve or develops hyoptension
   .
   #. Fever: Pt with fevers for 1 week. Possible sources include HAP,
   surgical wound, and CVL. Pt has been on Vanco/Cefepime since [**1-24**] and
   tylenol. Pt without leukocytosis.  Other causes of fevers include drug
   reaction, vasculitis, connective tissue disease, but these causes are
   less likely given infectious risk factors.
   -- change abx to Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro as above
   -- will likely need CVL removed and cultured
   -- sputum cx
   -- blood and urine cx
   -- wound swab
   -- will have vascular eval surgical wound
   -- trend WBC and fever curve
   -- tylenol prn
   .
   #. Acute Decompensated CHF: Pt [**Name (NI) **] showed EF >65. Likely fluid
   overloaded and has been on lasix gtt.
   -- cont diuresis as above with lasix gtt
   -- metolazone 2.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -- goal 1-2L negative
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt with left renal artery stenosis.
   Pt is being following renal. Likely worsening creatinine secondary from
   diuresis.
   -- cont lasix gtt
   -- renal recs if any
   -- renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #. CAD s/p CABG [**2168**]- Pt ECG back to baseline on admission to the MICU.
   CE negative x1.
   -- ROMI
   -- cont ASA 325mg, plavix 75mg, lipitor 40mg
   .
   #. HTN: Pt with h/o significant HTN.  Currently holding meds in the
   setting of acute decompensation.  Will plan to monitor and restart BP
   regimen if remains hypertensive.
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt s/p 9 pRBC transfusions. Last transfusion [**1-22**]. Hct has
   been stable. Likely blood loss in the setting of surgery, chronic
   inflammation from infection, renal disease.
   -- plan to transfuse 1U pRBC
   -- q12 Hct goal Hct >25
   -- f/u Fe studies
   .
   #. PVD: Pt s/p right common and external illiac stent placement, left
   CEA, and left fem-[**Doctor Last Name 114**].
   -- cont ASA/ plavix/statin
   -- f/u vascular recs
   -- f/u wound swab
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Cont levothyroxine
   .
   #. Gout: Holding allopurinol given worsening renal function

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post-mitral valve replacement, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, past transient ischemic attack, and hypertension. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient also has a fever, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia, surgical wound infection, or central venous line infection. There is evidence of acute decompensated congestive heart failure, fluid overload, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has a history of gout and is currently holding allopurinol due to worsening renal function. She has received multiple blood transfusions for anemia, which is likely secondary to chronic inflammation from infection, blood loss during surgery, and renal disease. The patient's medications include aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, metoprolol, Tylenol, and H2 blockers for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia may progress, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including hospital-acquired pneumonia, surgical wound infection, and central venous line infection. These infections can worsen her condition and lead to sepsis.

3. Cardiac complications: Given her history of coronary artery disease and recent cardiac surgery,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and mitral valve repair (MVR), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), past transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hypertension (HTN). She presents with hypoxic respiratory failure, acute decompensated heart failure (CHF), fever, acute on chronic renal failure, and other comorbidities.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory distress requiring intubation. She also has worsening pulmonary edema, pneumonia, anemia, and possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics since January 24th and has had multiple blood cultures taken.

Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and liver function test abnormalities. The patient has received several blood transfusions and has been on diuretics for fluid management. Her renal function has been stable, but there has been a recent worsening of creatinine levels.

The patient's cardiovascular status shows ECG changes consistent with her past medical history of CAD. She has been on antiplatelet therapy and statins. Her blood pressure has been controlled, but it is currently being held due to acute decompensation.

The patient has a history of P"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), past transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hypertension (HTN). The patient is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with hypoxic respiratory failure, acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic renal failure, fever of unknown origin, and a wound infection.

The patient's medical conditions and interventions include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing severe hypoxia requiring mechanical ventilation. There are multiple factors contributing to this condition, including pulmonary edema, pneumonia, anemia, and possible acute mucus plugging. A CT angiogram (CTA) may be considered if hypoxia does not improve or if the patient develops hypotension.

2. Acute Decompensated CHF: The patient likely has fluid overload and has been on Lasix (furosemide) intravenous infusion. Diuretic therapy will continue with Lasix, and additional medications such as metolazone may be considered to achieve a negative fluid balance.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has worsening creatinine secondary to diastolic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mitral valve replacement (MVR), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), past transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hypertension (HTN). The patient presents with hypoxic respiratory failure and is intubated. She also has a fever for one week, acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, history of gout, hypothyroidism, and a wound infection in the left groin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and subsequent intubation indicate a potential respiratory failure. This could be due to pulmonary edema, pneumonia, anemia, or acute mucus plugging.
2. Fever: The patient has been experiencing fevers for one week. Possible sources include hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), surgical wound infection, and central venous line (CVL) infection.
3. Acute Decompensated CHF: The patient shows signs of fluid overload and has been on diuretics. This suggests acute decompensated CHF, which could be exacerbated by underlying conditions such as CAD and HTN.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a history of CKD and left renal artery st"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, mitral valve replacement, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, past transient ischemic attack, and hypertension. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, wound infection, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute-on-chronic renal failure, acute decompensated congestive heart failure, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and subsequent intubation indicate a severe impairment in gas exchange. Multifactorial causes, including pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and thick secretions (acute mucus plugging), should be considered. There is also concern for a possible pulmonary embolism due to the patient's recent surgery and prior deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
2. Wound Infection: The presence of fever and the surgical wound suggest a possible infection at the site. The patient has been on antibiotics since January 24th, but the fever persists. Further evaluation is needed, including obtaining cultures from the surgical wound, blood, urine, and sputum.
3. Acute-on-Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's worsening creatinine levels indicate a decline in renal function. This could be secondary to decompensated congestive heart failure or acute tubular necrosis. Close"

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is fever. The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mitral valve replacement, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), past transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hypertension post right common and external iliac stent placement, left carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and left femoral-popliteal bypass.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including pulmonary edema, pneumonia, anemia, and possible acute mucus plugging. There is also a concern for pulmonary embolism (PE) given the patient's recent surgery and the fact that she has been on deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

The patient has been febrile for one week, and possible sources of infection include hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), surgical wound infection, and central venous line (CVL) infection. The patient has been on vancomycin/cefepime since January 24th, but due to the acute decompensation, the antibiotic regimen will be changed to vancomycin/piperacillin-tazobactam/ciprofloxacin.

The patient also has acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), which is"

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and mitral valve replacement (MVR), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), past transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hypertension (HTN) post right common and external iliac stent placement, left carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and left femoral-popliteal bypass. The patient presents with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation.

Assessment:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory distress requiring intubation. There are multiple factors contributing to this, including pulmonary edema, pneumonia, anemia, and possible acute mucus plugging.
2. Fever: The patient has had fevers for one week, which may be due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), surgical wound infection, or central venous line (CVL) infection. Other possible causes include drug reaction, vasculitis, or connective tissue disease.
3. Acute Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has evidence of fluid overload and has been on lasix gtt.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function, likely due to decompensated CHF and acute tubular necrosis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and mitral valve replacement (MVR), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), past transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hypertension (HTN) post right common and external iliac stent placement, left carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and left femoral bypass.

The patient presents with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. The likely causes include pulmonary edema, pneumonia, anemia, and acute mucus plugging. The patient also has a large A-a gradient of ~460, suggesting possible pulmonary embolism (PE) due to recent surgery, although she has been on deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. The respiratory system infection and balance impairment are also noted.

Fever is present for one week, possibly from hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), surgical wound infection, or central venous line (CVL) infection. Other causes such as drug reaction, vasculitis, and connective tissue disease are less likely. The patient is already on vancomycin (Vanco) and cefepime (Cefepime), with plans to continue these medications along with ciprofloxacin (Cipro).

   75 yo female with CAD, s/p MVR, CKD, post-op CVA s/p CEA admitted with
   acute resp failure. Major issues include:
   1. Acute resp failure from pulmonary edema, aspiration/HAP, mucous
   plugging: has diuresed effectively, and resp mechnics looks reasonable,
   tolerating SBT. Frequency of secretions earlier an issue but improved
   from nurse. Will re-check after line change this afternoon- hope to
   extubate this afternoon but if not, will re-evaluate tomorrow. On
   vanc/zosyn/cipro for HAP coverage
   2. Fevers: possible sources include PNA, line. Cultures so far negative
   for causative bug. Plan to re-site CVL this afternoon and send tip for
   culture
   3. Acute on chronic renal failure, secondary to CHF/ATN- continuing to
   follow renal fxn, renally dose Rx
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 40 minutes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), mitral valve replacement, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), past transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hypertension. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory distress, requiring intubation. This is likely due to pulmonary edema, pneumonia, anemia, and possible acute mucus plugging. There is also a concern for pulmonary embolism given the patient's recent surgery.
2. Wound Infection: The patient has a fever and impaired skin integrity, which raises concerns for a wound infection, especially considering her recent surgical procedures.
3. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF): The patient has evidence of fluid overload and worsening pulmonary edema, indicating acute decompensated heart failure.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function, likely secondary to heart failure and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal function should be closely monitored, and medications will be dosed accordingly.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which includes previous CABG. It is important to continue antiplatelet therapy and statin"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and mitral valve replacement, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), past transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hypertension (HTN). The patient presents with hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has been intubated. There are several factors contributing to this condition, including pulmonary edema, pneumonia, anemia, and possible acute mucus plugging.

2. Wound Infection: The patient has a fever and impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of a wound infection. This could be related to the surgical wound or other sources of infection.

3. Acute Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient shows signs of fluid overload and has been on lasix gtt. This indicates possible acute decompensation of CHF.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a history of left renal artery stenosis and worsening creatinine levels, suggesting a decline in renal function.

5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, and there is mention of an ECG back to baseline on admission"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease and has received multiple transfusions and medications including Lasix, labetalol, and propofol. Their vital signs show hypertension and tachycardia. The patient's blood work indicates elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. They have impaired skin integrity with a wound infection, and their respiratory function is compromised. The patient's neurological status is not assessed. The patient's family history and allergies are documented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which could lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Wound Infection: The presence of impaired skin integrity and fever suggests a wound infection, which can worsen if not properly managed and could lead to sepsis or systemic infection.
3. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure may increase the risk of end-organ damage or cardiovascular events if not controlled.
4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has a negative fluid balance, indicating excessive fluid loss. This could lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or kidney dysfunction.
5. Medication Reactions: The patient has a history of allergies and adverse reactions to certain medications, so there"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. They have multiple medical conditions and allergies, including respiratory failure, fever, hypertension, PVD (peripheral vascular disease), and hypothyroidism. The patient is on various medications and infusions, such as lasix, propofol, furosemide, and antibiotics. They are also receiving nutrition through tube feeds but currently have them off.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, and there is a risk of further respiratory failure due to edema, pneumonia, and airway plugging. Continuous pulmonary toilet and diuresis are planned to address this issue.

2. Infection/Fever: The patient has had fevers, and the source of infection needs to be identified. The possibility of an infection related to the surgical wound in the left groin should be evaluated, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued. Tylenol has been given to manage the fever, but its standing dose should be held.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be managed carefully due to concerns about renal perfusion and chronic hypertension. The target blood pressure should be maintained at around 140/90 as per the patient's primary care physician (PCP).

4. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient has PVD, and they are on antiplatelet therapy with ASA and Plavix. It is important to ensure proper management and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mitral valve replacement, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, past transient ischemic attack, and hypertension post right common and external iliac stent placement, left carotid endarterectomy, and left femoral-popliteal bypass. She presents with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. The likely causes include pulmonary edema, pneumonia, anemia, and acute mucus plugging. There is also concern for possible pulmonary embolism given the patient's post-surgical status, although she has been on deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia require close monitoring and management. Intubation has already been performed to support her breathing.
2. Fever: The patient has been experiencing fevers for one week, which could be due to hospital-acquired pneumonia, surgical wound infection, or central venous line infection. Antibiotics have been initiated, and further investigations are planned to identify the source of infection.
3. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF): The patient's fluid overload and worsening renal function suggest acute decompensated heart failure. Diuretics have been adjusted to manage fluid balance.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's worsening creatinine levels indicate a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a complex medical history. The patient has experienced several significant events including multi lumen insertion, invasive ventilation, and changes in medication administration. 

The patient's allergies include reactions to Bactrim, tetracyclines, Vasotec, Isordil, Procardia, Hytrin, Catapres-Tts, Coreg, and Neurontin. The patient has also received various medications and antibiotics in the past few days.

Vital signs indicate a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 166/35 to 179/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation support with a tidal volume of 374 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals an absence of peripheral vascular pulses and skin assessment. Neurologic assessment is also incomplete due to non-responsiveness and lack of movement. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 223 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 8.8 g/dL, creatinine (Cr) at 2.3 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) at 140 mEq/L, potassium (K+) at 4.5 mEq/L, glucose at 67 mg/dL, and elevated lactic acid at 0.7 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and plan include hypertension, wound infection, fever, impaired skin integrity, and several other impaired functions such as aerobic capacity/endurance, balance, gait, knowledge, range of motion, and transfers. The patient is also diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, but not ARDS.

The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia and is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mitral valve replacement (MVR), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), past transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hypertension (HTN). The patient presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. She had a multi-lumen line placed on 01/29/2171 and her right internal jugular (IJ) vein line was re-sited due to bleeding. The patient also had a left carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and left femoral-popliteal bypass.

The patient's current conditions and treatment plans include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Resolved after extubation.
2. Bleeding from Line site: The patient has been experiencing bleeding from the line site, but attempts at hemostasis have been mildly successful. No evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or other coagulopathy has been found. No hemodynamic instability or Hct drop has occurred.
   - Continue pressure dressing
   - Platelets if unable to obtain hemostasis
   - Continue ASA Plavix

3. Fever/HAP: The patient had fevers for one week, which are now resolving"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease post-coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve replacement, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, past transient ischemic attack, and hypertension post-stent placement. The patient presents with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. She also has fever, acute decompensated congestive heart failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and a history of hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory distress requiring intubation. This could be due to pulmonary edema, pneumonia, anemia, or acute mucus plugging.
2. Fever: The patient has been having fevers for one week, possibly from hospital-acquired pneumonia, surgical wound infection, or central venous line infection.
3. Acute Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's fluid overload has led to acute decompensated CHF, which may require diuretic therapy.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function is likely due to acute decompensated CHF and acute tubular necrosis.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) post-CABG: The patient has a history of CAD that was treated with coronary artery bypass grafting. It is important to monitor her cardiac status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mitral valve replacement, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), past transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hypertension (HTN). The patient presents with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. She also has a fever, acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic renal failure, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia require close monitoring and management. The underlying causes, such as pulmonary edema, pneumonia, anemia, and possible acute mucus plugging, need to be addressed promptly.
2. Fever: The patient has been experiencing fevers for a week, which could be due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), surgical wound infection, or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). Appropriate antibiotics should be administered, and sources of infection should be identified and treated accordingly.
3. Acute Decompensated CHF: The patient's fluid overload and worsening pulmonary edema suggest acute decompensated CHF. Diuretics should be titrated to achieve negative fluid balance, and the underlying cause should be investigated.

   75 yo female with CAD, s/p MVR, CKD, post-op CVA s/p CEA admitted with
   acute resp failure. Major issues include:
   1. Acute resp failure from pulmonary edema, aspiration/HAP, mucous
   plugging:  Extubated yesterday and currently requiring 3- 4liter nc.
   Continues to have thick secretions per nursing- given large negative
   fluid balance over past 24 hours (-5.5 liters), this may make it harder
   for her to self-mobilize. Continue abx, hold on further diuretics today
   unless fluid balance becomes positive. Needs aggressive chest PT-
   2. Fevers: Off standing Tylenol, still no further fevers- likely from
   recent HAP Pna.
   3. Acute on chronic renal failure, secondary to CHF/ATN- Renal function
   continuing to improve. She remains fluid overloaded but current oxygen
   requirement is not too high, plan to monitor in
s/out
s and consider
   diuresis if fluid balance shifts positive
   Due to frequency of chest Ct, plan to keep her in ICU tonight and will
   reassess tomorrow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post-myocardial vein replacement (MVR), chronic kidney disease (CKD), post-stroke cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and carotid endarterectomy (CEA). She was admitted with acute respiratory failure and has been in the ICU.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Acute respiratory failure from pulmonary edema, aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and mucous plugging: The patient is currently requiring 3-4 liters of nasal cannula (nc) oxygen and has thick secretions. The large negative fluid balance over the past 24 hours may make it harder for her to self-mobilize. It is recommended to continue antibiotics and hold further diuretics today unless the fluid balance becomes positive. Aggressive chest physiotherapy (PT) is also advised.

2. Fevers: The patient was previously on standing Tylenol, but now no further fevers have been observed. This could be due to recent HAP Pna.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure, secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF)/acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's renal function is continuing to improve. She remains fluid overloaded but her current oxygen requirement is not too high. It is planned to monitor her in s/out and consider diuresis if"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions and allergies. He is currently on several medications including heparin sodium, ciprofloxacin, lasix drip, plavis, MVI, ASA, lipitor, famotidine, colace, nystatin, zosyn, and labetalol.

The patient's 24-hour events include the insertion and removal of a multi-lumen catheter, invasive ventilation, and bleeding from the central line insertion site. The bleeding was improved with the application of pressure and the patient is currently on Plavix.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 154/35 mmHg, heart rate of 66 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. The blood glucose levels are also within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema and warm skin. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movement with normal muscle tone.

The patient's chest x-ray shows diffuse rhonchi, and his ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis.

The patient's assessment and plan include continued weaning of FiO2,"

   demonstrates hypercarbia and CXR shows diffuse pulmonary edema. Major
   issues include:
   1. Acute resp failure from pulmonary edema, aspiration/HAP, mucous
   plugging:  Worsening pulmonary edema explains pt
s decompensation
   overnight. She has diastolic dysfunction and BP
s have been higher than
   ideal, so likely flash
d. Recent withdrawal of positive pressure
   ventilation may have also contributed. Plan tighter BP control with
   increase to labetolol to 600 mg TID, lasix for goal 2-4 liters, wean
   oxygen, NIPPV as needed.
   2. Fevers: Resolved, continue abx for HAP Pna.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MVR), chronic kidney disease (CKD), post-operative cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and carotid endarterectomy (CEA). She was admitted with acute respiratory failure and subsequently intubated.
- The patient was extubated on January 29th but experienced recurrent respiratory distress overnight, requiring high levels of oxygen and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).
- An arterial blood gas (ABG) demonstrated hypercarbia, and a chest X-ray showed diffuse pulmonary edema.
- The major issues include acute respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and mucous plugging.
- The patient has diastolic dysfunction and elevated blood pressure, which may have contributed to the worsening pulmonary edema.
- The plan includes tighter blood pressure control by increasing labetalol to 600 mg three times a day (TID), administering lasix for a goal of 2-4 liters, weaning off oxygen, and using NIPPV as needed.
- Other issues include fevers, which have resolved, and acute on chronic renal failure secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal function is continuing to improve.
- The rest of the plan is as per the housestaff note"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with significant vasculopathy, including a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and mitral valve replacement, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and previous transient ischemic attack (TIA). She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure following right common and external iliac stent placement, left carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and left femoral bypass surgery.

The patient presented with hypoxic respiratory failure but has now been extubated and is improving. She experienced episodes of desaturation last night, which resolved after diuresis. The patient has been on vancomycin and cefepime since January 24th for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient also had acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), likely due to pulmonary edema, and responded to furosemide 40 mg IV. Another dose of furosemide 40 mg IV was given, and the patient's urine output (UO) should be closely monitored. The goal is to achieve a fluid balance of -1L to even, allowing for autoregulation.

Additionally, the patient had bleeding from a line site, which has been mildly successful in being controlled with pressure dressing and platelets if necessary. There is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or other"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with significant vasculopathy, including a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and mitral valve replacement, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and past transient ischemic attack (TIA). She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after undergoing right common and external iliac stent placement, left carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and left femoral-popliteal bypass. The patient's medical history includes anemia, hypertension, wound infection, fever, impaired skin integrity, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, impaired gait, impaired knowledge, impaired range of motion, impaired transfers, acute respiratory failure, and peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure but has since improved and been extubated.
2. Acute Decompen"

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of significant vasculopathy, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and mitral valve replacement, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and past transient ischemic attack (TIA). She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure following right common and external iliac stent placement, left carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and left femoral artery repair. 

The patient presented with hypoxic respiratory failure but is now extubated and improving. She has been experiencing fevers for one week, which are now resolving. This is likely hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), as the wound is clean and central venous line (CVL) tip culture is pending. The patient has been on vancomycin and cefepime since January 24th and has also been given Tylenol. Blood, sputum cultures have been negative so far.

The patient had acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) with desaturation overnight, likely due to pulmonary edema, responding to furosemide 40 mg IV x 1. Another dose of furosemide 40 mg IV x 1 was given, and she will be monitored closely for urine output. More diuretics may be needed, aiming for a goal of -1L to even but allowing for autoregulation"

   I saw and examined the pt on rounds, and was present with the ICU team
   for the key portions of services provided. I agree with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10399**]
   note above, including assessment and plan. I would add:
   75 yo female with CAD, s/p MVR, CKD, post-op CVA s/p CEA admitted with
   acute resp failure. Extubated [**1-29**], but subsequent developed acute
   pulmonary edema and respiratory distress overnight requiring more
   oxygen and NIPPV. Major issues include:
   1. Acute resp distress from pulmonary edema, aspiration/HAP, mucous
   plugging:  with more aggressive BP control and additional diuresis, she
   is slowly improving and her oxygen requirement has decreased.
   Respiratory status remains tenuous however. Needs aggressive chest CT,
   further diuresis. BP control acceptable.
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure, secondary to CHF/ATN- Renal function
   continuing to improve.
   Rest of plan as per housestaff note.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 40 minutes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post-myocardial infarction (MI) with valve replacement (MVR), chronic kidney disease (CKD), post-stroke (CVA), and carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The patient was admitted with acute respiratory failure and subsequently developed acute pulmonary edema and respiratory distress requiring more oxygen and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).

The patient's current condition is described as critically ill. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute respiratory distress from pulmonary edema, aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and mucous plugging. The patient's respiratory status remains tenuous, and further aggressive chest physiotherapy and diuresis may be required.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure, secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's renal function is improving, but ongoing monitoring and repletion of electrolytes with diuresis are necessary.

3. Hypertension, which is being managed with labetalol and amlodipine.

4. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), for which the patient is continuing to receive aspirin (ASA) and Plavix.

5. Other risks include stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old lady with significant vasculopathy, including a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), mitral valve replacement (MVR), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and past transient ischemic attack (TIA). She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure following right common and external iliac stent placement, left carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and left femoral artery bypass surgery. The patient presented with hypoxic respiratory failure but is now improving without pulmonary edema overnight.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and chloride (Cl-) levels, which may require careful monitoring and management.

2. Anemia: The patient has received multiple blood transfusions, indicating ongoing blood loss or chronic inflammation from infection or renal disease. Close monitoring of hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels is necessary to ensure appropriate red blood cell (RBC) transfusion support.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of significant hypertension, currently moderately well controlled. Holding antihypertensive medications in the setting of acute decompensation may be necessary. Close blood pressure monitoring is important to prevent complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or myocardial infarction.

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypertension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/64 mmHg to 186/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula with aerosol-cool. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications and has been receiving antibiotics. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, potassium, sodium, chloride, magnesium, albumin, lactate, and other parameters. The patient has multiple medical complications including electrolyte and fluid disorder, anemia, hypertension, wound infection, fever, impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure. The patient also has a history of peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and there is evidence of impaired respiratory function. This may indicate respiratory failure, which can be further complicated by conditions such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Wound Infection: The patient has impaired"

She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure after undergoing right common and external iliac stent placement, left carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and left femoral-popliteal bypass surgery.

The patient presents with several potential medical complications:

1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an imbalance in sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels.

2. Anemia: The patient has received 10 packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions. Her hemoglobin concentration is low, indicating anemia, which may be due to blood loss during surgery, chronic inflammation from infection, or renal disease.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of significant hypertension. Currently, her blood pressure is elevated, and she is being managed with antihypertensive medications such as labetalol and amlodipine.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has left renal artery stenosis and is experiencing acute exacerbation of chronic renal failure. Her creatinine levels are improving after medical intervention and auto-diuresis.

The patient also has anemia, peripheral vascular disease, and a decreased appetite. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/64 mmHg to 152/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, blood glucose, and lactate levels. The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, clear breath sounds, and warm skin. The patient's neurological examination is not assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. worsening of congestive heart failure due to fluid overload or infection
2. development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

   I saw and examined the pt on rounds, and was present with the ICU team

   note above, including assessment and plan. I would add:
   75 yo female with CAD, s/p MVR, CKD, post-op CVA s/p CEA admitted with
   acute resp failure. Extubated [**1-29**], subsequent to which she developed
   acute pulmonary edema and respiratory distress requiring more oxygen
   and NIPPV. Major issues include:
   1. Acute resp distress from pulmonary edema, aspiration/HAP, mucous
   plugging:  Continuing to improve with additional diuresis, and
   antihypertensives, oxygen requirement down to 5 liters and resp rate
   wnl. Remains total body fluid overloaded throughout hospitalization and
   plan diuresis 1-2 liters over next day, ongoing pulm toilet. BP
   acceptable. Has recently completely course of abx for HAP
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure, secondary to CHF/ATN- renal function
   stabilizing, good urine output. Plan continued diuresis and avoidance
   of nephrotoxins.
   3. HTN: Pt chronically hypertensive,  goal SBP ~160
s to optimize
   peripheral perfusion and minimize risk of flash pulmonary edema in the
   setting of known diastolic dysfx.
   Appears appropriate for transfer to floor.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, presenting with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and pulmonary edema. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory distress and pulmonary edema may progress to ARDS, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.

2. Sepsis: HAP can lead to sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome that can result in organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.

3. Pneumonia complications: The patient's HAP may lead to complications such as lung abscesses, pleural effusions, or empyema.

4. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and previous CABG surgery, his respiratory distress and pulmonary edema may also have cardiac origins, such as acute heart failure or myocardial infarction.

5. Kidney injury: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure secondary to congestive heart failure and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) needs close monitoring, and there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and other factors"
