","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital after undergoing cardiac catheterization with a drug-eluting stent placed in the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery. 

The patient's chief complaint includes back/jaw pain and nausea following the cardiac catheterization. On the 24-hour mark, she began coughing while in the critical care unit and was found to be bleeding from the catheter site, leading to her becoming nauseous and extremely agitated. Pressure was applied for 20 minutes, and she was given Zofran followed by Ativan 0.5, which did not calm her down. The patient continued to be restless, cough, and bear down, and the bleeding from the catheter site resumed. Pressure was held for another 25 minutes, and a ultrasound was negative for hematoma. Ativan 0.5 was given again, but the patient continued to sundown and Morphine 1mg IV was administered. 

The patient also developed increased bruising and induration along the inguinal ligament and in the suprapubic area. Her hemoglobin concentration dropped from 31.6 two days prior to 22.3. She received 1 UPRBC and a non-contrast CT scan showed a large pelvic hyperdense collection concerning for a hematoma, measuring 10 x"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypothyroidism. She underwent cardiac catheterization with stent placement to the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery. Post-procedure, she experienced back/jaw pain, nausea, and agitation. She developed coughing while in the CCU and was found to be bleeding from the cath site. The patient was given Zofran and Ativan, but did not calm down. She continued to be restless, cough, and bear down, and the cath site began bleeding again. Pressure was held for 25 minutes, and an ultrasound showed no hematoma. However, the patient developed increased bruising and induration along the inguinal ligament and in the suprapubic area. Her hematocrit dropped from 31.6 two days prior to 22.3. Non-contrast CT revealed a large pelvic hyperdense collection concerning for hematoma, measuring 10 x 7 cm, as well as fat stranding concerning for bleeding in the right thigh. The ability to comment on active extravasation could not be determined. The patient's blood pressure was managed with hydralazine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematoma at cath site with potential for ongoing bleeding.
2. Decreased hematocrit levels indicating anemia due to blood loss.
3. Elevated creatinine levels indicating possible acute kidney injury.

","Summary:
The patient presented with back/jaw pain and nausea following a cardiac catheterization with stent placement in the left main coronary artery. They began coughing while in the CCU and were found to be bleeding from the catheter site, leading to agitation. Pressure was applied for 20 minutes initially but had to be held for 25 minutes due to ongoing bleeding. The patient continued to be restless and coughed, resulting in rebleeding at the catheter site. Ativan 0.5 was given, but it did not calm the patient. A non-contrast CT scan revealed a large pelvic hyperdense collection measuring 10 x 7 cm, concerning for a hematoma. Fat stranding was also noted, indicating possible bleeding in the right thigh. The patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped from 31.6 two days prior to 22.3, prompting the administration of 1 UPRBC. The patient has a history of allergies to codeine and scopolamine hydrobromide, with unknown reactions. They were receiving morphine sulfate, haloperidol, lorazepam, and hydralazine in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 182/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are in place. Physical"

She underwent cardiac catheterization with stent placement to the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery. The patient presented with back/jaw pain and nausea following the procedure.

The patient experienced coughing while in the critical care unit (CCU) and was found to be bleeding from the catheter site. She also became nauseous and extremely agitated, leading to pressure being held for 20 minutes. The patient was given Zofran followed by Ativan 0.5, which did not calm her down.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome. She presented after undergoing cardiac catheterization with a drug-eluting stent placement in the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery. The patient experienced back/jaw pain and nausea following the procedure. She also developed bleeding from the catheter site, coughing, and agitation. The patient was given Zofran and Ativan but did not calm down. She continued to be restless, cough, and bear down, leading to re-bleeding at the catheter site. Pressure was applied for 20 minutes initially and then for 25 minutes. A CT scan showed a large pelvic hyperdense collection concerning for hematoma, measuring 10 x 7 cm. There was also fat stranding concerning for bleeding in the right thigh, and the hematoma was compressing the right ureter with right kidney hydronephrosis and possible rupture of the renal pelvis.

Medical Complications:
1. Hematoma: The patient developed a large pelvic hematoma, which may have caused compression of the right ureter leading to hydronephrosis and possible renal pelvis rupture.
2. Delirium: The patient exhibited signs of delirium, including sundowning and agitation. She pulled out IVs and the Foley catheter, indicating a deteriorating mental status. The use of benzodiaz"

   Assessment and Plan
   88yo F hx HTN, CKI, hypothyroidism, Sjogrens presented s/p cardiac cath
   with drug eluting stent to left main with extension to LAD.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Anginal equivalent is intrascapular back pain with
   nausea. Precath ECG showed ST elevations in V1-2 and AVR with
   depressions in 2,3,AVL. Left main disease seen on cath and stent placed
   to LMCA extending to LAD. Post-cath ECG essentially unchaged. Post-cath
   Tn 0.02 CK 88.  No anginal equivalent since admission to CCU.
   - Aspirin 325 po qd
   - Plavix 75 po qd
   - Atorvastatin 80 po qd
   .
   # HEMATOMA: Developed as pt began sundowning and became very
   anxious/restless at around 8pm. Ultrasound was negative for hematoma,
   but induration and brusing along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic
   area developed afterwards. CT abd/pelvis showed 10x7cm pelvic fluid
   collection. Hct dropped from 31 two days PTA to 23. 2UPRBC given
 will
   check post transfusion H/H. Hematoma also possibly compressing R ureter
   causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture.
   - Contact vascular re: coiling procedure for involved vessels or
   evacuation -> no intervention indicated
   - Consult urology re: possible calyceal rupture -> recommended
   conservative management at this point
   - Recheck H/H q6 to keep above [**8-24**] -> transfused one unit PRBC
   overnight, will transfuse another unit this AM
   .
   # DELIRIUM: History of sundowning on previous hospital admissions.
   Given benzos last night and mental status deteriorated.  Pulled out
   some IVs and foley catheter. Will continue treating underlying
   conditions. Would stay away from benzos and use Haldol or Seroquel /
   Trazodone qpm. Use restraints as needed.
   - no recurrence overnight
   .
   # HYPERTENSION: On Atenolol at home. Hydralazine 10 IV previously
   required, none overnight.
   - Amlodipine 5 po qd
   - Carvedilol 6.25 po bid
   .
   # PUMP: No previous caths or echos. No history or symptoms of previous
   HF. Pt appears euvolemic.  However, was given volume and has diastolic
   dysfunction
 will stop IV fluids and give lasix prior to next unit
   blood.
   - TTE -> see above, preserved LVEF > 55%
   - On Carvedilol 6.25 po bid
   - Will hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given rising creatinine as outpatient ->
   will start when renal function improves

   .
   # CHRONIC KIDNEY INJURY: Baseline Cr 1yr ago was 1.3. Pt was advised to
   stop Olmesartan this past week over concerns of increased Cr to 2.0 two
   days PTA. Cr 1.7 on admission and 2.0 today with bump likely due to dye
   load. FENa 3.3 so prerenal component is unlikely.  SCr cont to rise
   slowly.  Pt likely had significant CKD at baseline, given small body
   habitus
   - Hold nephrotoxins, given gentle IVF, monitor SCr
   .
   # ANEMIA: Baseline outpatient H/H [**10-31**], MCV 93.
   - follow up pre-admission iron studies, B12, folate
   - Will continue to monitor ongoing blood loss and keep H/H above [**8-24**]

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with symptoms of chest pain and was found to have left main disease, for which a drug-eluting stent was placed in the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery. She also has a pelvic hematoma compressing the right ureter, leading to hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. The patient has been receiving conservative management for the hematoma and has been transfused with packed red blood cells due to a drop in hemoglobin levels. She has been experiencing delirium, which has been managed with benzodiazepines and antipsychotic medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is currently on several medications including aspirin, Plavix, atorvastatin, amlodipine, carvedilol, and levothyroxine. She has chronic kidney injury with a baseline creatinine level of 1.7 and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 26 mL/min/1.73m2. Her anemia is being managed with iron studies and B12/folate supplementation. The patient's condition remains stable, and she will continue to be monitored in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pelvic hematoma with compression of the right ureter leading to hydronephrosis"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome. The patient presented to the hospital with a complaint of left main disease and underwent cardiac catheterization with stent placement in the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery.

The patient developed a hematoma in the pelvic region, which is causing compression of the right ureter and subsequent hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. The patient's hematocrit levels dropped from 31% to 23% due to the hematoma, and they received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).

The patient also experienced delirium, for which benzodiazepines were initially used but caused a deterioration in mental status. Alternative medications such as haloperidol or quetiapine/trazodone were recommended for managing delirium.

The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and she is on multiple antihypertensive medications including atenolol, hydralazine, amlodipine, and carvedilol. However, her creatinine levels are rising, so starting an ACE inhibitor may be delayed until renal function improves.

The patient has diastolic dysfunction with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 55% as per the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome. She presented to the hospital with complaints of left main coronary artery disease and underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting. The patient also has a history of chronic kidney injury, anemia, and delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematoma: The patient developed a hematoma in the pelvic area, which is causing compression of the right ureter leading to hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. This could potentially result in further kidney damage or infection.

2. Delirium: The patient has a history of sundowning and experienced a decline in mental status after receiving benzodiazepines. It is important to avoid the use of benzos and consider alternative medications like Haldol or Seroquel/Trazodone for managing delirium.

3. Chronic Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.3 one year ago, but it has now risen to 2.0 with a recent bump likely due to dye load. This indicates ongoing kidney injury, which may require further evaluation and management.

4. Anemia: The patient's baseline hemoglobin/hematocrit levels were significantly low (10-31), indicating chronic anemia. Monitoring ongoing blood loss and maintaining H/H above 8-24 is crucial to prevent worsening an"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, CKI, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome. She presented to the hospital with complaints of chest pain and was found to have left main coronary artery disease, for which she underwent cardiac catheterization and placement of a drug-eluting stent to the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery.

The patient's post-catheterization ECG showed no significant changes, and her troponin and CK levels were within normal range. She has been on aspirin, Plavix, and atorvastatin.

However, during sundowning, the patient became anxious and restless, resulting in a hematoma development. An ultrasound initially showed no hematoma, but subsequent CT abdomen/pelvis revealed a large pelvic hematoma, which is compressing the right ureter and causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. The patient's hematocrit level dropped from 31% to 23.2%, and she received 1 unit of packed red blood cells.

The patient also has a history of delirium, and benzodiazepines were previously used, but they caused mental status deterioration. Instead, haloperidol or quetiapine/trazodone are being considered for delirium management.

The patient's hypertension is being managed with amlodipine and carvedilol, and"

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, CKI, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome. She presented to the hospital with drug-eluting stent placement in the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery. The patient's anginal equivalent is intrascapular back pain with nausea. Precath ECG showed ST elevations in V1-2 and AVR with depressions in 2,3,AVL. The patient has several medical complications, including a hematoma, delirium, hypertension, heart failure, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney injury, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematoma: The patient developed a hematoma that may be compressing the right ureter, causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. This could lead to further kidney damage or infection.
2. Delirium: The patient has a history of sundowning and experienced a deterioration in mental status after being given benzodiazepines. This suggests the possibility of delirium, which can be treated with alternative medications like Haldol or Seroquel/Trazodone.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed with appropriate antihypertensive medications.
4. Heart Failure: The patient appears euvolemic but may have underlying heart failure, which should be evaluated with a transt"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital after undergoing cardiac catheterization and placement of a drug-eluting stent in her left main coronary artery with extension to the left anterior descending artery. The patient also has a pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture. 

The patient's recent events include mild confusion overnight, attempted removal of the Foley catheter, and mild musculoskeletal back pain. She also reports mild lower abdominal pain and nausea but denies shortness of breath, headaches, lightheadedness, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, or dysuria. 

On examination, the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress, but appears anxious. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 119/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 22.3 g/dL, platelet count of 116 K/uL, creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL, and a troponin T level of 0.02. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

The patient has been started on aspirin, Plavix,"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome. She presented to the hospital after experiencing a cardiac catheterization with a drug-eluting stent placement in the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery. Since admission, she has developed pelvic hematuria and renal caliceal rupture. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), a heart rate of 67 bpm, a blood pressure of 119/61 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Her physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and mild anxiety. She has a systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border and diminished pulses in both lower extremities. Her abdomen is soft and non-distended with tenderness in the right lower quadrant. There is also ecchymosis over the right inguinal ligament and suprapubic area, which is mildly indurated. Neurologically, she is attentive and follows simple commands.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, a hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL, a platelet count of 116"

   # HEMATOMA: Developed as pt began sundowning and became very
   anxious/restless ~2hrs s/p cath. Ultrasound was negative for hematoma,
   but induration and brusing along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic
   area developed afterwards. CT abd/pelvis showed 10x7cm pelvic fluid
   collection. Hematoma also possibly compressing R ureter causing
   hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. Hct dropped from 31 two
   days PTA to 23.

   # DELIRIUM: History of sundowning on previous hospital admissions.
   Given benzos last night and mental status deteriorated.  Pulled out
   some IVs and foley catheter. Will continue treating underlying
   conditions. Would stay away from benzos and use Haldol or Seroquel /
   Trazodone qpm. Use restraints as needed.
   - no recurrence overnight

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital after undergoing cardiac catheterization with stent placement in her left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery. She now presents with pelvic hematuria and renal caliceal rupture. The patient has no angina since admission to the critical care unit (CCU). 

The patient developed a hematoma, which was initially negative on ultrasound but showed induration and bruising along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic area. A CT abdomen/pelvis revealed a 10x7cm pelvic fluid collection, suggesting a possible hematoma compressing the right ureter and causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. Her hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 31% two days post-admission to 23%. 

The patient also exhibits signs of delirium, which has been present during previous hospital admissions. Benzodiazepines were given last night, leading to a deterioration in mental status. The patient pulled out some IVs and foley catheter. Treatment for delirium includes avoiding benzodiazepines and using haloperidol or quetiapine/trazodone at nighttime. Restraints may be used as needed. 

The patient has hypertension, which is currently being managed with amlodipine and carvedilol. There is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and hypothyroidism who presented to the hospital after cardiac catheterization with a drug-eluting stent placed in the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery. She developed a pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture, with a significant drop in hemoglobin from 31% to 23%. The patient also experienced delirium, which worsened after receiving benzodiazepines, and mild confusion with attempts to remove her Foley catheter. Other medical conditions include chronic kidney injury, anemia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pelvic hematoma with ongoing blood loss leading to anemia.
2. Renal caliceal rupture causing hydronephrosis and potential kidney injury.
3. Delirium, particularly worsening with the use of benzodiazepines.
4. Hypertension requiring ongoing management.
5. Chronic kidney injury with rising creatinine levels.
6. Anemia of chronic disease with ongoing blood loss.
7. Hypothyroidism requiring ongoing levothyroxine replacement therapy.
8. Possible complications related to the cardiac stent placement, such as stent thrombosis or restenosis."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome. She presented to the hospital after undergoing a cardiac catheterization with stent placement to the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery. She now has a pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture.

The patient developed a pelvic hematoma and induration/bruising along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic area after becoming anxious and restless. A CT abdomen/pelvis showed a 10x7cm pelvic fluid collection, which is likely compressing the right ureter causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. Her hematocrit dropped from 31 two days prior to admission to 23.

The patient also experienced mild confusion overnight with attempts to pull out her Foley catheter. She was reoriented by staff and is aware that she is not herself while in the hospital. She reports mild musculoskeletal back pain, which is different from her anginal equivalent. She also has mild lower abdominal pain and nausea. The patient denies shortness of breath, headache, lightheadedness, vomiting, constipation/diarrhea, or dysuria.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. 

1. Pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture: The patient has developed a pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture as a result of a cardiac catheterization procedure. This condition needs to be closely monitored due to the risk of continued bleeding and potential complications such as infection or further kidney damage.

2. Acute on chronic kidney injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.3 one year ago, but it has increased to 2.0 recently. The patient's kidney function is currently impaired, and there is a concern for acute kidney injury on top of the chronic kidney disease. This requires careful management to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

3. Delirium: The patient has a history of sundowning, which is a phenomenon where patients become agitated or confused in the evening. Benzodiazepines have been used, but they worsened the patient's mental status. Alternative medications like Haloperidol or Quetiapine/Trazodone should be considered to manage delirium.

4. Heart failure: Although the patient does not have a history of heart failure, the echo showed mild diastolic dysfunction. There is a concern for developing heart failure due to the left main coronary artery disease and potential complications from the stent placement. Monitoring the patient's fluid status and cardiac function will be important.

5. Hypertension:"

","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypothyroidism. She presented with a drug-eluting stent in the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery, as well as pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture.

The patient developed a pelvic hematoma, which was initially negative on ultrasound but showed induration and bruising afterwards. A CT abdomen/pelvis revealed a 10x7cm pelvic fluid collection, indicating a possible hematoma compressing the right ureter and causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and her hematocrit (Hct) has increased and stabilized.

The patient also has acute-on-chronic kidney injury with a baseline creatinine (Cr) of 1.3 one year ago. Her Cr was 2.0 two days prior to admission and 1.7 on admission. The fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is 3.3, suggesting a prerenal component is unlikely. The Cr has been trending down, indicating improvement.

The patient has a history of sundowning and delirium on previous hospital admissions. She was given benzodiazepines on the day of admission and her mental status deteriorated. It is recommended to avoid benzodiazepines and use haloperidol or quetiapine/traz"

   nausea. Precath ECG showed 1mm ST elevations in V1-2 and AVR with
   depressions in 2,3,AVL. Left main disease seen on cath and stent placed
   to LMCA extending to LAD. Post-cath ECG essentially unchaged. Post-cath

   # HEMATOMA: Developed as pt began sundowning and became very
   anxious/restless ~2hrs s/p cath. Ultrasound was negative for hematoma,
   but induration and brusing along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic
   area developed afterwards. CT abd/pelvis showed 10x7cm pelvic fluid
   collection. Hematoma also possibly compressing R ureter causing
   hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. Hct dropped from 31 two
   days PTA to 23.  Pt received 4uPRBC and Hct has increased and
   stabilized.

   # DELIRIUM: History of sundowning on previous hospital admissions.
   Given benzos on day of admission and mental status deteriorated.
   Pulled out some IVs and foley catheter. Will continue treating
   underlying conditions. Would stay away from benzos and use Haldol or
   Seroquel / Trazodone qpm. Use restraints as needed.
   - No recurrence overnight
   .
   # PUMP: No previous caths or echos. No history or symptoms of previous
   HF. Pt appears euvolemic. Echo showed mild diastolic dysfunction but
   EF>55%. Will hold off on fluid boluses and give Lasix prior to future

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome. She presented to the hospital after a cardiac catheterization procedure, where she received a drug-eluting stent in her left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery. Since then, she developed a pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/61 to 148/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. She is in sinus rhythm.

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, increased creatinine, and mildly elevated potassium levels. Her troponin T level remains within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of angina equivalent, which is intrascapular back pain with nausea. Pre-cath ECG showed ST elevations in V1-2 and AVR with depressions in 2,3,AVL. Left main disease was seen on cath, and a stent was placed to LMCA extending to LAD. Post-cath ECG was essentially unchanged, with post-cath Tn"
