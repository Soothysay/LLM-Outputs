   36 year old male without significant past medical history with fevers,
   altered mental status, and seizures.
   .
   # fevers: given persistent high fevers, altered mental status,
   seizures, and LP results, suspect aseptic meningioencephalitis. CSF
   studies not c/w bacterial infection.  Significant leukocytosis with
   left shift raises concern for bacterial process although could be
   stress response from recent seizure. Ddx of aseptic
   meningioencephalitis includes viral (HSV, enterovirus, HIV, west [**Doctor First Name **],
   VZV, mumps), vasculitis, malignancy. ? exposure to toxin in [**Location (un) 4245**]
   leading to encephalitis. At OSH HIV negative, RPR negative, crypto CSF
   negative.
   - MRI
   - cont empiric acyclovir at 10 mg/kg Q8H
   - cont empiric ceftriaxone. Would add vancomycin to cover possible PCN
   resistent strep and ampicillin to cover listeria although no reason to
   suspect immunocompromised
   - repeat LP in am for cell count, protein, glucose, HSV PCR, HIV, Lyme,
   west [**Doctor First Name **] PCR, enterovirus PCR
   - stool culture for enteric viruses
   - check HIV Ab, HIV VL, CD4
   - consider serologic testing for cocksackie, echovirus, west [**Doctor First Name **], EBV,

   - send blood cultures, U/A, urine culture
   - check CXR
   - sputum and stool cultures prn
   - consider placing PPD
   - droplet precautions

   # respiratory failure: intubated in the setting of seizure with
   metabolic acidosis.  CXR without significant pulmonary pathology.
   - RSBI, SBT qam
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   .
   # seizures: possibly due to irritable focus from infection or anatomic
   abnormality. EtOH history unclear so must also consider EtOH withdrawal
   seizures although seems less likely in current setting. Discussed with
   Neuro. In setting of acute illness and single isolated seizure, no need
   for prophylaxis.
   - check MRI
   - folate/thiamine
   - propofol drip for sedation with have some effect on EtoH withdrawal
   ppx
   - ativan prn for seizures
   .
   # altered mental status: given high fevers, altered mental status, and
   results of LP, suspect encephalitis.  At OSH had no other evidence of
   infection.  Tox + for cannaboids but unlikely to cause persistent
   altered MS. Could have used other illicit drugs in [**Location (un) 4245**] although
   was 2 weeks ago so doubt persistent effects. Could also be subclinical
   seizures.  Also toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
   - fever treatment as above
   - Neuro consult in am
   - renal failure treatment as below
   .
   # ARF: At OSH, initial Cr 1.5 and improved this am to 1.2.  Now again
   elevated to 1.7.  Presumably had normal renal function prior.  Initial
   ARF likely due to dehydration due to poor po intake and increased
   insensible losses from fevers. Now suspect new process. ? contribution
   of acyclovir.
   - aggressive IVF
   - urine lytes
   - urine eos

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with no significant past medical history. He was admitted to the ICU due to fevers, altered mental status, and seizures. He is currently on invasive ventilation and has an arterial line in place. The patient has a fever of 101.3°F and his vital signs are stable. His laboratory results show leukocytosis with a left shift, elevated liver enzymes, and acute kidney injury. The patient is suspected to have aseptic meningioencephalitis, possibly caused by viral infection or toxin exposure. Empiric antibiotics and antiviral therapy have been initiated. Further investigations are planned, including repeat lumbar puncture, imaging studies, and serologic testing. The patient also has respiratory failure, seizures, and altered mental status, which may be due to encephalitis or metabolic abnormalities. Renal failure has developed, possibly due to dehydration or a new process. The patient is on appropriate IV fluids, medications, and monitoring for various complications. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Seizure recurrence or status epilepticus due to ongoing encephalitis.
2. Worsening respiratory failure if the patient's lung condition deteriorates.
3. Infection-related complications such as pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
4. Progression of renal failure and the need for dialysis.
5. Development of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) due to the severity of the underlying"

   Assessment and Plan
   36 year old male without significant past medical history with fevers,
   altered mental status, and seizures.
   .
   # Fevers: Persistently high fevers in setting of myalgias, sore throat
   raises suspicion for viral prodrome and infection. Altered mental
   status and seizure x1 also causes concern for meningitis vs.
   encephalitis. The patient had LP at OSH but per neuro service would be
   useful to tap again and run for various viral serologies and infectious
   labs. CSF at OSH not consistent with bacterial infection. CXR appears
   clear w/question of haziness in LLL. Clinically lungs are clear on exam
   but noted this AM was increased sputum production, and sample was sent
   for culture. Given patient
s history he is at increased risk for HIV
   (study pending at OSH). In addition to infectious causes (including
   HIV, EBV, HSV, Cryptococcus, etc) etiologies such as vasculitis and
   malignancy should be considered.
   - MRI/MRA to further work up anatomy and ? vasculitis
   - cont acyclovir, vancomycin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone for infectious
   etiology
   - repeat LP in am for cell count, protein, glucose, HSV PCR, HIV, Lyme,
   west [**Doctor First Name **] PCR, enterovirus PCR
   - f/u stool cultures
   - f/u HIV labs
   -f/u ID and neurology recommendations
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture and sputum cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated in the setting of seizure with
   metabolic acidosis.  CXR without significant pulmonary pathology
   although increasing sputum production.
   - RSBI, SBT qam
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -if increasing secretions would hold off on extubation
   .
   # Seizures: Consider toxic-metabolic vs infectious etiology vs.
   structural abdormality of focus. Ct negative at outside hospital. MRI
   to be done today. Per neurology will start keppra and monitor for
   seizure activity with EEG.
   - check MRI
   - keppra
   - propofol drip for sedation
   - ativan prn for seizures
   -monitor and replete electrolytes
   -tox screen negative except for marijuana
   .
   # Altered mental status: given high fevers, altered mental status, and
   results of LP, suspect encephalitis.  At OSH had no other evidence of
   infection.  Tox + for cannaboids but unlikely to cause persistent
   altered MS. Also noted by family was change in behavior from his
   baseline since his return from overseas. Will continue to work up for
   toxic/metabolic and infectious etiologies.
   - fever treatment as above
   - f/u neuro consult
   - renal failure treatment as below
   .
   # ARF: At OSH, initial Cr 1.5 and improved this am to 1.2.  Now again
   elevated to 1.7.  Presumably had normal renal function prior.  Initial
   ARF likely due to dehydration due to poor po intake and increased
   insensible losses from fevers. Also suspect acyclovir may have caused
   intrinsic renal damage.
   - aggressive IVF
   - renally dose meds
   - trend Cr
   -spin urine if ? acyclovir damage
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: likely in the setting of fever and infection.
   Possible contribution of dehydration. Much better this morning.
   - IVF as above
   - monitor fever curve
   - ID treatment as above
   .
   # asthma: alb/atrovent nebs
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete electrolytes prn, nutrition recs if
   prolonged intubation.
   -monitor INR (1.5), may need vitamin K if concern for bleed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with no significant past medical history. He presents with fevers, altered mental status, and seizures. The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure in the setting of a seizure with metabolic acidosis. The chest X-ray appears clear with a question of haziness in the left lower lobe (LLL), but clinically the lungs are clear. 

The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and seizures. The assessment suggests that the patient may have encephalitis or meningitis, possibly due to viral or bacterial infection. There is also concern for HIV infection, vasculitis, and malignancy. 

The plan includes continuing with acyclovir, vancomycin, ampicillin, and ceftriaxone for infectious etiology. A repeat lumbar puncture (LP) is recommended for cell count, protein, glucose, HSV PCR, HIV, Lyme, West Nile virus PCR, and enterovirus PCR. Stool cultures, blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum cultures are also pending. 

For the respiratory failure, the plan is to monitor respiratory system function and perform spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) every morning. Albuterol/atrovent nebs are recommended for increasing secretions. 

Regarding the seizures, an MRI will be done today to rule out any structural abnormalities. Keppra will be started for seizure management,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with fevers, altered mental status, and seizures. He has been intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient has leukocytosis with a left shift, suggesting a possible bacterial infection. However, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies do not indicate a bacterial infection, raising suspicion for aseptic meningioencephalitis. The differential diagnosis includes viral infections (such as herpes simplex virus, enterovirus, HIV, west Nile virus, varicella-zoster virus, mumps), vasculitis, malignancy, and possible exposure to toxins leading to encephalitis.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, and there is a concern for acute kidney injury (AKI), possibly due to dehydration, increased insensible losses from fevers, or a new renal process. The patient also has sinus tachycardia, which could be related to fever, infection, and dehydration.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and treatment for the suspected infections, including empiric coverage for bacteria, viruses, and fungal agents. Further diagnostic tests are needed, including repeat lumbar puncture (LP) for cell count, protein, glucose, HSV PCR, HIV, Lyme, and other viral PCRs. Blood cultures, urine analysis (U/A), and urine culture have also been ordered. Imaging studies,"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, fever of unknown origin, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/62 mmHg to 141/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on SpO2. The patient has a sinus rhythm and has received multiple doses of antibiotics including ceftriaxone, acyclovir, vancomycin, and ampicillin. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.0 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to the critical illness and the use of corticosteroids.
4. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status, which could progress to delirium if not properly managed.
5. Nosocomial infections: The prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections.
6. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated lactate levels and potential use of nephrotoxic medications may increase the risk of developing AKI."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 year old male without significant past medical history with fevers,
   altered mental status, and seizures.
   .
   # Fevers: Persistently high fevers in setting of myalgias, sore throat
   raises suspicion for viral prodrome and infection. Altered mental
   status and seizure x1 also causes concern for meningitis vs.
   encephalitis. The patient had LP at OSH but per neuro service would be
   useful to tap again and run for various viral serologies and infectious
   labs. CSF at OSH not consistent with bacterial infection. CXR appears
   clear w/question of haziness in LLL. Clinically lungs are clear on exam
   but noted this AM was increased sputum production, and sample was sent
   for culture. Given patient
s history he is at increased risk for HIV
   (study pending at OSH). In addition to infectious causes (including
   HIV, EBV, HSV, Cryptococcus, etc) etiologies such as vasculitis and
   malignancy should be considered.
   - MRI/MRA to further work up anatomy and ? vasculitis
   - cont acyclovir, vancomycin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone for infectious
   etiology
   - repeat LP in am for cell count, protein, glucose, HSV PCR, HIV, Lyme,
   west [**Doctor First Name **] PCR, enterovirus PCR
   - f/u stool cultures
   - f/u HIV labs
   -f/u ID and neurology recommendations
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture and sputum cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated in the setting of seizure with
   metabolic acidosis.  CXR without significant pulmonary pathology
   although increasing sputum production.
   - RSBI, SBT qam
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -if increasing secretions would hold off on extubation
   .
   # Seizures: Consider toxic-metabolic vs infectious etiology vs.
   structural abdormality of focus. Ct negative at outside hospital. MRI
   to be done today. Per neurology will start keppra and monitor for
   seizure activity with EEG.
   - check MRI
   - keppra
   - propofol drip for sedation
   - ativan prn for seizures
   -monitor and replete electrolytes
   -tox screen negative except for marijuana
   .
   # Altered mental status: given high fevers, altered mental status, and
   results of LP, suspect encephalitis.  At OSH had no other evidence of
   infection.  Tox + for cannaboids but unlikely to cause persistent
   altered MS. Also noted by family was change in behavior from his
   baseline since his return from overseas. Will continue to work up for
   toxic/metabolic and infectious etiologies.
   - fever treatment as above
   - f/u neuro consult
   - renal failure treatment as below
   .
   # ARF: At OSH, initial Cr 1.5 and improved this am to 1.2.  Now again
   elevated to 1.7.  Presumably had normal renal function prior.  Initial
   ARF likely due to dehydration due to poor po intake and increased
   insensible losses from fevers. Also suspect acyclovir may have caused
   intrinsic renal damage.
   - aggressive IVF
   - renally dose meds
   - trend Cr
   -spin urine if ? acyclovir damage
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: likely in the setting of fever and infection.
   Possible contribution of dehydration. Much better this morning.
   - IVF as above
   - monitor fever curve
   - ID treatment as above
   .
   # asthma: alb/atrovent nebs
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete electrolytes prn, nutrition recs if
   prolonged intubation.
   -monitor INR (1.5), may need vitamin K if concern for bleed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented with fevers, altered mental status, and seizures. He has been intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently sedated but responsive to voice. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis vs. encephalitis: The patient's altered mental status, seizures, and high fevers raise suspicion for meningitis or encephalitis. The neuro service recommends repeating the lumbar puncture (LP) for cell count, protein, glucose, HSV PCR, HIV, Lyme, and West Nile virus PCR.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure, possibly caused by an infectious etiology. The respiratory support plan includes RSBI (respiratory system assessment), SBT (spontaneous breathing trial) every morning, albuterol/atrovent nebs (nebulizer treatments), and consideration for extubation if increasing secretions are managed.

3. Seizures: The patient experienced a seizure, and further evaluation is needed to determine the etiology. Toxic-metabolic causes, infectious etiology, or structural abnormalities will be investigated through an MRI. The neurology team has started keppra for seizure management and will monitor for seizure activity with EEG.

   Assessment and Plan
   36 year old male without significant past medical history with fevers,
   altered mental status, and seizures.
   .
   # Fevers: Persistently high fevers in setting of myalgias, sore throat
   raises suspicion for viral prodrome and infection. Altered mental
   status and seizure x1 also causes concern for meningitis vs.
   encephalitis. The patient had LP at OSH but per neuro service would be
   useful to tap again and run for various viral serologies and infectious
   labs. CSF at OSH not consistent with bacterial infection. CXR appears
   clear w/question of haziness in LLL. Clinically lungs are clear on exam
   but noted this AM was increased sputum production, and sample was sent
   for culture. Given patient
s history he is at increased risk for HIV
   (study pending at OSH). In addition to infectious causes (including
   HIV, EBV, HSV, Cryptococcus, etc) etiologies such as vasculitis and
   malignancy should be considered.
   - MRI/MRA to further work up anatomy and ? vasculitis
   - cont acyclovir, vancomycin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone for infectious
   etiology
   - repeat LP in am for cell count, protein, glucose, HSV PCR, HIV, Lyme,
   west [**Doctor First Name **] PCR, enterovirus PCR
   - f/u stool cultures
   - f/u HIV labs
   -f/u ID and neurology recommendations
 continue current mgmt, cont
   acyclovir, d/c remainder of abx, keep keppra
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture and sputum cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated in the setting of seizure with
   metabolic acidosis.  CXR without significant pulmonary pathology
   although increasing sputum production.
   - RSBI, SBT qam
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -if increasing secretions would hold off on extubation
   - extubated - resolved
   .
   # Seizures: Consider toxic-metabolic vs infectious etiology vs.
   structural abdormality of focus. Ct negative at outside hospital. MRI
   to be done today. Per neurology will start keppra and monitor for
   seizure activity with EEG.
   - check MRI  - normal MRI/MRA
   - keppra
   - propofol drip for sedation
 d/c
   - ativan prn for seizures
   -monitor and replete electrolytes
   -tox screen negative except for marijuana
   .
   # Altered mental status: given high fevers, altered mental status, and
   results of LP, suspect encephalitis.  At OSH had no other evidence of
   infection.  Tox + for cannaboids but unlikely to cause persistent
   altered MS. Also noted by family was change in behavior from his
   baseline since his return from overseas. Will continue to work up for
   toxic/metabolic and infectious etiologies.
   - fever treatment as above
   - f/u neuro consult
 keep keppra
 f/u s/p MRI/MRA results
   - renal failure treatment as below
   .
   # ARF: At OSH, initial Cr 1.5 and improved this am to 1.2.  Now again
   elevated to 1.7.  Presumably had normal renal function prior.  Initial
   ARF likely due to dehydration due to poor po intake and increased
   insensible losses from fevers. Also suspect acyclovir may have caused
   intrinsic renal damage.
   - aggressive IVF
   - renally dose meds
   - trend Cr
   -spin urine if ? acyclovir damage
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: likely in the setting of fever and infection.
   Possible contribution of dehydration. Much better this morning.
   - IVF as above
   - monitor fever curve
   - ID treatment as above
   .
   # asthma: alb/atrovent nebs
   .
   # FEN: changed to clears, ADAT now, replete electrolytes prn, nutrition
   recs if prolonged intubation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with no significant past medical history. He presented with fevers, altered mental status, and seizures. The patient's initial lab results showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Imaging studies revealed a possible haziness in the left lower lobe of the lungs, which was further investigated. The patient underwent lumbar puncture, arterial line placement, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to aid in diagnosis.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's persistently high fevers, sore throat, myalgias, and altered mental status raise suspicion for viral prodrome and infection. Altered mental status and seizure also cause concern for meningitis versus encephalitis.

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has significantly improved over the past two days, likely due to fevers, infection, and sedation. Continuous monitoring is necessary.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has improved with IV hydration. It is likely a combination of pre-renal dehydration and acyclovir therapy. Close monitoring of renal function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly is essential.
3. Sinus tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is likely elevated due to fever and infection, possibly with a contribution from dehydration. IVF as above and monitoring fever curve are recommended.
4. Seizures: Although the patient has not experienced seizure-like activity since admission, it is advised to continue treatment with Keppra for the time being, as per neuro recommendations.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient was successfully extubated and is tolerating oral intake well. However, ongoing respiratory support may be required if any complications arise.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with no significant past medical history. He presented initially to OSH on [**1-18**] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] on [**1-19**] with fevers, altered mental status, seizures, and respiratory failure. The patient is suspected to have viral encephalopathy based on the workup. He was successfully extubated yesterday and remains on acyclovir. His confusion is improving, and he is alert and oriented. The patient's vital signs are stable, and his laboratory results are within normal limits. He is awaiting additional viral workup and will be encouraged for PO hydration while on acyclovir. The patient's respiratory failure has resolved, and he is tolerating oral intake. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to fevers, infection, and sedation. The assessment and plan include continuing acyclovir until HSV results return, ruling out bacterial meningitis, and monitoring for potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 year old male without significant past medical history with fevers,
   altered mental status, and seizures.
   .
   # Fevers: Persistently high fevers in setting of myalgias, sore throat
   raises suspicion for viral prodrome and infection. Altered mental
   status and seizure x1 also causes concern for meningitis vs.
   encephalitis. The patient had LP at OSH but per neuro service would be
   useful to tap again and run for various viral serologies and infectious
   labs. CSF at OSH not consistent with bacterial infection. CXR appears
   clear w/question of haziness in LLL. Clinically lungs are clear on exam
   but noted this AM was increased sputum production, and sample was sent
   for culture. Given patient
s history he is at increased risk for HIV
   (study pending at OSH). In addition to infectious causes (including
   HIV, EBV, HSV, Cryptococcus, etc) etiologies such as vasculitis and
   malignancy should be considered.
   - MRI/MRA to further work up anatomy and ? vasculitis
   - cont acyclovir, vancomycin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone for infectious
   etiology
   - repeat LP in am for cell count, protein, glucose, HSV PCR, HIV, Lyme,
   west [**Doctor First Name **] PCR, enterovirus PCR
   - f/u stool cultures
   - f/u HIV labs
   -f/u ID and neurology recommendations
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture and sputum cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated in the setting of seizure with
   metabolic acidosis.  CXR without significant pulmonary pathology
   although increasing sputum production.
   - RSBI, SBT qam
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   -if increasing secretions would hold off on extubation
   .
   # Seizures: Consider toxic-metabolic vs infectious etiology vs.
   structural abdormality of focus. Ct negative at outside hospital. MRI
   to be done today. Per neurology will start keppra and monitor for
   seizure activity with EEG.
   - check MRI
   - keppra
   - propofol drip for sedation
   - ativan prn for seizures
   -monitor and replete electrolytes
   -tox screen negative except for marijuana
   .
   # Altered mental status: given high fevers, altered mental status, and
   results of LP, suspect encephalitis.  At OSH had no other evidence of
   infection.  Tox + for cannaboids but unlikely to cause persistent
   altered MS. Also noted by family was change in behavior from his
   baseline since his return from overseas. Will continue to work up for
   toxic/metabolic and infectious etiologies.
   - fever treatment as above
   - f/u neuro consult
   - renal failure treatment as below
   .
   # ARF: At OSH, initial Cr 1.5 and improved this am to 1.2.  Now again
   elevated to 1.7.  Presumably had normal renal function prior.  Initial
   ARF likely due to dehydration due to poor po intake and increased
   insensible losses from fevers. Also suspect acyclovir may have caused
   intrinsic renal damage.
   - aggressive IVF
   - renally dose meds
   - trend Cr
   -spin urine if ? acyclovir damage
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: likely in the setting of fever and infection.
   Possible contribution of dehydration. Much better this morning.
   - IVF as above
   - monitor fever curve
   - ID treatment as above
   .
   # asthma: alb/atrovent nebs
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete electrolytes prn, nutrition recs if
   prolonged intubation.
   -monitor INR (1.5), may need vitamin K if concern for bleed
   .
   # PPx: heparin sc. PPI while on vent. bowel regimen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of fevers, altered mental status, and seizures. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 137/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's neurological status is described as altered mental status, and he has had one seizure episode.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 20.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.4 g/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.7 mg/dL, blood glucose (Glucose) of 140 mg/dL, and anion gap metabolic acidosis. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has undergone multiple tests and procedures, including an MRI/MRA, lumbar puncture (LP), chest X-ray (CXR), and various cultures. The CXR is clear with a question of haziness in the left lower lobe (LLL), but the patient's lungs are clinically clear on examination. Sputum production has increased, and a sample has been sent for culture.

The assessment and plan include suspicion for viral prodrome and infection, possible mening"
