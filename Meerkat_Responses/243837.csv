","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV who presented with fever, myalgias, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough. He was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia). The patient has been treated with prednisone, Bactrim, vancomycin, levofoxacin, and cefepime. He also received IVF and ibuprofen for fever. Blood cultures are pending, and sputum cultures are pending for Legionella and induced sputum culture.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Ineffective coping due to new diagnosis of HIV.
2. Pneumonia, other (PCP likely).
3. Tachycardia.
4. LFT elevation (possibly viral from HIV infection or excessive Tylenol use).
5. Iron-deficiency anemia.
6. Hypertension.
7. Anxiety (difficulty coping with new diagnosis and sleeping).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) due to immunosuppression from HIV and PCP treatment.
2. Opportunistic infections such as cryptococcal meningitis or toxoplasmosis.
3. HIV-related complications such as Kaposi's sarcoma or HIV-associated nephropathy.
4. Adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV. He presented with fever, myalgias, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough and was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia). The patient has been diagnosed with ineffective coping, pneumonia (likely PCP), iron-deficiency anemia, and hypertension. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments including antibiotics, antiretrovirals, and supplemental oxygen. The patient's condition remains unstable with potential medical complications such as sepsis, multi-drug resistant infections, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and HIV-related opportunistic infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of infection with elevated white blood cell count and fever. There is a possibility of developing sepsis if the infection spreads or if the current treatment is ineffective.
2. Multi-drug resistant infections: Due to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is a risk of developing multi-drug resistant bacteria or fungi, which could make the treatment more challenging.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low oxygen saturation and presence of pulmonary infiltrates on imaging suggest the possibility of ARDS, a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure.
4. HIV-related opportunistic infections: As the patient has a new diagnosis of HIV, he is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV. He presented with fever, myalgias, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough and was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia). The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving treatment for pneumonia, which includes prednisone and Bactrim. His HIV infection is a new diagnosis, and further follow-up is needed with the ID (infectious disease) department to determine the appropriate antiretroviral therapy (ARV) based on viral load and CD4 count. The patient also has tachycardia, which has resolved, and hypertension, for which outpatient regimen will be held, and short-acting medications may be considered as needed. He is also being treated for iron-deficiency anemia and anxiety. The patient's lab results show elevated WBC, Hct, and Plt levels, as well as low sodium and potassium levels. His imaging shows improving lung aeration particularly RLL per HO read. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and he is pending oxygen saturation stability before considering disposition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with PCP, which is a type of pneumonia commonly seen in individuals with HIV/AIDS. The severity of the pneumonia can lead to respiratory distress and potentially require mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV presenting with fever, myalgias, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough. He was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia). The patient has been started on prednisone and Bactrim for PCP treatment. His HIV infection is a new diagnosis based on viral load, with antibodies and CD4 count pending. The patient's tachycardia on admission is likely due to infection, fever, and dehydration, which improved with IVF and ibuprofen. His LFT elevation is trending down and may be related to viral infection or excessive Tylenol use. The patient also has iron-deficiency anemia and hypertension. He is experiencing anxiety due to his new diagnosis. The patient's condition is stable at the moment, but there are potential medical complications that can arise, such as worsening of PCP, opportunistic infections like CMV retinitis if CD4 count is low, and possible development of other infections due to immunosuppression from HIV."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV who presented with fever, myalgias, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough. He was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia). The patient has been started on prednisone and Bactrim for PCP treatment. He also has a new diagnosis of HIV infection, and his viral load is pending. Antibodies and CD4 count are also pending. The patient is currently experiencing anxiety and has been prescribed Klonopin for it. His vital signs are stable, but he has a low SpO2 level indicating possible hypoxia. His lung examination shows decreased breath sounds bilaterally with no wheezing or crackles. The patient has tachycardia, which could be due to infection, fever, or dehydration. His LFTs are elevated, but trending down, possibly due to viral infection or excessive Tylenol use. He has iron-deficiency anemia and hypertension, for which medications will be considered. The patient is alert, oriented, and in no apparent distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) - The patient is already being treated for PCP with prednisone and Bactrim. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and daily chest X-rays will be important to assess response to treatment"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV presenting with fever, myalgias, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough. He was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia). The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with persistent hypoxemia despite increased high flow O2 and repositioning. Repeat ABG showed improvement in PaO2 but same PCO2. The patient expressed his desire to undergo intubation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate respiratory distress, which can be attributed to pneumonia.
2. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP): The patient has been diagnosed with PCP, a type of lung infection commonly seen in individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS.
3. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety related to his new diagnosis of HIV and difficulty in oxygenation.
4. Liver function test (LFT) elevation: The patient has elevated LFTs, which may be due to viral infection from HIV or excessive use of Tylenol prior to admission.
5. Iron-deficiency anemia: The patient has been started on iron supplementation for iron-deficiency anemia.
6. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which will be managed in the outpatient setting.

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV who presented with fever, myalgias, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough. He was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia). The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with persistent hypoxemia despite increased oxygen supplementation and repositioning. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a PaO2 of 110 and PCO2 of 55. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator-aided control (VA/C) mode. A nasogastric (NG) tube was also placed.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels persist despite high-flow oxygen supplementation and repositioning. Intubation and mechanical ventilation were necessary to improve oxygenation.

2. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP): The patient has been diagnosed with PCP, which is a common opportunistic infection in individuals with HIV/AIDS. Treatment includes steroids and antibiotics.

3. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing difficulty coping with his new diagnosis and sleeping. Clonazepam has been prescribed to manage anxiety.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV. He presented with fever, myalgias, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough and was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia). The patient has been diagnosed with ineffective coping, pneumonia (other), and PJP (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia). He is currently receiving treatment for these conditions, including prednisone and bactrim. The patient also has iron-deficiency anemia, hypertension, and anxiety. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure due to worsening pneumonia or PJP.
2. Infection due to immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding from stress ulcer prophylaxis or other causes.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility.
5. Hepatitis B or C infection due to possible exposure.
6. Hypotension and shock due to sepsis or fluid loss.
7. Renal dysfunction or failure due to dehydration or medication toxicity.
8. Arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to electrolyte imbalances or underlying heart disease.
9. Worsening liver function or hepatic encephalopathy.
10. Malnutrition or poor nutritional intake.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. 

1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The presence of fever and worsening respiratory symptoms may indicate an ongoing or developing infection.
   - Barotrauma: High levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and plateau pressures can lead to barotrauma, which can cause lung injury and pneumothorax.

2. Cardiovascular Complications:
   - Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating potential inadequate tissue perfusion and organ function. This could be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or medication effects.
   - Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, suggesting a compensatory response to maintain cardiac output in the setting of hypotension or infection.

3. Renal Complications:
   - Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's decreased urine output (UOP) over the last 6 hours and elevated creatinine levels indicate possible renal dysfunction. This may be due to prerenal causes such as hypovolemia or intrinsic renal damage.

4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
   - Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to critical"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV presenting in respiratory failure likely due to Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's condition has been deteriorating despite aggressive management. The medical team has been trying to optimize the ventilator settings, but the patient's oxygenation and carbon dioxide levels continue to worsen. The patient's fever has spiked to 102 degrees Fahrenheit, indicating a possible infection.

The patient's renal function is also compromised, as evidenced by oliguria (low urine output). Despite fluid challenges, the urine output remains poor. A renal ultrasound showed no abnormalities, but further evaluation with urine electrolytes and urinalysis is planned.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and lactic acid, indicating possible sepsis. The blood cultures are pending, while sputum cultures have grown yeast, suggesting colonization rather than infection.

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. Steroids have been initiated for suspected PCP pneumonia, and the decision to start antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or initiate respiratory support (IRS) is ongoing.

Other complications and considerations include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension requiring vasopressor support, hyperglycemia, iron deficiency anemia"

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV presenting in respiratory failure likely due to Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP). The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

Key findings and concerns include:

1. Respiratory status: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and acidosis despite adjustments in FiO2 and PEEP. There is evidence of permissive hypercapnia. The patient may be underparalyzed, so additional paralysis may be considered.

2. Fever: The patient has had persistent fever, which could indicate an ongoing infection. Blood cultures have been drawn.

3. Renal function: The patient's urine output has been inadequate over the last 6 hours, and there is concern for fluid overload or kidney dysfunction. Urine output should be monitored closely, and further evaluation with a renal ultrasound and urine electrolytes is warranted.

4. Fluid management: The patient has received a total of 5 liters of fluids, and additional fluid challenges may be necessary to maintain adequate urine output.

5. HIV infection: The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV with a CD4 count of 64. Genotype testing and antiretroviral therapy (ARV) should be considered, but with caution due to the risk of immune reconstitution syndrome.

6. Liver function tests (LFTs): There is a trend of decreasing LFTs, possibly related to viral hepatitis. Hep"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV who presented with fever, myalgias, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough. He was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP and subsequently intubated. The patient is currently being treated for PCP with Bactrim, and folate has been given due to potential marrow suppression. No HAART therapy is being administered at this time.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, HIV, ineffective coping, pneumonia, PJP, hyperglycemia, anemia, fever, renal failure, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function and potential need for more aggressive respiratory support.
2. Infection: The patient has an active infection due to PCP and may be at risk for developing other infections while in the ICU, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient is receiving norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure, indicating potential septic shock and ongoing monitoring is required to assess perfusion status.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient has oliguria and may be at risk for developing acute kidney injury (AKI).

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9162**] is a 45 year old male with new diagnosis of HIV, who presented
   with fever, myalgias, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough and
   transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for
   PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] intubated [**2196-7-11**].
   PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2443**]. Bactrim. Now 500mg QID in
 NS.  Folate. Monitor CBC for
   marrow suppression.
   - Continue bactrim day [**7-29**]
   - Changed 40mg methylprednisolone daily (day 1 of 5)
   - No HAART at this time
   Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure. Intubated. Esophageal balloon in place
   for transpulmonary pressures. Asynchronous with vent. Increased
   sedation, required levophed.
   - Asynchronous with vent
   - Increased fentanyl/versed - required levophed - willing to tolerate
   some level of asynchrony as long as ABG and vent levels adequate
   - Vt decreased to ARDSnet goal (6cc/kg IBW)
   - FiO2 decreased to 50%
   - PEEP increased to 16
   - Q6h ABG, change vent settings as needed
   - duonebs
   Hypotension. Relative. Sepsis physiology. In setting of increased
   sedation. Not in setting of fever. Monitoring UOP and perfusion,
   lactate rising to 2.4.
   - Levophed - wean as tolerated
   - 1L NS bolus fluid challenge, if positive increase fluids today
   SIRS: Evaluating for another source. Sputum culture grew yeast, likely
   colonizing
   - follow blood and urine cx
   - blood cultures negative for [**7-7**], [**7-6**]
   - D/C Vanc, Cefepime, Cipro, ID agreeable
   - Surveillance cultures
   Renal Function: BUN/Cr ratio increasing, may be pre-renal vs ATN.
   Patient has good UOP. Could be secondary to steroids and bactrim.
   - Continue to monitor UOP goal of >30cc/hr
   - Urine lytes, eos
   HIV infection:
   - Genotype pending
   - No HAART
   - ID following
    Residuals: likely constipated from fentanyl
   - aggressive bowel regimen including lactulose enema
   Tachycardia: may be worsened by levophed
   - Tachy worse with fever
   - Currently afebrile
   - Continue to monitor
   Fever:
   - Tylenol PRN with limits
   - Follow LFT
   Iron deficiency anemia: on Fe.

He presented with fever, myalgias, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough and was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP. The patient was intubated on [**2196-7-11**] and received bactrim for PCP. He is currently on 500mg QID in NS and folate. The patient's condition has been unstable with episodes of hypoxemic respiratory failure, asynchronous ventilation, increased sedation, and relative hypotension. He also has a rising lactate level and positive sputum culture for yeast, likely colonizing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with ongoing hypoxia despite being on 50% FiO2 and PEEP of 16 cmH2O. The asynchrony with the ventilator and increased sedation requirements indicate potential complications related to the mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's relative hypotension and rising lactate level suggest sepsis physiology, possibly due to an underlying infection. The sputum culture growing yeast may indicate an opportunistic infection, which could be contributing to the systemic inflammatory response.
3. Renal Function: The increasing BUN/Cr ratio raises concerns about renal function. It is important to differentiate between pre-renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV who presented with fever, myalgias, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough. He was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. He has been receiving Bactrim for PCP and methylprednisolone for immune modulation. His current condition includes hypotension, tachycardia, fever, anemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, HIV infection, and pneumonia.

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection.
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection: The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place, increasing the risk of bloodstream infection.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's BUN/Cr ratio is increasing, indicating a possible pre-renal or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) renal dysfunction.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be due to sepsis or medication-induced bone marrow suppression.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be related to sepsis physiology or increased sedation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV. He presented with fever, myalgias, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough and was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with GPC bacteremia, pneumonia, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's medical history includes HIV, PJP, and iron deficiency anemia. He is currently receiving multiple medications including bactrim, methylprednisolone, vancomycin, pantoprazole, heparin, and furosemide.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated (K+5.7) which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory distress. ARDS is a life-threatening condition that can result in respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, which can progress to septic shock if not treated promptly.
5. HIV infection: The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV, and his immune system may be compromised"

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:
1. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications if not managed properly.
2. Anemia: The patient has low hemoglobin levels, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is at risk for further lung injury and respiratory failure due to ARDS.

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV, presenting with fever, myalgias, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough. He was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP and intubated on [**2196-7-11**]. 

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including:

1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The goal is to wean vent requirements and decrease the tidal volume to ARDSnet goal (6cc/kg IBW).

2. Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP): The patient is being treated with Bactrim and folate. Monitor CBC for marrow suppression.

3. GPC Bacteremia: Blood cultures showed GPC in clusters, and the patient developed a new fever yesterday. A pancx was done, and vancomycin was started. Check trough levels before the third dose, and follow-up cultures are needed.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is maintained in the 60s-70s with adequate UOP and normal lactate levels. Levophed has been discontinued.

5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, likely due to Bactrim. Kayexelate, lasix, and lactulose have been given to increase bowel movement and monitor daily EKG if K>6"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV who presented with fever, myalgias, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough. He was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP, intubated on [**2196-7-11**]. The patient has been diagnosed with various conditions, including hypoxemic respiratory failure, PCP pneumonia, GPC bacteremia, constipation, hyperkalemia, anemia, and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI): The patient's prolonged antibiotic use increases the risk of developing CDI.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility due to being bedridden increases the risk of developing blood clots.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The presence of multiple lines and catheters increases the risk of CRBSI.
5. Nosocomial infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV/AIDS increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections.
6. Barotrauma: The patient's high levels of PEEP and plateau pressures may increase the risk of barotrauma.
7. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): The patient's ARDSnet goal of low tidal volume may reduce the risk of VILI.
8. Endocarditis: The presence of GPC bacteremia and the need for TEE evaluation suggest a potential risk for endocarditis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a new diagnosis of HIV who presented with fever, myalgias, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough. He was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). The patient was intubated on [**2196-7-11**] due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. His current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, PCP, GPC bacteremia, hypotension, hyperkalemia, fever, renal dysfunction, HIV infection, constipation, tachycardia, and iron deficiency anemia. The patient is sedated with fentanyl and versed, receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 26 breaths per minute, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 60%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels. This can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient has GPC bacteremia and fever, indicating a potential infection. If not promptly treated, this could progress to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
3. HIV Infection: As the patient has a new diagnosis of HIV, he is at risk for opportunistic infections and complications related to immunosuppression. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may indicate poor perfusion and organ dysfunction. Maintaining adequate blood pressure is crucial to prevent further complications.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications. Monitoring potassium levels and implementing appropriate interventions are essential.
6. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation due to fentanyl use. Regular bowel regimens should be implemented to prevent complications such as fecal impaction.
7. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient has iron deficiency anemia, which can lead to fatigue and compromised oxygen-carrying capacity. Management should include iron supplementation and addressing underlying causes.
8. Potential Drug Interactions: Given the patient's multiple comorbidities and medications, there is a risk of drug interactions that could lead to adverse effects or reduced efficacy of certain drugs. Regular monitoring and careful consideration of potential interactions are necessary.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS, admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (PCP), and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. He continues to be intermittently febrile and has not responded to Reglan for constant hiccupping. The patient's condition has worsened, with increased GG opacities and LLL infection seen on the CT torso. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about hyperkalemia, anemia, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient's blood cultures have shown gram-positive rods and budding yeast. Treatment includes antibiotics, insulin for glycemic control, and other supportive measures. The patient is also being evaluated for potential complications such as DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a known history of HIV and is being treated for presumed PCP PNA with Bactrim and prednisone. The ID does not want to start HAART at this time. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 108/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's oxygen delivery device is an endotracheal tube, and he is on PRVC/AC mode with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O. His FiO2 is 50%. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place and a Dobhoff catheter for nutrition. He is receiving midazolam and fentanyl for sedation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation. The underlying cause of the respiratory failure could be PCP PNA or another type of pneumonia. Further investigations are needed to identify the exact cause.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of HIV who presents with PCP pneumonia and remains intubated in respiratory failure. The patient has been started on a methadone protocol and fentanyl is being weaned off per pharmacy note. The patient experienced emesis of tube feeds, so tube feeds were stopped and an NG tube was placed with residuals of 450cc. There are no suctioning from the ET tube and the chest X-ray showed no change. The patient has a fever of 101.5 degrees and urine and blood cultures have been taken. The patient's blood pressure is low with a MAP of 60s, but there are no signs of poor perfusion. The patient's urine output is good and there is no tachycardia. The patient has been off from any fluids or pressors. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and in respiratory failure due to PCP pneumonia. This could potentially lead to further deterioration of the patient's respiratory status.
2. Infection: The patient has a fever and has undergone cultures for both urine and blood. This suggests the possibility of an ongoing infection, which may require appropriate antibiotic treatment.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low with a MAP of 60s. This could indicate septic shock or inadequate fluid resuscitation, leading to organ hypoperfusion and potential organ dysfunction.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's current BUN/Cr levels are within normal limits, but there is a concern for renal failure due to potential sepsis or other underlying conditions.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which could be due to SIADH, fluid infusions, or other causes. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.
6. Anemia: The patient has stable Hct levels, indicating ongoing blood loss or decreased production of red blood cells. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management.
7. HIV/AIDS: The patient has a known diagnosis of HIV/AIDS. It is important to consider opportunistic infections and the need for antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the management plan.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be necessary to confirm the potential medical complications."

- The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with PRVC/AC ventilation mode, FiO2 set at 60%, PEEP at 13 cmH2O, and a tidal volume (Vt) set at 400 mL.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt).
- The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for hyponatremia.
- The patient's renal function is currently normal.
- The patient has a history of HIV and is off HAART at this time.
- The patient's anemia is stable with a Hct of 25.4%.
- The patient has an arterial line and multi-lumen central line in place.
- Prophylactic measures include heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
- The patient's disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and respiratory support.
2. Nosocomial infection or sepsis due to the presence of fever and potential bacterial colonization from the NG tube.
3. Renal failure, as indicated by the presence of low blood pressure and concern for inadequate renal perfusion.
4. Stress-related mucosal disease or gastrointestinal bleeding due to prolonged critical illness and use of pantoprazole.
5. HIV-related complications such as opportunistic infections or progression to AIDS due to the patient's untreated HAART regimen.
6. Anemia and thrombocytopenia secondary to sepsis, HIV infection, or other underlying conditions.
7. Hyponatremia requiring further investigation and management.
8. Disseminated infection or bone marrow involvement due to the abnormal peripheral smear.
9. Liver dysfunction indicated by transaminitis, which may be related to medication use, biliary sludging, or critical illness.
10. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheterization."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of HIV who presented with PCP pneumonia and is currently intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by persistent ARDS physiology, and they are unable to be weaned off the ventilator settings significantly. The patient also has anemia with a hematocrit level of 24, reticulocyte count of 2.7, and abnormal peripheral blood smears suggestive of HIV infection. Other findings include elevated lipase, possible gallstone or medication-related issue, transaminitis likely due to critical illness, hyponatremia, and potential SIADH or infusion-related. The patient's renal function is currently normal, and there are concerns about the potential for renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory condition is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's persistent ARDS physiology indicates a high risk of developing or worsening lung injury and difficulty weaning off the ventilator.
3. Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit level and abnormal blood smear suggest a need for further evaluation and management of anemia, which could be related to HIV infection or other causes.
4. Elevated lipase: The new elevation in lipase suggests a possible pancreatic issue, such as gallstone or medication"

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of HIV presenting with PCP pneumonia, intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by other pulmonary infections, persistent ARDS physiology, and difficulty weaning off the ventilator. The patient is currently on Bactrim, prednisone, and AC settings with ARDSnet Vt. Blood cultures have been taken, and results are pending. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.2Â°C (100.8Â°F), heart rate 90 bpm, blood pressure 106/57 mmHg, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95%. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, skin is not assessed, and neurologic examination is not performed due to the patient being intubated. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 202 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, and slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 7,338 mL and total output of 6,365 mL. The patient's urine output is adequate at 6,190 mL. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range at 125 mg/dL. The patient's imaging shows left lower lobe consolidation on CT scan, which was not present on admission. A mini-BAL was performed, and results are pending. The patient's assessment and plan include continuing Bactrim, starting prednisone, maintaining current AC settings, weaning off the ventilator as tolerated, following up with arterial blood gas analysis, and awaiting BAL culture results. The patient's other concerns include fevers, hypotension, anemia, hypoxia, and transaminitis. The patient's nutrition is being provided through tube feeds, and his renal function is currently normal. The patient's lines include an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and a 20-gauge line. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of HIV presenting with PCP pneumonia, intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has been in the ICU for 12 days and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has persistent ARDS physiology and is unable to be weaned off the ventilator settings significantly. 
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 8.5 g/dL, indicating anemia. 
3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and a history of transaminitis. 
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels. 
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels. 
6. Renal failure: The patient's BUN/Cr levels are currently normal, but there is a concern for potential renal failure. 
7. HIV cholangiopathy: The patient has mild gallbladder wall irregularity seen on RUQ ultrasound, which may represent HIV cholangiopathy. 
8. PJP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia): The patient has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia, but there is a concern for other pulmonary infections as well. 
9. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has had fevers, but no clear source of infection has been identified yet. 
10. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is being monitored and managed in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of HIV presenting with PCP pneumonia, intubated. The patient is interested in starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) but is concerned about fast gastrointestinal transit time due to an aggressive bowel regimen. The patient has undergone various interventions and treatments, including Dobhoff tube placement, red blood cell transfusion, and administration of medications for different conditions such as pneumonia, HIV, and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure due to PCP pneumonia, and there is a concern for other pulmonary infections as well. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and weaning off the ventilator has been challenging.
2. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL. This may require further investigation and management.
3. HIV-related complications: As the patient has recently been diagnosed with HIV, there is a risk of HIV-related complications such as opportunistic infections and progression to AIDS.
4. Sepsis: The patient has had an episode of sepsis without organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and prompt treatment are necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), which requires careful monitoring and management to prevent cardiac complications.
6. Nutritional concerns: The patient has alteration in nutrition, possibly due to prolonged ICU stay and ent"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS and is currently experiencing several medical complications. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), and hyperkalemia (high potassium levels). The patient is also anemic and has hypotension, but it is not in shock. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate between 61-114 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 80-114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The plan for the patient includes weaning off oxygen and ventilator support, starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV/AIDS once the patient's lipase levels and diarrhea improve, continuing treatment for PJP with Bactrim and weaning steroids, further evaluation of abnormal liver function tests and lipase levels, and addressing nutritional needs by advancing enteral feeding. 

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS and presents with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypoxemic respiratory failure, pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), sepsis without organ dysfunction, anemia, hyperkalemia, hypotension, and alterations in nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 12 cmH2O. The plan is to gradually wean the FiO2 and PEEP while monitoring the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters.

2. HIV/AIDS: The patient's HIV/AIDS status needs to be managed appropriately. It is planned to start highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) when the patient's lipase and diarrhea improve, and the viral genotype is available. The ID team will be following up on this.

3. Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia (PJP): The patient is currently on Bactrim, and the plan is to continue with the medication while weaning off steroids.

4. Abnormal Liver Function Tests/Lipase: An ultrasound has been performed, which showed no signs of acute cholecystitis. However, there is a possibility of HIV cholangiopathy given the abnormal liver function tests. The trend"

   Assessment and Plan
   45M with recent diagnosis of HIV presents with PCP pneumonia, intubated
   .
 HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2443**]. Other pulmonary infection
   cannot be ruled out, however at this time we have no cultures
   supporting another infection. CT shows new LLL consolidation since
   admission. BAL performed with nonrevealing results. Persistent ARDS
   physiology with difficulty weaning from vent. Intubated day 13. At
   ARDSnet goal for tidal volume.
   - Bactrim - continue current dose
   - Prednisone - start 20mg daily for duration of treatment
   - Continue AC settings
   - Wean as tolerated - follow with ABG, alter settings as needed
   - Sedation- transitioning to methadone regimen, weaning of fentanyl and
   midazolam, started on zyprexa
    .
Fevers: may be due to known PCP pneumonia vs other etiology, multiple
   cultures without other source apparent
   - f/u cultures - including blood, urine, BAL, stool, sputum, urine
   - add antibiotics as appropriate
   - keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis
   - ID following
   .
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Awaiting genotyping.
   - Add HAART once GI motility slowed, possibly Monday
   - Decreased bowel regimen
   - f/u genotyping
   - ID following
   .
 ANEMIA, OTHER, Hct to 24 today from 25.  retic count 2.7. Currently
   stable. Heme onc following, peripheral smears consistent with HIV, no
   bone marrow biopsy at this time.
   - check hct q12h, transfuse to > 21
    .
Elevated Lipase: Patient had increase in lipase overnight. Maybe be
   secondary to medication vs obstruction vs HIV cholangiopathy. U/S
   unrevealing. Has not had propofol overnight. Bactrim may be cause.
   - Stop tube feeds, TPN
   - Trend lipase
   - If continues to increase consider further imaging
   .
Transaminitis: medications not likely cause, may be biliary sludging
   from critical illness. Serologies sent, unrevealing. LFT's trending up
   today.
   - Trend LFT's
   - Minimize tylenol - under 2g daily
   - Consider further imaging
   .
   Nutrition: Pt had emesis of tube feeds. NG tube placed with residuals
   of 450cc. Increased Lipase today. Post pyloric tube now pre pyloric.
   Need to schedule IR to replace to post pyloric position on Monday.
   Starting TPN until tube feeds tolerated.
   - Day 2 of TPN today - need to write orders
   - IR to replace post pyloric tube on Monday
   - Restart tube feeds - once tolerating d/c TPN
   - Check residuals often
   .
Hypotension: patient off pressors, pressures normotensive overnight,
   no signs of poor perfusion, good urine output, not tachycardic, warm
   ext.
   - Follow vitals
   - UOP > 30
   - IVF/levophed as needed
   .
 RENAL FAILURE BUN Cr currently normal. UOP adequate.
   - continue to trend Bun/cr and UOP
   .
Hyponatremia: possible SIADH vs infusions vs other.  Currently normal.
   - follow daily lytes

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of HIV presenting with PCP pneumonia and currently intubated in the ICU. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to PCP pneumonia. Other pulmonary infections cannot be ruled out, but no cultures supporting another infection have been found so far. The patient's ARDS physiology is persistent, and there is difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

2. Fevers: The patient is experiencing fevers, which may be due to the known PCP pneumonia or another underlying etiology. Multiple cultures have been obtained but have not revealed any other source of infection. Further cultures and appropriate antibiotics should be considered.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 24, which is lower than the previous reading of 25.5. The reticulocyte count is 2.7, indicating a stable anemia. A bone marrow biopsy has not been performed at this time, but peripheral smears are consistent with HIV.

4. Elevated Lipase: The patient has an elevated lipase level, which may be secondary to medication, obstruction, or HIV cholangiopathy. An ultrasound (U/S) has not revealed any abnormalities. The lipase level should be trended, and if it continues to increase, further imaging should be"

   Assessment and Plan
   45M with recent diagnosis of HIV presents with PCP pneumonia, intubated
 HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2443**]. Other pulmonary infection
   cannot be ruled out, however at this time we have no cultures
   supporting another infection. CT shows new LLL consolidation since
   admission. BAL performed with nonrevealing results. Persistent ARDS
   physiology with difficulty weaning from vent. Intubated day 13. At
   ARDSnet goal for tidal volume.
   - Bactrim - continue current dose
   - Prednisone - start 20mg daily for duration of treatment
   - Continue AC settings
   - Wean as tolerated - follow with ABG, alter settings as needed
   - Sedation- transitioning to methadone regimen, weaning of fentanyl and
   midazolam, started on zyprexa
Fevers: may be due to known PCP pneumonia vs other etiology, multiple
   cultures without other source apparent
   - f/u cultures - including blood, urine, BAL, stool, sputum, urine
   - add antibiotics as appropriate
   - keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis
   - ID following
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Awaiting genotyping.
   - Add HAART once GI motility slowed, possibly Monday
   - Decreased bowel regimen
   - f/u genotyping
   - ID following
 ANEMIA, OTHER, Hct to 24 today from 25.  retic count 2.7. Currently
   stable. Heme onc following, peripheral smears consistent with HIV, no
   bone marrow biopsy at this time.
   - check hct q12h, transfuse to > 21
   - heme onc following - follow up recs
Elevated Lipase: Patient had increase in lipase overnight. Maybe be
   secondary to medication vs obstruction vs HIV cholangiopathy. U/S
   unrevealing. Has not had propofol overnight. Bactrim may be cause.
   - Stop tube feeds, TPN
   - Trend lipase
   - If continues to increase consider further imaging
Transaminitis: medications not likely cause, may be biliary sludging
   from critical illness. Serologies sent, unrevealing. LFT's trending up
   today.
   - Trend LFT's
   - Minimize tylenol - under 2g daily
   - Consider further imaging
   Nutrition: Pt had emesis of tube feeds. NG tube placed with residuals
   of 450cc. Increased Lipase today. Post pyloric tube now pre pyloric.
   Need to schedule IR to replace to post pyloric position on Monday.
   Starting TPN until tube feeds tolerated.
   - Day 2 of TPN today - need to write orders
   - IR to replace post pyloric tube on Monday
   - Restart tube feeds - once tolerating d/c TPN
   - Check residuals often
Hypotension: patient off pressors, pressures normotensive overnight,
   no signs of poor perfusion, good urine output, not tachycardic, warm
   ext.
   - Follow vitals
   - UOP > 30
   - IVF/levophed as needed
 RENAL FAILURE BUN Cr currently normal. UOP adequate.
   - continue to trend Bun/cr and UOP
Hyponatremia: possible SIADH vs infusions vs other.  Currently normal.
   - follow daily lytes

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of HIV presenting with PCP pneumonia and currently intubated in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure due to PCP pneumonia and is experiencing persistent ARDS physiology with difficulty weaning from the ventilator. Other potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for 13 days, which increases the risk of developing VAP. It is important to monitor for signs of infection such as fever, increased sputum production, and changes in respiratory status.

2. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospitalization and exposure to healthcare settings can increase the risk of nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, or surgical site infections.

3. HIV-related opportunistic infections: The patient's recent diagnosis of HIV makes him susceptible to various opportunistic infections, including but not limited to cryptococcal meningitis, cytomegalovirus infection, toxoplasmosis, and tuberculosis. Monitoring for symptoms related to these infections is crucial.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has decreased from 25.9% to 24.0% during the hospital stay, indicating possible anemia. Further investigation and management should be considered.

5. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests (L"

- PICC line was started on 07/23/2196 at 03:00 PM.
- The patient tolerated dropping the rate of vent well and showed improvement in PaO2.
- TPN was started as drip infusion with difficulty in knotting.
- The patient became more awake but then delirious, so Zyprexa was given with good effect.
- No known drug allergies were reported.
- Bactrim (SMX/TMP) was administered at 03:30 AM on 07/24/2196.

Infusions:
- Midazolam (Versed) at a rate of 5 mg/hour.

","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS, which may have contributed to the development of PCP. 

The patient has been receiving treatment for PCP with Bactrim and steroids, and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. The plan is to wean the patient off the ventilator by reducing PEEP and reassessing oxygenation, with a goal of switching to pressure support ventilation (PSV) soon.

The patient also has hyperkalemia, anemia, hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and pneumonia other than PCP. 

For the anemia, the plan is to treat it if the hemoglobin level falls below 21. The lipase levels are stable, and there are no immediate plans to intervene regarding this issue.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids, and efforts are being made to achieve glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and PICC line. Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention are also being implemented. Communication with the healthcare team and documentation of the patient's code status and disposition are noted."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9162**] is a 45 year old male with history of hypertension and [**Hospital 9163**]
   transferred from the floor for PCP and ARDS.
   .
    HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Secondary to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2443**] ->ARDS. Repeat
   Chest CT shows worse compared to prior. Currently day 16 bactrim
   (dosing 500mg IV Q6H). ? treatment failure on bactrim with worsening of
   PCP vs fibrotic stage of ARDS, vs VAP.
   No cultures supporting another infection to date although sputum
   cultures have mostly been read as invalid due to excessive oral
   secretions. Nursing, respiratory noted y/d change in
   secretions,thicker,blood tinged and given leukocytosis and fevers, and
   hypoxia,  rapid evolution of symptoms, reasonable to cover empirically
   for VAP. Vanc day 3 cefepime, cipro day 1.
   Currently has 2 sputum Cx pending.
   Currently high PEEP, Fi02 limits ability to bronch.
   If Vent dependence improves, consider bronchoscopy to obtain sample for
   culture, determine whether any obstruction.
   wrt ? is this treatment failure if so what is appropriate second line
   regimen (pentamidine? Primaquine with clinda, atovaquone ? )and
   response to it is complicated by outstanding genotype, delaying at this
   point initiation of HAART.
   I.D has recommended darunavir (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) if reliable GI
   motility/ med absorption.
   Also currently tapering his prednisone, Prednisone - Day 3 of 20mg
   daily for duration of treatment. No evidence to suggest utility of high
   dose steroids in severe PCP beyond acute presentation, and could do
   more harm in setting of VAP.
   ARDS:
   Currently  tidal volume 400, RR: 24, PEEP 18, FI02 70
   wih abg 7.33/40/118/22 and normalization of lactate at 1.0 from high
   2.1 y/d.
   Also significant anxiety component to his hypoxia, currently getting
   midaz, methadone daily, and olanzapine.
   - Wean as tolerated - follow with ABG, alter settings as needed
   GotHead, chest, abdominal and pelvic CT.
   Labile BPs:
   Hypertensive to 250s, underlying HTN, also in setting of backing off
   sedation, associated anxiety, no CNS pathology noted on wet read Head
   CT.
   Now hypotensive, possibly related to sepsis/sedative meds. Fluid
   responsive, but autodiuresing high volumes - ? SIADH.
   Cautious use of fluids for low bps, continue levophed for MAPs <60.
   .
   Fevers: Afebrile currently, defervescing with tylenol .Etiologies
   discussed above.
   - f/u cultures - including blood, urine, BAL, stool, sputum, urine
   - add antibiotics as appropriate
   - keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis
   .
   HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME,
   AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Awaiting genotyping. Darunavir/truvada
   recommended by I.D but initiation complicated by pending genotype, poor
   gut motility with ? effective med absorption + transaminitis.
   Discuss with I.D
   .
   Transamintis/pancreatitis
   AST/ALTs continuing to trend up slowly as does lipase
   ? drug toxicity (bactrim) vs obstruction vs ?HIV cholangiopathy on US,
   vs acalculus cholecystitis.
   RUQ US showed just sludging, consider perc drainage if no Improvement.
   Continue to trend LFTs, lipase, limit Tylenol to 2g.day.
   .
   Tube feeds:
   Held in setting high residuals, pancreatitis picture.
   KUB to determine placement Dopoff, IR guided post pyloric
   repositioning.

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9162**], a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, was transferred from the floor to the ICU for pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). He has been experiencing fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and worsening respiratory status. Blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum cultures have been ordered. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. He is also being treated for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with the addition of clindamycin. The patient's condition is complicated by anxiety, which is contributing to his hypoxia. He is receiving midazolam, methadone, and olanzapine for sedation and anxiety. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and lipase levels are elevated, indicating possible drug toxicity or pancreatitis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. The patient's anemia is being managed with phlebotomy and nutritional support. He is also receiving prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's disposition is currently ICU care.

   Currently has 2 sputum Cx pending.
   Bronchoscopy to obtain sample for culture, any obstruction, do they
   look at histology - stage ards, does it matter?
   wrt ? is this treatment failure if so what is appropriate second line

   Also currently tapering his prednisone, Prednisone - Day 3 of 20mg
   daily for duration of treatment. No evidence to suggest utility of high
   dose steroids in severe PCP beyond acute presentation, and if he really
   has a VAP potential for harm.
   ARDS: Ventilated since 3rd, Pa02/Fi02 <200. at worst was at PEEP 20
   FI02 100%.
   Currently  tidal volume 400, RR: 24, PEEP 18, FI02 80

   Also significant anxiety component to his hypoxia, currently getting
   midaz, methadone daily, and olanzapine.
   - Wean as tolerated - follow with ABG, alter settings as needed
   -Had derecruitment on psupport so to rerecruit and get participation.
   Alkalosis: Bicarb of 20, overbreathing him on vent with RR 24.
   Respiratory alkalosis compensating by dropping bicarb, PCO2 also low.
   Change vent settings? Since we are breathing for him, give Na Bicarb.
    from his few worthwhile alveoli, so back on assist, had to go back up
   on FI02 and then increase PEEP to get more lung involved in
   oxygenation, blood gas improved. now can back off.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be that he had derecruitment when we put him on pressure support,
   improved back on AC with PEEP but risk for further lung injury from 02
   radicals at high FI02, barotrauma from high PEEP, needed it acutely but
   should wean as tolerated.
   Hypertensive emergency:

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and transferred from the floor for pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient developed fever, hypertension, and tachycardia, and was pan-cultured.
- Blood cultures are pending, as well as urine and sputum cultures.
- The patient's condition worsened, leading to the decision to cover empirically for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Antibiotics were added to the regimen.
- The patient's respiratory status improved with the adjustment of ventilator settings.
- The patient's hypertension and tachycardia responded to antihypertensive medication.
- The patient's fever subsided with antipyretic medication.
- Further investigations are ongoing, including genotyping for HIV, stool culture, and other tests.
- The patient's nutrition is being managed through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to issues with tube feeds.
- The patient's anemia is being managed with blood transfusions as needed.
- The patient's renal function is currently normal.
- The patient's sodium levels are being monitored closely.
- The patient remains in the ICU for further management and monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's worsening respiratory status and presence of fever and leukocytosis raise concerns for VAP."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they have been admitted to the ICU. The patient's temperature is elevated at 104.0 degrees Fahrenheit, indicating a fever. They have been started on antibiotics (Vanco/Cefipime, Cipro) to address possible infection.

The torso CT scan shows worsening parenchymal lung disease, especially in the right upper lobe (RUL). This could be indicative of pneumonia or acute lung injury. The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a mode of PRVC/AC, set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 38 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 23 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cmH2O, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10 and FiO2 > 60%.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 77 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 115/57 to 236/129 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm (SR), and their central venous pressure ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has a history of HIV and is currently experiencing several medical complications. 

1. Hypoemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has had a significant deterioration in their condition, with high fevers, hypertension, and tachycardia. The ventilator settings have been adjusted to provide higher airway pressure and increased oxygen delivery. Efforts will be made to wean the patient off the ventilator and reduce the need for supplemental oxygen.

2. Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP): Steroid therapy is being gradually reduced, and Bactrim is being monitored for any potential adverse effects on potassium levels. It is uncertain whether the downward trend is due to medication failure or another infection such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or bacterial infection.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced transient episodes of low blood pressure last night, which may be related to fluid shifts, high fevers, and sedation. 

4. HIV: The patient requires antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and their genotype needs to be determined before initiating treatment. The patient also needs to improve gastrointestinal motility and have a declining lipase level before starting HAART.

5. Fevers: The patient's fevers may be attributed to VAP, positive blood culture, or an abdominal CT scan without acute changes. Liver function tests are being monitored due to the risk"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient has a fever of 104.0Â°F and has been started on antibiotics including Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Ciprofloxacin. Blood cultures were drawn from the PICC line, urine, and sputum. The torso CT scan shows significant worsening of parenchymal lung disease, especially in the right upper lobe.

The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS and is currently being treated for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). However, there are concerns about possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or bacterial infection due to the high fevers and acute changes in the chest X-ray.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and an elevated central venous pressure (CVP). The respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 169.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a"

   with previously invalid sputum cultures, no other positive culture
   data.  Now sputum cultures showing yeast.
   Unable to wean vent settings significantly
 FiO2 from 70 yesterday to
   60 this morning.  Have been avoiding bronch due to concerns with
   derecruitment in the setting of high PEEP requirements.  However, will
   consider bronch when possible in order to get further data for
   treatment, and to investigate possible intermittent obstruction of ET
   tube.  RT and nursing expressing concern for occasional difficulty
   passing suction catheter.
   I.D has recommended darunavir (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) if reliable GI
   motility/ med absorption.
   Also currently tapering his prednisone, Prednisone - Day 4 of 20mg
   daily for duration of treatment. No evidence to suggest utility of high

    HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Secondary to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2443**] ->ARDS, now
   with likely superimposed PNA.  Repeat Chest CT on [**7-25**] showed worse
   compared to prior. Currently day 17 bactrim (dosing 500mg IV Q6H).
   Vancomycin day 4, cefepime/cipro day 2.  Had been treating empirically
   until now given fevers, leukocytosis, hypoxia, change in secrections,
   with previously invalid sputum cultures, no other positive culture
   data.  Now sputum cultures showing yeast.
   Unable to wean vent settings significantly
 FiO2 from 70 yesterday to
   60 this morning.  Have been avoiding bronch due to concerns with
   derecruitment in the setting of high PEEP requirements.  However, will
   consider bronch when possible in order to get further data for
   treatment, and to investigate possible intermittent obstruction of ET
   tube.  RT and nursing expressing concern for occasional difficulty
   passing suction catheter.
   I.D has recommended darunavir (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) if reliable GI
   motility/ med absorption.
   Also currently tapering his prednisone, Prednisone - Day 4 of 20mg
   daily for duration of treatment. No evidence to suggest utility of high
   dose steroids in severe PCP beyond acute presentation, and could do
   more harm in setting of VAP.
   Currently  tidal volume 400, RR: 24, PEEP 18, FI02 60
   Most recent abg 7.30/43/114/ 22
   Also significant anxiety component to his hypoxia, sedation was

   Had previously been hypertensive to 250s, underlying HTN, also in
   setting of backing off sedation, associated anxiety, no CNS pathology
   noted on wet read Head CT.
    Hypotensive overnight, possibly related to sepsis/sedative meds.
   Mildly responsive to fluids, but requiring low-dose levophed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and admitted to the ICU for PCP and ARDS. He has been treated empirically with antibiotics but developed fevers, leukocytosis, hypoxia, and change in secretions. The patient's sputum cultures showed yeast, indicating a possible superimposed pneumonia. He is still experiencing respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has HIV/AIDS and is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. He has shown some improvement in his blood cultures but remains febrile. His blood glucose levels are within normal range, and his renal function is stable. However, he has mild transaminitis, possibly related to drug toxicity or pancreatitis. His nutrition is being closely monitored, and efforts are being made to reestablish tube feeds. The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, likely due to stress, phlebotomy, and suboptimal nutrition. He requires careful monitoring and management of his condition in the ICU. Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. HIV-related complications
3. Sepsis
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
5. Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)
6. Anemia
7. Hypotension

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and AIDS who was transferred from the floor for PCP and ARDS. He is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to PCP and likely superimposed PNA. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and Bactrim. Sputum cultures have shown budding yeast with pseudohyphae.

The patient's condition remains unstable with persistent fevers, leukocytosis, hypoxia, and difficulty weaning off the ventilator. The recent ABG shows a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 43, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 167, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The chest CT shows worsening lung injury compared to the previous one.

The patient's blood pressure has been labile, with episodes of hypertension and hypotension. Levophed has been started to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Tylenol has been limited to 2g daily due to transaminitis.

The patient has been diagnosed with HIV and is awaiting genotyping. Initiation of antiretroviral therapy is complicated by poor gut motility and uncertain medication absorption. Prednisone is being tapered due to severe PCP.

Other issues include anemia, hyperkalemia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and HIV/AIDS, who was transferred from the floor for treatment of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia) and ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). He is currently on day 17 of Bactrim therapy for PCP but is showing no improvement. He also has suspected VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia), and cultures are pending. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications including hyperkalemia, anemia, hypotension, and transaminitis. He requires ongoing respiratory support with mechanical ventilation due to ARDS. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has suspected VAP, which is a common complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. It can be caused by various pathogens including bacteria and fungi. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and additional antibiotics may be necessary based on culture results.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is suffering from ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by diffuse inflammation and pulmonary edema. It can lead to respiratory failure and requires intensive care management, including mechanical ventilation. The patient's ARDS is complicated by the presence of PCP and possible superimposed bacterial infection.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high levels of potassium in his"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with ARDS, sepsis, and pneumonia. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a fever, low blood pressure, and an increased heart rate. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) of 8.4 L/min, and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) at 69%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 8,909 mL and an output of 3,940 mL over the past 24 hours. 

The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with PRVC/AC ventilation mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.30, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 43 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 190 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 8.5 L/min.

The physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic status. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), sepsis, and other medical conditions. The note details the patient's vital signs, lab results, respiratory support, and physical examination findings. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and hypercoagulable state associated with critical illness increase the risk of blood clots.

3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines or devices can lead to infections such as central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests impaired renal function, which can worsen due to sepsis and inadequate fluid management.

5. Hypotension and shock: The patient's low blood pressure indicates possible hypotension, which may progress to septic shock if not managed appropriately.

6. Malnutrition: Prolonged bed rest and impaired nutritional intake may result in malnutrition, which can delay recovery.

7. HIV/AIDS-related complications: The presence of HIV/AIDS increases the risk of opportunistic infections and immune dysfunction.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient and implement appropriate interventions to prevent or"

   get him completely passive on the vent for good numbers- best est is
   PEEP 16 optimal. Added coverage for VAP- may bronch later if settings
   on vent stabalize. Could also be a component of pulm edema after HTN
   and tachy and trying to keep negative.
   2.       PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: wean steroids to 20 QD, ongoing Bactrim watch K.
   question of whether downward spiral could be PCP treatment failure but
   acuity makes it seem less likely and VAP or bac infection more likely.
   3.       Hypotension: seems related to sedation and autoPEEPing. We
   will try to wean levophed as bale today.
   4.       HIV: hope to add HAART, awaiting genotype, needs to improve GI
   motility and hope for a down trending lipase before we start
   5.       Fevers: VAP, pan cx, abd CT without acute changes but trend
   LFTs as he is at risk for acalc choly so will re US tomm if rising ,
   6.       Nutrition: restart tube feeds today and advance as tolerated.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of ARDS and sepsis. The patient's medical history includes HIV, for which they are awaiting genotype to determine appropriate HAART therapy. The patient also has anemia, hyperkalemia, hypotension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is described as hypoxemic and failing, indicating a risk for further deterioration in oxygenation and potential need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient already has increased white blood cell count and fever, which may indicate an infection.
3. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP): As the patient has HIV, PCP is a concern, especially with the current presentation of fever and respiratory symptoms.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating ongoing hypotension. This could be due to sepsis, ARDS, or medication effects.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's nutrition status is a concern, as tube feeds have been restarted and will be advanced as tolerated. Malnutrition can complicate recovery and increase the risk of infections.
6. Acute kidney injury: The elevated creatinine levels suggest possible kidney dysfunction, which may require further evaluation and management"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9162**] is a 45 year old male with history of hypertension and [**Hospital 9163**]
   transferred from the floor for PCP and ARDS.
   1) HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Secondary to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2443**] ->ARDS, now
   with likely superimposed PNA.  Repeat Chest CT on [**7-25**] was stable
   compared to prior. Currently day 18 bactrim (dosing 500mg IV Q6H).
   Vancomycin day 5, cefepime/cipro day 3.  Had been treating empirically
   until now given fevers, leukocytosis, hypoxia, change in secrections,
   with previously invalid sputum cultures, no other positive culture
   data.  Now sputum cultures showing yeast.
   Vent settings weaned
 FiO2 from 60 yesterday to 50 this morning, PEEP
   18 to 16.  Have been avoiding bronch due to concerns with derecruitment
   in the setting of high PEEP requirements.
   However, will consider bronch when possible in order to get further
   data for treatment, and to investigate possible intermittent
   obstruction of ET tube.
   Replacement of ET tube: Continues with blood tinged secretions. RT and
   nursing expressing concern for occasional difficulty passing suction
   catheter.
   Increased anxiety so to Versed was increased 10 mg yesterday.
   Also currently tapering his prednisone, Prednisone - Day 5 of 20mg
   daily for duration of treatment. No evidence to suggest utility of high
   dose steroids in severe PCP beyond acute presentation, and could do
   more harm in setting of VAP
   -Continue careful wean as tolerated esp with PEEP
attempt to wean by 2,
   FiO2 to 40, following ABG.
   -Bronch-PEEP closer to 10
   -Continue at prednisone 20 mg
   -CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes
   2) ANEMIA,:. Hct down to 23.1. Heme onc following, peripheral smears
   consistent with HIV. Likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition
   suboptimal. no bone marrow biopsy at this time. Hct has been hovering
   around 25.
   - check hct q12h, transfuse to > 21.
   3) Labile BP: BP stable overnight. No CNS pathology on CT. Fentanyl
   D/C
d, which likely helped with improving hypotension. No pressors at
   this point.
   -Cautious use of fluids for low bps
   -continue levophed for MAPs <60.
   4) Fevers: T to 99.1 overnight, WBC decreased.  BCX pending, C diff
   negative. Sputum with yeast.
   -continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics
   -Consider mini BAL if PEEP decreased.
   - keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis
   5)   Urine lytes checked yesterday
 FeNa 3.  Creatinine WNL, good
   UOP.  Unclear etiology at this point. Continues to autodiurese.
   6) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Awaiting genotyping.
   Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities dyslipidemia, some
   hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) recommended by I.D but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  Recommend continuing to
   hold on initiating HAART therapy for now.
   -C/s ID if darunavir can be restarted given improved GI motility and
   decreasing transaminases.
   7) Transamintis/pancreatitis: AST/ALTs and lipase all down today. Ddx ?
   drug toxicity (bactrim) vs obstruction vs ?HIV cholangiopathy on US, vs
   acalculus cholecystitis. RUQ US showed just sludging.
   -Can consider perc drainage if no Improvement but trending down today
   Continue to trend LFTs, lipase, limit Tylenol to 2g.day.
   8) Nutrition: TF residuals 65 yesterday.  Dopoff now in place, verified
   by CT.   Will restart tube feeds today slowly.

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9162**] is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and [**Hospital 9163**] transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to PCP and ARDS. There is also a possibility of superimposed pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
3. Intermittent obstruction of ET tube: The patient's blood-tinged secretions and difficulty passing suction catheter raise concerns for possible intermittent obstruction of the endotracheal (ET) tube.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. It is likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, and suboptimal nutrition.
6. Labile blood pressure: The patient's blood pressure is unstable and requires careful monitoring and management.
7. Fevers: The patient has had persistent fevers despite antibiotic treatment"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9162**] is a 45 year old male with history of hypertension and [**Hospital 9163**]
   transferred from the floor for PCP and ARDS, with success wean of
   ventilation requirements and stable BP yesterday.
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Secondary to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2443**] ->ARDS,
   now with likely superimposed PNA.  CXR stable to improved. Currently
   day 18 bactrim (dosing 500mg IV Q6H).  Vancomycin day 5, cefepime/cipro
   day 3.  Sputum cultures now with yeast, blood cx pending.
   *Vent settings weaned
 FiO2 from 60 yesterday to 50 this morning, PEEP
   18 to 16.
   *Possible intermittent obstruction of ET tube, with increased
   difficulty passing suction catheter today. Have been avoiding bronch
   due to concerns with derecruitment in the setting of high PEEP
   requirements. However, will consider bronch  today because concern that
   potential obstruction will impair ability to wean PEEP further.
   Consider replacement of ET as needed pending bronch results. ID
   recommended BAL
can perform at the time of bronch if possible. Consider
   use of inhaled nitrous oxide during bronch to decrease hypercarbia and
   hypoxemia without exacerbating V/Q mismatch.
   *Increased anxiety so to Versed was increased 10 mg yesterday.
   *Currently tapering his prednisone, Prednisone - Day 5 of 20mg daily
   for duration of treatment. No evidence to suggest utility of high dose
   steroids in severe PCP beyond acute presentation, and could do more
   harm in setting of VAP.
   *Overall goals for respiratory failure unclear; we need to discuss the
   potential endpoints such as tracheotomy with the family
   - Bronchoscopy today with BAL if possible. Consider use of inhaled
   nitrous oxide during bronch to avoid hypercarbia.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg
   - Discuss goals of care including possible trach with family today.
   - Wean sedation as tolerated following bronch.
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes
   2) ANEMIA: Hct down to 23.1, has been hovering around 25, likely due to
   HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone marrow biopsy at
   this time. Heme onc following, peripheral smears consistent with HIV.
   Decrease in Hct today is within the +/-2 range of Hct expected range.
   No signs of acute blood loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused,
   Cr within normal limits.
   - Check hct q12h
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) Labile BP: BP stable overnight. No CNS pathology on CT. Fentanyl
   D/C
d, which likely helped improve hypotension. Pressors discontinued
   yesterday. No intervention required at this point due to stable BP.
   -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs
   - Levophed for MAPs <60.
   4) Fevers: T to 99.1 overnight, WBC decreased.  Likely due to VAP.
   Blood CX pending, C diff negative. Sputum with yeast.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics as per above.
   -Mini-BAL today with bronchoscopy if possible.
   - Keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis
   5) Transamintis/pancreatitis: AST/ALTs and lipase all down today, alk
   phos up. Ddx ? drug toxicity (bactrim) vs obstruction vs ?HIV
   cholangiopathy on US, vs acalculus cholecystitis. RUQ US  on [**2196-7-22**]
   showed just sludging. Lower AST/ALT with persistently elevated alk phos
   could indicate ongoing biliary process (high alk phos) that is no
   longer causing backup into the liver (lower transaminases).
   - Repeat RUQ ultrasound today.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Tylenol to 2g.day, as per above.
   6) Nutrition: Dopoff now in place, verified by CT.   TF residuals 65
   yesterday but seemingly successful at 35mL/hr.
   -Continue tube feeds as tolerated
   7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  However, his transaminitis
   is decreased today, and his tube feeding as been successful as per
   above.
   -Will ask ID
s recommendations if darunavir can be started in the near
   future given improved GI motility and decreasing transaminases.
   8)   Urine lytes checked yesterday
 FeNa 3.  Creatinine WNL, good
   UOP.  Unclear etiology at this point. Continues to autodiurese.
   -Simultaneous serum and urine osms today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9162**], a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, was transferred from the floor to the ICU for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). He is currently on assisted ventilation, receiving oxygen through an endotracheal tube. The patient's recent progress includes successful weaning of ventilation requirements and stable blood pressure yesterday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Secondary to PCP and likely superimposed pneumonia. The patient's CXR is stable to improved, and he is currently on day 18 of Bactrim therapy. Sputum cultures show yeast, and blood cultures are pending.
2) Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased to 23.1, likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, and suboptimal nutrition. No bone marrow biopsy has been done yet, but peripheral smears are consistent with HIV. The decrease in Hct today is within the expected range.
3) Labile Blood Pressure: The patient's blood pressure has been stable overnight, and no CNS pathology is seen on the CT scan. Fentanyl was discontinued, which may have improved the hypotension. Pressors were stopped yesterday, and no intervention is required at this point due to stable blood pressure.
4) Fevers: The patient's temperature is elevated at 99.1 degrees overnight, and his"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9162**] is a 45 year old male with history of hypertension and [**Hospital 9163**]
   transferred from the floor for PCP and ARDS, with success wean of
   ventilation requirements and stable BP yesterday.
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Secondary to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2443**] ->ARDS,
   now with likely superimposed PNA.  CXR stable to improved. Currently
   day 18 bactrim (dosing 500mg IV Q6H).  Vancomycin day 5, cefepime/cipro
   day 3.  Sputum cultures now with yeast, blood cx pending.
   *Vent settings weaned
 FiO2 from 60 yesterday to 50 this morning, PEEP
   18 to 16.
   *Possible intermittent obstruction of ET tube, with increased
   difficulty passing suction catheter today. Have been avoiding bronch
   due to concerns with derecruitment in the setting of high PEEP
   requirements. However, will consider bronch  today because concern that
   potential obstruction will impair ability to wean PEEP further.
   Consider replacement of ET as needed pending bronch results. ID
   recommended BAL
can perform at the time of bronch if possible. Consider
   use of inhaled nitrous oxide during bronch to decrease hypercarbia and
   hypoxemia without exacerbating V/Q mismatch.
   *Increased anxiety so to Versed was increased 10 mg yesterday.
   *Currently tapering his prednisone, Prednisone - Day 5 of 20mg daily
   for duration of treatment. No evidence to suggest utility of high dose
   steroids in severe PCP beyond acute presentation, and could do more
   harm in setting of VAP.
   *Overall goals for respiratory failure unclear; we need to discuss the
   potential endpoints such as tracheotomy with the family
   - Bronchoscopy today with BAL if possible. Consider use of inhaled
   nitrous oxide during bronch to avoid hypercarbia.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg
   - Discuss goals of care including possible trach with family today.
   - Wean sedation as tolerated following bronch.
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes
   2) ANEMIA: Hct down to 23.1, has been hovering around 25, likely due to
   HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone marrow biopsy at
   this time. Heme onc following, peripheral smears consistent with HIV.
   Decrease in Hct today is within the +/-2 range of Hct expected range.
   No signs of acute blood loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused,
   Cr within normal limits.
   - Check hct q12h
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) Labile BP: BP stable overnight. No CNS pathology on CT. Fentanyl
   D/C
d, which likely helped improve hypotension. Pressors discontinued
   yesterday. No intervention required at this point due to stable BP.
   -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs
   - Levophed for MAPs <60.
   4) FEVERS: T to 99.1 overnight, WBC decreased.  Likely due to VAP.
   Blood Cx pending, C diff negative. Sputum with yeast.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics as per above.
   -Mini-BAL today with bronchoscopy if possible.
   - Keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis
   5) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: AST/ALTs and lipase all down today, alk
   phos up. Ddx ? drug toxicity (bactrim) vs obstruction vs ?HIV
   cholangiopathy on US, vs acalculus cholecystitis. RUQ US  on [**2196-7-22**]
   showed just sludging. Lower AST/ALT with persistently elevated alk phos
   could indicate ongoing biliary process (high alk phos) that is no
   longer causing backup into the liver (lower transaminases).
   - Repeat RUQ ultrasound today.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Tylenol to 2g.day, as per above.
   6) NUTRITION: Dopoff now in place, verified by CT.   TF residuals 65
   yesterday but seemingly successful at 35mL/hr.
   -Continue tube feeds as tolerated
   7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  However, his transaminitis
   is decreased today, and his tube feeding as been successful as per
   above.
   -Will ask ID
s recommendations if darunavir can be started in the near
   future given improved GI motility and decreasing transaminases.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 3.  Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear
   etiology at this point, potentially due to solute diuresis. Continues
   to autodiurese.
   -Simultaneous serum and urine osms today.
   9) FEN: Continue tube feeds as per above.
   10) PROPHYLAXIS: heparin UF SC, pneumoboots, PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and HIV, who was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). He has been in the ICU for 18 days and is currently on day 5 of treatment with Bactrim for PCP. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 110/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on FiO2 50% and PEEP 16 cmH2O. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, and PaO2 of 162 mmHg.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) likely secondary to PCP and now with superimposed pneumonia. CXR is stable to improved.
2. Intermittent obstruction of ET (endotracheal) tube: The patient has increased difficulty passing suction catheter through the ET tube, which could impair the ability to wean PEEP further.
3. Increased anxiety: The patient's anxiety has increased, and he is currently on Versed to help with sedation.
4. Transaminitis/Pancreatitis: The patient's AST/ALT levels are elevated,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, transferred from the floor for hypoxia and initiation of therapy for PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). The patient is currently in the ICU, intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and pneumonia. The patient's condition is stable, with improvements seen in his CXR (chest X-ray). However, there are concerns about potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to PCP and ARDS, with a likely superimposed pneumonia. Ventilator settings have been weaned, FiO2 from 60 to 50 and PEEP from 18 to 16. There is a possible intermittent obstruction of the ET (endotracheal) tube, with increased difficulty passing suction catheters. Bronchoscopy is planned today to address this issue.

2. Anemia: The patient's Hct (hematocrit) has decreased to 23.1, likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, and nutrition suboptimal. No bone marrow biopsy has been performed at this time. The patient's peripheral smears are consistent with HIV.

3. Labile Blood Pressure: The patient's blood pressure has been stable overnight, with no CNS pathology on CT. Fentanyl has been discontinued, which may have helped"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9162**] is a 45 year old male with history of hypertension and [**Hospital 9163**]
   transferred from the floor for PCP and ARDS.
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Secondary to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2443**] ->ARDS,
   now with likely superimposed PNA.  CXR stable to improved. Currently
   day 18 bactrim (dosing 500mg IV Q6H).  Vancomycin day 5, cefepime/cipro
   day 3.  Sputum cultures now with yeast, blood cx pending.
   *Vent settings weaned
 FiO2 from 60 yesterday to 50 this morning, PEEP
   18 to 16.
   *Possible intermittent obstruction of ET tube, with increased
   difficulty passing suction catheter today. Have been avoiding bronch
   due to concerns with derecruitment in the setting of high PEEP
   requirements. However, will consider bronch  today because concern that
   potential obstruction will impair ability to wean PEEP further.
   Consider replacement of ET as needed pending bronch results. ID
   recommended BAL
can perform at the time of bronch if possible. Consider
   use of inhaled nitrous oxide during bronch to decrease hypercarbia and
   hypoxemia without exacerbating V/Q mismatch.
   *Increased anxiety so to Versed was increased 10 mg yesterday.
   *Currently tapering his prednisone, Prednisone - Day 5 of 20mg daily
   for duration of treatment. No evidence to suggest utility of high dose
   steroids in severe PCP beyond acute presentation, and could do more
   harm in setting of VAP.
   *Overall goals for respiratory failure unclear; we need to discuss the
   potential endpoints such as tracheotomy with the family
   - Bronchoscopy today with BAL if possible. Consider use of inhaled
   nitrous oxide during bronch to avoid hypercarbia.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg
   - Discuss goals of care including possible trach with family today.
   - Wean sedation as tolerated following bronch.
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes
   2) ANEMIA: Hct down to 23.1, has been hovering around 25, likely due to
   HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone marrow biopsy at
   this time. Heme onc following, peripheral smears consistent with HIV.
   Decrease in Hct today is within the +/-2 range of Hct expected range.
   No signs of acute blood loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused,
   Cr within normal limits.
   - Check hct q12h
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) Labile BP: BP stable overnight. No CNS pathology on CT. Fentanyl
   D/C
d, which likely helped improve hypotension. Pressors discontinued
   yesterday. No intervention required at this point due to stable BP.
   -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs
   - Levophed for MAPs <60.
   4) Fevers: T to 99.1 overnight, WBC decreased.  Likely due to VAP.
   Blood CX pending, C diff negative. Sputum with yeast.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics as per above.
   -Mini-BAL today with bronchoscopy if possible.
   - Keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis
   5) Transamintis/pancreatitis: AST/ALTs and lipase all down today, alk
   phos up. Ddx ? drug toxicity (bactrim) vs obstruction vs ?HIV
   cholangiopathy on US, vs acalculus cholecystitis. RUQ US  on [**2196-7-22**]
   showed just sludging. Lower AST/ALT with persistently elevated alk phos
   could indicate ongoing biliary process (high alk phos) that is no
   longer causing backup into the liver (lower transaminases).
   - Repeat RUQ ultrasound today.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Tylenol to 2g.day, as per above.
   6) Nutrition: Dopoff now in place, verified by CT.   TF residuals 65
   yesterday but seemingly successful at 35mL/hr.
   -Continue tube feeds as tolerated
   7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  However, his transaminitis
   is decreased today, and his tube feeding as been successful as per
   above.
   -Will ask ID
s recommendations if darunavir can be started in the near
   future given improved GI motility and decreasing transaminases.
   8)   Urine lytes checked yesterday
 FeNa 3.  Creatinine WNL, good
   UOP.  Unclear etiology at this point. Continues to autodiurese.
   -Simultaneous serum and urine osms today.
   9) FEN: Continue tube feeds as per above.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has been critically ill and requires intensive care unit (ICU) care. The patient is sedated and intubated, indicating mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/60 mmHg to 152/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 4,498 mL and output of 5,090 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -592 mL. This may indicate ongoing fluid losses or inadequate fluid resuscitation.

The patient's blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 162 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36 mmHg. These values suggest adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 26.2 K/uL, and elevated lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L. The patient also has hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 5.8 mEq/L.

The patient's medical history includes HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several medical complications. The note mentions the following potential medical complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and they are receiving mechanical ventilation with PRVC/AC mode, set Vt of 400 mL, RR of 24, PEEP of 16 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 95%. ABG results show PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 162, indicating some improvement.

2. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has been receiving antibiotics since [**2196-7-27**] 12:00 AM, which suggests an ongoing infection that has led to sepsis. However, the note does not provide specific details about the source of infection.

3. Hyperkalemia: The lab results show a high potassium level of 5.9 mEq/L, indicating hyperkalemia. This condition requires careful monitoring and management.

4. Anemia: The hemoglobin level is low at 7.8 g/dL, indicating anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

5. Hypotension: The blood pressure readings are low, ranging from 115/60 mmHg to 152/78 mmHg. The patient is being closely monitored for signs of hypotension and may require"

","The patient in the ICU is experiencing respiratory failure, and the medical team is working to optimize their condition. The patient has been weaned off high levels of oxygen (FIO2) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), indicating improvement. The stool culture came back negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff), which is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

The patient has no known drug allergies. They received multiple antibiotics, including cefepime, Bactrim (SMX/TMP), ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin, indicating a severe infection requiring broad-spectrum coverage.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Their temperature is slightly elevated. They have a central venous pressure (CVP) of 14 mmHg, which is within the normal range. Fluid balance shows an overall positive intake, with slightly more output than intake.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 24 breaths per minute, PEEP of 16 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 32 cmH2O. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are within acceptable limits.

   get him completely passive on the vent for good numbers- best est is
   PEEP 16 optimal. Added coverage for VAP- may bronch later if settings

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU and has undergone several interventions and treatments.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) is 37.3Â°C, current temperature (Tcurrent) is 36.4Â°C, heart rate (HR) is 74 bpm, blood pressure (BP) is 115/60 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) is 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 95%. The patient's height is 66 inches, central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 mmHg, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) is not mentioned. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 16 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at 32 cmH2O.

The patient has been weaned off vasopressors and has shown improvement in their condition. However, they still require intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26.2 K/uL"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with several medical conditions and complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they are currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, HIV/AIDS, and other nutritional alterations. The ARDS is indicated by fair air movement in the chest examination and the ABG results. Sepsis is suggested by the elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and other inflammatory markers.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate but decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 95% on FiO2 of 50%. The temperature is slightly elevated at 37.3Â°C. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 14 mmHg.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (cefipime, bactrim, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin), sedatives (midazolam), pain management (methadone), and prophylactic anticoagulation (heparin sodium). They are also receiving nutritional support through enteral feeding.

Laboratory results indicate anemia, hyperkalemia, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's renal function is also impaired with elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient is sedated and intubated, and currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/60 to 152/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has been weaned off vasopressors and has a negative C. diff culture. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted changes above.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of acute lung injury. ARDS can lead to severe respiratory failure and may require prolonged ventilatory support.

2. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient's sepsis is indicated by the presence of fever, increased white blood cell count, and positive cultures. Sepsis can progress to septic shock if not promptly treated, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially death.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has an elevated potassium level of 5.6 mEq/L, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness if not corrected.

4. Malnutrition: The patient's nutrition is compromised, as indicated by an altered nutritional"

   Assessment and Plan
   45M with a h/o HTN, [**Hospital 9163**] transfered to MICU with recent diagnosis of HIV
   and new diagnosis of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring
   intubation has had intermittent hypotension with difficulty weaning
   from ventilator
   .
   # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia with
   ARDS physiology. Now likely has superimposed PNA with some pulmonary
   edema. On bactrim and prednisone for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], cefepime and cipro for
   suspected VAP. CXR improved.
   *Vent settings remained at  50% FiO2, PEEP 16.
   *No major obstruction of ET tube on bronch. BAL with no organisms on
   gram stain.
   *Versed increased to 15 mg/hr due to lightness of sedation with HTN,
   tachycardia, desaturation while awake. Pharmacy to f/u re: possible
   increase in methodone and zyprexa dosing.  [**Month (only) 51**] need to add back the
   fentanyl drip
   * Prednisone - Day 6 of 20mg daily for duration of treatment. No
   evidence to suggest utility of high dose steroids in severe PCP beyond
   acute presentation, and could do more harm in setting of VAP.
   *Overall goals for respiratory failure unclear; we need to discuss the
   potential endpoints such as trach with the family
   -
   - F/u pharm recs for increasing methadone and zyprexa for inadequate
   sedation.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg
   - Discuss goals of care including possible trach with family today.
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes
   2) ANEMIA: Hct down to 23.1, has been hovering around 25, likely due to
   HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone marrow biopsy at
   this time. Heme onc following, peripheral smears consistent with HIV.
   Decrease in Hct today is within the +/-2 range of Hct expected range.
   No signs of acute blood loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused,
   Cr within normal limits.
   - Check hct q12h
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) Labile BP: BP stable overnight. No CNS pathology on CT. Fentanyl
   D/C
d, which likely helped improve hypotension. Pressors discontinued
   yesterday. No intervention required at this point due to stable BP.
   -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs
   - Levophed for MAPs <60.
   4) FEVERS: T to 99.1 overnight, WBC decreased.  Likely due to VAP.
   Blood Cx pending, C diff negative. Sputum with yeast.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics as per above.
   -Mini-BAL today with bronchoscopy if possible.
   - Keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis
   5) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: AST/ALTs and lipase all down today, alk
   phos up. Ddx ? drug toxicity (bactrim) vs obstruction vs ?HIV
   cholangiopathy on US, vs acalculus cholecystitis. RUQ US  on [**2196-7-22**]
   showed just sludging. Lower AST/ALT with persistently elevated alk phos
   could indicate ongoing biliary process (high alk phos) that is no
   longer causing backup into the liver (lower transaminases).
   - Repeat RUQ ultrasound today.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Tylenol to 2g.day, as per above.
   6) NUTRITION: Dopoff now in place, verified by CT.   TF residuals 65
   yesterday but seemingly successful at 35mL/hr.
   -Continue tube feeds as tolerated
   7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  However, his transaminitis
   is decreased today, and his tube feeding as been successful as per
   above.
   -Will ask ID
s recommendations if darunavir can be started in the near
   future given improved GI motility and decreasing transaminases.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 3.  Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear
   etiology at this point, potentially due to solute diuresis. Continues
   to autodiurese.
   -Simultaneous serum and urine osms today.

   Assessment and Plan
   45M with a h/o HTN, [**Hospital 9163**] transfered to MICU with recent diagnosis of HIV
   and new diagnosis of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring
   intubation has had intermittent hypotension with difficulty weaning
   from ventilator
   .
   # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia with
   ARDS physiology. Now likely has superimposed PNA with some pulmonary
   edema. On bactrim day 19 and prednisone for PCP,  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] day 6,
   cefepime/cipro day 4 for suspected VAP. CXR improved. Leukocytosis has
   resolved. No organisms on gram stain on BAL, with cx pending.
   *Vent settings weaned to  50% FiO2, PEEP 14 with stable SpO2. Could
   likely tolerate further decrease in PEEP toward goal of PEEP ~10 and
   trach placement. HCP agrees with trach.
   *No major obstruction of ET tube on bronch. BAL with no organisms on
   gram stain.
   *Versed increased to 15 mg/hr due to lightness of sedation with HTN,
   tachycardia, desaturation while awake. Options for improving sedation
   is increasing benzos (either Versed or other benzo) or increasing
   methadone for anxiety/pain. Fentanyl could be considered if sedation
   continues to be problem[**Name (NI) 595**]; [**Name2 (NI) 1410**] would address anxiety but he is at
   maximum dose. Given his current lack of pain and his long-standing high
   dose outpatient benzo use, he seems to be intolerant of benzo weans. In
   this setting, we can give him PO benzos to try to reduce his IV Versed
   dose over time, with the goal of weaning from IV benzos and trach
   placement. Once on trach, he may feel less anxious than while intubated
   and may require less benzos overall.
   * Prednisone - Day 6 of 20mg daily for duration of treatment. No
   evidence to suggest utility of high dose steroids in severe PCP beyond
   acute presentation, and could do more harm in setting of VAP.
   - Wean PEEP by 2 or as tolerated. Goal PEEP 10 with conversion to
   trach.
   - Diazepam 10 mg PO Q6H. Adjust Versed as tolerated, but weaning from
   Versed would likely be most successful after Diazepam has been onboard
   for a day.
   -Consult thoracics regarding potential trach in the coming days.
   -Continue Bactrim, cefepime/cipro, and [**Name2 (NI) **]. Consider adjustment to
   abx regimen pending BAL cx.
   -Per ID recs, check vanc troph 20 minutes before next dose.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes
   2) ANEMIA: Hct stable at 23.1, has been hovering around 25, likely due
   to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone marrow biopsy
   at this time. Heme onc following, peripheral smears consistent with
   HIV. No signs of acute blood loss: continues to be warm and
   well-perfused, Cr within normal limits.
   - Check hct q12h. Consider Q24h if stable this afternoon.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) Labile BP: BP stable with increased sedation. Because HTN,
   tachycardia and desats in the setting of inadequate sedation, achieving
   sedation goals above are important to controlling BP.  No pressors have
   been required x2day
   - Diazepam with Versed wean, per above.
    -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs
   - Levophed for MAPs <60.
   4) FEVERS: T to 99.4, WBC decreased.  Likely due to VAP. Blood Cx
   pending, C diff negative. No microorganisms on BAL gram stain
   yesterday, cx pending. Sputum with yeast.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics as per above.
   Adjustments to abx as needed pending BAL cx.
   -Follow up BAL cx
   - Keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis
   5) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: Stable. Ddx ? drug toxicity (bactrim) vs
   obstruction vs ?HIV cholangiopathy on US, vs acalculus cholecystitis.
   More likely drug toxicity because RUQ US  on [**2196-7-26**] showed no acute
   cholecystitis.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Tylenol to 2g.day, as per above.
    6) NUTRITION: Tolerated advancement to tube feeds at 50 cc/hr with
   residuals <100.
   -Continue tube feeds as tolerated
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  Given stable transaminitis
   and advanced tube feeds, we can consider starting today or the coming
   days; will seek ID
s recs.
    -Will ask ID
s recommendations if darunavir can be started in the near
   future given improved GI motility and decreasing transaminases.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 3.  Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear
   etiology at this point, potentially due to solute diuresis. Continues
   to autodiurese.  Can consider urine and serum osms if change to
   electrolytes or UOP.
    9) FEN: Continue tube feeds as per above.
   10) PROPHYLAXIS: heparin UF SC, pneumoboots, PPI
   11) ACCESS: A-line and RIJ. Place PICC line today and D/C RIJ.
    12) COMMUNICATION: [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9196**]-- [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9548**] (hm), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9549**] (wk)
    13) Disposition: Goal is to lower PEEP to enable trach. Continues to
   require ICU level care at this point.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, who was transferred to the MICU with recent diagnoses of HIV and PCP. He developed ARDS requiring intubation and has had intermittent hypotension with difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient is currently sedated and easily aroused, with frequent intermittent tachycardia, hypertension, and desaturation when awake. He is tolerating tube feedings with minimal gastric residuals at 50 cc/hr.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia with ARDS physiology. Now likely has superimposed PNA with some pulmonary edema.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Suspected due to the presence of yeast in sputum cultures and worsening lung infiltrates.
3. Anemia: Hct stable at 23.1, likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal.
4. Labile blood pressure: BP stable overnight, no CNS pathology on CT. No intervention required at this point due to stable BP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN) who was transferred to the MICU with recent diagnoses of HIV and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). He developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) requiring intubation and has had intermittent hypotension with difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: This is likely secondary to PCP pneumonia with ARDS physiology. Now it appears to have superimposed pneumonia with some pulmonary edema. The patient is on Bactrim and prednisone for PCP, cefepime, and cipro for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The chest X-ray has improved.

2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has decreased to 23.1 due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, and suboptimal nutrition. There are no signs of acute blood loss, and the creatinine levels are within normal limits.

3. Labile blood pressure: The patient's blood pressure has been stable overnight. No central nervous system (CNS) pathology was seen on the CT scan. Fentanyl was discontinued, which likely helped improve the hypotension. Pressors were discontinued yesterday. No further intervention is required at this point.

4. Fevers: The patient's temperature has increased to 99.1 overnight. The white blood cell count has decreased"

   Assessment and Plan
   45M with a h/o HTN, [**Hospital 9163**] transfered to MICU with recent diagnosis of HIV
   and new diagnosis of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring
   intubation has had intermittent hypotension with difficulty weaning
   from ventilator
   .
   # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia with
   ARDS physiology. Now likely has superimposed PNA with some pulmonary
   edema. On bactrim day 19 and prednisone for PCP,  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] day 6,
   cefepime/cipro day 4 for suspected VAP. CXR improved. Leukocytosis has
   resolved. No organisms on gram stain on BAL, with cx pending.
   *Vent settings weaned to  50% FiO2, PEEP 14 with stable SpO2. Could
   likely tolerate further decrease in PEEP toward goal of PEEP ~10 and
   trach placement. HCP agrees with trach.
   *No major obstruction of ET tube on bronch. BAL with no organisms on
   gram stain.
   *Versed increased to 15 mg/hr due to lightness of sedation with HTN,
   tachycardia, desaturation while awake. Options for improving sedation
   is increasing benzos (either Versed or other benzo) or increasing
   methadone for anxiety/pain. Fentanyl could be considered if sedation
   continues to be problem[**Name (NI) 595**]; [**Name2 (NI) 1410**] would address anxiety but he is at
   maximum dose. Given his current lack of pain and his long-standing high
   dose outpatient benzo use, he seems to be intolerant of benzo weans. In
   this setting, we can give him PO benzos to try to reduce his IV Versed
   dose over time, with the goal of weaning from IV benzos and trach
   placement. Once on trach, he may feel less anxious than while intubated
   and may require less benzos overall.
   * Prednisone - Day 6 of 20mg daily for duration of treatment. No
   evidence to suggest utility of high dose steroids in severe PCP beyond
   acute presentation, and could do more harm in setting of VAP.
   - Wean PEEP by 2 or as tolerated. Goal PEEP 10 with conversion to
   trach.
   - Diazepam 10 mg PO Q6H. Adjust Versed as tolerated, but weaning from
   Versed would likely be most successful after Diazepam has been onboard
   for a day.
   -Consult thoracics regarding potential trach in the coming days.
   -Continue Bactrim, cefepime/cipro, and [**Name2 (NI) **]. Consider adjustment to
   abx regimen pending BAL cx.
   -Per ID recs, check vanc troph 20 minutes before next dose.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes
   2) ANEMIA: Hct stable at 23.1, has been hovering around 25, likely due
   to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone marrow biopsy
   at this time. Heme onc following, peripheral smears consistent with
   HIV. No signs of acute blood loss: continues to be warm and
   well-perfused, Cr within normal limits.
   - Check hct q12h. Consider Q24h if stable this afternoon.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) Labile BP: BP stable with increased sedation. Because HTN,
   tachycardia and desats in the setting of inadequate sedation, achieving
   sedation goals above are important to controlling BP.  No pressors have
   been required x2day
   - Diazepam with Versed wean, per above.
    -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs
   - Levophed for MAPs <60.
   4) FEVERS: T to 99.4, WBC decreased.  Likely due to VAP. Blood Cx
   pending, C diff negative. No microorganisms on BAL gram stain
   yesterday, cx pending. Sputum with yeast.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics as per above.
   Adjustments to abx as needed pending BAL cx.
   -Follow up BAL cx
   - Keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis
   5) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: Stable. Ddx ? drug toxicity (bactrim) vs
   obstruction vs ?HIV cholangiopathy on US, vs acalculus cholecystitis.
   More likely drug toxicity because RUQ US  on [**2196-7-26**] showed no acute
   cholecystitis.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Tylenol to 2g.day, as per above.
    6) NUTRITION: Tolerated advancement to tube feeds at 50 cc/hr with
   residuals <100.
   -Continue tube feeds as tolerated
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  Given stable transaminitis
   and advanced tube feeds, we can consider starting today or the coming
   days; will seek ID
s recs.
    -Will ask ID
s recommendations if darunavir can be started in the near
   future given improved GI motility and decreasing transaminases.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 3.  Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear
   etiology at this point, potentially due to solute diuresis. Continues
   to autodiurese.  Can consider urine and serum osms if change to
   electrolytes or UOP.
    9) FEN: Continue tube feeds as per above.
   10) PROPHYLAXIS: heparin UF SC, pneumoboots, PPI
   11) ACCESS: A-line and RIJ. Place PICC line today and D/C RIJ.
    12) COMMUNICATION: [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9196**]-- [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9548**] (hm), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9549**] (wk)

   require ICU level care at this point.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, who was transferred to the MICU with recent diagnoses of HIV and PCP. He developed ARDS requiring intubation and has had intermittent hypotension with difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient underwent a bronchoscopic and BAL procedure, which showed no organisms on gram stain. He has been stable on FiO2 50% and PEEP 16, and has been weaned to PEEP 14 with a stable SpO2. The patient's RUQ ultrasound did not reveal any evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary ductal dilatation. He has been lightly sedated and easily aroused, with frequent intermittent tachycardia, hypertension, and desaturation when awake. His hiccups were resolved with the administration of Reglan. The patient has been tolerating tube feedings well with minimal gastric residuals at 50 cc/hr. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has secondary hypoxic respiratory failure due to PCP pneumonia with ARDS physiology. There is also a superimposed pneumonia with some pulmonary edema. The patient is currently on Bactrim day 19 and prednisone for PCP, cefepime/cipro day 4 for suspected VAP, and CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved, and no organisms were seen on gram"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure. They have undergone various procedures, including an ultrasound and bronchoscopy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 95/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is sedated and intubated, with fair air movement in their chest. They have a history of HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure indicates a potential complication related to inadequate oxygenation. Optimizing sedation and fluid balance is necessary to improve their condition.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed leukocytosis and fevers, which may indicate VAP. Adding coverage for VAP seems to have helped, and optimizing sedation and fluid balance is recommended.
3. HIV/AIDS: The patient's HIV status requires close monitoring and management, including adding HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) once the genotype is available.
4. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient's fevers and leukocytosis were initially thought to be due to VAP, but further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
5. Nutrition: The patient's nutritional status needs attention,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. The chief complaint is respiratory failure, and the patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. 

The patient has undergone an ultrasound and bronchoscopy, with no significant findings such as CBD dilation or organisms in the BAL sample. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/53 mmHg to 153/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. 

The patient's lab results show normal levels of hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, creatinine, and electrolytes. However, there are elevated levels of lactate, lactic acid, LDH, and liver enzymes (ALT and AST). 

The patient's medical history includes HIV/AIDS, pneumonia (likely PJP), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The plan of care includes weaning off sedation, discontinuing methadone, initiating HAART therapy for HIV management, and discussing tracheostomy placement with the family. The patient is also receiving nutrition through tube feeds and prophylactic treatments for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of respiratory function, infections such as VAP or pneumonia, bleeding due to the use of anticoagulant prophylaxis,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure.
- The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments, including bronchoscopy and ultrasound.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 95/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- The patient is sedated and intubated, with mechanical ventilation support.
- The patient's chest X-ray shows no new infiltrates or worsening of existing ones.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and slightly elevated potassium levels.
- The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), HIV, pneumonia, and other conditions.
- The patient is receiving nutritional support through enteral feeding, and measures are in place for glycemic control and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring and adherence to proper hygiene and infection control measures are crucial to prevent VAP.
2. Stress ulcers: Prolonged critical illness and mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. Prophylactic medications may be given"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. The patient has undergone several procedures and treatments, including bronchoscopy and ultrasound. They are currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 14 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/53 to 153/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, blood glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and magnesium. However, there is a slightly elevated level of creatinine and lactic acid. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 33 mmHg, PaO2 of 172, and HCO3- of 21 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals no audible murmurs, fair air movement in the chest, soft distended hypoactive bowel sounds, and stable extremities. The patient's BAL culture shows 1+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) without organisms.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has undergone several procedures and treatments including bronchoscopy, ultrasound, and administration of antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4 C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 95/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 223 K/uL, and elevated C-reactive protein level of 106 mEq/L. The blood culture results from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) show no organisms present, indicating that there is no bacterial infection.

The patient's chest X-ray reveals bilateral infiltrates in the lungs, consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's ARDS is classified as moderate severity with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 172.

The patient's nutritional status is concerning, as they are unable to tolerate enteral feeds due to their critical condition. The plan is to restart tube feeds today and advance as tolerated.

The patient's HIV status is mentioned, but no specific information regarding viral load or CD4 count is provided. The patient is currently on steroids for PCP pneumonia and will be evaluated for HAART therapy once their liver function tests stabilize.

   Fecal cx: negative
   IJ catheter tip culture pending.
   45M with a h/o HTN, [**Hospital 9163**] transfered to MICU with recent diagnosis of HIV
   and new diagnosis of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring
   intubation has had intermittent hypotension with difficulty weaning
   from ventilator
   .
   # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia with
   ARDS physiology. Now likely has superimposed PNA with some pulmonary
   edema.
   *On bactrim day 20 and prednisone for PCP,  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] day 7, cefepime/cipro
   day 5 for suspected VAP. CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. No
   organisms on gram stain on BAL, with cx pending.
   *Vent settings at 50% FiO2, PEEP 12 with stable SpO2. Goal is PEEP <10
   allowing for trach placement. HCP agrees with trach. Can increase FiO2
   to sustain decreased PEEP but bigger issue with desats is
   anxiety/agitation.
   *Versed at 15 mg/hr due to lightness of sedation with HTN, tachycardia,
   desaturation while awake. Options for improving sedation increasing
   frequency of diazepam, increasing methadone.
   * Prednisone - Day 6 of 20mg daily for duration of treatment. No
   evidence to suggest utility of high dose steroids in severe PCP beyond
   acute presentation, and could do more harm in setting of VAP.
   - Wean PEEP by 2 or as tolerated.  Can increase FiO2 if needed to
   sustain SpO2. Goal PEEP <10 with conversion to trach.
   - Increase Diazepam 10 mg PO to Q4H.
   -Increase methadone
   -Consult thoracics regarding potential trach in the coming days.
   -Continue Bactrim, cefepime/cipro, and [**Name10 (NameIs) **]. Consider adjustment to
   abx regimen pending BAL cx.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes
   2) Increase PO4 and low Mg: Magnesium repleted. Low Po4 may be due to
   recent advancement of tube feeds (increased insulin secretion) v.
   cumulative impact of suboptimal nutrition. Low Mg may be due to renal
   losses,
   -Replete Mg and PO4
   2) ANEMIA: Hct stable at 23.1, has been hovering around 25, likely due
   to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone marrow biopsy
   at this time. Heme onc following, peripheral smears consistent with
   HIV. No signs of acute blood loss: continues to be warm and
   well-perfused, Cr within normal limits.
   - Check hct q12h. Consider Q24h if stable this afternoon.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) Labile BP: BP stable with increased sedation. Because HTN,
   tachycardia and desats in the setting of inadequate sedation, achieving
   sedation goals above are important to controlling BP.  No pressors have
   been required x2day
   - Diazepam with Versed wean, per above.
    -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs
   - Levophed for MAPs <60.
   4) FEVERS: T to 99.4, WBC decreased.  Likely due to VAP. Blood Cx
   pending, C diff negative. No microorganisms on BAL gram stain
   yesterday, cx pending. Sputum with yeast.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics as per above.
   Adjustments to abx as needed pending BAL cx.
   -Follow up BAL cx
   - Keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis
   5) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: Stable. Ddx ? drug toxicity (bactrim) vs
   obstruction vs ?HIV cholangiopathy on US, vs acalculus cholecystitis.
   More likely drug toxicity because RUQ US  on [**2196-7-26**] showed no acute
   cholecystitis.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Tylenol to 2g.day, as per above.
    6) NUTRITION: Tolerated advancement to tube feeds at 50 cc/hr with
   residuals <100.
   -Continue tube feeds as tolerated
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  Given stable transaminitis
   and advanced tube feeds, ID will likely recommend starting HAART today.
    -F/u ID recs regarding starting HAART.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 3.  Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear
   etiology at this point, potentially due to solute diuresis. Continues
   to autodiurese.  Can consider urine and serum osms if change to
   electrolytes or UOP.
    9) FEN: Continue tube feeds as per above.
   10) PROPHYLAXIS: heparin UF SC, pneumoboots, PPI
   11) ACCESS: A-line and RIJ. Place PICC line today and D/C RIJ.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and a recent diagnosis of HIV and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). He was admitted to the MICU with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation due to ARDS. He has had intermittent hypotension and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient's current conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, anemia, labile blood pressure, fever, transaminitis/pancreatitis, and poor nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to PCP pneumonia with ARDS physiology. There is also a superimposed pneumonia with some pulmonary edema.
2. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which could be due to various factors such as HIV, stress, phlebotomy, or suboptimal nutrition.
3. Labile Blood Pressure: The patient's blood pressure is labile and can fluctuate between hypertension and hypotension. It is important to control BP through sedation and fluid management.
4. Fever: The patient has a fever, likely due to VAP. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered, and adjustments will be made based on the results of the BAL culture.
5. Transaminitis/Pancreatitis: The patient has evidence of transaminitis and pancreatitis, possibly due to drug toxicity (bactrim),"

   PEEP decreased from 16 to 12.
   Diazepam added to sedation regimen (currently Versed), with goal of
   decreasing Versed so that trach can be done when PEEP is 10.
   Stable during day, but with increased agitation in the later evening,
   very anxious with elevated HR and BP - patient reassured, given
   diazepam for sedation, also increased Versed.  PICC was also placed,
   then R IJ line removed, XR checked post-procedure.  Continues to have
   low residuals with tube feeds, may consider removing OG tube (leaving
   Dophoff) if they continue to be low.
   Discussed with ID - will likely advise starting HAART therapy today if
   stable.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint and various medical conditions.
- The patient has undergone several procedures, including an EKG, PICC line placement, and removal of a multi-lumen line.
- The patient's PEEP has been decreased from 16 to 12.
- Diazepam has been added to the sedation regimen to decrease Versed and prepare for tracheostomy when PEEP is at 10.
- The patient has shown increased agitation, anxiety, elevated heart rate, and blood pressure, for which diazepam and increased Versed were given.
- A PICC line was placed, and an IJ line was removed.
- The patient continues to have low residuals with tube feeds, and consideration is being given to removing the OG tube while leaving the Dophoff tube.
- The patient's last doses of antibiotics were administered on different days.
- The patient is receiving multiple infusions and other ICU medications.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a slightly elevated heart rate.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 5,583 mL and output of 6,735 mL, indicating a negative balance of 1,152 mL.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with PRVC/AC mode, set Vt of 400 mL, RR of 24 breaths per minute, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and RSBI deferred due to PEEP > 10.
- The patient's ABG results are within normal limits.
- The patient's physical examination reveals crackles bilaterally on anterior exam and hypoechoic, soft, non-distended abdomen.
- The patient's lab results show normal values for WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, TCO2, Glucose, and other electrolytes.
- Imaging studies show new right PICC terminating at the cavoatrial junction and widespread parenchymal opacities.

   CXR from [**2196-7-29**]:
   Microbiology: BAL from [**2196-7-27**]: Fungal cx negative. Respiratory cx
   pending.
   Fecal cx: negative
   IJ catheter tip culture pending.
   45M with a h/o HTN, [**Hospital 9163**] transfered to MICU with recent diagnosis of HIV
   and new diagnosis of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring
   intubation has had intermittent hypotension with difficulty weaning
   from ventilator
   .
   # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia with
   ARDS physiology. Now likely has superimposed PNA with some pulmonary
   edema.
   *On bactrim day 20 and prednisone for PCP,  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] day 7, cefepime/cipro
   day 5 for suspected VAP. CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. No
   organisms on gram stain on BAL, with cx pending.
   *Vent settings at 50% FiO2, PEEP 12 with stable SpO2. Goal is PEEP <10
   allowing for trach placement. HCP agrees with trach. Can increase FiO2
   to sustain decreased PEEP but bigger issue with desats is
   anxiety/agitation.
   *Versed at 15 mg/hr due to lightness of sedation with HTN, tachycardia,
   desaturation while awake. Options for improving sedation increasing
   frequency of diazepam, increasing methadone.
   * Prednisone - Day 6 of 20mg daily for duration of treatment. No
   evidence to suggest utility of high dose steroids in severe PCP beyond
   acute presentation, and could do more harm in setting of VAP.
   - Wean PEEP by 2 or as tolerated.  Can increase FiO2 if needed to
   sustain SpO2. Goal PEEP <10 with conversion to trach.
   - Increase Diazepam 10 mg PO to Q4H.
   -Consult thoracics regarding potential trach in the coming days.
   -Continue Bactrim, cefepime/cipro, and [**Name10 (NameIs) **]. Consider adjustment to
   abx regimen pending BAL cx.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes
   2) Increase PO4 and low Mg: Magnesium repleted. Low Po4 may be due to
   recent advancement of tube feeds (increased insulin secretion) v.
   cumulative impact of suboptimal nutrition. Low Mg may be due to renal
   losses,
   -Replete Mg and PO4
   2) ANEMIA: Hct stable at 23.1, has been hovering around 25, likely due
   to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone marrow biopsy
   at this time. Heme onc following, peripheral smears consistent with
   HIV. No signs of acute blood loss: continues to be warm and
   well-perfused, Cr within normal limits.
   - Check hct q12h. Consider Q24h if stable this afternoon.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) Labile BP: BP stable with increased sedation. Because HTN,
   tachycardia and desats in the setting of inadequate sedation, achieving
   sedation goals above are important to controlling BP.  No pressors have
   been required x2day
   - Diazepam with Versed wean, per above.
    -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs
   - Levophed for MAPs <60.
   4) FEVERS: T to 99.4, WBC decreased.  Likely due to VAP. Blood Cx
   pending, C diff negative. No microorganisms on BAL gram stain
   yesterday, cx pending. Sputum with yeast.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics as per above.
   Adjustments to abx as needed pending BAL cx.
   -Follow up BAL cx
   - Keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis
   5) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: Stable. Ddx ? drug toxicity (bactrim) vs
   obstruction vs ?HIV cholangiopathy on US, vs acalculus cholecystitis.
   More likely drug toxicity because RUQ US  on [**2196-7-26**] showed no acute
   cholecystitis.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Tylenol to 2g.day, as per above.
    6) NUTRITION: Tolerated advancement to tube feeds at 50 cc/hr with
   residuals <100.
   -Continue tube feeds as tolerated
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  Given stable transaminitis
   and advanced tube feeds, ID will likely recommend starting HAART today.
    -F/u ID recs regarding starting HAART.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 3.  Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear
   etiology at this point, potentially due to solute diuresis. Continues
   to autodiurese.  Can consider urine and serum osms if change to
   electrolytes or UOP.
    9) FEN: Continue tube feeds as per above.
   10) PROPHYLAXIS: heparin UF SC, pneumoboots, PPI
   11) ACCESS: A-line and RIJ. Place PICC line today and D/C RIJ.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and newly diagnosed HIV, was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with a recent diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by intermittent hypotension and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

The patient has shown improvement with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Bactrim, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. The patient's leukocytosis has resolved, and there are no organisms detected on the gram stain of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) has also improved. However, the patient remains dependent on high levels of FiO2 and PEEP, making it difficult to plan for a tracheostomy.

The patient's sedation regimen includes midazolam (Versed) and diazepam (Valium), which have been adjusted due to lightness of sedation and episodes of agitation. The patient's blood pressure has been labile, but stable with increased sedation. Efforts are being made to wean the patient off the ventilator and perform a tracheostomy.

The patient's labs show elevated liver enzymes and lipase levels, suggesting possible drug toxicity or pancreatitis. The patient's electrolytes"

   Imaging:
   CXR for PICC placement from [**2196-7-28**]: New R PICC terminates at
   cavoatrial jxn, otherwise unchanged, with bilateral
   widespread parenchymal opacities.
   CXR from [**2196-7-29**]: Stable to improved diffuse parenchymal opacities.
   Microbiology: BAL from [**2196-7-27**]: Fungal cx negative. Respiratory cx
   pending.
   Fecal cx: negative
   IJ catheter tip culture pending.
   45M with a h/o HTN, [**Hospital 9163**] transfered to MICU with recent diagnosis of HIV
   and new diagnosis of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring
   intubation has had intermittent hypotension with difficulty weaning
   from ventilator.
   .
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   with ARDS physiology. Now likely has superimposed PNA with some
   pulmonary edema. On bactrim day 20 and prednisone for PCP,  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] day
   7, cefepime/cipro day 5 for suspected VAP. CXR improved. Leukocytosis
   has resolved. No organisms on gram stain on BAL, with cx pending.
   *Vent settings at 50% FiO2, PEEP 12 with generally stable SpO2 but
   drops in PaO2 on ABG and of SpO2 in the setting of agitation. Goal is
   PEEP </=10 allowing for trach placement. Can increase FiO2 to sustain
   decreased PEEP if needed but concern is desats are due to
   anxiety/agitation.
   *Sedation: Midazolam at 15 mg/hr, Olanzapine 5 mg Q6hrs, and Diazepam
   10 mg Q6Hr; plus 65 mg Midazolam PRN, Fentanyl IV x1 and Diazepam x 1
   overnight due to lightness of sedation with HTN, tachycardia,
   desaturation while agitated. Options for improving sedation include
   increasing frequency of diazepam, trial of alternate antipsychotic
   since we are at maximum dose of olanzapine, increasing Fio2, or
   increasing methadone. Given that he required large doses of Midazolam
   prn overnight, we can increase the frequency of his diazepam today;
   weighing against the risk of hypotension/other benzo toxicity requires
   care in significant increases to benzo dose. Also, we can D/C
   olanzapine and start Seroquel standing dose for agitation/anxiety.
   After making these adjustments, we can re-evaluate the need to increase
   FiO2 or methadone.
   * Prednisone: Day 6 of 20mg daily for duration of treatment. No
   evidence to suggest utility of high dose steroids in severe PCP beyond
   acute presentation, and could do more harm in setting of VAP.
   - Increase Diazepam 10 mg PO to Q4H.
   -D/C Olanzapine and start Quetiapine Fumarate 25 mg PO BID
   -Continue Midazolam 15 mg/hr. Consider weaning as tolerated following
   above changes.
   - Wean PEEP by 2 or as tolerated, but will be conservative pending
   evaluation of response to anxiolytic regimen above. Goal PEEP </=10
   with conversion to trach.
   - Follow up with thoracics regarding potential trach in the coming
   days.
   -Continue Bactrim, cefepime/cipro, and [**Name10 (NameIs) **]. Consider adjustment to
   abx regimen pending BAL cx.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes
   2) LABILE BP: HTN with agitation, hypotensive episode with tachycardia
   responsive to IVF overnight.  Because HTN, tachycardia and desats in
   the setting of inadequate sedation, achieving sedation goals above are
   important to controlling BP.  No pressors have been required x3 days.
   - Increase Diazepam, continue Midazolam, and start Quetiapine per
   above.
    -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs
   - Levophed for MAPs <60.
   3) Low PO4 and low Mg: Magnesium repleted. Low phosphate likely due to
   recent advancement of tube feeds (increased insulin secretion) v.
   cumulative impact of suboptimal nutrition vs. renal losses from current
   autodiuresis. Low Mg may be due to renal losses v. cumulative impact of
   suboptimal nutrition.
   -Replete with Mg and PO phosphate as needed.
   -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate
   4) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: Stable/slowly increasing in the past
   days. Ddx ? drug toxicity (bactrim +/- Tylenol) vs obstruction vs ?HIV
   cholangiopathy on US, vs acalculus cholecystitis. More likely drug
   toxicity because RUQ US on [**2196-7-26**] showed no acute cholecystitis or
   ductal dilatation. Negative crypto and CMV. Unclear why rising in the 3
   days.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Tylenol to 2g.day
   5) ANEMIA: Hct stable around 25. Anemia likely due to HIV, stress,
   phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone marrow biopsy at this time.
   Heme onc following, peripheral smears consistent with HIV. No signs of
   acute blood loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused, Cr within
   normal limits.
   - Continue with Q24Hr Hct checks to minimize blood loss due to
   phlebotomy.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   6) FEVERS: T to 99.2, WBC decreased.  Likely due to VAP. Blood Cx
   pending, C diff negative, stool culture negative. No microorganisms on
   BAL gram stain yesterday, cx pending. Sputum with yeast.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics as per above.
   Adjustments to abx as needed pending BAL cx.
   -Follow up BAL respiratory cx
   - Keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  Given stable transaminitis
   and advanced tube feeds, ID will likely recommend starting HAART today.
    -F/u ID recs regarding starting HAART today.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 3.  Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear
   etiology at this point, potentially due to solute diuresis. Continues
   to autodiurese.  Can consider urine and serum osms if change to
   electrolytes or UOP.
   9) FEN: Tolerated advancement to tube feeds at 50 cc/hr without
   significant residuals. Can D/C OG tube today, with Dopoff remaining.
   -Can D/C OG tube today
   -Continue ISS for glycemic control
   10) PROPHYLAXIS: heparin UF SC, pneumoboots, PPI
   11) ACCESS: A-line and PICC.

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and newly diagnosed HIV presenting with ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia. He has been intubated and is currently in the ICU. The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia with ARDS physiology. There is also a possibility of superimposed pneumonia with some pulmonary edema. The patient is on Bactrim day 20 and prednisone for PCP, cefepime/cipro day 5 for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The chest X-ray shows improvement. Leukocytosis has resolved, and no organisms were found on the gram stain of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), with the culture pending.

2. Labile blood pressure: The patient experiences episodes of hypertension with agitation and hypotension with tachycardia. This is responsive to intravenous fluids overnight. The goal is to achieve sedation goals mentioned above to control blood pressure. No vasopressors have been required for the past three days.

3. Low phosphate and magnesium: The patient's phosphate levels are low due to recent advancement of tube feeds (increased insulin secretion) versus cumulative impact of suboptimal nutrition versus renal losses from autodiuresis. Magnesium repletion has been done. The patient's low magnesium may be due to renal losses versus cumulative impact of suboptimal nutrition. Repletion with magnesium"

   PEEP decreased from 16 to 12.
   Diazepam added to sedation regimen (currently Midazolam), with goal of
   decreasing Versed so that trach can be done when PEEP is 10.
   Overnight: Pt had increased agitation and became acutely tachycardic HR
   >140 and hypertensive with SBP>180 twice overnight and required
   multiple boluses of Midazolam (65 mg/12Hr), IV Diazepam and IV fentanyl
   x1, in addition to scheduled doses of PO Diazepam and Olanzapine.

   45M with a h/o HTN, [**Hospital 9163**] transfered to MICU with recent diagnosis of HIV
   and new diagnosis of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring
   intubation has had intermittent hypotension with difficulty weaning
   from ventilator.
   .
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   with ARDS physiology. Now likely has superimposed PNA with some
   pulmonary edema. On bactrim day 20 and prednisone for PCP,  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] day 7
   of 15, cefepime/cipro day 5 of 14 for suspected VAP. CXR improved.
   Leukocytosis has resolved. No organisms on gram stain on BAL, with cx
   pending.
   *Vent settings at 50% FiO2, PEEP 12 with generally stable SpO2 but
   drops in PaO2 on ABG and of SpO2 in the setting of agitation. Goal is
   PEEP </=10 allowing for trach placement. Can increase FiO2 to sustain
   decreased PEEP if needed but concern is desats are due to
   anxiety/agitation.
   *Sedation: Midazolam at 15 mg/hr, Olanzapine 5 mg Q6hrs, and Diazepam
   10 mg Q6Hr; plus 65 mg Midazolam PRN, Fentanyl IV x1 and Diazepam x 1
   overnight due to lightness of sedation with HTN, tachycardia,
   desaturation while agitated. Options for improving sedation include
   increasing frequency of diazepam, trial of alternate antipsychotic
   since we are at maximum dose of olanzapine, increasing Fio2, or
   increasing methadone. Given that he required large doses of Midazolam
   prn overnight, we can increase the frequency of his diazepam today;
   weighing against the risk of hypotension/other benzo toxicity requires
   care in significant increases to benzo dose. Also, we can D/C
   olanzapine and start Seroquel standing dose for agitation/anxiety.
   After making these adjustments, we can re-evaluate the need to increase
   FiO2 or methadone.
   * Prednisone: Day 6 of 20mg daily for duration of treatment. No
   evidence to suggest utility of high dose steroids in severe PCP beyond
   acute presentation, and could do more harm in setting of VAP.
   - Increase Diazepam 10 mg PO to Q4H.
   -D/C Olanzapine and start Quetiapine Fumarate 25 mg PO BID
   -Continue Midazolam 15 mg/hr. Consider weaning as tolerated following
   above changes.
   - Wean PEEP by 2 or as tolerated, but will be conservative pending
   evaluation of response to anxiolytic regimen above. Goal PEEP </=10
   with conversion to trach.
   - Follow up with thoracics regarding potential trach in the coming
   days.
   -Continue Bactrim, cefepime/cipro, and [**Name10 (NameIs) **]. Consider adjustment to
   abx regimen pending BAL cx.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes
   2) LABILE BP: HTN with agitation, hypotensive episode with tachycardia
   responsive to IVF overnight.  Because HTN, tachycardia and desats in
   the setting of inadequate sedation, achieving sedation goals above are
   important to controlling BP.  No pressors have been required x3 days.
   - Increase Diazepam, continue Midazolam, and start Quetiapine per
   above.
    -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs
   - Levophed for MAPs <60.
   3) Low PO4 and low Mg: Magnesium repleted. Low phosphate likely due to
   recent advancement of tube feeds (increased insulin secretion) v.
   cumulative impact of suboptimal nutrition vs. renal losses from current
   autodiuresis. Low Mg may be due to renal losses v. cumulative impact of
   suboptimal nutrition.
   -Replete with Mg and PO phosphate as needed.
   -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate
   4) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: Stable/slowly increasing in the past
   days. Ddx ? drug toxicity (bactrim +/- Tylenol) vs obstruction vs ?HIV
   cholangiopathy on US, vs acalculus cholecystitis. More likely drug
   toxicity because RUQ US on [**2196-7-26**] showed no acute cholecystitis or
   ductal dilatation. Negative crypto and CMV. Unclear why rising in the 3
   days.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Tylenol to 2g.day
   5) ANEMIA: Hct stable around 25. Anemia likely due to HIV, stress,
   phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone marrow biopsy at this time.
   Heme onc following, peripheral smears consistent with HIV. No signs of
   acute blood loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused, Cr within
   normal limits.
   - Continue with Q24Hr Hct checks to minimize blood loss due to
   phlebotomy.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   6) FEVERS: T to 99.2, WBC decreased.  Likely due to VAP. Blood Cx
   pending, C diff negative, stool culture negative. No microorganisms on
   BAL gram stain yesterday, cx pending. Sputum with yeast.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics as per above.
   Adjustments to abx as needed pending BAL cx.
   -Follow up BAL respiratory cx
   - Keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  Given stable transaminitis
   and advanced tube feeds, ID will likely recommend starting HAART today.
    -F/u ID recs regarding starting HAART today.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 3.  Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear
   etiology at this point, potentially due to solute diuresis. Continues
   to autodiurese.  Can consider urine and serum osms if change to
   electrolytes or UOP.
   9) FEN: Tolerated advancement to tube feeds at 50 cc/hr without
   significant residuals. Can D/C OG tube today, with Dopoff remaining.
   -Can D/C OG tube today

","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of PCP pneumonia with ARDS physiology. There is also a suspicion of superimposed pneumonia with pulmonary edema. The patient is currently on bactrim and prednisone for PCP, as well as cefepime/cipro for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The CXR has improved, but the patient still requires significant FiO2 to maintain adequate oxygenation. The goal is to wean PEEP to â¤10 to allow for tracheostomy placement.

2. Labile blood pressure: The patient experiences episodes of hypertension and hypotension, which may be related to agitation, anxiety, or inadequate sedation. The current treatment plan includes increasing the frequency of diazepam, discontinuing olanzapine, and starting quetiapine to improve sedation. Cautious fluid management and the use of vasopressors such as levophed will be considered if the patient's blood pressure remains unstable.

3. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient has low phosphate levels, likely due to recent advancement of tube feeds, increased insulin secretion, and cumulative nutritional deficiencies. Magnesium repletion has been initiated, and phosphate supplementation may be necessary. The patient's low magnesium levels may also contribute to these findings.

4. Transaminitis/pancreatitis:"

   PEEP decreased from 16 to 12.
   Diazepam added to sedation regimen (currently Midazolam), with goal of
   decreasing Versed so that trach can be done when PEEP is 10.
   Overnight: Pt had increased agitation and became acutely tachycardic HR
   >140 and hypertensive with SBP>180 twice overnight and required
   multiple boluses of Midazolam (65 mg/12Hr), IV Diazepam and IV fentanyl
   x1, in addition to scheduled doses of PO Diazepam and Olanzapine.

s despite remaining tachycardic, for
   which he received a 500 ccNS bolus.
   PICC was also placed, then R IJ line removed, XR checked post-procedure
   with confirmation of appropriate positioning.
   Continues to have low residuals with tube feeds, may consider removing
   OG tube (leaving Dophoff) if they continue to be low.

   </=10 with conversion to trach.
   - Follow up with thoracics regarding potential trach in the coming
   days.
   -Continue Bactrim, cefepime/cipro, and [**Name10 (NameIs) **]. Consider adjustment to
   abx regimen pending BAL cx.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes
   2) LABILE BP: HTN with agitation, hypotensive episode with tachycardia
   responsive to IVF overnight.  Because HTN, tachycardia and desats in
   the setting of inadequate sedation, achieving sedation goals above are
   important to controlling BP.  No pressors have been required x3 days.
   - Increase Diazepam, continue Midazolam, and start Quetiapine per
   above.
    -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs
   - Levophed for MAPs <60.
   3) Low PO4 and low Mg: Magnesium repleted. Low phosphate likely due to
   recent advancement of tube feeds (increased insulin secretion) v.
   cumulative impact of suboptimal nutrition vs. renal losses from current
   autodiuresis. Low Mg may be due to renal losses v. cumulative impact of
   suboptimal nutrition.
   -Replete with Mg and PO phosphate as needed.
   -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate
   4) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: Stable/slowly increasing in the past
   days. Ddx ? drug toxicity (bactrim +/- Tylenol) vs obstruction vs ?HIV
   cholangiopathy on US, vs acalculus cholecystitis. More likely drug
   toxicity because RUQ US on [**2196-7-26**] showed no acute cholecystitis or
   ductal dilatation. Negative crypto and CMV. Unclear why rising in the 3
   days.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Tylenol to 2g.day
   5) ANEMIA: Hct stable around 25. Anemia likely due to HIV, stress,
   phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone marrow biopsy at this time.
   Heme onc following, peripheral smears consistent with HIV. No signs of
   acute blood loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused, Cr within
   normal limits.
   - Continue with Q24Hr Hct checks to minimize blood loss due to
   phlebotomy.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   6) FEVERS: T to 99.2, WBC decreased.  Likely due to VAP. Blood Cx
   pending, C diff negative, stool culture negative. No microorganisms on
   BAL gram stain yesterday, cx pending. Sputum with yeast.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics as per above.
   Adjustments to abx as needed pending BAL cx.
   -Follow up BAL respiratory cx
   - Keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  Given stable transaminitis
   and advanced tube feeds, ID will likely recommend starting HAART today.
    -F/u ID recs regarding starting HAART today.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 3.  Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear
   etiology at this point, potentially due to solute diuresis. Continues
   to autodiurese.  Can consider urine and serum osms if change to
   electrolytes or UOP.
   9) FEN: Tolerated advancement to tube feeds at 50 cc/hr without

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recently diagnosed with HIV and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). He has developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and requires intubation. The patient has been experiencing intermittent hypotension and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. He has been diagnosed with VAP and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. His blood cultures are pending, and he has shown improvement in his chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS physiology may lead to persistent hypoxemia despite supplemental oxygen therapy. Weaning from the ventilator remains challenging due to his agitation and anxiety.
2. Labile Blood Pressure: The patient's blood pressure fluctuates between hypertension and hypotension, which requires careful management with sedation and fluid resuscitation.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has low phosphate levels, likely due to recent advancements in tube feeds and suboptimal nutrition. Magnesium repletion has been initiated.
4. Transaminitis/Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and lipase, which could be attributed to drug toxicity, obstruction, or HIV cholangiopathy.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is stable, but he is anemic, possibly due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, and suboptimal nutrition.

   PEEP decreased from 16 to 12.
   Diazepam added to sedation regimen (currently Midazolam), with goal of
   decreasing Versed so that trach can be done when PEEP is 10.
   Overnight: Pt had increased agitation and became acutely tachycardic HR
   >140 and hypertensive with SBP>180 twice overnight and required
   multiple boluses of Midazolam (65 mg/12Hr), IV Diazepam and IV fentanyl
   x1, in addition to scheduled doses of PO Diazepam and Olanzapine.
   Became hypotensive w/sbp
s 80
s despite remaining tachycardic, for
   which he received a 500 ccNS bolus.
   PICC was also placed, then R IJ line removed, XR checked post-procedure
   with confirmation of appropriate positioning.
   Continues to have low residuals with tube feeds, may consider removing
   OG tube (leaving Dophoff) if they continue to be low.
   Discussed with ID - will likely advise starting HAART therapy today if
   stable.

   CXR for PICC placement from [**2196-7-28**]: New R PICC terminates at
   cavoatrial jxn, otherwise unchanged, with bilateral
   widespread parenchymal opacities.
   CXR from [**2196-7-29**]: Stable to improved diffuse parenchymal opacities.
   Microbiology: BAL from [**2196-7-27**]: Fungal cx negative. Respiratory cx
   pending.
   Fecal cx: negative
   IJ catheter tip culture pending.
   45M with a h/o HTN, [**Hospital 9163**] transfered to MICU with recent diagnosis of HIV
   and new diagnosis of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring
   intubation has had intermittent hypotension with difficulty weaning
   from ventilator.
   .
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   with ARDS physiology. Now likely has superimposed PNA with some
   pulmonary edema. On bactrim day 20 and prednisone for PCP,  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] day 7
   of 14, cefepime/cipro day 5 of 14 for suspected VAP. CXR improved.
   Leukocytosis has resolved. No organisms on gram stain on BAL, with cx
   pending.
   *Vent settings at 50% FiO2, PEEP 12 with generally stable SpO2 but
   drops in PaO2 on ABG and of SpO2 in the setting of agitation. Goal is
   PEEP </=10 allowing for trach placement. Can increase FiO2 to sustain
   decreased PEEP if needed but concern is desats are due to
   anxiety/agitation.
   *Sedation: Midazolam at 15 mg/hr, Olanzapine 5 mg Q6hrs, and Diazepam
   10 mg Q6Hr; plus 65 mg Midazolam PRN, Fentanyl IV x1 and Diazepam x 1
   overnight due to lightness of sedation with HTN, tachycardia,
   desaturation while agitated. Options for improving sedation include
   increasing frequency of diazepam, trial of alternate antipsychotic
   since we are at maximum dose of olanzapine, increasing Fio2, or
   increasing methadone. Given that he required large doses of Midazolam
   prn overnight, we can increase the frequency of his diazepam today;
   weighing against the risk of hypotension/other benzo toxicity requires
   care in significant increases to benzo dose. Also, we can D/C
   olanzapine and start Seroquel standing dose for agitation/anxiety.
   After making these adjustments, we can re-evaluate the need to increase
   FiO2 or methadone.
   * Prednisone: Day 6 of 20mg daily for duration of treatment. No
   evidence to suggest utility of high dose steroids in severe PCP beyond
   acute presentation, and could do more harm in setting of VAP.
   - Increase Diazepam 10 mg PO to Q4H.
   -D/C Olanzapine and start Quetiapine Fumarate 25 mg PO BID. Check EKG
   for QTc prior to starting.
   -Continue Midazolam 15 mg/hr. Consider weaning as tolerated following
   above changes.
   - Wean PEEP by 2 or as tolerated, but will be conservative pending
   evaluation of response to sedative/anxiolytic regimen above. Goal PEEP
   </=10 with conversion to trach.
   - Follow up with thoracics regarding potential trach in the coming
   days.
   -Continue Bactrim, cefepime/cipro, and [**Name10 (NameIs) **]. Consider adjustment to
   abx regimen pending BAL cx.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes
   2) LABILE BP: HTN with agitation, hypotensive episode with tachycardia
   responsive to IVF overnight.  Because HTN, tachycardia and desats in
   the setting of inadequate sedation, achieving sedation goals above are
   important to controlling BP.  No pressors have been required x3 days.
   - Increase Diazepam, continue Midazolam, and start Quetiapine per
   above.
    -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs
   - Levophed for MAPs <60.
   3) Low PO4 and low Mg: Magnesium repleted. Low phosphate likely due to
   recent advancement of tube feeds (increased insulin secretion) v.
   cumulative impact of suboptimal nutrition vs. renal losses from current
   autodiuresis. Low Mg may be due to renal losses v. cumulative impact of
   suboptimal nutrition.
   -Replete with Mg and PO phosphate as needed.
   -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate
   4) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: Stable/slowly increasing in the past
   days. Ddx ? drug toxicity (bactrim +/- Tylenol) vs obstruction vs ?HIV
   cholangiopathy on US, vs acalculus cholecystitis. More likely drug
   toxicity because RUQ US on [**2196-7-26**] showed no acute cholecystitis or
   ductal dilatation. Negative crypto and CMV. Unclear why rising in the 3
   days.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Tylenol to 2g.day
   5) ANEMIA: Hct stable around 25. Anemia likely due to HIV, stress,
   phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone marrow biopsy at this time.
   Heme onc following, peripheral smears consistent with HIV. No signs of
   acute blood loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused, Cr within
   normal limits.
   - Continue with Q24Hr Hct checks to minimize blood loss due to
   phlebotomy.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   6) FEVERS: T to 99.2, WBC decreased.  Likely due to VAP. Blood Cx
   pending, C diff negative, stool culture negative. No microorganisms on
   BAL gram stain yesterday, cx pending. Sputum with yeast.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics as per above.
   Adjustments to abx as needed pending BAL cx.
   -Follow up BAL respiratory cx
   - Keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation

   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  Given stable transaminitis
   and advanced tube feeds, ID will likely recommend starting HAART today.
    -F/u ID recs regarding starting HAART today.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 3.  Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear
   etiology at this point, potentially due to solute diuresis. Continues
   to autodiurese.  Can consider urine and serum osms if change to

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recently diagnosed with HIV and PCP pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and developed ARDS. The patient has been experiencing intermittent hypotension, difficulty weaning from the ventilator, and has a labile blood pressure. Other medical complications include low phosphate levels, transaminitis, pancreatitis, anemia, fever, and possible VAP. The patient's current medications include midazolam, diazepam, fentanyl, cefepime/cipro, bactrim, prednisone, and olanzapine. The plan is to lower PEEP to enable tracheostomy placement and continue ICU care.

Potential medical complications:
1) Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Secondary to PCP pneumonia with ARDS physiology, now likely superimposed with pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
2) Labile blood pressure: HTN with agitation, hypotensive episode with tachycardia responsive to IVF overnight.
3) Low phosphate levels: Likely due to recent advancement of tube feeds (increased insulin secretion) versus cumulative impact of suboptimal nutrition vs. renal losses from current autodiuresis.
4) Transaminitis/pancreatitis: Stable/slowly increasing in the past days. Differential diagnosis includes drug toxicity (bactrim +/- Tylenol) vs. obstruction vs. HIV cholangiopathy on US,"

   CXR for PICC placement from [**2196-7-28**]: New R PICC terminates at
   cavoatrial jxn, otherwise unchanged, with bilateral
   widespread parenchymal opacities.
   CXR from [**2196-7-29**]: Stable to improved diffuse parenchymal opacities.
   Microbiology: BAL from [**2196-7-27**]: Fungal cx negative. Respiratory cx
   pending.
   Fecal cx: negative
   IJ catheter tip culture pending.
   45M with a h/o HTN, [**Hospital 9163**] transfered to MICU with recent diagnosis of HIV
   and new diagnosis of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring
   intubation has had intermittent hypotension with difficulty weaning
   from ventilator.
   .
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   with ARDS physiology. Now likely has superimposed PNA with some
   pulmonary edema. On bactrim day 20 and prednisone for PCP,  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] day 7
   of 14, cefepime/cipro day 5 of 14 for suspected VAP. CXR improved.
   Leukocytosis has resolved. No organisms on gram stain on BAL, with cx
   pending.
   *Vent settings at 50% FiO2, PEEP 12 with generally stable SpO2 but
   drops in PaO2 on ABG and of SpO2 in the setting of agitation. Goal is
   PEEP </=10 allowing for trach placement. Can increase FiO2 to sustain
   decreased PEEP if needed but concern is desats are due to
   anxiety/agitation.
   *Sedation: Midazolam at 15 mg/hr, Olanzapine 5 mg Q6hrs, and Diazepam
   10 mg Q6Hr; plus 65 mg Midazolam PRN, Fentanyl IV x1 and Diazepam x 1
   overnight due to lightness of sedation with HTN, tachycardia,
   desaturation while agitated. Options for improving sedation include
   increasing frequency of diazepam, trial of alternate antipsychotic
   since we are at maximum dose of olanzapine, increasing Fio2, or
   increasing methadone. Given that he required large doses of Midazolam
   prn overnight, we can increase the frequency of his diazepam today;
   weighing against the risk of hypotension/other benzo toxicity requires
   care in significant increases to benzo dose. Also, we can D/C
   olanzapine and start Seroquel standing dose for agitation/anxiety.
   After making these adjustments, we can re-evaluate the need to increase
   FiO2 or methadone.
   * Prednisone: Day 6 of 20mg daily for duration of treatment. No
   evidence to suggest utility of high dose steroids in severe PCP beyond
   acute presentation, and could do more harm in setting of VAP.
   - Increase Diazepam 10 mg PO to Q4H.
   -D/C Olanzapine and start Quetiapine Fumarate 25 mg PO BID
   -Continue Midazolam 15 mg/hr. Consider weaning as tolerated following
   above changes.
   - Wean PEEP by 2 or as tolerated, but will be conservative pending
   evaluation of response to sedative/anxiolytic regimen above. Goal PEEP
   </=10 with conversion to trach.
   - Follow up with thoracics regarding potential trach in the coming
   days.
   -Continue Bactrim, cefepime/cipro, and [**Name10 (NameIs) **]. Consider adjustment to
   abx regimen pending BAL cx.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes
   2) LABILE BP: HTN with agitation, hypotensive episode with tachycardia
   responsive to IVF overnight.  Because HTN, tachycardia and desats in
   the setting of inadequate sedation, achieving sedation goals above are
   important to controlling BP.  No pressors have been required x3 days.
   - Increase Diazepam, continue Midazolam, and start Quetiapine per
   above.
    -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs
   - Levophed for MAPs <60.
   3) Low PO4 and low Mg: Magnesium repleted. Low phosphate likely due to
   recent advancement of tube feeds (increased insulin secretion) v.
   cumulative impact of suboptimal nutrition vs. renal losses from current
   autodiuresis. Low Mg may be due to renal losses v. cumulative impact of
   suboptimal nutrition.
   -Replete with Mg and PO phosphate as needed.
   -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate
   4) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: Stable/slowly increasing in the past
   days. Ddx ? drug toxicity (bactrim +/- Tylenol) vs obstruction vs ?HIV
   cholangiopathy on US, vs acalculus cholecystitis. More likely drug
   toxicity because RUQ US on [**2196-7-26**] showed no acute cholecystitis or
   ductal dilatation. Negative crypto and CMV. Unclear why rising in the 3
   days.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Tylenol to 2g.day
   5) ANEMIA: Hct stable around 25. Anemia likely due to HIV, stress,
   phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone marrow biopsy at this time.
   Heme onc following, peripheral smears consistent with HIV. No signs of
   acute blood loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused, Cr within
   normal limits.
   - Continue with Q24Hr Hct checks to minimize blood loss due to
   phlebotomy.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   6) FEVERS: T to 99.2, WBC decreased.  Likely due to VAP. Blood Cx
   pending, C diff negative, stool culture negative. No microorganisms on
   BAL gram stain yesterday, cx pending. Sputum with yeast.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics as per above.
   Adjustments to abx as needed pending BAL cx.
   -Follow up BAL respiratory cx
   - Keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  Given stable transaminitis
   and advanced tube feeds, ID will likely recommend starting HAART today.
    -F/u ID recs regarding starting HAART today.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 3.  Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear
   etiology at this point, potentially due to solute diuresis. Continues
   to autodiurese.  Can consider urine and serum osms if change to
   electrolytes or UOP.
   9) FEN: Tolerated advancement to tube feeds at 50 cc/hr without
   significant residuals. Can D/C OG tube today, with Dopoff remaining.
   -Can D/C OG tube today
   -Continue ISS for glycemic control
   10) PROPHYLAXIS: heparin UF SC, pneumoboots, PPI
   11) ACCESS: A-line and PICC.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and a recent diagnosis of HIV and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and required intubation. The patient has been experiencing intermittent hypotension and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and his chest X-ray has shown improvement. The patient's sedation regimen includes midazolam, diazepam, and olanzapine, but he required additional doses of midazolam and fentanyl overnight due to agitation. His current vital signs include a heart rate over 140 bpm and blood pressure over 180/80 mmHg. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and low phosphate levels. His magnesium level has been repleted, and he is receiving phosphate supplementation as needed. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and adjustments to his medications and treatment plan are being made as necessary. The patient's family has been informed of the situation, and communication with them is being maintained. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU, with the goal of lowering PEEP to enable tracheostomy placement."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient is sedated and intubated, indicating a severe respiratory condition. The patient's medical history includes HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, sepsis, and ARDS.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 111 beats per minute and hypertension with a blood pressure of 85/50 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 93% on 50% FiO2, indicating some difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 12 cmH2O.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, high potassium levels at 5.1 K/uL, and low magnesium levels at 0.8 mg/dL. The patient's liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are elevated at 119/108, respectively, and the albumin level is low at 2.2 g/dL. Imaging shows widespread bilateral parenchymal opacities on chest X-ray, suggestive of severe lung involvement.

The patient's plan includes continuing with tube feeds, considering removal of the OG tube if residuals remain low, discussing the possibility of starting HAART therapy, and monitoring for potential"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications including hypoxemic respiratory failure, hyperkalemia, anemia, hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, HIV, pneumonia, and other potential issues. 

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable in the morning, and the goal is to wean the ventilator to PEEP 12 and FiO2 0.5. Tracheostomy placement will be considered when PEEP is less than 10. The optimal PEEP range for this patient is between 12 and 14.

2. Sedation: The patient will start taking oral Valium and the sedation drip will be weaned slowly over the next few days. Methadone will be held at the current dose, and Seroquel will be switched to evaluate its effectiveness.

3. PCP: Steroids will be reduced to 20 mg daily, and ongoing monitoring of Bactrim for potassium levels will be done.

4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on day 7 of a 14-day antibiotic regimen for VAP. A bronchoscopy was performed late in the course and was unrevealing.

5. HIV: HAART therapy will be added today.

Other remaining issues will be addressed by the housestaff. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition via"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has been in the ICU for several days and is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C (99.2Â°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 105/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's physical examination reveals no audible murmurs, fair air movement in the chest, and soft distended hypoactive bowel sounds.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 8.5 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, normal platelet count of 223 K/uL, and normal electrolyte levels except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.1 mEq/L. The patient's blood cultures have grown methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient is also HIV positive.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygenation is improving, so the plan is to wean the ventilator settings further. If the patient's oxygenation improves with dropping PEEP, the next step will be to go to a PEEP of 12 and then 10. At that point, the intensiv"

   respiratory cx: oropharyngeal flora absent. Yeast >100,000
   organisms/mL, and prelim fungal culture: no fungus.
   Assessment and Plan
   45M with a h/o HTN, [**Hospital 9163**] transfered to MICU with recent diagnosis of HIV
   and new diagnosis of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring
   intubation with difficulty weaning from ventilator and sedation but
   trach placed yesterday.
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   with ARDS physiology. Now likely has superimposed PNA. On bactrim day
   21 and prednisone for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] day 8 of ?14, cefepime/cipro day 6 of
   ?14 for suspected VAP. CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. No
   organisms on gram stain on BAL, with respiratory cx: oropharyngeal
   flora absent. Yeast >100,000 organisms/mL, and prelim fungal culture:
   no fungus.
   *Trach placed yesterday, with vent settings at 50% FiO2, PEEP 10 with
   stable ABG.  High PaO2 on recent ABG, so we can likely decrease PEEP
   very slowly as tolerated vs. transition to PSV. Given his on-going
   issues with anxiety/agitation, he may be more comfortable on PSV, so
   trial of PSV with continued PEEP of 10 is preferred.
   *? VAP: CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. No organisms on gram
   stain on BAL, with respiratory cx: oropharyngeal flora absent. Yeast
   >100,000 organisms/mL, and prelim gungal culture: no fungus. BAL was
   performed several days after starting antibiotics, so we will likely
   complete his current course. We will seek ID recommendations for the
   appropriate duration of treatment.
   *Sedation: regimen yesterday was Midazolam at 15 mg/hr, with Quetiapine
   25 mh [**Hospital1 7**] replacing Olanzapine, and Diazepam 10 mg increased to Q4Hr,
   with continued HTN and tachycardia during agitated episodes, but
   without further desaturations. Agitation may improve with PSV instead
   of AC. Agitation is worse at night.
   *ID recommends starting HAART today.
   * Prednisone: Day 7 of 20mg daily for duration of treatment. No
   evidence to suggest utility of high dose steroids in severe PCP beyond
   acute presentation, and could do more harm in setting of VAP.
   -Attempt PSV today, with maintenance of PEEP 10 or as tolerated.
   - Reassess sedation once PSV attempted. Will follow up with pharmacy
   regarding potential adjustments to current regimen that would minimize
   sedation if HTN/tachycardia persist despite transition to PSV.
   Otherwise, attempt to wean Midazolam as tolerated and continue
   Quetiapine and Diazepam pending pharmacy recommendations.
   -Start Darunavir/ ritonavir/ truvada this AM per ID.
   -Continue Bactrim, cefepime/cipro, and [**Hospital1 **]. Consider adjustment to
   abx regimen and/or treatment duration pending ID recommendations.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg.
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes.
   2) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, no
   significant hypotensive episodes and decreased range of BP.  Will
   monitor on trach today and adjust sedative accordingly as per above. No
   pressors have been required x4 days.
   - Adjust/wean sedation per above.
    -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs. Levophed for MAPs <60.
   3) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: Transaminases stable/slowly increasing
   in the past days. Lipase with continued elevation, spike yesterday
   likely due to propofol used during trach placement. Ddx ? drug toxicity
   (bactrim +/- Tylenol) vs obstruction vs ?HIV cholangiopathy on US, vs
   acalculus cholecystitis. More likely drug toxicity because RUQ US on
   [**2196-7-26**] showed no acute cholecystitis or ductal dilatation. Negative
   crypto and CMV. Unclear why transaminases rising in the past several
   days.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
   4) FEVERS: T to 100.9, WBC decreased, with new monocytosis.  Likely due
   to VAP. Blood Cx pending, C diff negative, stool culture negative. No
   microorganisms on BAL gram stain yesterday, cx with yeast. Sputum with
   yeast.
   *Monocytosis: Likely due to recovery from acute infection, although new
   infection could also potentially cause monocytosis. However, he is on
   an extensive antibiotic regimen and has an improved clinical picture,
   so new infection is less likely.
   -Continue to monitor WBC.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics, with adjustment
   to regimen pending ID recommendations, as per above.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
   5) ANEMIA: Hct 23.3, generally stable around around 23-25. Anemia
   likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone
   marrow biopsy at this time. Heme onc following, peripheral smears
   consistent with HIV. No signs of acute blood loss: continues to be warm
   and well-perfused, Cr within normal limits.
   - Continue with Q24Hr Hct checks to minimize blood loss due to
   phlebotomy.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   6) Low PO4 and low Mg: Magnesium low this AM. PO4 improved from
   yesterday despite no repletion. Low PO4 likely due to recent
   advancement of tube feeds (increased insulin secretion) v. cumulative
   impact of suboptimal nutrition vs. renal losses from current
   autodiuresis.  Mg likely low due to cumulative impact of suboptimal
   nutrition vs. renal losses from current autodiuresis
   -Replete Mg and phosphate as needed.
   -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  Given stable transaminitis
   and advanced tube feeds, ID will likely recommend starting HAART today.
   -Start darunavir 800 mg PO once daily, ritonavir 100 mg PO once daily,
   and truvada 1 tab PO once daily this AM.
   -Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   -Follow respiratory status for immune reconstitution inflammation
   syndrome.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 2.9 with ongoing autodiuresis.
   Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially
   due to solute diuresis.
   -Continue to follow UOP, urine lytes, and serum electrolytes.
   9) FEN: Tolerated advancement to tube feeds at 50 cc/hr without
   significant residuals. OG D/C'd when ET tube removed; Dopoff position
   post-trach confirmed.
   -Continue tube feeds
   -Continue ISS for glycemic control

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recently diagnosed with HIV and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). He developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and required intubation with difficulty weaning from the ventilator. A tracheostomy was performed yesterday. The patient has been experiencing episodes of anxiety, agitation, and hypertension, which have been managed with increased doses of diazepam and quetiapine. His current medications include darunavir, ritonavir, and truvada for HIV treatment, as well as antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's recent lab results show elevated liver enzymes and lipase levels, indicating possible drug toxicity or pancreatitis. His electrolytes are within normal limits, except for low phosphate and magnesium levels. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he has been diagnosed with candiduria. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and PCP pneumonia can lead to severe respiratory compromise, requiring ongoing monitoring and management.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Antibiotic therapy has been initiated based on susceptibility results.
3. Transaminitis/pancreatitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and lipase levels suggest possible drug toxicity or pancreatitis. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the underlying"

   Assessment and Plan
   45M with a h/o HTN, [**Hospital 9163**] transfered to MICU with recent diagnosis of HIV
   and new diagnosis of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring
   intubation with difficulty weaning from ventilator and sedation but
   trach placed yesterday.
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   with ARDS physiology. Now likely has superimposed PNA. On bactrim day
   21 and prednisone for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] day 8 of ?14, cefepime/cipro day 6 of
   ?14 for suspected VAP. CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. No
   organisms on gram stain on BAL, with respiratory cx: oropharyngeal
   flora absent. Yeast >100,000 organisms/mL, and prelim fungal culture:
   no fungus.
   *Trach placed yesterday, with vent settings at 50% FiO2, PEEP 10 with
   stable ABG.  High PaO2 on recent ABG, so we can likely decrease PEEP
   very slowly as tolerated vs. transition to PSV. Given his on-going
   issues with anxiety/agitation, he may be more comfortable on PSV, so
   trial of PSV with continued PEEP of 10 is preferred.
   *? VAP: CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. No organisms on gram
   stain on BAL, with respiratory cx: oropharyngeal flora absent. Yeast
   >100,000 organisms/mL, and prelim gungal culture: no fungus. BAL was
   performed several days after starting antibiotics, so we will likely
   complete his current course. We will seek ID recommendations for the
   appropriate duration of treatment.
   *Sedation: regimen yesterday was Midazolam at 15 mg/hr, with Quetiapine
   25 mh [**Hospital1 7**] replacing Olanzapine, and Diazepam 10 mg increased to Q4Hr,
   with continued HTN and tachycardia during agitated episodes, but
   without further desaturations. Agitation may improve with PSV instead
   of AC. Agitation is worse at night.
   *ID recommends starting HAART today.
   * Prednisone: Day 7 of 20mg daily for duration of treatment. No
   evidence to suggest utility of high dose steroids in severe PCP beyond
   acute presentation, and could do more harm in setting of VAP.
   -Attempt PSV today, with maintenance of PEEP 10 or as tolerated.
   - Reassess sedation once PSV attempted. Will follow up with pharmacy
   regarding potential adjustments to current regimen that would minimize
   sedation if HTN/tachycardia persist despite transition to PSV.
   Otherwise, attempt to wean Midazolam as tolerated and continue
   Quetiapine and Diazepam pending pharmacy recommendations.
   -Start Darunavir/ ritonavir/ truvada this AM per ID.
   -Continue Bactrim, cefepime/cipro, and [**Hospital1 **]. Consider adjustment to
   abx regimen and/or treatment duration pending ID recommendations.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg.
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes.
   2) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, no
   significant hypotensive episodes and decreased range of BP.  Will
   monitor on trach today and adjust sedative accordingly as per above. No
   pressors have been required x4 days.
   - Adjust/wean sedation per above.
    -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs. Levophed for MAPs <60.
   3) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: Transaminases stable/slowly increasing
   in the past days. Lipase with continued elevation, spike yesterday
   likely due to propofol used during trach placement. Ddx ? drug toxicity
   (bactrim +/- Tylenol) vs obstruction vs ?HIV cholangiopathy on US, vs
   acalculus cholecystitis. More likely drug toxicity because RUQ US on
   [**2196-7-26**] showed no acute cholecystitis or ductal dilatation. Negative
   crypto and CMV. Unclear why transaminases rising in the past several
   days.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
   4) FEVERS: T to 100.9, WBC decreased, with new monocytosis.  Likely due
   to VAP. Blood Cx pending, C diff negative, stool culture negative. No
   microorganisms on BAL gram stain yesterday, cx with yeast. Sputum with
   yeast.
   *Monocytosis: Likely due to recovery from acute infection, although new
   infection could also potentially cause monocytosis. However, he is on
   an extensive antibiotic regimen and has an improved clinical picture,
   so new infection is less likely.
   -Continue to monitor WBC.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics, with adjustment
   to regimen pending ID recommendations, as per above.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
   5) ANEMIA: Hct 23.3, generally stable around around 23-25. Anemia
   likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone
   marrow biopsy at this time. Heme onc following, peripheral smears
   consistent with HIV. No signs of acute blood loss: continues to be warm
   and well-perfused, Cr within normal limits.
   - Continue with Q24Hr Hct checks to minimize blood loss due to
   phlebotomy.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   6) Low PO4 and low Mg: Magnesium low this AM. PO4 improved from
   yesterday despite no repletion. Low PO4 likely due to recent
   advancement of tube feeds (increased insulin secretion) v. cumulative
   impact of suboptimal nutrition vs. renal losses from current
   autodiuresis.  Mg likely low due to cumulative impact of suboptimal
   nutrition vs. renal losses from current autodiuresis
   -Replete Mg and phosphate as needed.
   -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  Given stable transaminitis
   and advanced tube feeds, ID will likely recommend starting HAART today.
   -Start darunavir 800 mg PO once daily, ritonavir 100 mg PO once daily,
   and truvada 1 tab PO once daily this AM.
   -Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   -Follow respiratory status for immune reconstitution inflammation
   syndrome.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 2.9 with ongoing autodiuresis.
   Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially
   due to solute diuresis.
   -Continue to follow UOP, urine lytes, and serum electrolytes.
   9) FEN: Tolerated advancement to tube feeds at 50 cc/hr without
   significant residuals. OG D/C'd when ET tube removed; Dopoff position
   post-trach confirmed.
   -Continue tube feeds
   -Continue ISS for glycemic control

","The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has developed ARDS and is likely experiencing superimposed pneumonia. They are on Bactrim, cefepime/cipro, and prednisone for PCP, and their CXR has improved.
2. Labile blood pressure: The patient continues to be hypertensive with agitation, with no significant hypotensive episodes. They will be monitored closely, and sedation will be adjusted accordingly.
3. Transaminitis/pancreatitis: The patient's transaminases are stable/slowly increasing, and their lipase remains elevated. There is a possibility of drug toxicity, obstruction, or HIV cholangiopathy. Further evaluation is needed.
4. Fevers: The patient's temperature is elevated, and they have a new monocytosis. This could be due to VAP, but further investigation is required.
5. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, and suboptimal nutrition. No bone marrow biopsy has been done at this time.
6. Low phosphate and magnesium: The patient has low levels of phosphate and magnesium, which may be due to suboptimal nutrition and autodiuresis.

   Assessment and Plan
   45M with a h/o HTN, [**Hospital 9163**] transfered to MICU with recent diagnosis of HIV
   and new diagnosis of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring
   intubation has had intermittent hypotension with difficulty weaning
   from ventilator.
   .
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   with ARDS physiology. Now likely has superimposed PNA. On bactrim day
   21 and prednisone for PCP,  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] day 8 of 14, cefepime/cipro day 6 of
   14 for suspected VAP. CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. No
   organisms on gram stain on BAL, with respiratory cx: oropharyngeal
   flora absent. Yeast >100,000 organisms/mL, and prelim gungal culture:
   no fungus.
   *Trach placed yesterday, with vent settings at 50% FiO2, PEEP 10 with
   stable ABG.
   *? VAP: CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. No organisms on gram
   stain on BAL, with respiratory cx: oropharyngeal flora absent. Yeast
   >100,000 organisms/mL, and prelim gungal culture: no fungus. Given risk
   of infection due to long hospital stay and immunocompromised state, we
   can continue antibiotics, pending ID recs.
   *Sedation: regimen yesterday was Midazolam at 15 mg/hr, with Quetiapine
   25 mh [**Hospital1 7**] replacing Olanzapine, and Diazepam 10 mg increased to Q4Hr.
   *ID recommends starting HAART today.
   * Prednisone: Day 7 of 20mg daily for duration of treatment. No
   evidence to suggest utility of high dose steroids in severe PCP beyond
   acute presentation, and could do more harm in setting of VAP.
   - Can attempt to wean Midazolam with agitation in minimal, but
   considering trach yesterday, can be conversative and maintain current
   dose. Continue Quetiapine nad Diazepam.
   - Wean PEEP +/- FiO2 as tolerated, but conversative advancement is
   preferred.
   -Start Darunavir/ritonavir/truvada today per ID. Confirm ritonavir.
   -Continue Bactrim, cefepime/cipro, and [**Hospital1 **]. Consider adjustment to
   abx regimen pending BAL cx.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes
   2) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, no
   significant hypotensive episodes.  Will monitor on trach today and
   adjust sedative accordingly.  No pressors have been required x3 days.
   - Wean sedation as tolerated, per above.
    -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs
   - Levophed for MAPs <60.
   4) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: Transaminases stable/slowly increasing
   in the past days. Ddx ? drug toxicity (bactrim +/- Tylenol) vs
   obstruction vs ?HIV cholangiopathy on US, vs acalculus cholecystitis.
   More likely drug toxicity because RUQ US on [**2196-7-26**] showed no acute
   cholecystitis or ductal dilatation. Negative crypto and CMV. Unclear
   why rising in the 3 days.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Tylenol to 2g.day
   5) Monocytosis: ? recovery from acute infection.
   6) FEVERS: T to 99.2, WBC decreased.  Likely due to VAP. Blood Cx
   pending, C diff negative, stool culture negative. No microorganisms on
   BAL gram stain yesterday, cx pending. Sputum with yeast.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics as per above.
   Adjustments to abx as needed pending BAL cx.
   -Follow up BAL respiratory cx
   - Keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
   5) ANEMIA: Hct 23.3, generally stable around around 23-25. Anemia
   likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone
   marrow biopsy at this time. Heme onc following, peripheral smears
   consistent with HIV. No signs of acute blood loss: continues to be warm
   and well-perfused, Cr within normal limits.
   - Continue with Q24Hr Hct checks to minimize blood loss due to
   phlebotomy.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) Low PO4 and low Mg: Magnesium repleted and WNL. Low continues to be
   low, likely due to recent advancement of tube feeds (increased insulin
   secretion) v. cumulative impact of suboptimal nutrition vs. renal
   losses from current autodiuresis.
   -Replete PO phosphate as needed.
   -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  Given stable transaminitis
   and advanced tube feeds, ID will likely recommend starting HAART today.
    -Start darunavir 800 mg PO once daily, ritonavir 100 mg PO once daily,
   and truvada 1 tab PO once daily.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 2.9 with ongoing autodiuresis.
   Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially
   due to solute diuresis.

   Microbiology: BAL from [**2196-7-27**]: No organisms on gram stain on BAL, with

   Assessment and Plan
   45M with a h/o HTN, [**Hospital 9163**] transfered to MICU with recent diagnosis of HIV
   and new diagnosis of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring
   intubation with difficulty weaning from ventilator and sedation but
   trach placed yesterday.
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   with ARDS physiology. Now likely has superimposed PNA. On bactrim day
   21 and prednisone for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] day 8 of ?14, cefepime/cipro day 6 of
   ?14 for suspected VAP. CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. No
   organisms on gram stain on BAL, with respiratory cx: oropharyngeal
   flora absent. Yeast >100,000 organisms/mL, and prelim gungal culture:
   no fungus.
   *Trach placed yesterday, with vent settings at 50% FiO2, PEEP 10 with
   stable ABG.  High PaO2 on recent ABG, so we can likely decrease PEEP
   very slowly as tolerated vs. transition to PSV. Given his on-going
   issues with anxiety/agitation, he may be more comfortable on PSV, so
   trial of PSV with continued PEEP of 10 is preferred.
   *? VAP: CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. No organisms on gram
   stain on BAL, with respiratory cx: oropharyngeal flora absent. Yeast
   >100,000 organisms/mL, and prelim gungal culture: no fungus. BAL was
   performed several days after starting antibiotics, so we will likely
   complete his current course. We will seek ID recommendations for the
   appropriate duration of treatment.
   *Sedation: regimen yesterday was Midazolam at 15 mg/hr, with Quetiapine
   25 mh [**Hospital1 7**] replacing Olanzapine, and Diazepam 10 mg increased to Q4Hr,
   with continued HTN and tachycardia during agitated episodes, but
   without further desaturations. Agitation may improve with PSV instead
   of AC. Agitation is worse at night.
   *ID recommends starting HAART today.
   * Prednisone: Day 7 of 20mg daily for duration of treatment. No
   evidence to suggest utility of high dose steroids in severe PCP beyond
   acute presentation, and could do more harm in setting of VAP.
   -Attempt PSV today, with maintenance of PEEP 10 or as tolerated.
   - Reassess sedation once PSV attempted. Will follow up with pharmacy
   regarding potential adjustments to current regimen that would minimize
   sedation if HTN/tachycardia persist despite transition to PSV.
   Otherwise, attempt to wean Midazolam as tolerated and continue
   Quetiapine and Diazepam pending pharmacy recommendations.
   -Start Darunavir/ ritonavir/ truvada this AM per ID.
   -Continue Bactrim, cefepime/cipro, and [**Hospital1 **]. Consider adjustment to
   abx regimen and/or treatment duration pending ID recommendations.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg.
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes.
   2) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, no
   significant hypotensive episodes and decreased range of BP.  Will
   monitor on trach today and adjust sedative accordingly as per above. No
   pressors have been required x4 days.
   - Adjust/wean sedation per above.
    -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs. Levophed for MAPs <60.
   3) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: Transaminases stable/slowly increasing
   in the past days. Lipase with continued elevation, spike yesterday
   likely due to propofol used during trach placement. Ddx ? drug toxicity
   (bactrim +/- Tylenol) vs obstruction vs ?HIV cholangiopathy on US, vs
   acalculus cholecystitis. More likely drug toxicity because RUQ US on
   [**2196-7-26**] showed no acute cholecystitis or ductal dilatation. Negative
   crypto and CMV. Unclear why transaminases rising in the past several
   days.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
   4) FEVERS: T to 100.9, WBC decreased, with new monocytosis.  Likely due
   to VAP. Blood Cx pending, C diff negative, stool culture negative. No
   microorganisms on BAL gram stain yesterday, cx with yeast. Sputum with
   yeast.
   *Monocytosis: Likely due to recovery from acute infection, although new
   infection could also potentially cause monocytosis. However, he is on
   an extensive antibiotic regimen and has an improved clinical picture.
   Will continue to monitor WBC.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics, with adjustment
   to regimen pending ID recommendations, as per above.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
   5) ANEMIA: Hct 23.3, generally stable around around 23-25. Anemia
   likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone
   marrow biopsy at this time. Heme onc following, peripheral smears
   consistent with HIV. No signs of acute blood loss: continues to be warm
   and well-perfused, Cr within normal limits.
   - Continue with Q24Hr Hct checks to minimize blood loss due to
   phlebotomy.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   6) Low PO4 and low Mg: Magnesium low this AM. PO4 improved from
   yesterday despite no repletion. Low PO4 likely due to recent
   advancement of tube feeds (increased insulin secretion) v. cumulative
   impact of suboptimal nutrition vs. renal losses from current
   autodiuresis.  Mg likely low due to cumulative impact of suboptimal
   nutrition vs. renal losses from current autodiuresis
   -Replete Mg and phosphate as needed.
   -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  Given stable transaminitis
   and advanced tube feeds, ID will likely recommend starting HAART today.
   -Start darunavir 800 mg PO once daily, ritonavir 100 mg PO once daily,
   and truvada 1 tab PO once daily this AM.
   -Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   -Follow respiratory status for immune reconstitution inflammation
   syndrome.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 2.9 with ongoing autodiuresis.
   Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially
   due to solute diuresis.
   -Continue to follow UOP, urine lytes, and serum electrolytes.
   9) FEN: Tolerated advancement to tube feeds at 50 cc/hr without
   significant residuals. OG D/C'd when ET tube removed; Dopoff position
   post-trach confirmed.
   -Continue tube feeds
   -Continue ISS for glycemic control

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recently diagnosed with HIV and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). He developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and required intubation. The patient had difficulty weaning from the ventilator and was sedated but underwent a tracheostomy placement yesterday. He continues to experience episodes of hypertension, tachycardia, and agitation. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and lipase levels. The patient's fever has resolved, and his chest x-ray shows improvement. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition requires ongoing intensive care management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS and PCP pneumonia may lead to continued respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on antibiotics for suspected VAP. Monitoring for improvement in chest x-ray and clinical symptoms is necessary.
3. Transaminitis/Pancreatitis: Elevated liver enzymes and lipase levels may indicate drug toxicity, obstruction, or other causes. Further investigation is required.
4. Fevers: The patient's recent fever could be due to VAP or another underlying infection. Blood cultures and ongoing monitoring are necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, likely due to HIV,"

   Imaging: CXR from [**7-29**]: Increasing airspace consolidations bilaterally,
   with
   further diaphgragm obscuration.
   Microbiology: BAL from [**2196-7-27**]: No organisms on gram stain on BAL, with
   respiratory cx: oropharyngeal flora absent. Yeast >100,000
   organisms/mL, and prelim gungal culture: no fungus.
   Assessment and Plan
   45M with a h/o HTN, [**Hospital 9163**] transfered to MICU with recent diagnosis of HIV
   and new diagnosis of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring
   intubation has had intermittent hypotension with difficulty weaning
   from ventilator.
   .
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   with ARDS physiology. Now likely has superimposed PNA. On bactrim day
   21 and prednisone for PCP,  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] day 8 of 14, cefepime/cipro day 6 of
   14 for suspected VAP. CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. No
   organisms on gram stain on BAL, with respiratory cx: oropharyngeal
   flora absent. Yeast >100,000 organisms/mL, and prelim gungal culture:
   no fungus.
   *Trach placed yesterday, with vent settings at 50% FiO2, PEEP 10 with
   stable ABG.
   *? VAP: CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. No organisms on gram
   stain on BAL, with respiratory cx: oropharyngeal flora absent. Yeast
   >100,000 organisms/mL, and prelim gungal culture: no fungus. Given risk
   of infection due to long hospital stay and immunocompromised state, we
   can continue antibiotics, pending ID recs.
   *Sedation: regimen yesterday was Midazolam at 15 mg/hr, with Quetiapine
   25 mh [**Hospital1 7**] replacing Olanzapine, and Diazepam 10 mg increased to Q4Hr.
   *ID recommends starting HAART today.
   * Prednisone: Day 7 of 20mg daily for duration of treatment. No
   evidence to suggest utility of high dose steroids in severe PCP beyond
   acute presentation, and could do more harm in setting of VAP.
   - Can attempt to wean Midazolam with agitation in minimal, but
   considering trach yesterday, can be conversative and maintain current
   dose. Continue Quetiapine nad Diazepam.
   - Wean PEEP +/- FiO2 as tolerated, but conversative advancement is
   preferred.
   -Start Darunavir/ritonavir/truvada today per ID. Confirm ritonavir.
   -Continue Bactrim, cefepime/cipro, and [**Hospital1 **]. Consider adjustment to
   abx regimen pending BAL cx.
   - Continue at prednisone 20 mg
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes
   2) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, no
   significant hypotensive episodes.  Will monitor on trach today and
   adjust sedative accordingly.  No pressors have been required x3 days.
   - Wean sedation as tolerated, per above.
    -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs
   - Levophed for MAPs <60.
   4) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: Transaminases stable/slowly increasing
   in the past days. Ddx ? drug toxicity (bactrim +/- Tylenol) vs
   obstruction vs ?HIV cholangiopathy on US, vs acalculus cholecystitis.
   More likely drug toxicity because RUQ US on [**2196-7-26**] showed no acute
   cholecystitis or ductal dilatation. Negative crypto and CMV. Unclear
   why rising in the 3 days.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Tylenol to 2g.day
   5) Monocytosis: ? recovery from acute infection.
   6) FEVERS: T to 99.2, WBC decreased.  Likely due to VAP. Blood Cx
   pending, C diff negative, stool culture negative. No microorganisms on
   BAL gram stain yesterday, cx pending. Sputum with yeast.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics as per above.
   Adjustments to abx as needed pending BAL cx.
   -Follow up BAL respiratory cx
   - Keep tylenol under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
   5) ANEMIA: Hct 23.3, generally stable around around 23-25. Anemia
   likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone
   marrow biopsy at this time. Heme onc following, peripheral smears
   consistent with HIV. No signs of acute blood loss: continues to be warm
   and well-perfused, Cr within normal limits.
   - Continue with Q24Hr Hct checks to minimize blood loss due to
   phlebotomy.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) Low PO4 and low Mg: Magnesium repleted and WNL. Low continues to be
   low, likely due to recent advancement of tube feeds (increased insulin
   secretion) v. cumulative impact of suboptimal nutrition vs. renal
   losses from current autodiuresis.
   -Replete PO phosphate as needed.
   -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday. ID
   recommends Darunavir/truvada (protease inhibitor: toxicities
   dyslipidemia, some hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia) but initiation
   complicated by pending genotype, poor gut motility with ? effective med
   absorption + transaminitis.  ID following.  Given stable transaminitis
   and advanced tube feeds, ID will likely recommend starting HAART today.
    -Start darunavir 800 mg PO once daily, ritonavir 100 mg PO once daily,
   and truvada 1 tab PO once daily.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 2.9 with ongoing autodiuresis.
   Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially
   due to solute diuresis.
   9) FEN: Tolerated advancement to tube feeds at 50 cc/hr without
   significant residuals. OG D/C'd when ET tube removed; Dopoff position
   post-trach confirmed.
   -Continue tube feeds
   -Continue ISS for glycemic control
   10) PROPHYLAXIS: heparin UF SC, pneumoboots, PPI
   11) ACCESS: A-line and PICC.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, who was admitted to the ICU with recent diagnoses of HIV and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). He developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) requiring intubation and has had intermittent hypotension with difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

The patient's current medications include bactrim, cefepime/cipro, prednisone, midazolam, quetiapine, diazepam, and soon to start HAART therapy. His recent laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, low phosphate, and low magnesium levels. Imaging studies reveal worsening airspace consolidations bilaterally on chest X-ray.

The patient's medical complications include hypoxemic respiratory failure, labile blood pressure, transaminitis/pancreatitis, monocytosis, fever, anemia, low phosphate, and low magnesium levels. The patient's HIV status is a recent diagnosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further deterioration in respiratory status, persistent hypotension, hepatic dysfunction, worsening anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and potential opportunistic infections due to immunocompromised state."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with a history of severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). They are currently mechanically ventilated through a tracheotomy tube and remain sedated. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumocystis pneumonia, which has contributed to their respiratory failure. There are concerns about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as well. The patient's sedation levels need to be carefully managed, as they require significant doses of sedatives. 

The patient also has HIV and will be initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) today. They have been prescribed a range of medications, including antibiotics for the pneumonia and antiretroviral drugs for their HIV. 

There are other medical issues present, such as pancreatitis, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), anemia, and hypophosphatemia. These conditions need to be closely monitored. The patient's nutritional support is being provided through tube feeding (TF). 

In terms of ICU care, the patient has an arterial line, a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, and a central venous catheter. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU."

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation with difficulty
   weaning from ventilator and sedation, then likely superimposed VAP, now
   improving after broadening of abx coverage.  Overall respiratory status
   improving, trach placed successfully [**7-29**].
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   with ARDS physiology. On bactrim day 21 and prednisone for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   day 8 of 14, cefepime/cipro day 6 of 14 for suspected VAP. CXR
   improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. No organisms on gram stain on BAL,
   with respiratory cx: oropharyngeal flora absent. Yeast >100,000
   organisms/mL, and prelim fungal culture: no fungus.
   *Trach placed, with vent settings at 50% FiO2, PEEP 10 with stable
   ABG.  Transitioned to PSV yesterday, tolerated well, ABG
s steady.
   *? VAP: CXR improved. Seek ID recommendation for appropriate length of
   treatment.
   *Sedation: Continuing to have episodes of agitation with hypertension
   and tachycardia, worse at night.  Now off Versed drip, continuing PO
   Ativan, also IV methadone and PO Quetiapine.  Plan to transition to PO
   methadone per pharmacy recs.
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes.
   2) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally
   hypotensive, responsive to fluids.  Continue to monitor. No pressors
   have been required x4 days.
   - Adjust/wean sedation per above.
    -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed if needed for MAPs <60.
   3) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: LFT
s persistently elevated, with lipase
   increased after propofol [**7-29**].  Has had persistently elevated LFT
   with negative CT, negative RUQ ultrasound, no change in abdominal exam
   or reported pain.  Likely due to multiple medications.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
   4) FEVERS: T to 100.8 yesterday, blood Cx pending, C diff negative,
   stool culture negative. No microorganisms on BAL gram stain, cx with
   yeast. Sputum with yeast.
   *Monocytosis: Likely due to recovery from acute infection, although new
   infection could also potentially cause monocytosis. However, he is on
   an extensive antibiotic regimen and has an improved clinical picture,
   so new infection is less likely.
   -Continue to monitor WBC.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics, with adjustment
   to regimen pending ID recommendations, as per above.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
   5) ANEMIA: Hct 22.2, generally stable around around 23-25. Anemia
   likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No signs
   of acute blood loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused, Cr within
   normal limits.
   - Continue with Q24Hr Hct checks to minimize blood loss due to
   phlebotomy.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   6) Low PO4 and low Mg: improved - both WNL on this morning's labs.
   -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate, replete as necessary.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday.
   -HAART started yesterday - - darunavir 800 mg PO once daily, ritonavir
   100 mg PO once daily, and truvada 1 tab PO once daily this AM.
   -ID following.
   -Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   -Follow respiratory status for immune reconstitution inflammation
   syndrome.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 2.9 with ongoing autodiuresis.
   Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially
   due to solute diuresis.
   -Continue to follow UOP, urine lytes, and serum electrolytes.
   -Negative fluid balance over past several days - fluid bolus for any
   signs of hypovolemia.
   9) FEN: Tolerated advancement to tube feeds at 50 cc/hr without
   significant residuals. OG D/C'd when ET tube removed; Dopoff position
   post-trach confirmed.
   -Continue tube feeds
   -Continue ISS for glycemic control
   10) PROPHYLAXIS: heparin UF SC, pneumoboots, PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia) who developed ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) requiring intubation. He also has a suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) which improved with broadened antibiotic coverage. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 at 40%, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, and stable ABG.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to PCP pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
2. Labile blood pressure, occasionally hypertensive and hypotensive, responsive to fluids.
3. Transaminitis/pancreatitis with elevated liver function tests and lipase levels, possibly due to multiple medications.
4. Fevers with positive yeast in sputum culture but no microorganisms on BAL gram stain.
5. Anemia likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, and nutrition suboptimal.
6. Low phosphate and magnesium levels, both within normal limits now.
7. Recent diagnosis of HIV with initiation of HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) including darunavir, ritonavir, and truvada.
8. Unclear etiology of ongoing autodiuresis with elevated FeNa (fractional excretion of sodium).

   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   with ARDS physiology. Now likely has superimposed PNA. On bactrim day
   21 and prednisone for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] day 8 of ?14, cefepime/cipro day 6 of
   ?14 for suspected VAP. CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. No
   organisms on gram stain on BAL, with respiratory cx: oropharyngeal
   flora absent. Yeast >100,000 organisms/mL, and prelim fungal culture:
   no fungus.
   *Trach placed, with vent settings at 50% FiO2, PEEP 10 with stable
   ABG.  High PaO2 on recent ABG, so we can likely decrease PEEP very
   slowly as tolerated vs. transition to PSV. Given his on-going issues
   with anxiety/agitation, he may be more comfortable on PSV, so trial of
   PSV with continued PEEP of 10 is preferred.
   *? VAP: CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. No organisms on gram
   stain on BAL, with respiratory cx: oropharyngeal flora absent. Yeast
   >100,000 organisms/mL, and prelim gungal culture: no fungus. BAL was
   performed several days after starting antibiotics, so we will likely
   complete his current course. We will seek ID recommendations for the
   appropriate duration of treatment.
   *Sedation: regimen yesterday was Midazolam at 15 mg/hr, with Quetiapine
   25 mh [**Hospital1 7**] replacing Olanzapine, and Diazepam 10 mg increased to Q4Hr,
   with continued HTN and tachycardia during agitated episodes, but
   without further desaturations. Agitation may improve with PSV instead
   of AC. Agitation is worse at night.
   *HAART initiated yesterday per ID recommendation.
   * Prednisone: Day 7 of 20mg daily for duration of treatment. No
   evidence to suggest utility of high dose steroids in severe PCP beyond
   acute presentation, and could do more harm in setting of VAP.
   -continue PSV, follow ABG's for settings adjustments.
   - Reassess sedation - will follow up with pharmacy regarding potential
   adjustments to current regimen that would minimize sedation if
   HTN/tachycardia persist despite transition to PSV. Otherwise, attempt
   to wean Midazolam as tolerated and continue Quetiapine and Diazepam
   pending pharmacy recommendations.
   -Continue Bactrim, cefepime/cipro, and [**Hospital1 **]. Consider adjustment to
   abx regimen and/or treatment duration pending ID recommendations.
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes.
   2) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, no
   significant hypotensive episodes and decreased range of BP.  Continue
   to monitor. No pressors have been required x4 days.
   - Adjust/wean sedation per above.
    -Cautious use of fluids for low BPs. Levophed for MAPs <60.
   3) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: Transaminases stable/slowly increasing
   in the past days. Lipase with continued elevation, spike yesterday
   likely due to propofol used during trach placement. Ddx ? drug toxicity
   (bactrim +/- Tylenol) vs obstruction vs ?HIV cholangiopathy on US, vs
   acalculus cholecystitis. More likely drug toxicity because RUQ US on
   [**2196-7-26**] showed no acute cholecystitis or ductal dilatation. Negative
   crypto and CMV. Unclear why transaminases rising in the past several
   days.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
   4) FEVERS: T to 100.8 yesterday, WBC decreased, with new monocytosis.
   Likely due to VAP. Blood Cx pending, C diff negative, stool culture
   negative. No microorganisms on BAL gram stain yesterday, cx with yeast.
   Sputum with yeast.
   *Monocytosis: Likely due to recovery from acute infection, although new
   infection could also potentially cause monocytosis. However, he is on
   an extensive antibiotic regimen and has an improved clinical picture,
   so new infection is less likely.
   -Continue to monitor WBC.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics, with adjustment
   to regimen pending ID recommendations, as per above.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
   5) ANEMIA: Hct 23.3, generally stable around around 23-25. Anemia
   likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No bone
   marrow biopsy at this time. Heme onc following, peripheral smears
   consistent with HIV. No signs of acute blood loss: continues to be warm
   and well-perfused, Cr within normal limits.
   - Continue with Q24Hr Hct checks to minimize blood loss due to
   phlebotomy.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   6) Low PO4 and low Mg: improved - both WNL on this morning's labs.
   -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate, continue to trend
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday.
   -HAART started yesterday - - darunavir 800 mg PO once daily, ritonavir
   100 mg PO once daily, and truvada 1 tab PO once daily this AM.
   -ID following.
   -Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   -Follow respiratory status for immune reconstitution inflammation

   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 2.9 with ongoing autodiuresis.
   Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially
   due to solute diuresis.
   -Continue to follow UOP, urine lytes, and serum electrolytes.
   9) FEN: Tolerated advancement to tube feeds at 50 cc/hr without
   significant residuals. OG D/C'd when ET tube removed; Dopoff position
   post-trach confirmed.

The patient also had a significant drop in blood pressure to 86/49 (MAP 61) around 6 am on [**7-31**], likely due to the cumulative effect of sedating/anxiety medications. The patient was given 500ml x2 bolus with good effect. The patient's FiO2 was decreased from 50 to 40, PaO2 improved from 111 to 70, no significant change in pH, CO2, and PEEP was kept at 10. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), current temperature of 36.8 C (98.2 F), heart rate"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pneumocystis pneumonia, severe.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Hypoxemic Resp Failure attributed to pneumonia,
   ARDS.   Previously PEEP sensitive, but now PEEP= 10.  Now with trach,
   hope to move to IPS mode and reduce sedation if tolerates.  Replete
   Phosphate and Mg++.  Continue IPS mode.  Monitor
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- attributed predominately to Pneumocystis
   pneumonia, although may be component of ARDS, (no evidence for CMV
   co-infection) and now concern for VAP --> empirical vanco/cefopime,
   cipro.  Completing 21-day course of Bactrim for pneumocystis.  Continue
   complete course for VAP.
   HYPOTENSION -- transient, possibly related to medication (sedation).
   SEDATION
 major issue during hospitalization, requiring significant
   doses to provide adequate sedation.  Now off iv versed and fentanyl,
   and on benzodiazepines and methadone per NGT.  Monitor for evidence of
   benzodiazepine withdrawal.  Continue Methadone at current dose.  Switch
   Zyprexa to [**Hospital1 7**] Seroquel to see if more effective.
   FEVER -- no localizing signs.  Monitor for line-related infection, C.
   diff.  Discontinue unnecessary lines.  Monitor temperature.
   HIV -- Initiated HAART.  Need to monitor for possible [**Doctor First Name **] on HAART.
   PANCREATITIS
 chemical pancreatitis, in part attributed to
   medications.   Monitor.
   ELEVATED LFTs
 likely related to medications, but need to monitor for
   infection.
   ANEMIA
 attributed to ACD and medications. Stable.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- replete
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.  Continue.  Monitor lipase.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, attributed to severe Pneumocystis pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient remains mechanically ventilated through a tracheostomy tube and tolerates intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) mode. The patient experienced an episode of hypotension, which responded to intravenous fluid administration and is believed to be medication-related.

The patient's medical history includes HIV, for which HAART therapy has been initiated. The patient also has a history of pancreatitis, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), anemia, and hypophosphatemia. The patient's nutritional support is being provided through tube feeds at goal.

The patient has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line, PICC line, and central venous catheter. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots and systemic anticoagulation, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention with head of bed elevation and mouth care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumocystis pneumonia: The patient has a severe infection caused by Pneumocystis pneumonia, which is a common opportunistic infection in individuals with HIV/AIDS. This condition can lead to respiratory failure and may require aggressive treatment.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is experiencing ARDS, a potentially"

   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2196-7-31**] 10:00 AM
   -Discussed plan with ID - recommend continued Bactrim/prednisone
   treatment for now, further taper prednisone.  Today will be last day of
   treatment for VAP (Vanco, cefipime, Cipro), but will possibly continue
   Bactrim for several more days while tapering prednisone.  Will
   follow-up final plan with ID today. Will need prophylactic dose of

   -ABG in afternoon stable with normal CO2, low-normal PO2 - reduced PS
   from 12 to 10.  After reduced pressure support HR increased and O2 sat
   decreased slightly, so PS was increased back to 12.
   -Later in the evening began to have significantly increased HR and BP,
   associated with anxiety.  Versed bolus given without mild effect,

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and recent diagnosis of HIV. He was admitted to the ICU with difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sedation, likely secondary to PCP pneumonia with ARDS physiology. The patient has been improving on Bactrim and prednisone for PCP. He has leukocytosis, which has resolved, and sputum culture shows gram-positive cocci, rods, and yeast. The patient is stable on PSV but unable to reduce PS from 12 cmH2O due to agitation and hypertension. There are ongoing efforts to wean FiO2 and PS as tolerated, but sedation remains an impediment. The patient has episodes of agitation with hypertension and tachycardia, worse at night. He is currently on PO diazepam, quetiapine, IV methadone, and restarted on IV Fentanyl drip last night. The plan is to transition to PO methadone per pharmacy recommendations. The patient's blood culture is pending, and his fecal culture is negative for C. diff.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS and requires continued monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation.
2) Labile Blood Pressure: The patient continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally hypotensive, and responsive to fluids. Pressors have not been required for nearly a week.
3) Transaminitis/P"

   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2196-7-31**] 10:00 AM
   -Discussed plan with ID - recommend continued Bactrim/prednisone
   treatment for now, further taper prednisone.  Today will be last day of
   treatment for VAP (Vanco, cefipime, Cipro), but will possibly continue
   Bactrim for several more days while tapering prednisone.  Will
   follow-up final plan with ID today. Will need prophylactic dose of
   Bactrim going forward after discontinuation of current Bactrim regimen.
   -ABG in afternoon stable with normal CO2, low-normal PO2 - reduced PS
   from 12 to 10.  After reduced pressure support HR increased and O2 sat
   decreased slightly, so PS was increased back to 12.
   -Later in the evening began to have significantly increased HR and BP,
   associated with anxiety.  Versed bolus given without mild effect,
   started back on Versed drip, now at 12 mg/hr.
   -Morning ABG showed PaO2 64, increased oxygen from 40 to 50%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia) who developed ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) requiring intubation. The patient has been on Bactrim and prednisone for PCP treatment. His respiratory status has been improving, tracheostomy tube was placed successfully. The patient is now improving after broadening of antibiotic coverage. He has leukocytosis, which has resolved, and sputum culture showed gram-positive cocci, rods, and yeast. The patient is stable on pressure support ventilation but unable to reduce pressure support from 12. There are episodes of agitation with hypertension and tachycardia, worse at night. Sedation remains a large impediment to attempts to wean ventilation. The patient's lab results show transaminitis, elevated lipase, but now stable to decreased even after starting potentially hepatotoxic HAART regimen. The patient's anemia is likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, and nutrition suboptimal. He has low phosphate and magnesium levels, which have improved. The patient has a recent diagnosis of HIV and started HAART, with stable LFTs. The patient's urine electrolytes show ongoing autodiuresis, and creatinine is within normal limits. The patient's current medications include Bactrim, prednisone, heparin, pneum"

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation with difficulty
   weaning from ventilator and sedation, then likely superimposed VAP, now
   improving after broadening of abx coverage.  Overall respiratory status
   improving, trach placed successfully [**7-29**].
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   with ARDS physiology. On bactrim day 21 and prednisone for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. Sputum culture from [**7-30**] with gram
   positive cocci and clusters, gram positive rods, and yeast.
   *Stable on PSV but unable to reduce PS from 12 yesterday. Can recheck
   ABG this AM and consider weaning FiO2, then PS as tolerated, but
   sedation remains large impediment to attempts to wean ventilation.
   *Sedation: Continuing to have episodes of agitation with hypertension
   and tachycardia, worse at night.  Continuing PO Diazepam and
   Quetiapine, IV methadone and restarted on IV Fentanyl drip last night.
   Plan was to transition to PO methadone per pharmacy recs. Given than
   HTN and tachycardia continue to be a concern at night, we can increase
   Quetiapine to more therapeutic doses. Beta-blockers and other
   anti-HTN/HR drugs may be helpful but would not address the underlying
   problem of anxiety. Also consider starting SSRI; need to check
   interactions with other medications, especially HAART agents.
   * VAP: Per ID
s recommendations, completed vanco and cefepime/cipro
   yesterday.
   *PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 54**] ID, will likely continue Bactrim for a few more days before
   transitioning to prophylactic dose and will taper steroids. Final
   recommendations from ID pending.
   -Continue to attempt to wean FiO2 and PS as tolerated.
   -Increase Quetiapine to 50 mg NG [**Hospital1 7**].
   -EKG to check QTc in setting of Quetiapine.
   -Follow up with pharm regarding interactions with SSRI and current
   medications.
   -Attempt to wean Fentanyl drip.
   -Continue Bactrim and steroids; follow up ID recommendations
   - [**Hospital1 **] Q24H or prn clinical changes.
   2) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally
   hypotensive, responsive to fluids.  Continue to monitor. No pressors
   have been required for nearly 1 week.
   -Per above, increased Quetiapine, consider starting SSRI.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed if needed for MAPs <60.
   3) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: LFT
s persistently elevated, with lipase
   increased after propofol [**7-29**] but now stable to decreased even after
   starting potentially hepatotoxic HAART regimen. Negative CT, negative
   RUQ ultrasound, no change in abdominal exam or reported pain.  Likely
   due to multiple medications.
    - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
    4) FEVERS: T to 99, blood Cx pending, sputum with gram positive cocci
   and clusters, gram positive rods, and yeast.
    C diff negative, stool culture pending. Resolution of monocytosis.
   -Continue to monitor WBC.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
   5) ANEMIA: Hct 22.9, generally stable around around 23-25. Anemia
   likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No signs
   of acute blood loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused, Cr within
   normal limits.
   - Continue with Q24Hr Hct checks to minimize blood loss due to

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and recent diagnosis of HIV, presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and subsequent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and has shown improvement. However, the patient continues to experience episodes of agitation, hypertension, and tachycardia, particularly at night. These symptoms suggest underlying anxiety and may contribute to the difficulty in weaning off the ventilator. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying ARDS and current respiratory status make him prone to further episodes of hypoxemia.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient has shown improvement, there is still a risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of fever and ongoing infection.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels indicate a potential risk for hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit levels suggest anemia, which may be related to chronic disease, phlebotomy, or inadequate nutrition.
5. Transaminitis/Pancreatitis: The patient's persistently elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and increased lipase levels raise concerns about possible hepatotoxicity or pancreatitis.
6. Labile blood pressure: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure, ranging from hypertension to hypotension, requires close"

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation with difficulty
   weaning from ventilator and sedation, then likely superimposed VAP, now
   improving after broadening of abx coverage.  Overall respiratory status
   improving, trach placed successfully [**7-29**].
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   with ARDS physiology. On bactrim day 21 and prednisone for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. Sputum culture from [**7-30**] with gram
   positive cocci and clusters, gram positive rods, and yeast.
   *Stable on PSV but unable to reduce PS from 12 yesterday.
   * VAP: Per ID
s recommendations, completed vanco and cefepime/cipro
   yesterday.
   *Sedation: Continuing to have episodes of agitation with hypertension
   and tachycardia, worse at night.  Continuing PO Diazepam and
   Quetiapine, IV methadone and restarted on IV Fentanyl drip last night.
   Plan to transition to PO methadone per pharmacy recs. Given than HTN
   and tachycardia continue to be a concern at night, we can start
   beta-blockers today and attempt to wean from PSV.
   *PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 54**] ID, will continue Bactrim for a few more days before
   transitioning to prophylactic dose. Will taper steroids.
   -Continue to attempt to wean PS as tolerated.
   -Start metoprolol for tachycardia and HTN
   -Attempt to wean Fentanyl drip
   -Continue Bactrim.
   -Steroid taper:
   - [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Q24H or prn clinical changes.
   2) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally
   hypotensive, responsive to fluids.  Continue to monitor. No pressors
   have been required x4 days.
   - Start metoprolol per above.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed if needed for MAPs <60.
   3) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: LFT
s persistently elevated, with lipase
   increased after propofol [**7-29**]. now stable to decreased. Negative CT,
   negative RUQ ultrasound, no change in abdominal exam or reported pain.
   Likely due to multiple medications.
    - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
    4) FEVERS: T to 99, blood Cx pending, sputum with gram positive cocci
   and clusters, gram positive rods, and yeast.
    C diff negative, stool culture pending. Resolution of monocytosis.
   -Continue to monitor WBC.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
   5) ANEMIA: Hct 22.9, generally stable around around 23-25. Anemia
   likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No signs
   of acute blood loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused, Cr within
   normal limits.
   - Continue with Q24Hr Hct checks to minimize blood loss due to
   phlebotomy.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
    6) Low PO4 and low Mg: improved - both WNL on this morning's labs.
    -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate, replete as necessary.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis.
   -Continue HAART
   -ID following.
   -Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   -Follow respiratory status for immune reconstitution inflammation
   syndrome.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: Most recent FeNa 2.9 with ongoing
   autodiuresis.  Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear etiology at this
   point, potentially due to solute diuresis.
    -Continue to follow UOP, urine lytes, and serum electrolytes.
   -Negative fluid balance over past several days - fluid bolus for any
   signs of hypovolemia.

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and recent diagnosis of HIV presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and subsequently developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition has been improving after broadening antibiotic coverage. The patient remains on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned off sedation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS physiology puts him at risk for ongoing hypoxemic respiratory failure. He is currently improving but will require continued monitoring and management.

2. Infectious complications: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV and recent PCP pneumonia, he is at increased risk for other infections. The presence of gram-positive cocci, rods, and yeast in the sputum culture indicates a possible infection, which needs to be addressed appropriately.

3. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level, indicating anemia. This could be due to various factors such as HIV infection, stress, phlebotomy, or poor nutrition. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and consideration of transfusion may be necessary.

4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has low potassium and magnesium levels, which need to be corrected. Monitoring of electrolytes and repletion as necessary is important.

5. HIV-related complications: The patient's recent diagnosis of HIV places him at risk for other HIV-related complications, such as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS"

   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2196-7-31**] 10:00 AM
   -Discussed plan with ID - recommend continued Bactrim/prednisone
   treatment for now, further taper prednisone.  Today will be last day of
   treatment for VAP ([**Year (4 digits) 1343**], cefipime, Cipro), but will possibly continue
   Bactrim for several more days while tapering prednisone.  Will need
   prophylactic dose of Bactrim going forward after discontinuation of
   current Bactrim regimen.
   ABG in afternoon stable with normal CO2, low-normal PO2 - reduced PS
   from 12 to 10.  After reduced pressure support HR increased and O2 sat
   decreased slightly, so PS was increased back to 12.  Later in the
   evening began to have significantly increased HR and BP, associated
   with anxiety.  Versed bolus given without mild effect, started back on

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation with difficulty
   weaning from ventilator and sedation, then likely superimposed VAP, now
   improving after broadening of abx coverage.  Overall respiratory status
   improving, trach placed successfully [**7-29**].
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   with ARDS physiology. On bactrim day 21 and prednisone for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   day 8 of 14, cefepime/cipro day 6 of 14 for suspected VAP. CXR
   improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. No organisms on gram stain on BAL,
   with respiratory cx: oropharyngeal flora absent. Yeast >100,000
   organisms/mL, and prelim fungal culture: no fungus.
   *Trach placed, with vent settings at 50% FiO2, PEEP 10 with stable
   ABG.  Transitioned to PSV yesterday, tolerated well, ABG
s steady.
   *? VAP: CXR improved. Seek ID recommendation for appropriate length of
   treatment.
   *Sedation: Continuing to have episodes of agitation with hypertension
   and tachycardia, worse at night.  Now off Versed drip, continuing PO
   Ativan, also IV methadone and PO Quetiapine.  Plan to transition to PO
   methadone per pharmacy recs.
   - CXR Q24H or prn clinical changes.
   2) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally
   hypotensive, responsive to fluids.  Continue to monitor. No pressors
   have been required x4 days.
   - Adjust/wean sedation per above.
    -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed if needed for MAPs <60.
   3) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: LFT
s persistently elevated, with lipase
   increased after propofol [**7-29**].  Has had persistently elevated LFT
   with negative CT, negative RUQ ultrasound, no change in abdominal exam
   or reported pain.  Likely due to multiple medications.
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
   4) FEVERS: T to 100.8 yesterday, blood Cx pending, C diff negative,
   stool culture negative. No microorganisms on BAL gram stain, cx with
   yeast. Sputum with yeast.
   *Monocytosis: Likely due to recovery from acute infection, although new
   infection could also potentially cause monocytosis. However, he is on
   an extensive antibiotic regimen and has an improved clinical picture,
   so new infection is less likely.
   -Continue to monitor WBC.
   -Continuing to treat with broad spectrum antibiotics, with adjustment
   to regimen pending ID recommendations, as per above.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
   5) ANEMIA: Hct 22.2, generally stable around around 23-25. Anemia
   likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. No signs
   of acute blood loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused, Cr within
   normal limits.
   - Continue with Q24Hr Hct checks to minimize blood loss due to
   phlebotomy.
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   6) Low PO4 and low Mg: improved - both WNL on this morning's labs.
   -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate, replete as necessary.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. Genotyping arrived yesterday.
   -HAART started yesterday - - darunavir 800 mg PO once daily, ritonavir
   100 mg PO once daily, and truvada 1 tab PO once daily this AM.
   -ID following.
   -Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   -Follow respiratory status for immune reconstitution inflammation
   syndrome.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: FeNa 2.9 with ongoing autodiuresis.
   Creatinine WNL, good UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially
   due to solute diuresis.
   -Continue to follow UOP, urine lytes, and serum electrolytes.
   -Negative fluid balance over past several days - fluid bolus for any
   signs of hypovolemia.
   9) FEN: Tolerated advancement to tube feeds at 50 cc/hr without
   significant residuals. OG D/C'd when ET tube removed; Dopoff position
   post-trach confirmed.
   -Continue tube feeds
   -Continue ISS for glycemic control

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and recent diagnosis of HIV, presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and possible central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has shown improvement in respiratory status. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy, and his sedation is being weaned. The patient has multiple medical complications including anxiety, labile blood pressure, transaminitis, pancreatitis, fever, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: This complication is likely secondary to PCP pneumonia with ARDS physiology. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with suspected VAP, and appropriate treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is ongoing. CXR has shown improvement, and further ID recommendation for appropriate length of treatment is needed.
3. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): Although not confirmed, the presence of yeast in the sputum and blood cultures raises the possibility of a central line infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.
4. Labile blood pressure: The patient continues to be hypertensive with episodes of agitation and tachycardia. Sedation management should be adjusted accordingly, and close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary.
5. Transaminitis and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure due to pneumonia and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). This is indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation support and the presence of pulmonary infiltrates.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, which suggests an ongoing systemic inflammatory response likely secondary to the infection.

3. HIV/AIDS: The patient has an underlying HIV infection with AIDS, requiring HAART therapy. Monitoring for opportunistic infections and potential complications related to immunosuppression is necessary.

4. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP): The patient has severe PCP, for which treatment with Bactrim has been initiated. There is concern for coinfection with cytomegalovirus (CMV), but no evidence has been found so far.

5. Pancreatitis: The patient is experiencing chemical pancreatitis, possibly attributed to medications. Close monitoring of pancreatic enzymes and appropriate management are essential.

6. Anxiety: The patient exhibits significant anxiety, requiring sedation with Versed. Methadone is being continued at the current dose, and an increase in nighttime Seroquel is considered. A psych consultation may be necessary if there is no further progress.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. Here are the summarized information and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary of Information:
- Chief Complaint: respiratory failure due to ARDS and PCP.
- The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS.
- The patient requires sedation, which has been a major issue during hospitalization.
- The patient has pneumonia, specifically Pneumocystis pneumonia, and there is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary infiltrates.
- The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics for suspected infections.
- The patient is on HAART therapy for HIV management.
- There is evidence of pancreatitis.
- The patient's liver function tests are elevated.
- The patient is receiving nutritional support through enteral feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Early identification and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial.
2. Nosocomial infections: Given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU, there is a risk of developing healthcare-associated infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or central line-associated thrombosis.
3. HIV-related opportunistic infections: Despite HAART therapy, the patient remains immunocompromised, making them susceptible to other opportunistic infections like cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection or fungal infections.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of respiratory failure due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and Pneumocystis pneumonia. The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS and is being treated with HAART therapy. The patient requires mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode, with FiO2 set at 50%. Other vital signs include a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/55-161/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 6,085 mL (total in) and output of 7,605 mL (total out), resulting in a negative balance of 1,520 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient has been diagnosed with anxiety, anemia, ARDS, sepsis without organ dysfunction, HIV, pneumonia (PJP), respiratory failure, pulmonary infiltrates, sedation, fever, pancreatitis, elevated liver function tests, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS and pneumonia put them at risk for continued respiratory failure and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.

   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- attributed predominately to Pneumocystis
   pneumonia, although may be component of ARDS, (no evidence for CMV
   co-infection) and now concern for VAP --> empirical vanco/cefopime,
   cipro.  Completing 21-day course of Bactrim for pneumocystis.  Continue
   complete course for VAP.
   SEDATION
 major issue during hospitalization, requiring significant
   doses to provide adequate sedation.  Now off iv versed and fentanyl,
   and on benzodiazepines and methadone per NGT.  Monitor for evidence of
   benzodiazepine withdrawal.  Continue Methadone at current dose.  Switch
   Zyprexa to [**Hospital1 7**] Seroquel to see if more effective.
   FEVER -- no localizing signs.  Monitor for line-related infection, C.
   diff.  Discontinue unnecessary lines.  Monitor temperature.
   HIV -- Initiated HAART.  Need to monitor for possible [**Doctor First Name **] on HAART.
   PANCREATITIS
 chemical pancreatitis, in part attributed to
   medications.   Monitor.
   ELEVATED LFTs
 likely related to medications, but need to monitor for

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation with difficulty
   weaning from ventilator and sedation, then likely superimposed VAP, now
   improving after broadening of abx coverage.  Overall respiratory status
   improving, trach placed successfully [**7-29**].
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   with ARDS physiology. On bactrim day 21 and prednisone for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. Sputum culture from [**7-30**] with gram
   positive cocci and clusters, gram positive rods, and yeast.
   *Vent settings weaned to PS 10 with stable ABG. PaO2 is elevated this
   AM, so can wean FiO2, with subsequent weaning to PS and PEEP as
   tolerated.
   *Sedation: Improved agitation overnight on increased Quetiapine and
   Midazolam of [**8-18**]. Plan was to transition to PO methadone per pharmacy
   recs.  Also consider starting SSRI; need to check interactions with
   other medications, especially HAART agents.
   * VAP: Per ID
s recommendations, completed vanco and cefepime/cipro
   yesterday.
   *PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 54**] ID, will likely continue Bactrim for a few more days before
   transitioning to prophylactic dose and will taper steroids. Final
   recommendations from ID still pending.
   -Continue to attempt to slowly wean FiO2, then PS and PEEP as
   tolerated.
   -Continue Quetiapine, Midazolam, Diazepam. Wean Midazolam as tolerated.
   -Follow up with pharm regarding interactions with SSRI and current
   medications.
   -Continue Bactrim and steroids; follow up ID recommendations
   - [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Q24H or prn clinical changes.
   5) ANEMIA: Hct 19.7 this AM, otherwise generally stable around around
   23-25. Baseline anemia likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition
   suboptimal. Reason for acute Hct drop unclear; no signs of acute blood
   loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused, Cr within normal limits.
   LDH WNL, so hemolysis less likely.
   - Check Hct this AM.
   -
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   2) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally
   hypotensive, responsive to fluids.  Continue to monitor. No pressors
   have been required for nearly 1 week.
   -Per above, continue current anxiolytic regimen, with attempts to wean
   Midazolam.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed if needed for MAPs <60.
   3) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: LFT
s persistently elevated, with lipase
   increased after propofol [**7-29**] but now trednign down even after starting
   potentially hepatotoxic HAART regimen. Negative CT, negative RUQ
   ultrasound, no change in abdominal exam or reported pain.  Likely due
   to multiple medications.
    - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
    4) FEVERS: T to 99, blood Cx pending, sputum with gram positive cocci
   and clusters, gram positive rods, and yeast.
    C diff negative, stool culture pending. Resolution of monocytosis.
   -Continue to monitor WBC.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
    6) Low PO4 and low Mg: improved - both WNL on this morning's labs.
    -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate, replete as necessary.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable
   LFTs.  Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome.
   -Continue HAART
   -ID following.
   -Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: Ongoing autodiuresis.  Creatinine WNL, good
   UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially due to solute
   diuresis.
   -Continue to follow UOP and Cr.
   -Negative fluid balance over past several days - fluid bolus for any
   signs of hypovolemia.
   9) FEN:
   -Continue tube feeds. Glycemic control with ISS.
   -Consult GI regarding GJ tube placement, in anticipation of transfer to
   rehab facility in the future.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). The patient developed ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) requiring intubation with difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sedation. It is likely that the patient also developed VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 151/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 610 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows pH of 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 49 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 222 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 24400 cells/ÂµL, anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) of 19.7%, and hyperkalemia with a potassium"

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation with difficulty
   weaning from ventilator and sedation, then likely superimposed VAP, now
   improving after broadening of abx coverage.  Overall respiratory status
   improving, trach placed successfully [**7-29**].
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. On bactrim
   day 23 and prednisone for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] improved. Leukocytosis has resolved.
   Sputum culture from [**7-30**] with gram positive cocci in pairs and
   clusters, gram positive rods, and yeast but prelim cx with sparse
   growth of orophargyngeal flora.
   *Vent settings weaned to PS 10 with stable ABG. PaO2 is elevated this
   AM, so can wean FiO2, with subsequent weaning to PS and PEEP as
   tolerated.
   *Sedation: Improved agitation overnight on increased Quetiapine and
   Midazolam of [**8-18**]. Plan was to transition to PO methadone per pharmacy
   recs.  Also consider starting SSRI; need to check interactions with
   other medications, especially HAART agents.
   * VAP: Per ID
s recommendations, completed vanco and cefepime/cipro
   yesterday.
   *PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 54**] ID, will likely continue Bactrim for a few more days before
   transitioning to prophylactic dose and will taper steroids. Final
   recommendations from ID still pending.
   -Continue to attempt to slowly wean FiO2, then PS and PEEP as
   tolerated.
   -Continue Quetiapine, Midazolam, Diazepam. Wean Midazolam as tolerated.
   -Follow up with pharm regarding interactions with SSRI and current
   medications.
   -Continue Bactrim and steroids; follow up ID recommendations
   - [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Q24H or prn clinical changes.
   2) ANEMIA: Hct 19.7 this AM, otherwise generally stable around around
   23-25. Baseline anemia likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition
   suboptimal. Reason for acute Hct drop unclear; no signs of acute blood
   loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused, Cr within normal limits.
   Guaiac status unknown. LDH WNL, so hemolysis less likely. WBC and plts
   also down, but no IVF yesterday, with net negative fluid balance.
   - Check Hct this AM.
   -Guaiaic stool.
   - Consider hemolysis labs pending appropriate response (haptoglobin,
   retic count, peripheral smear)
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally
   hypotensive, responsive to fluids.  Continue to monitor. No pressors
   have been required for nearly 1 week.
   -Per above, continue current anxiolytic regimen, with attempts to wean
   Midazolam.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed if needed for MAPs <60.
   4) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: LFT
s persistently elevated, with lipase
   increased after propofol [**7-29**] but now trednign down even after starting
   potentially hepatotoxic HAART regimen. Negative CT, negative RUQ
   ultrasound, no change in abdominal exam or reported pain.  Likely due
   to multiple medications.
    - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
   5) FEVERS: T to 99, blood Cx pending, sputum with gram positive cocci
   and clusters, gram positive rods, and yeast.
    C diff negative, stool culture pending. Resolution of monocytosis.
   -Continue to monitor WBC.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
    6) Low PO4 and low Mg: improved - both WNL on this morning's labs.
    -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate, replete as necessary.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable
   LFTs.  Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome.
   -Continue HAART
   -ID following.
   -Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: Ongoing autodiuresis.  Creatinine WNL, good
   UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially due to solute
   diuresis.
   -Continue to follow UOP and Cr.
   -Negative fluid balance over past several days - fluid bolus for any
   signs of hypovolemia.
   9) FEN:
   -Continue tube feeds. Glycemic control with ISS.
   -Consult GI regarding GJ tube placement, in anticipation of transfer to

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of PCP. He developed ARDS requiring intubation and had difficulty weaning from the ventilator, leading to suspected superimposed VAP. The patient's respiratory status has improved after broadening antibiotic coverage. He has been sedated but is now responding to voice and nodding appropriately. The patient's blood pressure is labile, and he has anemia with a hematocrit of 19.7. Other medical complications include transaminitis, pancreatitis, fevers, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS physiology and resolving secondary pneumonia may contribute to ongoing respiratory distress.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's clinical course suggests a possible superimposed VAP, which needs to be addressed with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit indicates anemia, likely due to HIV-related bone marrow suppression, stress, phlebotomy, and poor nutrition.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels require careful monitoring and management to prevent cardiac complications.
5. Transaminitis/pancreatitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and lipase levels indicate possible liver and pancreatic involvement, likely due to multiple medications including HAART regimen."

   does have elevated PaCO2, which may be secondary to his sedation
   regimen.
   *Sedation: Improved agitation overnight on increased Quetiapine and
   Midazolam of [**8-18**]. Since he did well with increased Quetiapine and 25
   mg HS dose x1, we can increase his QHS dose from 50 mg to 75 mg
   standing. Given his elevated PaCO2, we should attempt to minimize his
   benzos and opiate. Ritonavir inhibits benzo metabolism, so we can
   decrease the interval of his Diazepam standing dose, with subsequent
   weaning of Midazolam as tolerated. We can also decrease the frequency
   of his Methadone dose to further minimize respiratory depression given
   his lack of pain.
   Once his response to the new Diazepam and Methadone frequency is noted,
   we can proceed with weaning Midazolam IV in favor of anxiety control
   with Diazepam (PO) to facilitate disposition. Also consider starting
   SSRI for long-term anxiety control; need to check interactions with

   23-25. Baseline anemia likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition
   suboptimal. Reason for acute Hct drop unclear but it could be due to
   impaired production in the setting of HIV. No signs of acute blood
   loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused, Cr within normal limits.
   Guaiac status slightly positive this AM. LDH and tbili are WNL, so
   hemolysis is less likely. WBC and plts also down, but no IVF yesterday,
   with net negative fluid balance in 24Hrs, so hemodilution is less
   likely. If Hct does not appropriate respond to transfusion, consider

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and recent diagnosis of HIV and PCP. He developed ARDS requiring intubation and has likely superimposed VAP. The patient is currently improving after receiving a course of antibiotics but has difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sedation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's condition is likely secondary to PCP pneumonia and probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. The patient's PaO2 is elevated this AM, so weaning FiO2 can be considered, with subsequent weaning PEEP as tolerated.

2. Anemia: The patient has a Hct of 19.7, which is below the normal range. This could be due to various factors such as HIV, stress, phlebotomy, or nutrition suboptimal. The patient's WBC and plts are also down, but no IVF was given yesterday, so hemodilution is less likely. If Hct does not appropriately respond to transfusion, consider hemolysis labs (haptoglobin, retic count, peripheral smear).

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, now improving after receiving a course of abx but with difficulty
   weaning from ventilator and sedation, likely
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. On bactrim
   day 23 and prednisone for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] improved. Leukocytosis has resolved.
   Sputum culture from [**7-30**] with gram stain with gram positive cocci in
   pairs and clusters, gram positive rods, and yeast but prelim cx with
   sparse growth of orophargyngeal flora.
   *Vent settings weaned to PS 10 with stable ABG. PaO2 is elevated this
   AM, so can wean FiO2, with subsequent weaning PEEP as tolerated. He
   does have elevated PaCO2, which may be secondary to his sedation
   regimen.
   *Sedation: Improved agitation overnight on increased Quetiapine and
   Midazolam of [**8-18**]. Since he did well with increased Quetiapine and 25
   mg HS dose x1, we can increase his QHS dose from 50 mg to 75 mg
   standing. Given his elevated PaCO2, we should attempt to minimize his
   benzos and opiate. Ritonavir inhibits benzo metabolism, so we can
   decrease the interval of his Diazepam standing dose, with subsequent
   weaning of Midazolam as tolerated. We can also decrease the frequency
   of his Methadone dose to further minimize respiratory depression given
   his lack of pain.
   Once his response to the new Diazepam and Methadone frequency is noted,
   we can proceed with weaning Midazolam IV in favor of anxiety control
   with Diazepam (PO) to facilitate disposition. Also consider starting
   SSRI for long-term anxiety control; need to check interactions with
   other medications, especially HAART agents.
   * VAP: Per ID

   days ago; prelim sputum cx negative.
   *PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 54**] ID, will likely continue Bactrim for a few more days before
   transitioning to prophylactic dose and will taper steroids. Final
   recommendations from ID still pending.
   -Continue to attempt to slowly wean vent FiO2 setting, then PS and PEEP
   as tolerated.
   -Follow up final sputum cx.
   -Increase QHS Quetiapine from 50 mg to 75 mg, and continue QAM dose at
   50mg.
   -Decrease Diazepam frequency from 10 mg NG Q4H to Q8H.
   -Decrease Methadone frequency from 20 mg NG Q6H to Q8H.
   -Wean Midazolam as tolerated.

   Guaiac status slightly positive this AM. LDH and tbili are WNL, so
   hemolysis is less likely. WBC and plts also down, but no IVF yesterday,
   with net negative fluid balance in 24Hrs, so hemodilution is less
   likely. If Hct does not appropriate respond to transfusion, consider
   hemolysis labs (haptoglobin, retic count, peripheral smear).

   3) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally
   hypotensive, responsive to fluids.  Continue to monitor. No pressors
   have been required for nearly 1 week.
   -Per above, increase QHS dose of Quetiapine, decrease frequency of
   Diazepam and Methadone, and attempt to wean Midazolam.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed if needed for MAPs <60.
   4) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: LFT

   increased after propofol [**7-29**] but now trednign down even after starting
   potentially hepatotoxic HAART regimen. Negative CT, negative RUQ

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) requiring intubation, with likely superimposed Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP). The patient has shown improvement after receiving a course of antibiotics but continues to have difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sedation.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving but still at risk due to PCP pneumonia and possible resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. The weaning of FiO2, PS, and PEEP should be done cautiously.

2. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level of 19.7%, indicating anemia. This may be due to various factors such as HIV, stress, phlebotomy, and poor nutrition. Further investigation and transfusion may be necessary.

3. Labile Blood Pressure: The patient continues to have labile blood pressure, being hypertensive with agitation and occasionally hypotensive. This may be related to medication effects and should be closely monitored.

4. Transaminitis/Pancreatitis: The patient has persistently elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which may be due to multiple medications including potentially hepatotoxic HAART regimen"

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, now improving after receiving a course of abx but with difficulty
   weaning from ventilator and sedation, likely
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. On bactrim
   day 23 and prednisone for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] improved. Leukocytosis has resolved.
   Sputum culture from [**7-30**] with gram stain with gram positive cocci in
   pairs and clusters, gram positive rods, and yeast but prelim cx with
   sparse growth of orophargyngeal flora.
   *Vent settings weaned to PS 10 with stable ABG. PaO2 is elevated this
   AM, so can wean FiO2, with subsequent weaning PEEP as tolerated. He
   does have elevated PaCO2, which may be secondary to his sedation
   regimen.
   *Sedation: Improved agitation overnight on increased Quetiapine and
   Midazolam of [**8-18**]. Since he did well with increased Quetiapine and 25
   mg HS dose x1, we can increase his QHS dose from 50 mg to 75 mg
   standing. Given his elevated PaCO2, we should attempt to minimize his
   sedation regimen. Ritonavir inhibits benzo metabolism, so we can
   decrease the interval of his Diazepam standing dose, with subsequent
   weaning of Midazolam as tolerated. Once his response to the new
   Diazepam frequency is noted, we can proceed with weaning Midazolam IV
   in favor of anxiety control with Diazepam (PO) to facilitate
   disposition. We can also decrease the frequency of his Methadone dose
   to further minimize respiratory depression given his lack of pain. Also
   consider starting SSRI; need to check interactions with other
   medications, especially HAART agents.
   * VAP: Per ID
s recommendations, completed vanco and cefepime/cipro
   yesterday; prelim sputum cx negative.
   *PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 54**] ID, will likely continue Bactrim for a few more days before
   transitioning to prophylactic dose and will taper steroids. Final
   recommendations from ID still pending.
   -Continue to attempt to slowly wean FiO2, then PS and PEEP as
   tolerated.
   -Increase QHS Quetiapine from 50 mg to 75 mg, and continue QAM dose at
   50mg
   -Decrease Diazepam frequency from 10 mg Q4H to Q8H.
   -Decrease Methadone frequency from 20 mg NG Q6H to Q8H.
   -Wean Midazolam as tolerated.
   -Follow up with pharm regarding interactions with SSRI and current
   medications.
   -Continue Bactrim and steroids; follow up ID recommendations
   - [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Q24H or prn clinical changes.
   2) ANEMIA: Hct 19.7 this AM, otherwise generally stable around around
   23-25. Baseline anemia likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition
   suboptimal. Reason for acute Hct drop unclear but it could be due to
   impaired production in the setting of HIV. No signs of acute blood
   loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused, Cr within normal limits.
   Guaiac status slightly positive this AM. LDH and tbili are WNL, so
   hemolysis is less likely. WBC and plts also down, but no IVF yesterday,
   with net negative fluid balance in 24Hrs, so hemodilution is less
   likely. If Hct does not appropriate respond to transfusion, consider
   hemolysis labs (haptoglobin, retic count, peripheral smear).
   - Check Hct this AM.
   - Reduce frequency of lab draws to QAM for CBC and electrolyes and Q2-3
   days for LFTs.
   -Guaiaic stool.
   -Continue PPI [**Hospital1 7**].
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally
   hypotensive, responsive to fluids.  Continue to monitor. No pressors
   have been required for nearly 1 week.
   -Per above, increase QHS dose of Quetiapine, decrease frequency of
   Diazepam and Methadone, and attempt to wean Midazolam.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed if needed for MAPs <60.
   4) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: LFT
s persistently elevated, with lipase
   increased after propofol [**7-29**] but now trednign down even after starting
   potentially hepatotoxic HAART regimen. Negative CT, negative RUQ
   ultrasound, no change in abdominal exam or reported pain.  Likely due
   to multiple medications.
    - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
   5) FEVERS: T within normal limits and clinical picture improved, last
   spiked on [**7-30**] with blood Cx pending, sputum cx negative on prelim
   read. C diff negative, stool culture pending.
   -Continue to monitor WBC.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
    6) Low PO4 and low Mg: improved - both WNL on this morning's labs.
    -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate, replete as necessary.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable
   LFTs.  Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome.
   -Continue HAART
   -ID following.
   -Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: Ongoing autodiuresis.  Creatinine WNL, good
   UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially due to solute
   diuresis.
   -Continue to follow UOP and Cr.
   -Negative fluid balance over past several days - fluid bolus for any
   signs of hypovolemia.
   9) FEN:
   -Continue tube feeds. Glycemic control with ISS.
   -Consult GI regarding GJ tube placement, in anticipation of transfer to

","Summary:
The patient, a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and recent diagnosis of HIV, presented to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. He also has a new diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition is improving after receiving antibiotics, but he continues to have difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sedation. He has been sedated with midazolam and quetiapine for anxiety, and his sedation regimen is being adjusted to minimize respiratory depression. The patient's lab results show anemia with a hematocrit of 19.7%, hyperkalemia, and elevated liver enzymes. His blood cultures are pending, and he has received appropriate antibiotic treatment for VAP and PCP. The patient is being closely monitored for any complications, including hypoxemic respiratory failure, anemia, labile blood pressure, transaminitis/pancreatitis, fevers, low phosphate and magnesium levels, HIV/AIDS management, and ongoing autodiuresis."

   weaning from ventilator and sedation, then likely superimposed VAP, now
   improving after broadening of abx coverage.  Overall respiratory status
   improving, trach placed successfully [**7-29**].
   1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   with ARDS physiology. On bactrim day 21 and prednisone for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. Sputum culture from [**7-30**] with gram
   positive cocci and clusters, gram positive rods, and yeast.
   *Vent settings weaned to PS 10 with stable ABG. PaO2 is elevated this
   AM, so can wean FiO2, with subsequent weaning to PS and PEEP as
   tolerated.
   *Sedation: Improved agitation overnight on increased Quetiapine and
   Midazolam of [**8-18**]. Plan was to transition to PO methadone per pharmacy
   recs.  Also consider starting SSRI; need to check interactions with
   other medications, especially HAART agents.
   * VAP: Per ID
s recommendations, completed vanco and cefepime/cipro
   yesterday.
   *PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 54**] ID, will likely continue Bactrim for a few more days before
   transitioning to prophylactic dose and will taper steroids. Final
   recommendations from ID still pending.
   -Continue to attempt to slowly wean FiO2, then PS and PEEP as
   tolerated.
   -Continue Quetiapine, Midazolam, Diazepam. Wean Midazolam as tolerated.
   -Follow up with pharm regarding interactions with SSRI and current
   medications.
   -Continue Bactrim and steroids; follow up ID recommendations
   - [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Q24H or prn clinical changes.
   2) ANEMIA: Hct 19.7 this AM, otherwise generally stable around around
   23-25. Baseline anemia likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition
   suboptimal. Reason for acute Hct drop unclear; no signs of acute blood
   loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused, Cr within normal limits.
   LDH WNL, so hemolysis less likely. WBC and plts also down, but no IVF
   yesterday, with net negative fluid balance.
   - Check Hct this AM.
   -Guaiaic stool.
   - Consider hemolysis labs pending appropriate response (haptoglobin,
   retic count, peripheral smear)
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally
   hypotensive, responsive to fluids.  Continue to monitor. No pressors
   have been required for nearly 1 week.
   -Per above, continue current anxiolytic regimen, with attempts to wean
   Midazolam.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed if needed for MAPs <60.
   4) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: LFT
s persistently elevated, with lipase
   increased after propofol [**7-29**] but now trednign down even after starting
   potentially hepatotoxic HAART regimen. Negative CT, negative RUQ
   ultrasound, no change in abdominal exam or reported pain.  Likely due
   to multiple medications.
    - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
   5) FEVERS: T to 99, blood Cx pending, sputum with gram positive cocci
   and clusters, gram positive rods, and yeast.
    C diff negative, stool culture pending. Resolution of monocytosis.
   -Continue to monitor WBC.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
    6) Low PO4 and low Mg: improved - both WNL on this morning's labs.
    -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate, replete as necessary.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable
   LFTs.  Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome.
   -Continue HAART
   -ID following.
   -Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: Ongoing autodiuresis.  Creatinine WNL, good
   UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially due to solute
   diuresis.
   -Continue to follow UOP and Cr.
   -Negative fluid balance over past several days - fluid bolus for any
   signs of hypovolemia.
   9) FEN:
   -Continue tube feeds. Glycemic control with ISS.
   -Consult GI regarding GJ tube placement, in anticipation of transfer to
   rehab facility in the future.

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of PCP. He developed ARDS requiring intubation with difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sedation, then likely superimposed VAP. He is improving after broadening antibiotic coverage. His overall respiratory status is improving, and the tracheostomy tube was placed successfully on [**7-29**].

The patient's current conditions include:
1) Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia with ARDS physiology. He is on Bactrim day 21 and prednisone for PCP. He improved, leukocytosis has resolved, and sputum culture from [**7-30**] shows gram-positive cocci and clusters, gram-positive rods, and yeast.
2) Anemia: Hct 19.7 this AM, otherwise generally stable around 23-25. Baseline anemia likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal. Reason for acute Hct drop unclear; no signs of acute blood loss. Continue to monitor Hct, consider hemolysis labs pending appropriate response (haptoglobin, retic count, peripheral smear), and transfuse to >21.
3) Labile blood pressure: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally hypotensive, responsive to fluids. Continue to monitor, no pressors have been required for nearly 1 week"

   positive cocci and clusters, gram positive rods, and yeast.
   *Vent settings weaned to PS 10 with stable ABG. PaO2 is elevated this
   AM, so can wean FiO2, with subsequent weaning to PS and PEEP as
   tolerated.
   *Sedation: Improved agitation overnight on increased Quetiapine and
   Midazolam of [**8-18**]. Plan was to transition to PO methadone per pharmacy
   recs.  Also consider starting SSRI; need to check interactions with
   other medications, especially HAART agents.
   * VAP: Per ID
s recommendations, completed vanco and cefepime/cipro
   yesterday.
   *PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 54**] ID, will likely continue Bactrim for a few more days before
   transitioning to prophylactic dose and will taper steroids. Final
   recommendations from ID still pending.
   -Continue to attempt to slowly wean FiO2, then PS and PEEP as
   tolerated.
   -Continue Quetiapine, Midazolam, Diazepam. Wean Midazolam as tolerated.
   -Follow up with pharm regarding interactions with SSRI and current
   medications.
   -Continue Bactrim and steroids; follow up ID recommendations
   - [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Q24H or prn clinical changes.
   2) ANEMIA: Hct 19.7 this AM, otherwise generally stable around around
   23-25. Baseline anemia likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition
   suboptimal. Reason for acute Hct drop unclear; no signs of acute blood
   loss: continues to be warm and well-perfused, Cr within normal limits.
   Guaiac status unknown. LDH WNL, so hemolysis less likely. WBC and plts
   also down, but no IVF yesterday, with net negative fluid balance.
   - Check Hct this AM.
   -Guaiaic stool.
   - Consider hemolysis labs pending appropriate response (haptoglobin,
   retic count, peripheral smear)
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally
   hypotensive, responsive to fluids.  Continue to monitor. No pressors
   have been required for nearly 1 week.
   -Per above, continue current anxiolytic regimen, with attempts to wean
   Midazolam.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed if needed for MAPs <60.
   4) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: LFT
s persistently elevated, with lipase
   increased after propofol [**7-29**] but now trednign down even after starting
   potentially hepatotoxic HAART regimen. Negative CT, negative RUQ
   ultrasound, no change in abdominal exam or reported pain.  Likely due
   to multiple medications.
    - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
   5) FEVERS: T to 99, blood Cx pending, sputum with gram positive cocci
   and clusters, gram positive rods, and yeast.
    C diff negative, stool culture pending. Resolution of monocytosis.
   -Continue to monitor WBC.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
    6) Low PO4 and low Mg: improved - both WNL on this morning's labs.
    -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate, replete as necessary.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable
   LFTs.  Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome.
   -Continue HAART
   -ID following.
   -Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: Ongoing autodiuresis.  Creatinine WNL, good
   UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially due to solute
   diuresis.
   -Continue to follow UOP and Cr.
   -Negative fluid balance over past several days - fluid bolus for any
   signs of hypovolemia.
   9) FEN:
   -Continue tube feeds. Glycemic control with ISS.
   -Consult GI regarding GJ tube placement, in anticipation of transfer to
   rehab facility in the future.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The patient has been diagnosed with severe pneumonia, specifically Pneumocystis pneumonia, and is now experiencing acute lung injury and ARDS. They are currently on ventilatory support and require significant doses of sedation due to anxiety. The patient has also been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and has been started on HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy). Anemia and chemical pancreatitis have also been identified as potential issues that need to be monitored and managed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
2. Infection: There is a risk of developing new infections due to immunosuppression from HIV/AIDS and prolonged ICU stay. Frequent cultures and close monitoring for signs of infection are necessary.
3. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and prolonged PTT/INR indicate an increased risk of bleeding. Care should be taken during procedures or if there is any evidence of bleeding.
4. Hepatic Dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver involvement. Monitoring liver function and identifying the cause of this dysfunction is crucial.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase levels suggest pancreatitis. Monitoring pancreatic enzymes and addressing the underlying cause is important.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with ARDS and has been admitted to the ICU. They have received various treatments including antibiotics and respiratory support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate within normal range, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate low due to mechanical ventilation, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for decreased urine output. 

The flow sheet data shows that the patient has received a significant amount of fluids, with a total input of 4,504 mL and a total output of 5,530 mL since midnight. The patient's weight is currently 96.7 kg, which is slightly lower than their admission weight of 97.7 kg. 

The respiratory support data indicates that the patient is on CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode with a tidal volume of 838 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10. The patient's partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio is 222, which suggests adequate oxygenation.

The physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally with diffuse crackles throughout the lung fields. 

The lab results show normal white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), and plate"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. They have Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), anxiety, alteration in nutrition, hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), anemia, hypotension (not in shock), sepsis without organ dysfunction, HIV (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), pneumonia, and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PJP). The patient is receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU, including arterial and peripheral intravenous catheters, respiratory support, and nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS can worsen, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Infection: Despite receiving antibiotics, the patient may develop a new infection or have an existing infection that does not respond to treatment.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and sepsis can lead to cardiovascular collapse or organ dysfunction.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Stress ulcers in critically ill patients can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require urgent intervention.
5. Renal impairment: Hyperkalemia indicates potential renal dysfunction, which could be exacerbated by sepsis or other factors.
6. HIV-related complications: The patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV/AIDS can increase the risk of opportunistic infections and poor wound healing.
7. Malnutrition: The alteration in nutrition may contribute to poor recovery and increased risk of complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on mechanical ventilation support. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.9Â°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/69 to 96/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals tracheostomy in place, fair air movement in the chest, soft distended abdomen, and 2+ edema in the extremities. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is diagnosed with pneumonia, specifically Pneumocystis pneumonia, and is receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment. They are also being treated for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and HIV/AIDS. The patient's sedation needs have been significant during hospitalization, and they are on multiple sedatives. The plan is to wean off these sedatives gradually. The patient's nutrition is being provided through enteral feeding, and glycemic control is being monitored. Prophylactic measures are in place to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is set to full code, and they are currently in the ICU.

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, now improving after receiving a course of abx but with continued
   difficulty weaning from ventilator and sedation.  Respiratory,
   cardiovascular, and anxiety/sedation issues are all intertwined
   episodes of anxiety tend to cause increased HR and BP with worsened
   respiratory function.
    1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   and probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
   Bactrim PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing, tapering
   prednisone. CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. Sputum culture
   from [**7-30**] with sparse growth of orophargyngeal flora.
    *Remained on PS 10, PEEP 10 with increase FiO2 from 40 to 50%,  with
   stable ABG. PaO2 is elevated in most recent ABGs so can wean FiO2, with
   subsequent weaning PEEP as tolerated.
    *Sedation: Yesterday increased dose of QHS Quetiapine and decreased
   frequency of Diazepam and Methadone due to decreased benzo clearance in
   the setting of ritonavir and elevated PaCO2. We can proceed with
   weaning Midazolam IV in favor of anxiety control with Diazepam (PO) to
   facilitate disposition. Also consider starting SSRI for long-term
   anxiety control; need to check interactions with other medications,
   especially HAART agents.
    * VAP: Completed 8 day course of vanco and cefepime/cipro 2 days ago;
   sputum cx negative.
   *PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 54**] ID, Bactrim DS [**Hospital1 7**] (prophylactic dosing) and taper steroids
   off (10mg x2 days, 5mg x2 days -->0). Ordered for CMV, Toxo antibodies.
   -Continue to attempt to slowly wean vent FiO2 setting, then PS and PEEP
   as tolerated.
   -Continue Quetiapine, Diazepam, and Methadone at current doses. Wean
   Midazolam as tolerated.
   -Follow up with pharm regarding interactions with SSRI and current
   medications.
   -Reduce Bactrim to DS QD.
   -Steroids now stopped
 will monitor for any signs of insufficiency,
   restart if needed.
   -Follow up CMV and toxo antibodies per ID.
   - CXR prn clinical changes only.
   2) ANEMIA: Hct from 22 to 19.7 - following 1 unit of PRBC yesterday,
   Hct 25.4 today.  Otherwise generally stable around around 23-25.
   Baseline anemia likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition
   suboptimal.
   - Continue QAM for CBC and electrolyes and Q2-3 days for LFTs to
   minimize phlebotomy.
   -Guaiaic stool.
   -Continue PPI [**Hospital1 7**].
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally
   hypotensive, responsive to fluids.  Continue to monitor. No pressors
   have been required for nearly 1 week.
   -Per above, continue Quetiapine, Methadone, Diazepam and wean Midazolam
   as tolerated.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed if needed for MAPs <60.
   -started lisinopril 10 mg PO QD.
   -will start Clonidine patch, continue clonidine for BP control, help
   with weaning benzos.
   4) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: LFT
s persistently elevated, with lipase
   increased after propofol [**7-29**] but now trending down even after starting
   potentially hepatotoxic HAART regimen. Negative CT, negative RUQ
   ultrasound, no change in abdominal exam or reported pain.  Likely due
   to multiple medications.
    - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase, reduce frequency of labs.  Will
   check with tomorrow morning
s labs, especially if propofol needed for
   procedure today.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
   5) FEVERS: T within normal limits and clinical picture improved, last
   spiked on [**7-30**] with blood Cx pending, sputum cx negative on prelim
   read. C diff negative, stool culture pending.
   -Continue to monitor WBC.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
    6) Electrolye imbalances
 have been stable, phosphate slightly low
   this morning.  Will replete today.
    -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate, replete as necessary.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable
   LFTs.  Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome.
   -Continue HAART
   -ID following.
   -Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: Ongoing autodiuresis.  Creatinine WNL, good
   UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially due to solute
   diuresis.
   -Continue to follow UOP and Cr.
   -Negative fluid balance over past several days - fluid bolus for any
   signs of hypovolemia.
   9) FEN:
   -Continue tube feeds.
   -Discontinued ISS.
   -GJ tube placement with IR ordered and pending
 discussed with IR this
   morning, planning procedure today.  SQ heparin held this am, NPO
   -Also will need increased sedation for procedure today

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and recent diagnoses of HIV and PCP pneumonia. He developed ARDS requiring intubation and had superimposed VAP, but is now improving after receiving antibiotics. He continues to have difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sedation. The patient's current medical issues include hypoxic respiratory failure, labile blood pressure, anemia, transaminitis/pancreatitis, fever, electrolyte imbalances, HIV/AIDS, and autodiuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of PCP pneumonia and ARDS, which can lead to hypoxic respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and ventilation parameters is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Labile blood pressure: The patient's blood pressure fluctuates between hypertension and hypotension. This may be due to medication effects, stress response, or other underlying conditions. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management with antihypertensive or vasopressor medications are important.

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, now improving after receiving a course of abx but with difficulty
   weaning from ventilator and sedation.
    1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   and probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. On
   bactrim day 24 and prednisone for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] improved. Leukocytosis has
   resolved. Sputum culture from [**7-30**] with sparse growth of orophargyngeal
   flora.
    *Remained on PS 10, PEEP 10 with increase FiO2 from 40 to 50%,  with
   stable ABG. PaO2 is elevated in most recent ABGs so can wean FiO2, with
   subsequent weaning PEEP as tolerated.
    *Sedation: Increased QHS Quetiapine and decreased frequency of
   Diazepam and Methadone due to decreased benzo clearance in the setting
   of ritonavir and elevated PaCO2. We can proceed with weaning Midazolam
   IV in favor of anxiety control with Diazepam (PO) to facilitate
   disposition. Also consider starting SSRI for long-term anxiety control;
   need to check interactions with other medications, especially HAART
   agents.
    * VAP: Completed 8 day course of vanco and cefepime/cipro 2 days ago;
   sputum cx negative.
   *PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 54**] ID, Bactrim DS [**Hospital1 7**] (prophylactic dosing) and taper steroids
   off (10mg x2 days, 5mg x2 days -->0). Ordered for CMV, Toxo antibodies.
   -Continue to attempt to slowly wean vent FiO2 setting, then PS and PEEP
   as tolerated.
   -Continue Quetiapine, Diazepam, and Methadone at current doses. Wean
   Midazolam as tolerated.
   -Follow up with pharm regarding interactions with SSRI and current
   medications.
   -Reduce Bactrim to DS [**Hospital1 7**].
   -Decrease steroids to 10 mg today and tomorrow.
   -Follow up CMV and toxo antibodies per ID.
   - [**Hospital1 **] prn clinical changes only.
   2) ANEMIA: Hct from 22 to 19.7 following 1 unit of PRBC yesterday, Hct
   ________ today.  Otherwise generally stable around around 23-25.
   Baseline anemia likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition
   suboptimal.
   Reason for acute Hct drop unclear but it could be due to impaired
   production in the setting of HIV. No signs of acute blood loss:
   continues to be warm and well-perfused, Cr within normal limits. Guaiac
   status slightly positive. LDH and tbili are WNL, so hemolysis is less
   likely. WBC and plts also down, but no IVF yesterday, with net negative
   fluid balance in 24Hrs, so hemodilution is less likely. If Hct does not
   appropriate respond to transfusion, consider hemolysis labs
   (haptoglobin, retic count, peripheral smear).
   - Continue QAM for CBC and electrolyes and Q2-3 days for LFTs to
   minimize phlebotomy.
   -Guaiaic stool.
   -Continue PPI [**Hospital1 7**].
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally
   hypotensive, responsive to fluids.  Continue to monitor. No pressors
   have been required for nearly 1 week.
   -Per above, continue Quetiapine, Methadone, Diazepam and wean Midazolam
   as tolerated.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed if needed for MAPs <60.
   4) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: LFT
s persistently elevated, with lipase
   increased after propofol [**7-29**] but now trending down even after starting
   potentially hepatotoxic HAART regimen. Negative CT, negative RUQ
   ultrasound, no change in abdominal exam or reported pain.  Likely due
   to multiple medications.
    - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
   5) FEVERS: T within normal limits and clinical picture improved, last
   spiked on [**7-30**] with blood Cx pending, sputum cx negative on prelim
   read. C diff negative, stool culture pending.
   -Continue to monitor WBC.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
    6) Low PO4 and low Mg: improved - both WNL on this morning's labs.
    -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate, replete as necessary.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable
   LFTs.  Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome.
   -Continue HAART
   -ID following.
   -Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: Ongoing autodiuresis.  Creatinine WNL, good
   UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially due to solute
   diuresis.
   -Continue to follow UOP and Cr.
   -Negative fluid balance over past several days - fluid bolus for any
   signs of hypovolemia.
   9) FEN:
   -Continue tube feeds.
   -Discontinued ISS.
   -GJ tube placement with IR ordered and pending.
   10) PROPHYLAXIS: heparin UF SC, pneumoboots, PPI
   11) ACCESS:

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and recent diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and probable resolving secondary pneumonia. He has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation but has shown improvement after receiving antibiotics. The patient continues to experience difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sedation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and probable resolving secondary pneumonia may lead to persistent hypoxemia, requiring ongoing monitoring and adjustment of FiO2, PS, and PEEP settings.

2. Anemia: The patient has a baseline anemia likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, and poor nutrition. His Hct has dropped from 22 to 19.7 following a transfusion of 1 unit of PRBC. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the acute drop in Hct and to guide further management.

3. Labile blood pressure: The patient continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally hypotensive, and responsive to fluids. Close monitoring is necessary, and fluid boluses or vasopressor support may be required as needed.

4. Transaminitis/pancreatitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) remain elevated, but his lipase levels are trending down even after starting a potentially hepatotoxic HAART regimen. Other"

   PJP
   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, now improving after receiving a course of abx but with continued
   difficulty weaning from ventilator and sedation.  Respiratory,
   cardiovascular, and anxiety/sedation issues are all intertwined
   episodes of anxiety tend to cause increased HR and BP with worsened
   respiratory function.
    1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   and probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
   Bactrim PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing, tapering
   prednisone. CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. Sputum culture
   from [**7-30**] with sparse growth of orophargyngeal flora.
    *Remained on PS 10, PEEP 10 with increase FiO2 from 40 to 50%,  with
   stable ABG. PaO2 is elevated in most recent ABGs so can wean FiO2, with
   subsequent weaning PEEP as tolerated.
    *Sedation: Yesterday increased dose of QHS Quetiapine and decreased
   frequency of Diazepam and Methadone due to decreased benzo clearance in
   the setting of ritonavir and elevated PaCO2. We can proceed with
   weaning Midazolam IV in favor of anxiety control with Diazepam (PO) to
   facilitate disposition. Also consider starting SSRI for long-term
   anxiety control; need to check interactions with other medications,
   especially HAART agents.
    * VAP: Completed 8 day course of vanco and cefepime/cipro 2 days ago;
   sputum cx negative.
   *PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 54**] ID, Bactrim DS [**Hospital1 7**] (prophylactic dosing) and taper steroids
   off (10mg x2 days, 5mg x2 days -->0). Ordered for CMV, Toxo antibodies.
   -Continue to attempt to slowly wean vent FiO2 setting, then PS and PEEP
   as tolerated.
   -Continue Quetiapine, Diazepam, and Methadone at current doses. Wean
   Midazolam as tolerated.
   -Follow up with pharm regarding interactions with SSRI and current
   medications.
   -Reduce Bactrim to DS QD.
   -Decrease steroids to 10 mg today and tomorrow.
   -Follow up CMV and toxo antibodies per ID.
   - CXR prn clinical changes only.
   2) ANEMIA: Hct from 22 to 19.7 following 1 unit of PRBC yesterday, Hct
   25.4 today.  Otherwise generally stable around around 23-25. Baseline
   anemia likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal.
   - Continue QAM for CBC and electrolyes and Q2-3 days for LFTs to
   minimize phlebotomy.
   -Guaiaic stool.
   -Continue PPI [**Hospital1 7**].
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally
   hypotensive, responsive to fluids.  Continue to monitor. No pressors
   have been required for nearly 1 week.
   -Per above, continue Quetiapine, Methadone, Diazepam and wean Midazolam
   as tolerated.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed if needed for MAPs <60.
   -started lisinopril 10 mg PO QD.
   4) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: LFT
s persistently elevated, with lipase
   increased after propofol [**7-29**] but now trending down even after starting
   potentially hepatotoxic HAART regimen. Negative CT, negative RUQ
   ultrasound, no change in abdominal exam or reported pain.  Likely due
   to multiple medications.
    - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase, reduce frequency of labs.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
   5) FEVERS: T within normal limits and clinical picture improved, last
   spiked on [**7-30**] with blood Cx pending, sputum cx negative on prelim
   read. C diff negative, stool culture pending.
   -Continue to monitor WBC.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
    6) Electrolye imbalances
 have been stable, phosphate slightly low
   this morning.  Will replete today.
    -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate, replete as necessary.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable
   LFTs.  Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome.
   -Continue HAART
   -ID following.
   -Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: Ongoing autodiuresis.  Creatinine WNL, good
   UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially due to solute
   diuresis.
   -Continue to follow UOP and Cr.
   -Negative fluid balance over past several days - fluid bolus for any
   signs of hypovolemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recently diagnosed with HIV and PCP pneumonia, now improving after receiving antibiotic treatment. He developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed VAP, and is currently in the ICU. The patient has difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sedation. He is also experiencing anxiety, labile blood pressure, anemia, transaminitis/pancreatitis, electrolyte imbalances, and is on HAART for HIV management. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated WBC count, leukocytosis, and anemia. Imaging shows no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left upper extremity veins. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3Â°C (99.2Â°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/55 mmHg to 163/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Fluid balance is negative, and the patient is receiving various medications including sedatives, antibiotics, antivirals, and prophylactic treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying PCP pneumonia and probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology may lead to hypoxic respiratory failure. FiO2 has been increased to 50% with stable ABG, indicating potential improvement.
2. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased from 22 to 19.7 after receiving 1 unit of PRBC, with a current Hct of 25.4. This could be due to phlebotomy, stress, or inadequate nutrition.
3. Labile blood pressure: The patient continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally hypotensive, and responsive to fluids. Pressors have not been required for nearly a week.
4. Transaminitis/pancreatitis: The patient's LFTs have been persistently elevated, with lipase increased after propofol but now trending down. This could be due to multiple medications, including potentially hepatotoxic HAART regimen.
5. Fever: The patient's temperature has been within normal limits and clinical picture improved, but there was a spike on [**7-30**] with blood culture pending, sputum cx negative on preliminary read.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has stable electrolyte levels, with phosphate slightly low this morning. Repletion will be done today.
7. HIV/AIDS: The patient recently started HAART for HIV management, with stable LFTs. His respiratory status is improving, with no signs of immune reconstitution inflammation syndrome.
8. Urine electrolytes: The patient is experiencing ongoing autodiuresis, with unclear etiology at this point, potentially due to solute diuresis.
9. Access: The patient has an arterial line, PIC"

   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, now improving after receiving a course of abx but with continued
   difficulty weaning from ventilator and sedation.  Respiratory,
   cardiovascular, and anxiety/sedation issues are all intertwined
   episodes of anxiety tend to cause increased HR and BP with worsened
   respiratory function.
    1) HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia
   and probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. On
   bactrim day 24 and prednisone for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] improved. Leukocytosis has
   resolved. Sputum culture from [**7-30**] with sparse growth of orophargyngeal
   flora.
    *Remained on PS 10, PEEP 10 with increase FiO2 from 40 to 50%,  with
   stable ABG. PaO2 is elevated in most recent ABGs so can wean FiO2, with
   subsequent weaning PEEP as tolerated.
    *Sedation: Yesterday increased dose of QHS Quetiapine and decreased
   frequency of Diazepam and Methadone due to decreased benzo clearance in
   the setting of ritonavir and elevated PaCO2. We can proceed with
   weaning Midazolam IV in favor of anxiety control with Diazepam (PO) to
   facilitate disposition. Also consider starting SSRI for long-term
   anxiety control; need to check interactions with other medications,
   especially HAART agents.
    * VAP: Completed 8 day course of vanco and cefepime/cipro 2 days ago;
   sputum cx negative.
   *PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 54**] ID, Bactrim DS [**Hospital1 7**] (prophylactic dosing) and taper steroids
   off (10mg x2 days, 5mg x2 days -->0). Ordered for CMV, Toxo antibodies.
   -Continue to attempt to slowly wean vent FiO2 setting, then PS and PEEP
   as tolerated.
   -Continue Quetiapine, Diazepam, and Methadone at current doses. Wean
   Midazolam as tolerated.
   -Follow up with pharm regarding interactions with SSRI and current
   medications.
   -Reduce Bactrim to DS QD.
   -Decrease steroids to 10 mg today and tomorrow.
   -Follow up CMV and toxo antibodies per ID.
   - [**Hospital1 **] prn clinical changes only.
   2) ANEMIA: Hct from 22 to 19.7 following 1 unit of PRBC yesterday, Hct
   25.4 today.  Otherwise generally stable around around 23-25. Baseline
   anemia likely due to HIV, stress, phlebotomy, nutrition suboptimal.
   - Continue QAM for CBC and electrolyes and Q2-3 days for LFTs to
   minimize phlebotomy.
   -Guaiaic stool.
   -Continue PPI [**Hospital1 7**].
   - Transfuse to > 21.
   3) LABILE BP: Continues to be hypertensive with agitation, occasionally
   hypotensive, responsive to fluids.  Continue to monitor. No pressors
   have been required for nearly 1 week.
   -Per above, continue Quetiapine, Methadone, Diazepam and wean Midazolam
   as tolerated.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed if needed for MAPs <60.
   -started lisinopril 10 mg PO QD.
   4) TRANSAMINITIS/PANCREATITIS: LFT
s persistently elevated, with lipase
   increased after propofol [**7-29**] but now trending down even after starting
   potentially hepatotoxic HAART regimen. Negative CT, negative RUQ
   ultrasound, no change in abdominal exam or reported pain.  Likely due
   to multiple medications.
    - Continue to trend LFTs, lipase, reduce frequency of labs.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g.day
   5) FEVERS: T within normal limits and clinical picture improved, last
   spiked on [**7-30**] with blood Cx pending, sputum cx negative on prelim
   read. C diff negative, stool culture pending.
   -Continue to monitor WBC.
   - Keep Acetaminophen under 2g daily due to transaminitis, as per above.
    6) Electrolye imbalances
 have been stable, phosphate slightly low
   this morning.  Will replete.
    -Continue to trend Mg and phosphate, replete as necessary.
    7) HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS) - recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable
   LFTs.  Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome.
   -Continue HAART
   -ID following.
   -Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   8)   URINE ELECTROLYTES: Ongoing autodiuresis.  Creatinine WNL, good
   UOP. Unclear etiology at this point, potentially due to solute
   diuresis.
   -Continue to follow UOP and Cr.
   -Negative fluid balance over past several days - fluid bolus for any
   signs of hypovolemia.
   9) FEN:
   -Continue tube feeds.
   -Discontinued ISS.
   -GJ tube placement with IR ordered and pending.
   10) PROPHYLAXIS: heparin UF SC, pneumoboots, PPI
   11) ACCESS:
   -Arterial Line - [**2196-7-11**] 12:32 PM. Consider removing A line after
   assessing for ABG-VBG PaO2 and SpO2 correlation.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recently diagnosed with HIV and PCP pneumonia. He developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intubation and ventilation, along with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has shown improvement after receiving antibiotics but continues to have difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sedation.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: This is likely secondary to PCP pneumonia and probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. The patient has been on Bactrim for PCP and has shown improvement.

2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been fluctuating between 19.7% and 25.4%. This is likely due to baseline anemia caused by HIV, stress, phlebotomy, and suboptimal nutrition.

3. Labile blood pressure: The patient is hypertensive with agitation and occasionally hypotensive. This is responsive to fluids, and no pressors have been required for nearly a week.

4. Transaminitis/pancreatitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are persistently elevated, along with an increased lipase level. However, a negative CT scan and RUQ ultrasound suggest that this may be due to multiple medications rather than an acute pancreatitis.

5. Fevers: The patient's temperature has been within normal limits,"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and is currently on mechanical ventilation support. The patient has a history of HIV and is being treated with HAART therapy. Other significant findings include hyperkalemia, anemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and sedation issues. The patient is also at risk for possible opportunistic infections due to HAART therapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory distress and is on mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to ARDS and pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, indicating an ongoing infection that could potentially lead to organ failure if not properly managed.
3. Opportunistic Infections: Due to the patient's HIV status and HAART therapy, there is a risk of developing opportunistic infections such as PJP (Pneumocystis pneumonia) or other infections related to immunosuppression.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which can be life-threatening and require immediate attention to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may require further investigation and treatment to improve oxygen-carrying capacity and overall health status.
6. Sedation Issues: The patient has been experiencing significant sedation issues requiring high doses of sedation"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. The chief complaint is respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with hyperkalemia, anemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, HIV, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. The patient requires intensive care unit (ICU) care and is on multiple medications including sedatives, antibiotics, and medications for HIV treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the presence of ARDS and respiratory failure, the patient is at risk for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or worsening of lung function.
2. Infection: As the patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction and pneumonia, there is a risk of developing new infections or having existing infections worsen.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's blood pressure readings show fluctuations, indicating potential cardiac issues. This could lead to cardiogenic shock or heart failure.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The elevated levels of potassium and lactic acid suggest possible renal dysfunction. Monitoring kidney function and managing electrolyte imbalances will be crucial.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may require blood transfusions or other interventions to manage.
6. HIV-related Complications: The patient has HIV, and treatment with HAART should be closely monitored for potential side effects or adverse reactions.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and provide appropriate medical interventions to prevent or manage these potential complications"

","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress. They are currently in the ICU and have been prescribed several medications including midazolam, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 124/63 to 181/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory distress. On physical examination, the patient is sedated, has fair air movement in their chest, and exhibits 2+ edema in their extremities. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 262 K/uL, blood glucose level of 88 mg/dL, and slightly elevated potassium levels of 5.5 mEq/L. Other lab results show normal levels of creatinine, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, but there are abnormalities in liver function tests.

The patient has been diagnosed with hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), anemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, HIV, pneumonia, and PJP. The patient is critically ill and their disposition is currently in the ICU."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions, including hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), anemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), pneumonia, and other PJP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). The patient is receiving ICU care, including arterial line and PICC line placement, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP, as well as communication with the patient's proxy and the patient themselves.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. It can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a systemic response to infection. If not treated promptly and effectively, sepsis can progress to septic shock and organ failure.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of pneumonia increases the risk of complications such as respiratory failure, lung abscesses, or empyema.
4. HIV/AIDS: The patient's HIV-positive status may make them more susceptible to opportunistic infections and other related complications.
5. Hyperkalemia: High levels of potassium in the blood can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which are potentially life-threatening.
6. Anemia: Severe anemia can result in inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues and organs, leading"

   CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. Sputum culture from [**7-30**] with
   sparse growth of orophargyngeal flora. Pt with trach.
   *Remained on PS 10, PEEP 10, FiO2 0.5, Rate 20. Stable ABG, so we can
   minimally wean vent settings.
   *Sedation: Methadone, Quetiapine, Diazepam, Clonidine (also for BP
   control). Midazolam and Fentanyl off. Given the decline in his mental
   status, we can further decrease the frequency of Diazepam (HAART meds
   are expected to reduce benzo metabolism) and Methadone. If needed to
   control anxiety, agitation, tachycardia and/or HTN, Midazolam can be
   restarted at minimal dose.
   *Off antibiotics for VAP, off treatment dose of bactrim, off steroids.
   Receiving prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin)
   - Continue to wean vent settings as tolerated, follow ABG with vent
   settings, clinical changes
   - Continue Quetiapine and Clonidine.
   - Decrease frequency of Methadone 20 mg from Q8H to Q12H. Decrease
   frequency of Diazepam from 10 mg Q8H to Q12H. Monitor for
   anxiety/agitation.
   - Bactrim DS Qdaily, Azithromycin 1200mg Qweekly
   - CXR for clinical changes
   - EKG for QTc (methadone, quetiapine, etc)
   # FEVERS: Febrile yesterday and overnight. Pan-cultured. WBC stable.
   Sputum gram stain showed gram positive rods, gram positive cocci in
   pairs but CXR stable/improved this AM. Ddx includes post-op fever vs.
   infection, but given the low suspicion for infection and no final

   increased sedation yesterday for procedure +/- cumulative effect of
   sedation in the setting of decreased clearance from HAART regimen vs.
   fevers (infection) vs pancreatitis.
   - Follow mental status throughout the day
   - Decreased sedation, as per above.
   - Follow up micro, as per above.
   - If remains depressed consider head CT, LP and/or CT torso if lipase
   continues to trend up.
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently elevated. LFTs stable but lipase
   with sudden increase after yesterday. In past has negative CT, negative
   RUQ u/s, no change in reported pain. Likely due to medication but
   specific etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] propofol yesterday. HAART may be
   hepatotoxic.
   - Trend LFT and lipase today. If stabilized, then check every 2-3 days
   to reduce phlebotomy.
   - Consider CT torso/RUQ u/s if lipase continues to trend upward.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g per day, as per above.
   # ANEMIA: Hct stable since transfusion two days prior, around baseline.
   Anemia likely due to HIV, phlebotomy, suboptimal nutrition. Phlebotomy
   minimized.

   Hemodynamically stable since then. Clonidine patch was started
   yesterday.  Given his recent normotensive status, we can discontinue
   lisinopril (renal function WNL).
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed or phenylephrine if needed for
   MAPs <60.
   -Continue Clonidine for BP control and helping with weaning of benzos.
   -D/C Lisinopril.
   # HIV: recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable LFTs.
   Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome. ID has signed off.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). He developed ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) requiring intubation and subsequently developed VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia). He has been receiving antibiotics for PCP and now requires prophylaxis for MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex). The patient is still experiencing difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sedation. He also has episodes of anxiety, which cause increased heart rate and blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to PCP pneumonia and probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
2. Fever: The patient has been febrile, and there is a suspicion of infection. However, no definitive sputum culture results have been obtained yet.
3. Mental Status Changes: The patient appears more sedated than before, which could be due to increased sedation from procedures, cumulative effect of sedation in the setting of decreased clearance from HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) regimen, or infection.
4. Anemia: The patient has stable hematocrit levels since transfusion two days prior, around baseline. Anemia is likely due to HIV, phlebotomy, suboptimal nutrition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recently diagnosed with HIV and PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). He developed ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) requiring intubation, and subsequently developed VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia). The patient has been treated with antibiotics and is currently improving. However, he continues to have difficulty weaning off the ventilator and sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of PCP pneumonia and is likely experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to the infection. The patient's ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) results indicate respiratory improvement, but careful monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
2. Fever: The patient has been febrile for the past day, and a sputum gram stain showed gram-positive rods and cocci in pairs. Cultures are pending, and the patient may require antibiotics if the fever persists.
3. Mental Status Changes: The patient appears more sedated than before, which could be related to increased sedation for a procedure, fevers, or other causes. Monitoring mental status and considering further investigations such as a head CT or LP (Lumbar Puncture) if the sedation remains depressed.
4. Elevated LFTs/Lipase: The patient has persistently elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and lipase levels. This may be"

   Assessment and Plan
   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, now improving after receiving a course of abx but with continued
   difficulty weaning from ventilator and sedation.  Respiratory,
   cardiovascular, and anxiety/sedation issues are all intertwined
   episodes of anxiety tend to cause increased HR and BP with worsened
   respiratory function.
    # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. Bactrim
   PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing, tapering prednisone.
   CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. Sputum culture from [**7-30**] with
   sparse growth of orophargyngeal flora. Pt with trach.
   *Remained on PS 10, PEEP 10, FiO2 0.5, Rate 20. Stable ABG, so we can
   minimally wean vent settings.
   *Sedation: Methadone, Quetiapine, Diazepam, Clonidine (also for BP
   control). Midazolam and Fentanyl off. Given the decline in his mental
   status, we can further decrease the frequency of Diazepam (HAART meds
   are expected to reduce benzo metabolism) and Methadone. If needed to
   control anxiety, agitation, tachycardia and/or HTN, Midazolam can be
   restarted at minimal dose.
   *Off antibiotics for VAP, off treatment dose of bactrim, off steroids.
   Receiving prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin)
   - Continue to wean vent settings as tolerated, follow ABG with vent
   settings, clinical changes
   - Continue Quetiapine and Clonidine.
   - Decrease frequency of Methadone 20 mg from Q8H to Q12H. Decrease
   frequency of Diazepam from 10 mg Q8H to Q12H. Monitor for
   anxiety/agitation.
   - Bactrim DS Qdaily, Azithromycin 1200mg Qweekly
   - CXR for clinical changes
   - EKG for QTc (methadone, quetiapine, etc)
   # FEVERS: Febrile yesterday and overnight. Pan-cultured. WBC stable.
   Sputum gram stain showed gram positive rods, gram positive cocci in
   pairs but CXR stable/improved this AM. Ddx includes post-op fever vs.
   infection, but given the low suspicion for infection and no final
   sputum cx reads, we will withhold abx for now.
   - Follow up culture results, add antibiotics as appropriate
   - Acetaminophen 2g max daily
   - Trend WBC, clinical status
   # MENTAL STATUS: appears more sedated than prior days. Ddx includes
   increased sedation yesterday for procedure +/- cumulative effect of
   sedation in the setting of decreased clearance from HAART regimen vs.
   fevers (infection) vs pancreatitis.
   - Follow mental status throughout the day
   - Decreased sedation, as per above.
   - Follow up micro, as per above.
   - If remains depressed consider head CT, LP and/or CT torso if lipase
   continues to trend up.
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently elevated. LFTs stable but lipase
   with sudden increase after yesterday. In past has negative CT, negative
   RUQ u/s, no change in reported pain. Likely due to medication but
   specific etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] propofol yesterday. HAART may be
   hepatotoxic.
   - Trend LFT and lipase today. If stabilized, then check every 2-3 days
   to reduce phlebotomy.
   - Consider CT torso/RUQ u/s if lipase continues to trend upward.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g per day, as per above.
   # ANEMIA: Hct stable since transfusion two days prior, around baseline.
   Anemia likely due to HIV, phlebotomy, suboptimal nutrition. Phlebotomy
   minimized.
   - CBC qAM
   - Guaiac stool
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Transfuse to > 21
   # LABILE BP: continues to be hypertensive with agitation, hypotension
   with increased sedation. Pressors for procedure but since D/C
   Hemodynamically stable since then. Clonidine patch was started
   yesterday.  Given his recent normotensive status, we can discontinue
   lisinopril (renal function WNL).
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed or phenylephrine if needed for
   MAPs <60.
   -Continue Clonidine for BP control and helping with weaning of benzos.
   -D/C Lisinopril.
   # HIV: recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable LFTs.
   Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome. ID has signed off.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin) per
   above.
   - Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
   # FEN: autodiuresis. Replete lytes as necessary. TF held for 24H

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. The patient has Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and HIV/AIDS. The patient is also experiencing hypotension and requires mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube.

The vital signs indicate a temperature of 38.3Â°C (101Â°F), heart rate ranging from 74 to 132 beats per minute, blood pressure between 107/59 mmHg and 171/93 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14 and 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's weight is currently 96.7 kg, and height is 66 inches.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,793 mL and output of 5,665 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3,872 mL. The patient is receiving various medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others.

Laboratory results reveal leukocytosis with white blood cell count ranging from 4.2 to 6.0 thousand/mmÂ³, decreased hemoglobin levels at 8.2 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 244 to 281 thousand/mmÂ³, and abnormal blood gas values with pH at 7.46 and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 168. Other lab results show elevated lactate levels and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The physical examination findings include fair air movement in the chest, no audible murmurs, soft distended abdomen, 2+ edema in the extremities, and weakness in the extremities. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode ventilation with set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and nosocomial infections due to the prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with ARDS respiratory failure in the setting of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS and has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned off sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure due to ARDS. There is a risk of worsening hypoxemia and the need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. There is a risk of progression to septic shock and multi-organ failure.
3. HIV/AIDS: The patient's underlying HIV/AIDS infection puts them at risk for opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and other infections related to immunosuppression.
4. ARDS Complications: ARDS can lead to complications such as acute lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis, and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.
5. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which requires close monitoring and management to ensure adequate tissue perfusion.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may require blood transfusion support.
7. Diuresis: The patient is producing"

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, now improving after receiving a course of abx but with continued
   difficulty weaning from ventilator and sedation.  Respiratory,
   cardiovascular, and anxiety/sedation issues are all intertwined
   episodes of anxiety tend to cause increased HR and BP with worsened
   respiratory function.
    # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. Bactrim
   PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing, tapering prednisone.
   CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. Sputum culture from [**8-3**] with
   sparse growth of orophargyngeal flora. Pt with trach.
   *Remained on PS 10, PEEP 10, FiO2 0.5, Rate 20. Stable ABG, resolution
   of mild alkalosis. Last PaO2 high, so we can minimally wean FiO2 and
   PEEP as tolerated today.
   * Increased thick yellow sputum raises suspicion for PNA in the setting
   of recent fever [**Last Name (LF) 1445**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] CXR this AM. Hold off on starting abx
   pending CXR and sputum Cx, given h/o consistently negative cultures.
   *Sedation: Methadone, Quetiapine, Diazepam, Clonidine (also for BP
   control). Midazolam boluses needed overnight. Because he continues to
   look sedated this AM but will likely become agitated overnight, we can
   D/C his QAM doses of Diazepam and Quietiapine but maintain his QPM
   doses. We can continue Midazolam boluses as needed to control anxiety.
   *Off antibiotics for VAP, off treatment dose of bactrim, off steroids.
   Receiving prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin)
   - Continue to wean vent settings as tolerated (FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated), follow ABG with vent settings, clinical changes.
   - CXR this AM.
   - Follow up cultures
   - D/C QAM Quetiapine and Diazepam. Continue QPM Quetiapine and
   Diazepam. Continue Methadone and Clonidine standing and Midazolam
   boluses prn.
   - Bactrim DS Qdaily, Azithromycin 1200mg Qweekly
   - EKG for QTc (methadone, quetiapine, etc)
   # FEVERS: Febrile to T102.2. Pan-cultured. WBC stable. Sputum cx from
   [**8-3**] with sparse oropharyngeal flora but increased sputum this AM. Ddx
   includes PCP/HIV vs. new pulm infection vs. new other infection (?
   lines) vs. abdominal process, but we will withhold abx for now pending
   CXR and Abd CT.
   - Sputum culture.
   - Abdominal CT today.
   - CXR per above.
   - Follow up culture results, add antibiotics as appropriate
   - Acetaminophen 2g max daily.
   - Trend WBC, clinical status.
   # MENTAL STATUS: Appears less sedated today but still groggy this AM.
   Ddx includes cumulative impact of sedation in the setting of decreased
   clearance from HAART vs. infection vs. abdominal process.
   - Follow mental status throughout the day.
   - D/C AM Diazepam and Quetiapine per above.
   - Follow up CXR, CT and micro, as per above.
   - If remains depressed consider head CT, LP.
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently elevated. LFTs stable but lipase
   with sudden increase on [**8-4**]. In past has negative CT, negative RUQ
   u/s, no change in reported pain. Likely due to medication but specific
   etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] propofol yesterday. HAART may be hepatotoxic. Will
   do abd CT today to rule out pancreatic/hepatobiliary process.
   - Abd CT today
   - Check LFT and lipase every 2-3 days to reduce phlebotomy.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g per day, as per above.
   # URINE ELECTROLYES: UNa 169, with 35 meq Na+ loss/L UOP and UOsm 450.
   Unclear etiology of Na+ wasting, with UOsm elevated such as seen in
   SIADH, but UNa output per L UOP is 35 (SIADH is generally above 40).
   Also, he is undergoing extensive diuresis and has hypotensive episodes,
   unlike in SIADH. Fluctuating blood pressure and sodium wasting may be
   consistent with adrenal insufficiency, potentially caused by infection
   vs.  ischemia/ hemorrhage in the adrenal gland. We did stop steroids
   for PCP abruptly but extensive diuresis pre-dated this drop. Generally,
   he has managed to maintain his serum sodium despite UNa loss.
   - Cortisol to assess adrenal insufficiency.
   - Sodium repletion if becomes hyponatremic.
   - Consider renal consult pending the results of above.
   # LABILE BP: continues to be hypertensive with agitation, hypotension
   with increased sedation and in the setting of significant diuresis (see
   above). Not requiring pressors.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed or phenylephrine if needed for
   MAPs <60.
   -Continue Clonidine for BP control and helping with weaning of benzos.
   # HIV: recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable LFTs.
   Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome. ID has signed off.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin) per
   above.
   - Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
    # ANEMIA: Hct stable since transfusion two days prior, around
   baseline. Anemia likely due to HIV, phlebotomy, suboptimal nutrition.
   Phlebotomy minimized.
   - CBC qAM
   - Guaiac stool
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Transfuse to > 21
   # FEN: With elevated Uosm and UNa excretion with significant
   autodiuresis, likely [**1-11**] SIAHD. Cause of SIADH unknown; potentially
   medication effect versus increased pain afferents. Consider water
   restriction, Replete lytes as necessary. TF held for 24H following GJ

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). He developed ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) requiring intubation and had superimposed VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia). The patient is currently improving but still has difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sedation. There are several potential medical complications that can arise, including hypoxic respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, mental status changes, liver function abnormalities, electrolyte imbalances, and labile blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of PCP pneumonia and probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. It is essential to monitor his oxygenation levels and ventilatory support requirements closely.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient has had intermittent fevers, and the source remains unclear. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of these fevers, including obtaining cultures and imaging studies.

3. Mental Status Changes: The patient appears less sedated but still groggy in the morning. This could be due to cumulative sedation effects, infection, or other factors. Monitoring his mental status and adjusting sedation medications accordingly is crucial.

4. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and persistently elevated lipase levels. These abnormalities may be related to medication hepatotoxicity"

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, now improving after receiving a course of abx but with continued
   difficulty weaning from ventilator and sedation.  Respiratory,
   cardiovascular, and anxiety/sedation issues are all intertwined
   episodes of anxiety tend to cause increased HR and BP with worsened
   respiratory function.
    # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
   Bactrim/prednisone PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing.
   CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. Sputum culture from [**8-3**] with
   sparse growth of orophargyngeal flora. Pt with trach.
   *Remained on PS 10, PEEP 10, FiO2 0.5, Rate 20. Stable ABG, resolution
   of mild alkalosis. Last PaO2 high, so we can minimally wean FiO2 and
   PEEP as tolerated today.
   * Increased thick yellow sputum raises suspicion for PNA in the setting
   of recent fever [**Last Name (LF) 1445**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] CXR this AM. Hold off on starting abx
   pending CXR and sputum Cx, given h/o consistently negative cultures.
   *Sedation: Methadone, Quetiapine, Diazepam, Clonidine (also for BP
   control). Midazolam boluses needed overnight. Because he continues to
   look sedated this AM but will likely become agitated overnight, we can
   D/C his QAM doses of Diazepam and Quietiapine but maintain his QPM
   doses. We can continue Midazolam boluses as needed to control anxiety.
   *Off antibiotics for VAP, off treatment dose of bactrim, off steroids.
   Receiving prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin)
   - Continue to wean vent settings as tolerated (FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated), follow ABG with vent settings, clinical changes.
   - CXR this AM.
   - Follow up cultures
   - D/C QAM Quetiapine and Diazepam. Continue QPM Quetiapine and
   Diazepam. Continue Methadone and Clonidine standing and Midazolam
   boluses prn.
   - Bactrim DS Qdaily, Azithromycin 1200mg Qweekly
   - EKG for QTc (methadone, quetiapine, etc)
   # FEVERS: Febrile to T102.2. Pan-cultured. WBC stable. Sputum cx from
   [**8-3**] with sparse oropharyngeal flora but increased sputum this AM. Ddx
   includes PCP/HIV vs. new pulm infection vs. new other infection (?
   lines) vs. abdominal process, but we will withhold abx for now pending
   CXR and Abd CT.
   - Sputum culture.
   - Abdominal CT today.
   - CXR per above.
   - Follow up culture results, add antibiotics as appropriate
   - Acetaminophen 2g max daily.
   - Trend WBC, clinical status.
   # MENTAL STATUS: Appears less sedated today but still groggy this AM.
   Ddx includes cumulative impact of sedation in the setting of decreased
   clearance from HAART vs. infection vs. abdominal process.
   - Follow mental status throughout the day.
   - D/C AM Diazepam and Quetiapine per above.
   - Follow up CXR, CT and micro, as per above.
   - If remains depressed consider head CT, LP.
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently elevated. LFTs stable but lipase
   with sudden increase on [**8-4**]. In past has negative CT, negative RUQ
   u/s, no change in reported pain. Likely due to medication but specific
   etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] propofol yesterday. HAART may be hepatotoxic. Will
   do abd CT today to rule out pancreatic/hepatobiliary process.
   - Abd CT today
   - Check LFT and lipase every 2-3 days to reduce phlebotomy.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g per day, as per above.
   # URINE ELECTROLYES: UNa 169, with 35 meq Na+ loss/L UOP and UOsm 450.
   Unclear etiology of Na+ wasting, with UOsm elevated such as seen in
   SIADH, but UNa output per L UOP is 35 (SIADH is generally above 40).
   Also, he is undergoing extensive diuresis and has hypotensive episodes,
   unlike in SIADH. Fluctuating blood pressure and sodium wasting may be
   consistent with adrenal insufficiency, potentially caused by infection
   vs.  ischemia/ hemorrhage in the adrenal gland. We did stop steroids
   for PCP abruptly but extensive diuresis pre-dated this drop. Generally,
   he has managed to maintain his serum sodium despite UNa loss.
   - Cortisol to assess adrenal insufficiency.
   - Sodium repletion if becomes hyponatremic.
   - Consider renal consult pending the results of above.
   # LABILE BP: continues to be hypertensive with agitation, hypotension
   with increased sedation and in the setting of significant diuresis (see
   above). Not requiring pressors.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed or phenylephrine if needed for
   MAPs <60.
   -Continue Clonidine for BP control and helping with weaning of benzos.
   # HIV: recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable LFTs.
   Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome. ID has signed off.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin) per
   above.
   - Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
    # ANEMIA: Hct stable since transfusion two days prior, around
   baseline. Anemia likely due to HIV, phlebotomy, suboptimal nutrition.
   Phlebotomy minimized.
   - CBC qAM
   - Guaiac stool
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]

   # FEN: With elevated Uosm and UNa excretion with significant

   look sedated this AM but will likely become agitated overnight, we can
   D/C his QAM doses of Diazepam and Quietiapine but maintain his QPM
   doses. We can continue Midazolam boluses as needed to control anxiety.
   *Off antibiotics for VAP, off treatment dose of bactrim, off steroids.
   Receiving prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin)
   - Continue to wean vent settings as tolerated (FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated), follow ABG with vent settings, clinical changes.
   - CXR this AM.
   - Follow up cultures
   - D/C QAM Quetiapine and Diazepam. Continue QPM Quetiapine and
   Diazepam. Continue Methadone and Clonidine standing and Midazolam
   boluses prn.
   - Bactrim DS Qdaily, Azithromycin 1200mg Qweekly
   - EKG for QTc (methadone, quetiapine, etc)
   # FEVERS: Febrile to T102.2. Pan-cultured. WBC stable. Sputum cx from
   [**8-3**] with sparse oropharyngeal flora but increased sputum this AM. Ddx
   includes PCP/HIV vs. new pulm infection vs. new other infection (?
   lines) vs. abdominal process, but we will withhold abx for now pending
   CXR and Abd CT.
   - Sputum culture.
   - Abdominal CT today.
   - CXR per above.
   - Follow up culture results, add antibiotics as appropriate
   - Acetaminophen 2g max daily.
   - Trend WBC, clinical status.
   # MENTAL STATUS: Appears less sedated today but still groggy this AM.
   Ddx includes cumulative impact of sedation in the setting of decreased
   clearance from HAART vs. infection vs. abdominal process.
   - Follow mental status throughout the day.
   - D/C AM Diazepam and Quetiapine per above.
   - Follow up CXR, CT and micro, as per above.
   - If remains depressed consider head CT, LP.
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently elevated. LFTs stable but lipase
   with sudden increase on [**8-4**]. In past has negative CT, negative RUQ
   u/s, no change in reported pain. Likely due to medication but specific
   etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] propofol yesterday. HAART may be hepatotoxic. Will
   do abd CT today to rule out pancreatic/hepatobiliary process.
   - Abd CT today
   - Check LFT and lipase every 2-3 days to reduce phlebotomy.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g per day, as per above.
   # URINE ELECTROLYES: UNa 169, with 35 meq Na+ loss/L UOP and UOsm 450.
   Unclear etiology of Na+ wasting, with UOsm elevated such as seen in
   SIADH, but UNaoutput per L UOP <40 (SIADH is generally above 40). Also,
   he is undergoing extensive diuresis and has hypotensive episodes,
   unlike in SIADH. Fluctuating blood pressure and Na wasting may be
   consistent with adrenal insufficiency, potentially caused by infection
   vs.  ischemia/ hemorrhage in the adrenal gland. We did stop steroids
   for PCP abruptly but extensive diuresis predated this drop. In
   generally, he has managed to maintain his serum electrolyte balance.
   - Cortisol to assess adrenal insufficiency.
   - Sodium repletion if becomes hyponatremic.
   - Consider renal consult pending the results of above.
   # LABILE BP: continues to be hypertensive with agitation, hypotension
   with increased sedation and in the setting of significant diuresis (see
   above). Not requiring pressors.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed or phenylephrine if needed for
   MAPs <60.
   -Continue Clonidine for BP control and helping with weaning of benzos.
   # HIV: recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable LFTs.
   Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome. ID has signed off.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin) per
   above.
   - Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
    # ANEMIA: Hct stable since transfusion two days prior, around
   baseline. Anemia likely due to HIV, phlebotomy, suboptimal nutrition.
   Phlebotomy minimized.

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). He developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) requiring intubation and tracheostomy, with superimposed Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently improving but continues to have difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sedation. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and anxiety/sedation issues are intertwined, with episodes of anxiety causing increased heart rate and blood pressure, as well as worsened respiratory function.

The patient's recent medical events include fever, hypotension, and increased lipase levels. Blood cultures were sent on 08/04, stool culture was also sent on the same day, and a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast is planned for the following day due to the increased lipase level and change in mental status.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, HIV, pneumonia, and acute lung injury. His current medications include Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis, azithromycin for MAC prophylaxis, methadone, quetiapine, diazepam, and clonidine.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and increased lipase levels. Imaging studies reveal no acute abnormalities in the knee. Fluid analysis indicates possible SIADH with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and recent diagnoses of HIV and PCP. He developed ARDS requiring intubation and had superimposed VAP. He received a course of antibiotics and is now improving but has difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sedation. There are intertwined respiratory, cardiovascular, and anxiety/sedation issues. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure likely secondary to PCP pneumonia and probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. He is on prophylaxis dosing of Bactrim for PCP and tapering prednisone. His CXR has improved, and leukocytosis has resolved. He has increased thick yellow sputum raising suspicion for PNA, so a CXR this morning is planned.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and experiencing multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), which may contribute to their susceptibility to infections. 

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever of 102.2Â°F (39Â°C), hypotension with blood pressure readings in the 50s, and tachycardia with a heart rate of 85 beats per minute. These symptoms suggest an ongoing infection or sepsis. 

The patient is also experiencing respiratory distress, as evidenced by coarse breath sounds bilaterally and the need for mechanical ventilation. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, PaO2 of 138 mmHg, and HCO3- of 25 mEq/L, indicating respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic compensation.

Laboratory results reveal hyponatremia (sodium level of 135 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (potassium level of 5.2 K/uL), and an elevated lactate level of 1.5 mmol/L, which could indicate tissue hypoperfusion or poor oxygenation. The elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 271 K/uL suggests an active infection.

Imaging studies show no acute abnormalities in the patient's right knee, and stool cultures have grown Clostridium difficile (C."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). He developed ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) requiring intubation and had superimposed VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia). The patient is improving after receiving a course of antibiotics but continues to have difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sedation. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and anxiety/sedation issues are intertwined, with episodes of anxiety causing increased heart rate and blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to PCP pneumonia and probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. The improvement in the patient's condition suggests that this complication may be resolving.
2. Fever: The patient has had recurrent fevers, which could be due to an ongoing infection or other causes such as medication reactions or inflammation. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
3. Anxiety/Sedation Issues: The patient has episodes of anxiety, which can worsen respiratory function and cause increased heart rate and blood pressure. Sedation is being used to manage these symptoms, but the patient continues to require midazolam boluses overnight.
4. Potential New Infection: The patient's increased sputum production raises suspicion for a new infection, possibly pneumonia. Cultures have been obtained,"

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, now improving after receiving a course of abx but with continued
   difficulty weaning from ventilator and sedation.  Respiratory,
   cardiovascular, and anxiety/sedation issues are all intertwined
   episodes of anxiety tend to cause increased HR and BP with worsened
   respiratory function.
    # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolving secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. Bactrim
   PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing, tapering prednisone.
   CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. Sputum culture from [**8-3**] with
   sparse growth of orophargyngeal flora. Pt with trach.
   *Remained on PS 10, PEEP 10, FiO2 0.5, Rate 20. Stable ABG, resolution
   of mild alkalosis. Last PaO2 high, so we can minimally wean FiO2 and
   PEEP as tolerated today.
   * Increased thick yellow sputum raises suspicion for PNA in the setting
   of recent fever [**Last Name (LF) 1445**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] CXR this AM. Hold off on starting abx
   pending CXR and sputum Cx, given h/o consistently negative cultures.
   *Sedation: Methadone, Quetiapine, Diazepam, Clonidine (also for BP
   control). Midazolam boluses needed overnight. Because he continues to
   look sedated this AM but will likely become agitated overnight, we can
   D/C his QAM doses of Diazepam and Quietiapine but maintain his QPM
   doses. We can continue Midazolam boluses as needed to control anxiety.
   *Off antibiotics for VAP, off treatment dose of bactrim, off steroids.
   Receiving prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin)
   - Continue to wean vent settings as tolerated (FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated), follow ABG with vent settings, clinical changes.
   - CXR this AM.
   - Follow up cultures
   - D/C QAM Quetiapine and Diazepam. Continue QPM Quetiapine and

   - Abdominal CT today.
   - CXR per above.
   - Follow up culture results, add antibiotics as appropriate
   - Acetaminophen 2g max daily.
   - Trend WBC, clinical status.
   # MENTAL STATUS: Appears less sedated today but still groggy this AM.
   Ddx includes cumulative impact of sedation in the setting of decreased
   clearance from HAART vs. infection vs. abdominal process.
   - Follow mental status throughout the day.
   - D/C AM Diazepam and Quetiapine per above.
   - Follow up CXR, CT and micro, as per above.
   - If remains depressed consider head CT, LP.
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently elevated. LFTs stable but lipase
   with sudden increase on [**8-4**]. In past has negative CT, negative RUQ
   u/s, no change in reported pain. Likely due to medication but specific
   etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] propofol yesterday. HAART may be hepatotoxic. Will
   do abd CT today to rule out pancreatic/hepatobiliary process.
   - Abd CT today
   - Check LFT and lipase every 2-3 days to reduce phlebotomy.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g per day, as per above.
   # URINE ELECTROLYES: UNa 169, with 35 meq Na+ loss/L UOP and UOsm 450.
   Unclear etiology of Na+ wasting, with UOsm elevated such as seen in
   SIADH, but UNaoutput per L UOP <40 (SIADH is generally above 40). Also,
   he is undergoing extensive diuresis and has hypotensive episodes,
   unlike in SIADH. Fluctuating blood pressure and Na wasting may be
   consistent with adrenal insufficiency, potentially caused by infection
   vs.  ischemia/ hemorrhage in the adrenal gland. We did stop steroids
   for PCP abruptly but extensive diuresis predated this drop. In
   generally, he has managed to maintain his serum electrolyte balance.
   - Cortisol to assess adrenal insufficiency.
   - Sodium repletion if becomes hyponatremic.
   - Consider renal consult pending the results of above.
   # LABILE BP: continues to be hypertensive with agitation, hypotension
   with increased sedation and in the setting of significant diuresis (see
   above). Not requiring pressors.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed or phenylephrine if needed for

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recently diagnosed with HIV, and new diagnosis of PCP. He developed ARDS requiring intubation and had superimposed VAP. The patient is now improving but continues to have difficulty weaning from the ventilator and sedation. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and anxiety/sedation issues are interconnected. Episodes of anxiety cause increased HR and BP with worsened respiratory function.

The patient's 24-hour events include fever, hypotension, and increased thick yellow sputum overnight. Mental status has improved throughout the day, with agitation and associated hypertension and tachycardia but no desaturation overnight. Blood cultures and stool culture were sent. Tylenol was given for fever. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast was ordered for increased lipase, fever, and change in mental status. 

The patient has a history of anemia, other, and hyperkalemia. He is currently on prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin). His current medications include pantoprazole, heparin sodium, midazolam, and others. The patient's recent lab results show elevated lipase levels and persistent leukocytosis. His urine electrolytes indicate Na+ wasting and Uosm 450. 

The patient's plan includes continuing to wean vent settings as tolerated,"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of ARDS PCP HIV. He is currently admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing fever, respiratory distress, and anemia. The patient has undergone various interventions, including tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation, and antibiotic therapy. He is also receiving HAART for his HIV infection and prophylactic medications for PJP and CMV. The patient's condition is stable, but there are concerns about potential complications such as pneumonia, abdominal issues, and possible drug interactions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and respiratory symptoms could indicate a possible pneumonia infection. This can be confirmed by obtaining cultures of blood and sputum, as well as performing chest X-rays and other imaging studies.
2. Abdominal issues: The patient's abdominal pain and elevated lipase levels suggest a possible abdominal problem, such as pancreatitis or diverticulitis. Further evaluation with an abdominal CT scan and monitoring of symptoms would be necessary.
3. Drug interactions: The patient is on multiple medications, including HAART, antibiotics, and antiretrovirals. There is a risk of drug interactions, which may affect the efficacy or safety of these medications. Close monitoring and adjustment of dosages may be required.
4. HIV-related complications: As an HIV-positive patient, the patient is at risk for opportunistic infections and other HIV-related complications, such as CMV infection or seps"

The patient's vital signs show fever, low blood pressure, and an elevated heart rate. The respiratory support indicates that the patient is on CPAP/PSV (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure/Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Breath) mode with a tracheostomy tube, and the oxygen delivery device is set to provide FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) at 50%.

The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with an ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) pH of 7.43.

The patient's nutritional status is compromised, as mentioned in the assessment. They are receiving tube feeding through Peptamen 1.5 at a rate of 30 mL/hour.

The patient's medical history includes anxiety, alteration in nutrition, anemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), HIV, pneumonia, and PJP. The patient is also at risk for DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) and VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia), and receives prophylaxis for these conditions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of ARDS, PCP, and HIV. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fever, respiratory distress, and other complications related to his underlying conditions. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. His vital signs include a temperature of 102.2 F, blood pressure ranging from 63-147 mmHg, heart rate of 81-120 bpm, respiratory rate of 10-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. He is receiving various medications including antibiotics, antiretrovirals, and prophylactic treatments for opportunistic infections. The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, and he is receiving total parenteral nutrition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition of ARDS puts him at risk for respiratory failure, which is already evident as he requires mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and worsening chest X-ray findings may suggest a possible pneumonia, which could further compromise his respiratory status.
3. Line Infections: The presence of multiple lines and tubes increases the risk of line-associated infections, which need to be monitored and prevented.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated lipase levels indicate"

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, slowly improving overall.  Now 4 weeks on ventilator, past week
   with trach.
    # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
   Bactrim/prednisone PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing.
   CXR improved. Sputum culture from [**8-3**] with sparse growth of
   orophargyngeal flora. Pt with trach.
   *Remained on PS 10, PEEP 10, FiO2 0.5, Rate 20. Stable ABG, resolution
   of mild alkalosis. Last PaO2 high, so we can minimally wean FiO2 and
   PEEP as tolerated today.
   *episode of hypoxia yesterday after CT, repeated desaturations while
   sitting in chair.  Also significantly sedated.  Suctioned several
   times, after which he improved.
   *Sedation: Methadone, Quetiapine, Diazepam, Clonidine DC-ed am
   quetiapine and diazepam yesterday due to excessive am sedation.
   Midazolam boluses as needed, but trying to wean.
   *Off antibiotics for VAP, off treatment dose of bactrim, off steroids.
   Receiving prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin)
   - Continue to wean vent settings as tolerated (FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated), follow ABG with vent settings, clinical changes.
   - CXR when clinically indicated.
   - Follow up cultures
   - Bactrim DS Qdaily, Azithromycin 1200mg Qweekly
   - EKG for QTc (methadone, quetiapine, etc)
   # FEVERS: Continued intermittent fevers. Pan-cultured. WBC stable.
   Sputum cx from [**8-3**] with sparse oropharyngeal flora. Ddx includes
   PCP/HIV vs. new pulm infection vs. new other infection (? lines) vs.
   abdominal process, have been holding abx.  CT yesterday negative, no
   new infiltrate on CXR.   Now blood culture from a-line growing Gram+
   cocci.  A-line dc-ed.
   - Sputum culture.
   - CXR per above.
   - Begin vanco.
   - Acetaminophen 2g max daily.
   - Trend WBC, clinical status.
   # MENTAL STATUS: Appears less sedated today after decreased sedative
   regimen yesterday.  Will continue to follow closely, attempt to wean
   sedatives, but without causing anxiety or respiratory distress.
   - Follow up CXR, CT and micro, as per above.
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently elevated. LFTs stable but lipase
   with sudden increase on [**8-4**]. In past has negative CT, negative RUQ
   u/s, no change in reported pain. Likely due to medication but specific
   etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] propofol yesterday. HAART may be hepatotoxic. CT
   negative yesterday.
   - Check LFT and lipase every 2-3 days to reduce phlebotomy.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g per day, as per above.
   # URINE ELECTROLYES: UNa 169, with 35 meq Na+ loss/L UOP and UOsm 450.
   Unclear etiology of Na+ wasting, with UOsm elevated such as seen in
   SIADH, but UNa output per L UOP is 35 (SIADH is generally above 40).
   Also, he is undergoing extensive diuresis and has hypotensive episodes,
   unlike in SIADH. Fluctuating blood pressure and sodium wasting may be
   consistent with adrenal insufficiency, potentially caused by infection
   vs.  ischemia/ hemorrhage in the adrenal gland. We did stop steroids
   for PCP abruptly but extensive diuresis pre-dated this drop. Generally,
   he has managed to maintain his serum sodium despite UNa loss.
   - Cortisol to assess adrenal insufficiency.
   - Sodium repletion if becomes hyponatremic.
   - Consider renal consult pending the results of above.
   # LABILE BP: continues to be hypertensive with agitation, hypotension
   with increased sedation and in the setting of significant diuresis (see
   above). Not requiring pressors.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension, Levophed or phenylephrine if needed for
   MAPs <60.
   -Continue Clonidine for BP control and helping with weaning of benzos.
   # HIV: recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable LFTs.
   Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome. ID has signed off.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin) per
   above.
   - Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
    # ANEMIA: Hct stable since transfusion, around baseline. Anemia likely
   due to HIV, phlebotomy, suboptimal nutrition. Phlebotomy minimized.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). He developed ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. He is also on prophylaxis for PCP and MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex). The patient has been on the ventilator for four weeks and has had tracheostomy placement. He is currently stable with improved oxygenation, but still requires assisted ventilation. His mental status is less sedated, and sedative regimen has been decreased. He has intermittent fevers, with recent blood culture growing Gram-positive cocci. His LFTs and lipase are elevated, and there is a concern for medication-induced hepatotoxicity. He has hyponatremia with sodium wasting, and his blood pressure is labile, fluctuating between hypertension and hypotension. He has been diagnosed with HIV and is on HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy). He has anemia, which is likely due to HIV, phlebotomy, and suboptimal nutrition. He is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's current plan includes weaning of sedatives, minimizing phlebotomy, continuing HAART, and monitoring for any potential complications."

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, now improving after receiving a course of abx but with continued
   difficulty weaning from ventilator and sedation.  Respiratory,
   cardiovascular, and anxiety/sedation issues are all intertwined
   episodes of anxiety tend to cause increased HR and BP with worsened
   respiratory function.
    # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
   Bactrim/prednisone PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing.
   CXR improved. Leukocytosis has resolved. Sputum culture from [**8-3**] with
   sparse growth of orophargyngeal flora. Pt with trach.
   *Remained on PS 10, PEEP 10, FiO2 0.5, Rate 20. Stable ABG, resolution
   of mild alkalosis. Last PaO2 high, so we can minimally wean FiO2 and
   PEEP as tolerated today.
   * Increased thick yellow sputum raises suspicion for PNA in the setting
   of recent fever [**Last Name (LF) 1445**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] CXR this AM. Hold off on starting abx
   pending CXR and sputum Cx, given h/o consistently negative cultures.
   *Sedation: Methadone, Quetiapine, Diazepam, Clonidine (also for BP
   control). Midazolam boluses needed overnight. Because he continues to
   look sedated this AM but will likely become agitated overnight, we can
   D/C his QAM doses of Diazepam and Quietiapine but maintain his QPM
   doses. We can continue Midazolam boluses as needed to control anxiety.
   *Off antibiotics for VAP, off treatment dose of bactrim, off steroids.
   Receiving prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin)
   - Continue to wean vent settings as tolerated (FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated), follow ABG with vent settings, clinical changes.
   - CXR this AM.
   - Follow up cultures
   - D/C QAM Quetiapine and Diazepam. Continue QPM Quetiapine and

   - Follow up culture results, add antibiotics as appropriate
   - Acetaminophen 2g max daily.
   - Trend WBC, clinical status.
   # MENTAL STATUS: Appears less sedated today but still groggy this AM.
   Ddx includes cumulative impact of sedation in the setting of decreased
   clearance from HAART vs. infection vs. abdominal process.
   - Follow mental status throughout the day.
   - D/C AM Diazepam and Quetiapine per above.
   - Follow up CXR, CT and micro, as per above.
   - If remains depressed consider head CT, LP.
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently elevated. LFTs stable but lipase
   with sudden increase on [**8-4**]. In past has negative CT, negative RUQ
   u/s, no change in reported pain. Likely due to medication but specific
   etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] propofol yesterday. HAART may be hepatotoxic. Will
   do abd CT today to rule out pancreatic/hepatobiliary process.
   - Abd CT today
   - Check LFT and lipase every 2-3 days to reduce phlebotomy.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and recent diagnosis of HIV and PCP, who developed ARDS requiring intubation and is now improving after receiving a course of antibiotics. He has difficulty weaning from the ventilator and continues to have sedation issues. The patient's respiratory, cardiovascular, and anxiety/sedation problems are intertwined, with episodes of anxiety causing increased heart rate and blood pressure along with worsened respiratory function.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxemic respiratory failure likely secondary to PCP pneumonia and probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. He also has hyperkalemia, anemia, hypotension (not in shock), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), and pneumonia.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continued weaning of ventilator settings, follow-up ABG with vent settings, clinical changes, and CXR. He is off antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), off treatment dose of Bactrim, and off steroids. He will continue on prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin).

Other assessments and plans include fever evaluation, mental status evaluation, liver function tests with elevated lipase, urine electrolytes with sodium wasting, labile blood pressure, HIV management, anemia management, and fluid and electrolyte balance management."

   PJP
   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, slowly improving overall.  Now 4 weeks on ventilator, past week
   with trach.  Improving slowly.
    # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
   Bactrim/prednisone PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing.
   CXR improved. Sputum culture from [**8-3**] with sparse growth of
   orophargyngeal flora. Pt with trach.
   *Remained on PS 10, PEEP 10, FiO2 0.5, Rate 20. Stable ABG, resolution
   of mild alkalosis. Last PaO2 high, so we can minimally wean FiO2 and
   PEEP as tolerated today.
   *episode of hypoxia yesterday after CT, repeated desaturations while
   sitting in chair.  Also significantly sedated.  Suctioned several
   times, after which he improved.  Stable during the day yesterday.
   *Sedation: Methadone, Quetiapine, Diazepam, Clonidine DC-ed am
   quetiapine and diazepam yesterday due to excessive am sedation.
   Midazolam boluses as needed, but trying to wean.
   *Off antibiotics for VAP, off treatment dose of bactrim, off steroids.
   Receiving prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin)
   - Continue to wean vent settings as tolerated (FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated), follow ABG with vent settings, clinical changes.
   - CXR when clinically indicated.
   - Follow up cultures
   - Bactrim DS Qdaily, Azithromycin 1200mg Qweekly
   - EKG for QTc (methadone, quetiapine, etc)
   # FEVERS: Continued intermittent fevers. Pan-cultured. WBC stable.
   Sputum cx from [**8-3**] with sparse oropharyngeal flora. Ddx includes
   PCP/HIV vs. new pulm infection vs. new other infection (? lines) vs.
   abdominal process, have been holding abx.  CT yesterday negative, no
   new infiltrate on CXR.   Now blood culture from a-line growing Gram+
   cocci.  A-line dc-ed.
   - Sputum culture.
   - CXR per above.
   - Begin vanco.
   - Acetaminophen 2g max daily.
   - Trend WBC, clinical status.
   # MENTAL STATUS: Appears less sedated today after decreased sedative
   regimen yesterday.  Will continue to follow closely, attempt to wean
   sedatives, but without causing anxiety or respiratory distress.
   - Follow up CXR, CT and micro, as per above.
   -Continue to wean sedatives as tolerated.   Today reduce methadone dose
   from 20 to 10, Q12.
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently elevated. LFTs stable but lipase
   with sudden increase on [**8-4**]. In past has negative CT, negative RUQ
   u/s, no change in reported pain. Likely due to medication but specific
   etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] propofol yesterday. HAART may be hepatotoxic. CT
   negative yesterday.
   - Check LFT and lipase every 2-3 days to reduce phlebotomy.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g per day, as per above.
   # URINE ELECTROLYES: UNa 169, with 35 meq Na+ loss/L UOP and UOsm 450.
   Unclear etiology of Na+ wasting, with UOsm elevated such as seen in
   SIADH, but UNa output per L UOP is 35 (SIADH is generally above 40).
   Also, he is undergoing extensive diuresis and has hypotensive episodes,
   unlike in SIADH. Fluctuating blood pressure and sodium wasting may be
   consistent with adrenal insufficiency, potentially caused by infection
   vs.  ischemia/ hemorrhage in the adrenal gland. We did stop steroids
   for PCP abruptly but extensive diuresis pre-dated this drop. Generally,
   he has managed to maintain his serum sodium despite UNa loss.
   - Cortisol stim test to assess adrenal insufficiency.
   - Sodium repletion if becomes hyponatremic.
   - Consider renal consult pending the results of above.
   # LABILE BP: recurrent episodes of hypertension, improved recently,
   with agitation, hypotension with increased sedation and in the setting
   of significant diuresis (see above). Not requiring pressors.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension.
   -Continue Clonidine for BP control and helping with weaning of benzos.
   # HIV: recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable LFTs.
   Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome. ID has signed off.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin) per
   above.
   - Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
    # ANEMIA: Hct stable since transfusion, around baseline. Anemia likely
   due to HIV, phlebotomy, suboptimal nutrition. Phlebotomy minimized.
   - CBC qAM
   - Guaiac stool
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Transfuse to > 21
   # FEN: autodiuresis now improved, will continue to follow. TF restarted
   with PEG tube placement. Can restart this afternoon. Follow chem and
   UOP. Not on ISS.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of HIV, who presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and a probable resolved secondary pneumonia. He has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation for four weeks and has tracheostomy in place. The patient is improving slowly but remains dependent on the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS has resulted in severe hypoxemia, requiring mechanical ventilation. Weaning of ventilator settings should be done cautiously based on the patient's ABG results and clinical status.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Despite improvement, the patient is still at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged intubation. Regular sputum cultures and chest X-rays will be performed to monitor for any signs of infection.
3. Fever and potential infections: The patient continues to have intermittent fevers, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Blood cultures have grown Gram-positive cocci, and empiric vancomycin therapy has been started. Further investigations are needed to identify the causative organism.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure and sodium wasting suggest the possibility of adrenal insufficiency. A cortisol stimulation test will be performed to assess adrenal function.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to HIV, phlebotomy, and subopt"

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, slowly improving overall.  Now 4 weeks on ventilator, past week
   with trach.  Improving slowly.
   .
    # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
   Bactrim/prednisone PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing.
   CXR improved. Sputum culture from [**8-3**] with sparse growth of
   orophargyngeal flora. Pt with trach.
   *Remained on PS 10, PEEP 10, FiO2 0.5, Rate 20. Stable ABG, resolution
   of mild alkalosis. Last PaO2 high, so we can minimally wean FiO2 and
   PEEP as tolerated today.
   *Off antibiotics for VAP, off treatment dose of bactrim, off steroids.
   Receiving prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin), vanc
   for line infection.
   - Continue to wean vent settings as tolerated (FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated), follow ABG with vent settings or clinical changes.
   - CXR when clinically indicated.
   - Follow up cultures
   - Bactrim DS Qdaily, Azithromycin 1200mg Qweekly
   - EKG for QTc (methadone, quetiapine, etc)
   .
   # FEVERS: Continued intermittent fevers. Pan-cultured. WBC stable.
   Sputum cx from [**8-3**] with sparse oropharyngeal flora. Ddx includes
   PCP/HIV vs. new pulm infection vs. new other infection vs. abdominal
   process, have been holding abx.  CT yesterday negative, no new
   infiltrate on CXR.   Now blood culture from a-line growing Gram+
   cocci.  A-line dc-ed.
   - Vanc (day 2)
   - follow up cultures
   - Tylenol 2g max daily
   - Trend WBC, clinical status
   .
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently elevated. LFTs stable but lipase
   with sudden increase on [**8-4**]. In past has negative CT, negative RUQ
   u/s, no change in reported pain. Likely due to medication but specific
   etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] propofol yesterday. HAART may be hepatotoxic. CT
   negative yesterday.
   - Check LFT and lipase every 2-3 days to reduce phlebotomy.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g per day, as per above.
   .
    # MENTAL STATUS: Appears less sedated today after decreased sedative
   regimen yesterday.  Will continue to follow closely, attempt to wean
   sedatives, but without causing anxiety or respiratory distress.
   Improved.
   - Follow clinical status
   - Wean sedatives as tolerated
   .
   # URINE ELECTROLYES: UNa 169, with 35 meq Na+ loss/L UOP and UOsm 450.
   Unclear etiology of Na+ wasting, with UOsm elevated such as seen in
   SIADH, but UNa output per L UOP is 35 (SIADH is generally above 40).
   Also, he is undergoing extensive diuresis and has hypotensive episodes,
   unlike in SIADH. Fluctuating blood pressure and sodium wasting may be
   consistent with adrenal insufficiency, potentially caused by infection
   vs.  ischemia/ hemorrhage in the adrenal gland. We did stop steroids
   for PCP abruptly but extensive diuresis pre-dated this drop. Generally,
   he has managed to maintain his serum sodium despite UNa loss. Cortisol
   stim test negative.
   - Sodium repletion if becomes hyponatremic
   .
   # LABILE BP: recurrent episodes of hypertension, improved recently,
   with agitation, hypotension with increased sedation and in the setting
   of significant diuresis (see above). Not requiring pressors.
   - Fluid bolus for hypotension.
   - Continue Clonidine for BP control and helping with weaning of benzos.
   .
   # HIV: recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable LFTs.
   Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome. ID has signed off.
    - Continue HAART
   - Continue prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin) per
   above.
   - Follow LFTs q2-3 days given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART
   regimen.
   .
    # ANEMIA: Hct stable since transfusion, around baseline. Anemia likely
   due to HIV, phlebotomy, suboptimal nutrition. Phlebotomy minimized.
   - CBC qAM
   - Guaiac stool
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Transfuse to > 21

   # FEN: autodiuresis now improved, will continue to follow. TF restarted
   with PEG tube placement. Can restart this afternoon. Follow chem and
   UOP. Not on ISS.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). He developed ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) requiring intubation and tracheostomy placement. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for 4 weeks and has shown slow improvement overall.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure due to ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. His chest X-ray has improved, and sputum culture from 8/3 showed sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora.

The patient's recent events include intermittent fevers with pan-cultured results. His WBC count is stable, and he has been off antibiotics for VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia). Blood culture from the arterial line is growing Gram-positive cocci. The patient's LFTs and lipase levels are persistently elevated, but lipase suddenly increased on 8/4. CT scan yesterday was negative, and the cause of elevated lipase is unclear, possibly due to medication or HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy).

The patient's mental status has improved after decreasing sedative regimen yesterday. He appears less sedated today. His urine electrolytes show sodium wasting and elevated osmolarity, suggesting possible adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's labile blood pressure is"

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, slowly improving overall.  Now 4 weeks on ventilator, past week
   with trach.  Improving slowly.

    # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
   Bactrim/prednisone PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing.
   CXR improved. Sputum culture from [**8-3**] with sparse growth of
   orophargyngeal flora. Pt with trach.
   *Remained on PS 10, PEEP 10, FiO2 0.5, Rate 20. Stable ABG, resolution
   of mild alkalosis. Last PaO2 high, so we can minimally wean FiO2 and
   PEEP as tolerated today.
   *Off antibiotics for VAP, off treatment dose of bactrim, off steroids.
   Receiving prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin), vanc
   for line infection.
   - Continue to wean vent settings as tolerated (FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated), follow ABG with vent settings or clinical changes.
   - CXR when clinically indicated.

   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently elevated. LFTs stable but lipase
   with sudden increase on [**8-4**]. In past has negative CT, negative RUQ
   u/s, no change in reported pain. Likely due to medication but specific
   etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] propofol yesterday. HAART may be hepatotoxic. CT
   negative yesterday.
   - Check LFT and lipase every 2-3 days to reduce phlebotomy.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g per day, as per above.

    # MENTAL STATUS: Appears less sedated today after decreased sedative
   regimen yesterday.  Will continue to follow closely, attempt to wean

   # URINE ELECTROLYES: UNa 169, with 35 meq Na+ loss/L UOP and UOsm 450.
   Unclear etiology of Na+ wasting, with UOsm elevated such as seen in
   SIADH, but UNa output per L UOP is 35 (SIADH is generally above 40).
   Also, he is undergoing extensive diuresis and has hypotensive episodes,
   unlike in SIADH. Fluctuating blood pressure and sodium wasting may be
   consistent with adrenal insufficiency, potentially caused by infection
   vs.  ischemia/ hemorrhage in the adrenal gland. We did stop steroids
   for PCP abruptly but extensive diuresis pre-dated this drop. Generally,
   he has managed to maintain his serum sodium despite UNa loss. Cortisol
   stim test negative.

   # LABILE BP: recurrent episodes of hypertension, improved recently,
   with agitation, hypotension with increased sedation and in the setting

   - Fluid bolus for hypotension.
   - Continue Clonidine for BP control and helping with weaning of benzos.
   .
   # HIV: recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable LFTs.
   Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome. ID has signed off.
    - Continue HAART

   above.
   - Follow LFTs q2-3 days given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART
   regimen.
   .
    # ANEMIA: Hct stable since transfusion, around baseline. Anemia likely
   due to HIV, phlebotomy, suboptimal nutrition. Phlebotomy minimized.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). He developed ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) requiring intubation and tracheostomy placement, as well as superimposed VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia). The patient has been on HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) for HIV, prophylaxis for PCP and MAC (Azithromycin), and vancomycin for line infection. He continues to improve slowly and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. Close monitoring of ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) values and weaning of FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated is important to prevent further respiratory failure.
2. Fevers: The patient has intermittent fevers with pan-cultured blood cultures. A line infection was suspected, but the blood culture from the arterial line is growing Gram-positive cocci. This could indicate a new pulmonary infection or another source of infection. Follow-up cultures and trend WBC are necessary to determine the cause and guide further treatment.
3. LFTs/Lipase: The patient has persistently elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and lipase levels. While the"

   VAP, slowly improving overall.  Now 4 weeks on ventilator, past week
   with trach.  Improving slowly. Recently, pt has been febrile.
   # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
   Bactrim/prednisone PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing.
   CXR improved. Pt with trach.
    *PS 10, PEEP 8, FiO2 0.5, Rate 20. follow abg, we can minimally wean
   FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated today.
    *Sedation: Methadone, Quetiapine, Diazepam, Clonidine DC-ed am
   quetiapine and diazepam yesterday due to excessive am sedation.
   Midazolam boluses as needed, but trying to wean.
    *Off antibiotics for VAP, off treatment dose of bactrim, off steroids.
   Receiving prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin)
   -continue ppx c  Bactrim DS Qdaily, Azithromycin 1200mg Qweekly
   - EKG for QTc (methadone, quetiapine, etc)
    # FEVERS: Continued intermittent fevers. Pan-cultured. WBC stable. Ddx
   includes PCP/HIV vs. new pulm infection vs. new other infection (?
   lines) vs. abdominal process, have been holding abx.  CT yesterday
   negative, no new infiltrate on CXR.   Now blood culture from a-line
   growing Gram+ cocci.  A-line dc-ed, cx of aline pending.
   - Sputum cultures all c resp contam.
   - vanc d/ced yesterday
   - Acetaminophen 2g max daily.
   - Trend WBC, clinical status.
   -consider asking ID to weigh in
   # MENTAL STATUS: Appears less sedated today after decreased sedative
   regimen yesterday.  Will continue to follow closely, attempt to wean
   sedatives, but without causing anxiety or respiratory distress.
   - Follow up CXR, CT and micro, as per above.
   -Continue to wean sedatives as tolerated.
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently mildily elevated. LFTs stable but
   lipase with sudden increase on [**8-4**]. In past has negative CT, negative
   RUQ u/s, no change in reported pain. Likely due to medication but
   specific etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] propofol yesterday. HAART may be
   hepatotoxic. CT negative yesterday.
   - Check LFT and lipase every 2-3 days to reduce phlebotomy.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g per day, as per above.
   # URINE ELECTROLYES: UNa 169, with 35 meq Na+ loss/L UOP and UOsm 450.
   Unclear etiology of Na+ wasting, with UOsm elevated such as seen in
   SIADH, but UNa output per L UOP is 35 (SIADH is generally above 40).
   Also, he is undergoing extensive diuresis and has hypotensive episodes,
   unlike in SIADH. Fluctuating blood pressure and sodium wasting may be
   consistent with adrenal insufficiency, potentially caused by infection
   vs.  ischemia/ hemorrhage in the adrenal gland. We did stop steroids
   for PCP abruptly but extensive diuresis pre-dated this drop. Generally,
   he has managed to maintain his serum sodium despite UNa loss.
   - Cortisol stim test to assess adrenal insufficiency was wnl.
   - Sodium repletion if becomes hyponatremic.
   - Consider renal consult pending the results of above.
   # LABILE BP: recurrent episodes of hypertension, improved recently,
   with agitation, hypotension with increased sedation and in the setting
   of significant diuresis (see above). Not requiring pressors.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension (no hypotension in past 24 hours).
   -Continue Clonidine for BP control and helping with weaning of benzos.
   # HIV: recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable LFTs.
   Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome. ID has signed off.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin) per
   above.
   - Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
    # ANEMIA: Hct stable since transfusion, around baseline. Anemia likely
   due to HIV, phlebotomy, suboptimal nutrition. Phlebotomy minimized.
   - CBC qAM
   - Guaiac stool
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Transfuse to > 21
   # FEN: autodiuresis now improved, will continue to follow. TF restarted
   with PEG tube placement. Can restart this afternoon. Follow chem and
   UOP. Not on ISS.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). He was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and required intubation due to ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for four weeks and tracheostomy for one week. He is currently febrile and has been experiencing chills and lung pain. The patient's recent blood cultures have shown growth of Gram-positive cocci from the arterial line, and sputum cultures are pending.

The patient's mental status has improved after decreasing sedative medications. His LFTs (Liver Function Tests) and lipase levels are elevated, with a sudden increase in lipase on 08/04. The etiology of the elevated lipase is unclear, possibly due to medication or HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy). The patient's urine electrolytes show sodium wasting with a UNa output of 35 meq/L, indicating potential adrenal insufficiency. A cortisol stimulation test was performed, which came back within normal limits.

The patient's blood pressure has been labile, with episodes of hypertension and hypotension. His HIV status was recently diagnosed, and he has started on HAART with stable LFTs. His respiratory status has improved, but he remains on ventilatory support. The patient's anemia is likely due to HIV, ph"

   Also, he is undergoing extensive diuresis and has hypotensive episodes,
   unlike in SIADH. Fluctuating blood pressure and sodium wasting may be
   consistent with adrenal insufficiency, potentially caused by infection
   vs.  ischemia/ hemorrhage in the adrenal gland. We did stop steroids
   for PCP abruptly but extensive diuresis pre-dated this drop. Generally,
   he has managed to maintain his serum sodium despite UNa loss.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of HIV and PCP pneumonia. He has been in the ICU for about four weeks, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently febrile, with intermittent fevers, and has been experiencing chills and lung pain.

The patient's vital signs show an increased heart rate (113 bpm), high respiratory rate (30 breaths per minute), and low blood pressure (138/85 mmHg). His oxygen saturation is at 96%. The patient's mental status is impaired, likely due to sedative medications, but he appears less sedated today.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 6.5 K/uL, and normal platelet count. Blood cultures are pending, and imaging studies show considerable residual airspace disease in the lungs but no new consolidation.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxemic respiratory failure, hyperkalemia, ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, HIV, and pneumonia. He is also experiencing anxiety, impaired airway clearance, impaired gait, impaired knowledge, impaired ventilation, and impaired transfers.

The patient's plan of care includes weaning off sedatives, minimizing phlebotomy, limiting acetaminophen intake, following LFT and lip"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). They are currently admitted to the ICU and require mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of immunocompromised status and is being treated for HIV with HAART therapy. There is an ongoing investigation of fevers, with cultures taken and antibiotics held. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, mild hypotension, and elevated temperature. Fluid balance and oxygenation are being closely monitored. The patient is receiving nutrition through enteral feeding and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's neurological status is not assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and cultures will be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin should be continued.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and mechanical ventilation. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) prophylaxis should be continued to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Nosocomial infections: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with respiratory failure due to ARDS from PCP. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing prolonged fevers. His vital signs include a temperature of 103.2 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and nosocomial infections. The patient's immune system is compromised due to HIV infection and HAART therapy, which increases the risk of opportunistic infections.

Further evaluation and monitoring are necessary to identify any potential complications and provide appropriate treatment."

   PJP
   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, slowly improving overall.  Now 4 weeks on ventilator, past week
   with trach.  Improving slowly. Recently, pt has been febrile.
   # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
   Bactrim/prednisone PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing.
   CXR improved. Pt with trach.
    *PS 10, PEEP 8, FiO2 0.5, Rate 20. follow abg, we can minimally wean
   FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated today.
    *Sedation: Methadone, Quetiapine, Diazepam, Clonidine DC-ed am
   quetiapine and diazepam yesterday due to excessive am sedation.
   Midazolam boluses as needed, but trying to wean.
    *Off antibiotics for VAP, off treatment dose of bactrim, off steroids.
   Receiving prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin)
   -continue ppx c  Bactrim DS Qdaily, Azithromycin 1200mg Qweekly
   - SBT today
    # FEVERS: Continued intermittent fevers. Pan-cultured. WBC stable. Ddx
   includes PCP/HIV vs. new pulm infection vs. new other infection (?
   lines) vs. abdominal process, have been holding abx.  CT yesterday
   negative, no new infiltrate on CXR.   Now blood culture from a-line
   growing Gram+ cocci.  A-line dc-ed, cx of aline pending.
   - Sputum cultures all c resp contam.
   - vanc d/ced yesterday
   - Acetaminophen 2g max daily.
   - Trend WBC, clinical status.
   -will reconsult ID
   # MENTAL STATUS: Appears less sedated today after decreased sedative
   regimen yesterday.  Will continue to follow closely, attempt to wean
   sedatives, but without causing anxiety or respiratory distress.
   - Follow up CXR, CT and micro, as per above.
   -Continue to wean sedatives as tolerated.
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently mildily elevated. LFTs stable but
   lipase with sudden increase on [**8-4**]. In past has negative CT, negative
   RUQ u/s, no change in reported pain. Likely due to medication but
   specific etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] propofol yesterday. HAART may be
   hepatotoxic. CT negative yesterday.
   - Check LFT and lipase every 2-3 days to reduce phlebotomy.
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g per day, as per above.
   # URINE ELECTROLYES: UNa 169, with 35 meq Na+ loss/L UOP and UOsm 450.
   Unclear etiology of Na+ wasting, with UOsm elevated such as seen in
   SIADH, but UNa output per L UOP is 35 (SIADH is generally above 40).
   Also, he is undergoing extensive diuresis and has hypotensive episodes,
   unlike in SIADH. Fluctuating blood pressure and sodium wasting may be
   consistent with adrenal insufficiency, potentially caused by infection
   vs.  ischemia/ hemorrhage in the adrenal gland. We did stop steroids
   for PCP abruptly but extensive diuresis pre-dated this drop. Generally,
   he has managed to maintain his serum sodium despite UNa loss.
   - Cortisol stim test to assess adrenal insufficiency was wnl.
   - Sodium repletion if becomes hyponatremic.
   - Consider renal consult pending the results of above.
   # LABILE BP: recurrent episodes of hypertension, improved recently,
   with agitation, hypotension with increased sedation and in the setting
   of significant diuresis (see above). Not requiring pressors.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension (no hypotension in past 24 hours).
   -Continue Clonidine for BP control and helping with weaning of benzos.
   # HIV: recent diagnosis. HAART recently started, with stable LFTs.
   Stable to improved respiratory status with no signs of immune
   reconstitution inflammation syndrome. ID has signed off.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin) per
   above.
   - Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
    # ANEMIA: Hct stable since transfusion, around baseline. Anemia likely
   due to HIV, phlebotomy, suboptimal nutrition. Phlebotomy minimized.
   - CBC qAM
   - Guaiac stool
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Transfuse to > 21
   # FEN: autodiuresis now improved, will continue to follow. TF restarted
   with PEG tube placement. Can restart this afternoon. Follow chem and
   UOP. Not on ISS.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and recent diagnosis of HIV. He presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for four weeks, with recent improvement in his respiratory status.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxemia, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired airway clearance, impaired gait, impaired ventilation, impaired transfers, anxiety, hyperkalemia, anemia, hypotension, ARDS, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and HIV.

The patient's recent events include intermittent fevers, positive blood culture growing Gram+ cocci, sputum cultures all showing respiratory contaminants, discontinuation of vancomycin, and initiation of HAART therapy for HIV.

The patient's ongoing assessments and plans are as follows:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Continue to wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated.
2. Fever: Trend WBC, clinical status, and continue to hold antibiotics.
3. Mental status: Continue to follow closely and attempt to wean sedatives.
4. LFTs/Lipase: Check every 2-3 days to reduce phlebotomy, limit acetaminophen to 2g per day, and consider renal consult.
5. Urine electrolytes: Monitor sodium re"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-inch, 89.7 kg male with a history of HIV/AIDS, who presented with septic shock secondary to pneumonia. He was intubated and admitted to the ICU for management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and potential non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues including hyperkalemia, hypotension, anemia, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired airway clearance, impaired gait, impaired ventilation, impaired transfers, anxiety, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He also has a history of HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, and potential PJP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's current condition of acute respiratory distress syndrome poses a significant risk for further respiratory complications such as worsening hypoxemia, need for increased ventilatory support, or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Sepsis: Despite initial improvement, the patient remains at risk for recurrent or progressive sepsis due to his compromised immune system and ongoing infection.
3. HIV/AIDS: The patient's underlying HIV/AIDS condition increases the risk of opportunistic infections, such as PJP, and other HIV-related complications.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness, requiring close monitoring and potential interventions.
5. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin"

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, now slowly improving.  Now 4 weeks on ventilator, now transitioned
   to trach.  Improving slowly but with persistent fevers without clear
   source.
   # HYPOXEMIC [**Name10 (NameIs) **] FAILURE: ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
   Bactrim/prednisone PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing.
   CXR improved. Pt with trach.
   -Pressure support now [**9-12**], gradually improving.
   -Continuing to wean sedation
 methadone dose decreased yesterday.
   Needed 2 midazolam boluses yesterday.
   - Still on Bactrim and azithromycin for prophylaxis, vancomycin now
   dc-ed, A-line culture came back negative.
   -continue ppx, wean sedation.
   - SBT today
 tolerated trach collar for several hours
   yesterday.
    # FEVERS in setting of low CD4: Continued intermittent fevers,
   pan-cultured with no clear source. WBC stable.  A-line culture
   negative, and temperature continuing after pulling line.  DDx in light
   of low CD4- Infectious vs. malignancy?
   -Continue to follow cultures closely
   -ID consulted-said to consider IRS.
   - Sputum cultures all c resp contam.
   - vanc d/ced yesterday
   - Acetaminophen 2g max daily.
   - Trend WBC, clinical status.
   # MENTAL STATUS: Increasingly alert, but still with periods of
   agitation, usually concurrent with fever.
   - Follow up CXR, CT and micro, as per above, rule out infectious
   causes.
   -Continue to wean sedatives as tolerated, but cautiously given high
   requirements and likely tolerance. Will attempt to taper
   methadone/clonidine.
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently elevated. Likely due to medication
   but specific etiology unclear.  Negative RUQ US and CT previously.
   Possible medication effect.  Have been trending LFT
s, gradually
   trending downward though still elevated.
   - Continue to trend LFT
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g per day, as per above.
   -Consider further imaging if warranted by clinical change.
   # URINE ELECTROLYES: Had been concerned for autodiuresis, possible
   SIADH.  Cortisol stim test was normal, now urine output reduced,
   actually low yesterday, responsive to fluid bolus.  Fluid balance even
   yesterday, creatinine WNL.
   - Will start free water flushes with tube feeds
   - Sodium repletion if becomes hyponatremic.
   - Continue to follow I/O
s - monitor renal function.
   - Consider renal consult pending the results of above.
   # LABILE BP: More stable recently, will given fluid bolus for
   hypotension.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension (no hypotension in past 24 hours).
   -Continue Clonidine for BP control and helping with weaning of benzos.
   # HIV: on HAART, with elevated but stable LFTs.  Receiving
   Bactrim/azithro prophylaxis.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin) per
   above.
   - Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
    # ANEMIA: Hct stable since transfusion, around baseline. Anemia likely
   due to HIV, phlebotomy, suboptimal nutrition.  Will try to minimize
   phlebotomy as possible.
   - CBC qAM
   - Guaiac stool
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of PCP pneumonia. He developed ARDS requiring intubation and tracheostomy, with superimposed VAP. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for 4 weeks and is slowly improving. He continues to have intermittent fevers without a clear source, despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics. His mental status is increasingly alert but still agitated, especially during fevers. The patient has stable vital signs, although his blood pressure can be labile at times. He has anemia due to HIV, phlebotomy, and suboptimal nutrition. His LFTs are elevated but trending downward. The patient is on HAART for HIV, Bactrim/azithromycin prophylaxis, and receiving tube feeds through a PEG tube. There are concerns for potential complications such as sepsis, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, and possible malignancy given his low CD4 count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has persistent fevers and is pan-cultured with no clear source. This raises concern for ongoing infection and potential sepsis.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a high potassium level, which can be dangerous and may require medical intervention to lower it.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's urine output was previously low"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of prolonged [**remove confidential information**] failure due to ARDS from PCP. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fevers, which have not improved despite holding antibiotics. The patient has tolerated tracheostomy collar trials and will have another attempt today. Methadone weaning is planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent fevers and the need for mini-BAL indicate a possible ongoing infection. Cultures are pending, but it is essential to monitor for any signs of worsening infection, such as increased fever, changes in sputum color or quantity, or new onset of symptoms.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team is implementing measures to prevent VAP, including elevating the head of bed, performing mouth care, and ensuring regular spontaneous breathing trials.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. The patient is receiving prophylactic therapy with boots and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to his critical illness. Proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis is being administered to prevent this complication.
5. HIV management: The patient is now on HAART therapy for HIV"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). He developed ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) requiring intubation and had superimposed VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia). He has been on mechanical ventilation for 4 weeks, now transitioned to tracheostomy. The patient is slowly improving but continues to have persistent fevers without a clear source.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. This condition is likely due to the underlying PCP infection and the respiratory distress it caused.
2. Fever in Setting of Low CD4: The patient has intermittent fevers despite negative cultures, indicating a possible ongoing infection or malignancy, especially considering his low CD4 count.
3. Mental Status Changes: The patient has periods of agitation, usually concurrent with fever, indicating potential delirium or altered mental status.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to HIV, phlebotomy, and suboptimal nutrition.
5. Labile Blood Pressure: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which may be due to sepsis, autodiuresis, or SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion).
6. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has persistently elevated LFTs, possibly due to medication side effects or other causes.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient may have hyponatremia due to SIADH or autodiuresis.
8. HIV Infection: The patient is on HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) for HIV management.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for PCP and MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex) infections due to his immunocompromised state.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided medical progress note. Further evaluation and testing may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, now slowly improving.  Now 4 weeks on ventilator, now transitioned
   to trach.  Improving slowly but with persistent fevers without clear
   source.
    # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
   Bactrim/prednisone PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing.
   CXR improved. Pt with trach.
   -Pressure support now [**9-12**], gradually improving.
   -Continuing to wean sedation as tolerated.
   - Still on Bactrim and azithromycin for prophylaxis
   -continue ppx, wean sedation.
   - SBT today
 tolerated trach collar for several hours
   yesterday.
    # FEVERS in setting of low CD4: Continued intermittent fevers,
   pan-cultured with no clear source. WBC stable.  A-line culture
   negative, and temperature continuing after pulling line.  DDx in light
   of low CD4- Infectious vs. malignancy?
   -Continue to follow cultures closely
   -ID consulted-said to consider IRS.
   - Sputum cultures all c resp contam, miniBAL c PMNs no bugs, cx
   pending.
   - Acetaminophen 2g max daily.
   - Trend WBC, clinical status.
   # MENTAL STATUS: Increasingly alert, but still with periods of
   agitation, usually concurrent with fever.
   - Follow up CXR, CT and micro, as per above, rule out infectious
   causes.
   -Continue to wean sedatives as tolerated, but cautiously given high
   requirements and likely tolerance. Will attempt to taper
   methadone/clonidine. Methadone decreased to 5 [**Hospital1 7**] yesterday, will taper
   to 5 daily
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently elevated. Likely due to medication
   but specific etiology unclear.  Negative RUQ US and CT previously.
   Possible medication effect.  Have been trending LFT
s, gradually
   trending downward though still elevated.
   - Continue to trend LFT
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g per day, as per above.
   -Consider further imaging if warranted by clinical change.
   # URINE ELECTROLYES: Had been concerned for autodiuresis, possible
   SIADH.  Cortisol stim test was normal, now urine output reduced,
   actually low yesterday, responsive to fluid bolus.  Fluid balance even
   yesterday, creatinine WNL.
   - Will start free water flushes with tube feeds
   - Sodium repletion if becomes hyponatremic.
   - Continue to follow I/O
s - monitor renal function.
   - Consider renal consult pending the results of above.
   # LABILE BP: More stable recently, will given fluid bolus for
   hypotension.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension (no hypotension in past 24 hours).
   -Continue Clonidine for BP control and helping with weaning of benzos.
   # HIV: on HAART, with elevated but stable LFTs.  Receiving
   Bactrim/azithro prophylaxis.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin) per
   above.
   - Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
    # ANEMIA: Hct stable since transfusion, around baseline. Anemia likely
   due to HIV, phlebotomy, suboptimal nutrition.  Will try to minimize
   phlebotomy as possible.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension and recent diagnoses of HIV and PCP, has been in the ICU for an extended period of time. He initially developed ARDS requiring intubation and now has superimposed VAP. The patient is slowly improving but still experiences persistent fevers without a clear source. He is currently on a tracheostomy and has been on mechanical ventilation for four weeks.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology is a significant concern. This condition may continue to affect his oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Fevers in setting of low CD4: The patient has intermittent fevers despite being on prophylactic antibiotics. With a low CD4 count, there is a concern for either an infectious or malignant cause. Further investigations are needed to identify the source of the fever.

3. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of agitation, especially during fevers. This could be due to various factors such as sepsis, medication effects, or delirium.

4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolytes are abnormal, including hyperkalemia. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent complications related to these imbalances.

5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely multifactorial, including HIV"

   45M with h/o HTN with recent diagnosis of HIV and new diagnosis of PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, now slowly improving.  Now 4 weeks on ventilator, now transitioned
   to trach.  Improving slowly but with persistent fevers without clear
   source.
    # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
   Bactrim/prednisone PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing.
   CXR improved. Pt with trach.
   -Pressure support now [**9-12**], gradually improving.
   -Continuing to wean sedation as tolerated.
   - Still on Bactrim and azithromycin for prophylaxis
   -continue ppx, wean sedation.
   - SBT today
 tolerated trach collar for several hours
   yesterday.
    # FEVERS in setting of low CD4: Continued intermittent fevers,
   pan-cultured with no clear source. WBC stable.  A-line culture
   negative, and temperature continuing after pulling line.  DDx in light
   of low CD4- Infectious vs. malignancy?
   -Continue to follow cultures closely
   -ID consulted-said to consider IRS.
   - Sputum cultures all c resp contam, miniBAL c PMNs no bugs, cx
   pending.
   - Acetaminophen 2g max daily.
   - Trend WBC, clinical status.
   # MENTAL STATUS: Increasingly alert, but still with periods of
   agitation, usually concurrent with fever.
   - Follow up CXR, CT and micro, as per above, rule out infectious
   causes.
   -Continue to wean sedatives as tolerated, but cautiously given high
   requirements and likely tolerance. Will attempt to taper
   methadone/clonidine. Methadone decreased to 5 [**Hospital1 7**] yesterday, will taper
   to 5 daily
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently elevated. Likely due to medication
   but specific etiology unclear.  Negative RUQ US and CT previously.
   Possible medication effect.  Have been trending LFT
s, gradually
   trending downward though still elevated.
   - Continue to trend LFT
   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g per day, as per above.
   -Consider further imaging if warranted by clinical change.
   # URINE ELECTROLYES: Had been concerned for autodiuresis, possible
   SIADH.  Cortisol stim test was normal, now urine output reduced,
   actually low yesterday, responsive to fluid bolus.  Fluid balance even
   yesterday, creatinine WNL.
   - Will start free water flushes with tube feeds
   - Sodium repletion if becomes hyponatremic.
   - Continue to follow I/O
s - monitor renal function.
   - Consider renal consult pending the results of above.
   # LABILE BP: More stable recently, will given fluid bolus for
   hypotension.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension (no hypotension in past 24 hours).
   -Continue Clonidine for BP control and helping with weaning of benzos.
   # HIV: on HAART, with elevated but stable LFTs.  Receiving
   Bactrim/azithro prophylaxis.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin) per
   above.
   - Follow LFTs given potential hepatotoxicity of HAART regimen.
    # ANEMIA: Hct stable since transfusion, around baseline. Anemia likely
   due to HIV, phlebotomy, suboptimal nutrition.  Will try to minimize
   phlebotomy as possible.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and a new diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). He developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) requiring intubation and tracheostomy, with superimposed Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for 4 weeks and is slowly improving. He continues to have persistent fevers without a clear source.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology. He is on Bactrim and azithromycin prophylaxis. The patient's mental status is increasingly alert but still with periods of agitation, usually concurrent with fever.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). Blood cultures are pending. Imaging studies reveal an essentially unchanged chest X-ray (CXR).

The patient's assessment and plan include hypoxemia, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired airway clearance, impaired gait, impaired knowledge, impaired ventilation, impaired transfers, anxiety, hyperkalemia, anemia, hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, HIV, pneumonia, and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with prolonged failure due to ARDS from PCP. He continues to have fever spikes, but the fever curve is trending down. Mini-BAL culture is pending, and antibiotics have been held. The patient is experiencing neck tenderness, and a neck CT will be checked. It is possible that the fevers are due to immune reconstitution. The patient is on HAART for HIV and has completed a course of Bactrim/steroids for PCP. The patient is receiving nutrition through Peptamen 1.5 at a rate of 50 mL/hour. Glycemic control measures are in place. The patient has a PICC line and is receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. HOB elevation and mouth care are being implemented to prevent VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and he remains in the ICU. The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing nosocomial pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and immobility. Measures such as HOB elevation and mouth care are being implemented to prevent VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylaxis measures, including heparin sodium, have been initiated to prevent DVT.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 45-year-old male with prolonged ICU failure due to ARDS from PCP. He is currently being treated with therapeutic management trials for his condition. The patient's fever has been spiking, but the fever curve is trending downwards. Mini-BAL culture is pending, and antibiotics have been withheld. Neck tenderness is present, and a neck CT scan is being considered. It is possible that the fevers are due to immune reconstitution.

The patient is now on HAART for HIV management, and prophylaxis with Bactrim and azithromycin is being given. The patient received a course of Bactrim/steroids for PCP treatment.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving Peptamen 1.5 (Full) at 50 mL/hour for nutrition. Glycemic control is being maintained, and multiple lines are in place, including a PICC line. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention through elevation of the head of bed and mouth care.

The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU."

   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, now slowly improving.  4 weeks on ventilator, now transitioned to
   trach.  Improving slowly but with persistent fevers without clear
   source.
    # HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
   Bactrim/prednisone PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing.
   CXR improved. Pt with trach collar x 24 hrs, no vent.
   -Continuing to wean sedation as tolerated.
   - Still on Bactrim and azithromycin for prophylaxis
   - vent off for now.
    # FEVERS in setting of low CD4: Continued intermittent fevers,
   pan-cultured with no clear source. WBC stable.  A-line culture
   negative, and temperature continuing after pulling line.  DDx in light
   of low CD4- Infectious vs. malignancy?
   -Continue to follow cultures closely

   # MENTAL STATUS: Increasingly alert, but still with periods of
   agitation, usually concurrent with fever.
   - Follow up CXR, CT and micro, as per above, rule out infectious
   causes.
   -Continue to wean sedatives as tolerated, but cautiously given high
   requirements and likely tolerance. Will attempt to taper
   methadone/clonidine. Methadone decreased yesterday, midaz off and
   diazepam decreased yesterday as well so will not taper further today.
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently elevated. Negative RUQ US and CT
   previously. Possible medication effect.  Have been trending LFT
   gradually trending downward though still elevated.
   - Continue to trend LFT

   - Limit Acetaminophen to 2g per day, as per above.
   -Consider further imaging if warranted by clinical change.
   # LABILE BP: More stable recently, will given fluid bolus for
   hypotension.
   -Fluid bolus for hypotension (no hypotension in past 24 hours).
   -Continue Clonidine for BP control and helping with weaning of benzos.
   # HIV: on HAART, with elevated but stable LFTs.  Receiving
   Bactrim/azithro prophylaxis.
   - Continue HAART
   - Continue prophylaxis for PCP (Bactrim) and MAC (Azithromycin) per

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). He developed ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has been on the ventilator for 4 weeks, transitioned to a tracheostomy, and is slowly improving. He continues to have intermittent fevers without a clear source, and his CD4 count is low. The patient is on prophylactic medications for PCP and MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex), as well as HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) for HIV management. He also has axillary thrush and yeast infection, for which fluconazole is being continued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia may lead to ongoing respiratory distress and failure.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient continues to have intermittent fevers despite appropriate antibiotic coverage, which could indicate an underlying infection or malignancy, especially considering his low CD4 count.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to HIV, phlebotomy, and suboptimal nutrition. Regular monitoring and transfusion may be required.
4. Hiccups: The patient is experiencing hiccups, which need to be addressed to prevent aspiration and improve comfort.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). He developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. He has been on the ventilator for 4 weeks and is now transitioned to a tracheostomy. The patient is showing slow improvement but still has persistent fevers without a clear source.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
3. Sepsis: The patient's intermittent fevers and negative cultures suggest a possible ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent cardiac complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia, which may be due to HIV, phlebotomy, and suboptimal nutrition.
6. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has persistently elevated liver enzymes, which may be related to medication effects or other underlying conditions.
7. HIV-related infections: The patient's immune status puts him at risk for opportunistic infections, such as PJP (P"

3. Anemia: The patient has stable hemoglobin levels since transfusion, around baseline. Anemia is likely due to HIV, phlebotomy, and suboptimal nutrition.
4. Mental Status: The patient is increasingly alert but still experiences periods of agitation, usually concurrent with fever.
5. Labile Blood Pressure: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable but more stable recently.
6. Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has persistently elevated LFTs, which may be due to medication effect. Imaging studies have ruled out infectious causes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with prolonged [**Telephone/Fax (2) **] failure due to ARDS from PCP. He is currently on tracheal mask ventilation and doing well. The patient has been experiencing fevers, and there is sinus opacification noted. Further antibiotics have been withheld for now. The patient is also being treated for HIV with HAART and has completed a course of Bactrim/steroids for PCP. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Regular chest x-rays and sputum cultures should be done to monitor for any signs of infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin should be continued.
3. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to ARDS and HIV infection, making him more susceptible to nosocomial infections. Frequent monitoring of vital signs and regular surveillance cultures can help identify any potential infections early.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged ICU stay. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) prophylaxis should be continued.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's"

   [**Name10 (NameIs) 4784**] developed ARDS requiring intubation, with superimposed
   VAP, now slowly improving.  4 weeks on ventilator, now transitioned to
   trach.  Very much improved, tolerating trach mask, but having recurrent
   unexplained fevers and continued anxiety.
    # RECOVERING RESPIRATORY FAILURE: ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
   Bactrim/prednisone PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing.
   CXR improved. Pt with trach collar now, no vent.
   -Continuing to wean anxiolytics as tolerated.
   - Still on Bactrim and azithromycin for prophylaxis.
    # FEVERS in setting of low CD4: Continued intermittent fevers,
   pan-cultured with no clear source. WBC stable.  A-line culture
   negative, and temperature continuing after pulling line.  DDx in light
   of low CD4- Infectious vs. malignancy?  CT neck to investigate reported
   pain, no infectious source seen.  Evidence for chronic sinusitis, but
   nothing acute, not likely source.   Could also be IRS.  Fevers improved
   yesterday.
   -Continue to follow cultures closely
   -ID consulted
 do not recommend further interventions currently.
   - Sputum cultures all c resp contam, miniBAL c PMNs no bugs, cx resp
   flora.
   - Acetaminophen 2g max daily.

   # MENTAL STATUS: Increasingly alert, but still with periods of anxiety,
   usually concurrent with fever.  Also occasionally confused, disoriented
   as above.
   - Follow up final cultures as above.
   -Carefully weaning sedative medications given previous history of
   anxiety and very large doses over the past month.
   # LFTs/Lipase: LFTs and persistently elevated. Negative RUQ US and CT
   previously. Possible medication effect.  Have been trending LFT
   gradually trending downward though still elevated.  Lipase elevated
   further this morning.
   -Lipase elevated this morning
 difficult to interpret
 has had
   persistently elevated LFT

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia). He developed ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) requiring intubation and tracheostomy, and is currently improving. The patient has recurrent unexplained fevers and anxiety. He is on prophylaxis for PCP and MAC (Azithromycin). His HIV is being treated with HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy), but his LFTs (Liver Function Tests) are elevated. The patient also has anemia, likely due to HIV, phlebotomy, and suboptimal nutrition. There are no clear sources of infection, but possible causes include infectious or malignancy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent unexplained fevers - could indicate an ongoing infection or another underlying condition.
2. Anxiety - may be related to the patient's current medical condition and hospitalization.
3. Hiccups - could be caused by irritation of the diaphragm or nerve damage.
4. Abdominal pain - could be related to medication side effects, organ dysfunction, or another underlying condition.
5. Elevated LFTs and lipase - may indicate liver or pancreatic dysfunction.
6. Anemia - could be due to chronic disease, nutritional deficiencies, or blood loss.
7. Potential for further respiratory complications - given the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of PCP who developed ARDS requiring intubation and subsequent VAP. He has been on a ventilator for 4 weeks and is now transitioned to a tracheostomy. He shows signs of improvement but continues to have recurrent unexplained fevers and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels, which can be a result of ARDS and ventilation issues.
2. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level, which may be due to HIV, phlebotomy, or suboptimal nutrition.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated potassium levels, which may be caused by kidney dysfunction or medications.
4. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing ongoing anxiety, which could be related to the recent events, prolonged ICU stay, or medication side effects.
5. Fever: The patient has intermittent fevers despite negative cultures, indicating a possible ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
6. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be due to medication hepatotoxicity, HIV, or other underlying conditions.
7. Potential Drug Allergies: The patient has a reported allergy to sulfa drugs (Bactrim) but no other known drug allergies.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the provided progress note."

   trach.  Very much improved, tolerating trach mask, but having recurrent
   unexplained fevers and continued anxiety.
    # RECOVERING RESPIRATORY FAILURE: ARDS secondary to PCP pneumonia and
   probable resolved secondary pneumonia with ARDS physiology.
   Bactrim/prednisone PCP treatment complete, now on prophylaxis dosing.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension, recent diagnosis of HIV, and new diagnosis of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). He developed ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) requiring intubation and was later transitioned to a tracheostomy. The patient is slowly improving but is experiencing recurrent unexplained fevers and continued anxiety.

24-hour events include a fever of 101.2Â°F, CMV viral load ordered, and the patient's readiness to eat assessed. The patient received Ativan for anxiety and may be transferred to hospital rehab tomorrow. The infectious disease team does not believe that sinusitis is the source of infection. The patient reported abdominal pain, but the examination was reassuring. 

Medical history includes a previous episode of elevated lipase/amylase levels. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient is receiving prophylaxis with Bactrim and azithromycin.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,172 mL and output of 1,390 mL. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4Â°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/63 mmHg to 157/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a tracheostomy mask.

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia, anemia, hyperkalemia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of prolonged [**Telephone/Fax (3) **] failure due to ARDS from PCP. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes HIV and he is now on HAART therapy. He also has elevated lipase levels but is tolerating tube feeds. 

The patient's vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 100.4Â°C, a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/84 mmHg to 157/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight has decreased from 97.7 kg at admission to 89.7 kg currently.

The patient's lab results show a low white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and slightly elevated platelet count. The creatinine level is within normal range, as well as electrolyte levels. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, and decreased albumin level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by following proper ventilation hygiene practices and regular assessment of respiratory secretions.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): P"
