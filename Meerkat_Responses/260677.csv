   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol use disorder (ETOH) presenting with confusion, fevers, and cough. She has been diagnosed with acute liver failure, likely due to etoh hepatitis, and her MELD score is 26. The patient is also experiencing encephalopathy, which may be related to liver failure and possible etoh abuse. 

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Acute liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count indicate acute liver failure. This condition can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and decreased synthetic function of the liver.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and sluggish pupils suggest hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can progress to deep coma and is associated with a high mortality rate if not treated promptly.

3. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient has received ceftriaxone for possible SBP. SBP is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis and can lead to infection and sepsis if not treated.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may indicate hypotension. Hypotension in this context could be due to liver dysfunction or sepsis.

5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's laboratory results show metabolic acidosis, which"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of etoh cirrhosis presenting with confusion, fevers, and cough. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently critically ill.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/67 to 143/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 37.4 degrees Celsius.

The patient's physical examination reveals several findings, including sluggish pupils, normal breath sounds with no crackles or rhonchi, soft and distended abdomen with an enlarged spleen, trace edema in both lower extremities, muscle wasting, and warm skin. Neurologically, the patient responds to noxious stimuli and shows non-purposeful movement with decreased tone.

The patient's lab results indicate a low white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), high bilirubin levels, low albumin, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The blood glucose level is within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Acute liver failure - likely due to etoh hepatitis, with a MELD score of 26.
   - Repeat hepatitis viral studies.
   - Repeat abdominal ultrasound with tap.
   - Continue ceftriaxone for possible SBP.
   - Trend LFTs every 6 hours.

2. Hypotension and metabolic acidosis - appears less likely infectious but will rule this out.
   - IR-guided para for SBP.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures.

3. Encephalopathy - likely due to [**3-10**] liver failure and possible etoh abuse.
   - Head CT.
   - Rifaxamin.
   - Lactulose as tolerated.

4. ETOH - continue CIWA scale with ativan.
   - Thiamine, folate.
   - Tox screen.

5. Elevated CK - likely [**3-10**] muscle breakdown.
   - No significant EKG changes.
   - Normal troponins.

6. Electrolyte abnormalities - will replete as necessary.

The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to the patient's liver failure, there is a risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status and confusion.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and low white blood cell count, there is a risk of developing SBP, which can cause fever, abdominal pain, and signs of infection.
3. Hypotension and shock: The patient's low blood pressure and metabolic acidosis may indicate hypotension and shock, which can be life-threatening if not promptly addressed.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and if it worsens, it can lead to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
5. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an underlying infection, which can rapidly progress and become severe if not appropriately managed.
6. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and prolonged prothrombin time indicate a risk of bleeding, especially if invasive procedures are required.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications if not corrected promptly.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's condition and promptly address any potential complications that may arise."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver, alcohol abuse, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. He was admitted to the ICU and received various treatments including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, sedatives, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. Fluid balance shows a positive balance of 866 mL and negative balance of -479 mL. The patient's lab results indicate abnormal liver function tests, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated lactate levels. The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line, and is on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and altered mental status, hepatic encephalopathy is a possibility. This condition occurs due to the liver's inability to remove toxins from the blood, leading to neurological symptoms.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an infection. In the ICU setting, patients are at increased risk for various infections, such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections, or urinary tract infections.
3. Fluid overload: The positive fluid balance indicates that the patient may be experiencing fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory function.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 year old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, hypokalemia,
   hypomagnesemia and orthostatic hypotension who presents with confusion,
   fevers, lactate elevation and worse hepatic failure.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Failure:  Patient previously with preserved synthetic
   function.  Most likely etiology is acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   Ultrasound with poor study but patent vasculature and no overt ascites
   noted.  Lactate raises concern for infection although may be related to
   liver failure. Discriminate function is 63.  Estimated mortality given
   her degree of elevation in the presence of encephatlopathy is on the
   order of 45%. MELD score now 26 range.
   .
   - f/up blood and urine cultures
   - f/up final CXR read
   - repeat hepatitis viral serologies
   - liver consult
   - hold off on steroids for now while r/o infections
   - continue on lactulose TID
   - IR guided paracentesis in morning / check for SBP
   - + rifaximin
   - continue on IV CTX for SBP while pending work-up
   - social work consult
   - repeat ABD US in a.m with IR
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy with
   positive asterixis and in setting of acute hepatic failure
   - Q2hr neuro checks
   - CT head
   #SIRS/Sepsis:  Elevated lactate, tachycardiac, tachypneic, liver
   failure all concerning for sepsis/SIRS.  Not currently hypotensive and
   no elevated WBC which is reassuring. [**Month (only) 11**] all be related to liver
   failure/alcoholic hepatitis as well. No evidence of biliary source per
   ultrasound although poor study.
   - send off UA, urine cultures
   - repeat lactate/ABG
   - f/up CXR, blood cultures, plan a paracentesis tomorrow
   - continue on ceftriaxone
   - continue IVFs overnight / keep MAPs >65
   - keep UOP >30cc/hr
   - consider repeat RUQ US given poor ED study
   .
   #Elevated CK: Per patient's sister her fiance uses cocaine and she
   feels the patient has also been using.EKGs with no overt elevations but
   nonspecific TW changes differ from prior EKGs. Patient denies [**Last Name (un) **] pain
   but also very confused and limited historian. Given tachycardia may be
   secondary to demand ischemia as well. No known CAD per prior records.
   .
   -repeat EKG
   -check TTE in morning
   -trend enzymes x 3 sets
   -will add on cocaine urine levels
   .
   #Electrolyte Abnormalities:  Previously attributed to alcoholism, poor
   nutrition and renal electrolyte wasting secondary to alcohol. She has
   longstanding low Mg and low K as outpatient. Changes likely from
   acutely worse liver failure.
   - aggressive repletion for now
   - replete Phosphorus
   - given IV Ca gluconate, IV 2mg Mg x1 and PO K 40mEq x 2 on admission
   .
   #Alcohol Abuse:  Current alcohol use per family.  History of withdrawal
   but no known DTs or seizures. At high risk for withdrawal now as last
   drink yesturday.
   - Ativan CIWA
   - thiamine, folate, MVI
   .
   #Anemia:  Hematocrit 25 from baseline of 30, likely related to alcohol
   abuse and liver failure although history of bloody stools is
   concerning.
   - active type and screen
   - stool guaiacs
   - consider vitamin K for elevated INR
   .
   #Conjunctivitis: Eyes with bilateral yellowish-green thick secretions
   along conjunctivae.
   -erythromycin eye ointment QID
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #peripheral neuropathy
   - holding gabapentin for now given sedated
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and orthostatic hypotension. She presents with confusion, fevers, lactate elevation, and worsening hepatic failure. The most likely etiology of acute hepatic failure is acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's MELD score is 26, indicating a high risk of mortality.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hepatic Failure: The patient's worsening hepatic function suggests acute hepatic failure, which can lead to liver dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and positive asterixis indicate hepatic encephalopathy, a brain disorder caused by liver dysfunction. It can lead to altered mental status, coma, and other neurological complications.
3. Infection: Elevated lactate levels raise concern for infection, which can be a common and severe complication in patients with liver failure. Infections can be caused by bacteria or other pathogens and may require prompt antibiotic treatment.
4. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient's ascites and elevated white blood cell count increase the risk of SBP, a bacterial infection of the peritoneal fluid. This condition can lead to sepsis and other serious complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 year old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, hypokalemia,
   hypomagnesemia and orthostatic hypotension who presents with confusion,
   fevers, lactate elevation and worse hepatic failure.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Failure:  Patient previously with preserved synthetic
   function.  Most likely etiology is acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   Ultrasound with poor study but patent vasculature and no overt ascites
   noted.  Lactate raises concern for infection although may be related to
   liver failure. Discriminate function is 63 on admit.  Estimated
   mortality given her degree of elevation in the presence of
   encephatlopathy is on the order of 45%. MELD score now 24
   - continue steroids
   - place dophoff, start feeds
   - trend LFTs q6h, synthetic function
   - liver recs appreciated
   - if no evidence of infection by tomorrow DC ceftriaxone
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH
   withdrawal. CT head without evidence fo bleed
   - continue lactulose and refiaximin
   - Q2hr neuro checks
   # EtoH withdrawal
   - ativan drip to max 8mg/hr, add propofol if needed
   - basal fentanyl @25/hr
   - start haldol 2mg q8h, monitor QTC
   - continue mvt/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated
   #SIRS/Sepsis:  Elevated lactate, tachycardiac, tachypneic, liver
   failure all concerning for sepsis/SIRS.  Not currently hypotensive and
   no elevated WBC which is reassuring. [**Month (only) 11**] all be related to liver
   failure/alcoholic hepatitis as well. No evidence of biliary source per
   ultrasound although poor study.
   - continue ceftriaxone until tomorrow DC if cultures negative
   - CIS
   .
   #Elevated CK: Ruled out for MI, urine tox negative for cocaine. Has
   been trending down, can hold on further levels.
   ..
   #Anemia:  Hematocrit 25 from baseline of 30, likely related to alcohol
   abuse and liver failure although history of bloody stools is
   concerning.
   - active type and screen, transfuse hct>21 or active bleeding
   - continue PPI
   - stool guaiacs
   .
   #Conjunctivitis: Eyes with bilateral yellowish-green thick secretions
   along conjunctivae.
   -erythromycin eye ointment QID
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #peripheral neuropathy
   - holding gabapentin for now given sedated

   temp but if culture data negative at 48 hours will d/c
   2. Encephalopathy: [**3-10**] etoh withdrawal/DT, hepatitis
    - continue lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
    - standing haldol 2 mg q 8hr with daily ekg and maintain Mg and K
    - ativan gtt for withdrawal
    - will add additional propofol on top of this for sedation while
   intubated
    - fentanyl at 25 ucg/hr for pain
    - lactulose and rifaxamine for encephalopathy
    - cont thiamine, folate, mvi
   3. Infection: no s/sx infection, will d/c ctx for additional day and if
   all culture data remains negative then d/c
   4. Anemia: hct stable with INR 1.5
    - no s/sx active bleed, transfuse goal > 22
   5. Conjunctivities: erythromycin drops
   6. FEN: will place feeding tube today
   7. Hemodynamics:
    - will need cvl and arterial line for hemodynamic support

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis presenting with liver failure and altered mental status. The patient developed signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal overnight and required intubation for airway protection. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.9°C (100.2°F)
- Heart rate: 133 bpm
- Blood pressure: 132/93 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 38 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on room air

The patient's physical examination reveals several findings including poor dentition, dilated pupils, trace lower extremity edema, and warm skin. Neurologically, the patient is unresponsive to noxious stimuli and has decreased muscle tone.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and signs of renal dysfunction. Imaging reveals hepatomegaly and normal portal vein flow.

Assessment and plan:
1. Acute liver failure: likely alcohol hepatitis related to recent increase in alcohol intake. The patient will continue to trend liver function tests (LFTs) every 8 hours, electrolytes, and follow up with hepatitis serologies. Prednisone and pentoxyphylline will be continued.
2. Encephalopathy: likely due to alcohol withdrawal and hepatitis. Lactulose will be continued for hepatic encephalopathy. Additional sedation"

   This is a 42 yo F with ETOH abuse, ETOh cirrhosis who presents with
   liver failure and altered mental status.
   1. Acute liver failure: likely [**3-10**] etoh hepatitis related to recent
   increase in ETOH intake.
    - LFTs stable but elevated with discriminant function 63
    - will continue to trend lfts q 8hr, electrolytes
    - f/u hepatitis serologies
    - cont prednisone 40 qday, pentoxyphline
    - cont ceftriaxone for possible SBP, occult infections given low grade
   temp but if culture data negative at 48 hours will d/c
   2. Encephalopathy: [**3-10**] etoh, hepatitis
    - continue lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
    - standing haldol 2 mg q 8hr with daily ekg and maintain Mg and K
    - ativan gtt for withdrawal
    - will add additional propofol on top of this for sedation while
   intubated
    - fentanyl at 25 ucg/hr for pain
    - lactulose and rifaxamine for encephalopathy
    - cont thiamine, folate, mvi
   3. Infection: no s/sx infection, will d/c ctx for additional day and if
   all culture data remains negative then d/c
   4. Anemia: hct stable with INR 1.5
    - no s/sx active bleed, transfuse goal > 22
   5. Conjunctivities: erythromycin drops
   6. FEN: will place feeding tube today
   7. Hemodynamics:
    - will need cvl and arterial line for hemodynamic support

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis presenting with liver failure and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated for airway protection due to signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. She is currently receiving steroids, pentoxyphiline, and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and normal oxygen saturation. Her weight remains unchanged from admission. The patient has received a total of 2,946 mL of fluids since 41 AM, with an input of 2,906 mL and output of 2,080 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals poor dentition, dilated pupils, soft and distended abdomen, trace lower extremity edema, muscle wasting, warm skin, and decreased muscle tone. Neurologically, the patient responds to noxious stimuli but does not have spontaneous movement.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine, low troponin T level, and abnormal liver function tests with elevated ALT and AST. Imaging shows scant ascites, hepatomegaly, and normal portal vein flow.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute liver failure due to likely ETOH hepatitis related to recent increase in ETOH intake. The patient will continue to trend liver function tests, electrolytes, and follow up with hepatitis ser"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis presenting with acute fulminant hepatic failure, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. She has been intubated for airway protection and is on various medications including sedatives, antibiotics, and supportive care. The patient's condition is consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH withdrawal. She also has anemia and evidence of conjunctivitis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is receiving nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This can lead to altered mental status, confusion, and potentially life-threatening brain edema.
2. EtoH withdrawal: Withdrawal symptoms may include tremors, agitation, seizures, and hallucinations.
3. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infections due to her compromised immune system. Pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections are common complications in ICU patients.
4. Bleeding: Alcoholic cirrhosis can cause impaired clotting and an increased risk of bleeding.
5. Respiratory complications: Mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
6. Peripheral neuropathy: Long-term alcohol abuse can lead to peripheral neuropathy, which can worsen in the ICU setting.
7. Anemia: The patient's baseline anemia may worsen due to blood loss"

   failure all concerning for sepsis/SIRS.  Not currently hypotensive and
   no elevated WBC which is reassuring. [**Month (only) 11**] all be related to liver
   failure/alcoholic hepatitis as well. No evidence of biliary source per
   ultrasound although poor study.
   - continue ceftriaxone until tomorrow DC if cultures negative
   - CIS
   .
   #Elevated CK: Ruled out for MI, urine tox negative for cocaine. Has
   been trending down, can hold on further levels.
   ..
   #Anemia:  Hematocrit 25 from baseline of 30, likely related to alcohol
   abuse and liver failure although history of bloody stools is
   concerning.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with acute fulminant hepatic failure. She has multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and elevated lactate levels. The most likely etiology of her condition is acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's MELD score is 24, indicating a high mortality rate. She has been started on steroids, tube feeds, and prophylactic antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and elevated lactate levels suggest hepatic encephalopathy, which is a common complication of liver failure.
2. Infection/sepsis: The elevated lactate levels, tachycardia, and tachypnea may indicate sepsis. The patient is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. ETOH withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and symptoms such as agitation and tremors may suggest ETOH withdrawal. She is being treated with benzodiazepines and propofol to manage these symptoms.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has decreased from 30 to 25, possibly due to chronic blood loss from gastrointestinal bleeding or decreased production of erythropoietin in liver failure.
5. Conjunctivitis: The patient has yellowish-green thick secretions along her conjunctivae, suggesting conjunctivitis.

The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and requires large doses of sedatives. She has been started on various medications including ativan, fentanyl, haldol, and propofol. The patient has a MELD score of 24, indicating a high risk of mortality. She also has signs consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and ethanol withdrawal. There are concerns for sepsis/SIRS, anemia, conjunctivitis, and peripheral neuropathy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 112/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 6,111 mL and output of 1,750 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's labs indicate elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and abnormal electrolyte levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's confusion, elevated lactate levels, and history of alcohol abuse suggest hepatic encephalopathy. Continued lactulose and rifaximin therapy is recommended.
2. Ethanol Withdrawal"

   #Acute Hepatic Failure:  Patient previously with preserved synthetic
   function.  Most likely etiology is acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   Ultrasound with poor study but patent vasculature and no overt ascites
   noted.  Lactate raises concern for infection although may be related to
   liver failure. Discriminate function is 63 on admit.  Estimated
   mortality given her degree of elevation in the presence of
   encephatlopathy is on the order of 45%. MELD score now 24

   #SIRS/Sepsis:  Elevated lactate, tachycardiac, tachypneic, liver
   failure all concerning for sepsis/SIRS.  Not currently hypotensive and
   no elevated WBC which is reassuring. [**Month (only) 11**] all be related to liver
   failure/alcoholic hepatitis as well. No evidence of biliary source per
   ultrasound although poor study.
   - continue ceftriaxone until tomorrow DC if cultures negative
   - CIS

   #Elevated CK: Ruled out for MI, urine tox negative for cocaine. Has
   been trending down, can hold on further levels.
   ..
   #Anemia:  Hematocrit 25 from baseline of 30, likely related to alcohol
   abuse and liver failure although history of bloody stools is
   concerning.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and orthostatic hypotension. She presents with confusion, fevers, lactate elevation, and worse hepatic failure. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is on various medications including sedatives, opioids, antipsychotics, and antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 112/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal kidney function. She also has anemia with a hematocrit of 25 from a baseline of 30. Other laboratory values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hepatic Failure: The patient has worsening hepatic function with elevated liver enzymes and lactate levels, indicating possible acute hepatic failure. This could lead to further deterioration in organ function and increased mortality.
2. Infection: The elevated lactate levels raise concern for infection, which can be a common"

   42 year old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented
   with acute fulminant hepatic failure with multiple electrolyte
   abnormalities, confusion, fevers, & lactate elevation
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Failure:  Patient previously with preserved synthetic
   function.  Most likely etiology is acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   Ultrasound with poor study but patent vasculature and no overt ascites
   noted.  Lactate raises concern for infection although may be related to
   liver failure. Discriminate function is 63 on admit.  Estimated
   mortality given her degree of elevation in the presence of
   encephatlopathy is on the order of 45%. MELD score still at 24 today
   .
   - continue steroids
   - place dophoff, start feeds
   - trend LFTs q6h, synthetic function
   - liver recs appreciated
   - if no evidence of infection or fever spikes so consider DC
   ceftriaxone today
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH
   withdrawal. CT head without evidence of any bleeding.
   - continue lactulose and refiaximin
   - Q2hr neuro checks
   # EtoH withdrawal
   - ativan drip to max 8mg/hr, add propofol if needed
   - basal fentanyl @25/hr
   - start haldol 2mg q8h, monitor QTC
   - continue mvt/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated
   #SIRS/Sepsis:  Elevated lactate, tachycardiac, tachypneic, liver
   failure all concerning for sepsis/SIRS.  Not currently hypotensive and
   no elevated WBC which is reassuring. [**Month (only) 11**] all be related to liver
   failure/alcoholic hepatitis as well. No evidence of biliary source per
   ultrasound although poor study.
   - continue ceftriaxone until tomorrow DC if cultures negative
   - CIS
   .
   #Elevated CK: Ruled out for MI, urine tox negative for cocaine. Has
   been trending down, can hold on further levels.
   ..
   #Anemia:  Hematocrit 25 from baseline of 30, likely related to alcohol
   abuse and liver failure although history of bloody stools is
   concerning.
   - active type and screen, transfuse hct>21 or active bleeding
   - continue PPI
   - stool guaiacs
   .
   #Conjunctivitis: Eyes with bilateral yellowish-green thick secretions
   along conjunctivae.
   -erythromycin eye ointment QID
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #peripheral neuropathy
   - holding gabapentin for now given sedated

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with acute fulminant hepatic failure, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. She was intubated for airway protection and sedated with multiple medications including ativan, fentanyl, haldol, and propofol. A line was placed, and she was started on tube feeds. The patient received a blood transfusion with a hemoglobin level of 6.9 g/dL. She has been monitored closely with frequent assessments of vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory values.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hepatic Failure: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute fulminant hepatic failure, likely due to acute alcoholic hepatitis. This condition carries a high mortality rate, estimated at 45% in this case given the presence of encephalopathy.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient exhibits signs consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, possibly exacerbated by ETOH withdrawal. Treatment includes lactulose and rifaximin, with neurologic checks every 2 hours.
3. ETOH Withdrawal: The patient shows signs of alcohol withdrawal, which requires careful management with benzodiazepines (ativan) and other supportive measures.
4. SIRS/Sepsis: Elevated lactate, tachycardia, tachypnea, and liver failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 42 yo F with ETOH abuse, ETOh cirrhosis who presents with
   liver failure and altered mental status.
    1. Acute liver failure: likely [**3-10**] etoh hepatitis related to recent
   increase in ETOH intake.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies
   - cont prednisone 40 qday, pentoxyphline for elevated discriminant
   function
   - D/c ceftriaxone today as no evidence of GIB and no sputum/infiltrate
   to suggest PNA.
    2. Encephalopathy: [**3-10**] etoh withdrawal/DT, hepatitis.  Very difficult
   to sedate overnight.
    - continue lactulose, rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
    - fentanyl, ativan gtt and proprol for sedation at present, will work
   to simplify this now that she is sedate.
   - cont thiamine, folate, mvi
    -Follow EKGs on Haldol.
   3. Respiratory Failure:  Intubated for airway protection
   -PSV trial today.
   4. Anemia: hct stable with INR 1.5
    - no s/sx active bleed since O/P trauma with intubation, transfuse
   goal > 21
    -Check HCT q8hr today
   5. Conjunctivitis: erythromycin drops
    6. FEN: TF started.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of ethanol (ETOH) abuse and cirrhosis presenting with liver failure and altered mental status. She has been intubated for airway protection due to oropharyngeal bleeding. The patient has been receiving sedation and respiratory support. Her condition is complicated by acute liver failure, likely related to recent increased ETOH intake, encephalopathy possibly due to ETOH withdrawal or hepatitis, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, anemia, conjunctivitis, and poor nutritional status. The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may progress to more severe hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to increased confusion, seizures, or even coma.
2. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, which increases the risk of complications such as coagulopathy, hypoglycemia, and infections.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory infections.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.
5. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system, she is at an increased risk of developing infections, including bloodstream infections"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 42 yo F with ETOH abuse, ETOh cirrhosis who presents with
   liver failure and altered mental status.
    1. Acute liver failure: likely [**3-10**] etoh hepatitis related to recent
   increase in ETOH intake.
   - will continue to trend lfts q 8hr, electrolytes
   - f/u hepatitis serologies
   - cont prednisone 40 qday, pentoxyphline for elevated discriminant
   function
   - D/c ceftriaxone today as no evidence of GIB and no sputum/infiltrate
   to suggest PNA.
    2. Encephalopathy: [**3-10**] etoh withdrawal/DT, hepatitis.  Very difficult
   to sedate overnight.
    - continue lactulose, rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
    - fentanyl, ativan gtt and proprol for sedation at present, will work
   to simplify this now that she is sedate.
   - cont thiamine, folate, mvi
    -Follow EKGs on Haldol.
   3. Respiratory Failure:  Intubated for airway protection
   -PSV trial today.
   4. Anemia: hct stable with INR 1.5
    - no s/sx active bleed since O/P trauma with intubation, transfuse
   goal > 21
   -Check HCT q8hr today
   5. Conjunctivitis: erythromycin drops
    6. FEN: TF started.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis presenting with liver failure and altered mental status. She has been intubated for airway protection due to oropharyngeal bleeding. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 102/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history.

The patient's medical history includes alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, and recent increased intake of alcohol, leading to acute liver failure. The liver failure is likely etoh hepatitis related to recent alcohol intake. The patient is also experiencing encephalopathy, possibly due to etoh withdrawal/DT or hepatitis. She is currently on lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient has respiratory failure and is intubated for airway protection. A pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial is planned today. She has stable hemoglobin levels and an INR of 1.5. The patient is also being treated for conjunctivitis with erythromycin drops.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), low albumin levels, elevated lactate levels, and elevated LDH levels. The imaging shows an endotracheal tube in place with no lines, low lung volumes,"

   # Encephalopathy:
   Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH withdrawal. CT
   head without evidence of any bleeding.
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - try to limit further titration of fentanyl
   .
   # EtoH withdrawal
   - ativan drip to max 8mg/hr
   - continue propofol
   - basal fentanyl
 wean as tolerated
   - start haldol 2mg q8h, monitor QTC
   - continue mvt/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated
   .
   # Anemia:
   Pt with baseline anemia, also h/o BRBPR at home though none here. Had
   some oral trauma in setting of intubation causing some additional blood
   loss.
   - active type and screen, transfuse hct>21 or active bleeding
   - continue PPI
   - stool guaiacs
   .
   # Vent
   Overbreathing AC. CXR clear. She had been intubated for airway
   protection.
   - Change to PSV today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis presenting with acute fulminant hepatic failure, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's condition is consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and alcohol withdrawal. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated lactate levels and confusion are indicative of hepatic encephalopathy, a condition characterized by altered brain function due to liver dysfunction. Complications associated with hepatic encephalopathy include increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, seizures, and coma.

2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient's symptoms, such as agitation, tremors, and confusion, suggest alcohol withdrawal. Complications of alcohol withdrawal can include seizures, delirium tremens (severe agitation, hallucinations, and autonomic instability), and, in some cases, life-threatening complications like Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (associated with thiamine deficiency).

3. Infection: The patient's recent fevers and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. Infections in ICU patients can lead to sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

4. Bleeding: The patient's history of BRBPR (blood in stool) at home and oral trauma during intubation"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with alcoholic hepatitis, altered mental status, elevated lactate levels, and recent fevers. She is currently receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient has been admitted with respiratory failure, encephalitis, cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol abuse, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and alcohol abuse. Her condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Infection: The patient's recent fevers and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of an infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as increased fever, leukocytosis, or positive cultures, is necessary.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can present with altered mental status and should be managed with lactulose and other supportive measures.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's lab results show an elevated creatinine level, which may indicate renal impairment. Monitoring kidney function and addressing any underlying causes of AKI is crucial.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged PT/INR indicates a coagulopathy. This requires careful monitoring and appropriate management to prevent bleeding complications.

5. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving enteral nutrition, but her nutritional status should be monitored"

   Assessment and Plan:
   42 year old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented
   with acute fulminant hepatic failure with multiple electrolyte
   abnormalities, confusion, fevers, & lactate elevation
   .
   #Alcoholic hepatitis:
   Ultrasound with poor study but patent vasculature and no overt ascites
   noted.  Discriminate function is 63 on admit.  Estimated mortality
   given her degree of elevation in the presence of encephalopathy is on
   the order of 45%.  Bilirubin continues to climb.
   - continue steroids d4, pentoxiphylline
   - continue tube feeds via OGT
   - liver recs appreciated
   - trend LFTs, synthetic function daily
   - liver recs appreciated, f/up additional input
   - no clear evidence of infection (no infiltrate, blood and urine cx
   unremarkable) therefore stopped ceftriaxone yesterday
   .
   # Encephalopathy:
   Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH withdrawal. CT
   head without evidence of any bleeding.
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - try to limit  Fentanyl  and d/c her propofol at this point
   .
   # EtoH withdrawal:
   - Ativan drip to max 8mg/hr now , will wean today
   - now off of propofol completely
   - basal Fentanyl with boluses as needed /  weaning slowly as tolerates
   - continue on haldol 2mg q8h standing, monitor QTC
   - continue mvt/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated, will continue to follow
   .
   #Stool changes: stools more odorous and discolored today. [**Month (only) 11**] just
   simply be lactulose effects and hyperbilirubinemia vs.  recent
   antibiotics with ceftriaxone.
   - will send off C.difficile
   .
   #Electrolyte abnormalities: Chronic issue even as outpatient as she has
   need for Mg and K repletion at home. She has been having low Phos, Mg,
   K  in setting of worse liver failure
   --Will continue to check [**Hospital1 **] lytes and replete as needed
   .
   # Anemia:
   Pt with baseline anemia, also h/o BRBPR at home though none here. Had
   some oral trauma in setting of intubation causing some additional blood
   loss.
   - active type and screen, transfuse hct>21 or active bleeding
   - check Hcts daily
   - continue PPI
   - stool guaiacs
   .
   # Ventilation:
   Overbreathing slightly but will allow given metabolic acidosis.  CXRs
   have been  clear. She had been intubated for airway protection / AMS.
   - Did not tolerate PSV well so will continue to rest on A/C for today
   to maintain safe airway given extreme AMS and encephalopathy.
   .
   # Increased secretions/ recent fevers:  No current leukocytosis or
   fevers and lactate elevation has now corrected so may not be any clear
   infection.  Intubation with AMS on admission so need to be weary of
   aspiration PNAs and VAP.
   -CIS, low threshold to cover with Abx / holding off for now
   -f/up sputum, blood cultures
   -follow CXRs for interval changes
   .
   # Conjunctivitis: Eyes with bilateral yellowish-green thick secretions
   along conjunctivae when admitted.  Much improved eye exam with no
   crusting today.
   -erythromycin eye ointment QID ( day 4 of 7 )
   -continue to monitor ; improving
   .
   # peripheral neuropathy
   - holding gabapentin for now given sedated

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, presenting with acute fulminant hepatic failure, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and elevated lactate levels. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to airway protection and altered mental status. The patient's condition is worsening, with increasing bilirubin levels, encephalopathy, and potential complications such as alcoholic hepatitis, hepatic encephalopathy, EtoH withdrawal, anemia, and peripheral neuropathy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has had recent fevers and elevated lactate levels, indicating a possible infection. She is at risk for pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and Clostridium difficile infection due to antibiotic use.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy is consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, which can be exacerbated by electrolyte imbalances and medication interactions.
3. Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and worsening liver function tests suggest ongoing alcoholic hepatitis, which can lead to liver failure and other complications.
4. EtoH withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of EtoH withdrawal, which can cause severe symptoms including seizures, hallucinations, and autonomic instability.
5. Anemia: The patient has a baseline anemia, which may be exacerbated by ongoing bleeding or blood"

   noted.  Discriminate function is 63 on admit.  Estimated mortality
   given her degree of elevation in the presence of encephalopathy is on
   the order of 45%.  Bilirubin continues to climb.
   - continue steroids d4, pentoxiphylline
   - continue tube feeds via OGT
   - liver recs appreciated
   - trend LFTs, synthetic function daily
   - liver recs appreciated, f/up additional input
   - no clear evidence of infection (no infiltrate, blood and urine cx
   unremarkable) therefore stopped ceftriaxone yesterday

   # Encephalopathy:
   Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH withdrawal. CT
   head without evidence of any bleeding.
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - try to limit  Fentanyl  and d/c her propofol at this point
   .
   # EtoH withdrawal:
   - Ativan drip to max 8mg/hr now , will wean today
   - now off of propofol completely
   - basal Fentanyl with boluses as needed /  weaning slowly as tolerates
   - continue on haldol 2mg q8h standing, monitor QTC
   - continue mvt/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated, will continue to follow

   #Stool changes: stools more odorous and discolored today. [**Month (only) 11**] just
   simply be lactulose effects and hyperbilirubinemia vs.  recent
   antibiotics with ceftriaxone.
   - will send off C.difficile
   .
   # Anemia:
   Pt with baseline anemia, also h/o BRBPR at home though none here. Had
   some oral trauma in setting of intubation causing some additional blood
   loss.
   - active type and screen, transfuse hct>21 or active bleeding
   - check Hcts daily
   - continue PPI
   - stool guaiacs

   # Ventilation
   Overbreathing slightly but will allow given metabolic acidosis.  CXR
   clear. She had been intubated for airway protection.
   - Change to PSV today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, presenting with acute fulminant hepatic failure. She has multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. The patient's condition is worsening, with ongoing encephalopathy and elevated bilirubin levels. She is currently on ventilatory support due to airway protection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and elevated ammonia levels indicate hepatic encephalopathy. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to worsening of mental status and potential development of sepsis.
2. Infection: The patient has had recent fevers, which could indicate an underlying infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection is essential to prevent or treat any potential infections promptly.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (BRBPR at home) and ongoing blood loss due to oral trauma. Active type and screen have been ordered, and transfusion should be considered if the patient's hemoglobin levels drop significantly.
4. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds, but there is a risk of malnutrition due to prolonged enteral nutrition. Monitoring nutritional status and adjusting the diet as necessary is important.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk of developing DVT due to immobilization. Prophylactic measures, such as pne"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with acute fulminant hepatic failure, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. Her Discriminant Function (DF) score is 63 on admission, indicating a high degree of hepatic encephalopathy and estimated mortality rate of around 45%. She is currently receiving steroids, pentoxifylline, tube feeds, lactulose, rifaximin, and other supportive treatments. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: This condition is a common complication of liver cirrhosis and can cause confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms. The patient's DF score indicates a high risk for hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to liver failure, she is at an increased risk of infections. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, and changes in vital signs, is crucial.
3. Bleeding: Liver cirrhosis can lead to coagulopathy and an increased risk of bleeding. The patient has a history of BRBPR (blood in the stool) and oral trauma, indicating possible bleeding tendencies.
4. Respiratory Failure: Due to the patient's intubation for airway protection and the need for ventilatory"

   # Encephalopathy:
   Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH withdrawal. CT
   head without evidence of any bleeding.
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - try to limit further titration of fentanyl
   .
   # EtoH withdrawal
   - ativan drip to max 8mg/hr
   - continue propofol
   - basal fentanyl
 wean as tolerated
   - start haldol 2mg q8h, monitor QTC
   - continue mvt/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated

   - continue PPI
   - stool guaiacs
   .
   # Vent
   Overbreathing AC. CXR clear. She had been intubated for airway
   protection.
   - Change to PSV today

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with acute fulminant hepatic failure, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. She is currently in the ICU for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/55 to 123/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She has a history of alcoholic hepatitis with an elevated discriminant function of 63 on admission and an estimated mortality of 45%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including AST and ALT, as well as elevated bilirubin levels. Her albumin level is low at 2.9 g/dL, and there are abnormalities in her electrolyte levels, including low sodium and potassium levels. Her lactic acid level is elevated at 1.9 mmol/L. Other lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count and platelet count.

The patient's medications include lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, steroids, pentoxifylline, and tube feeds. She is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of her liver function, electrolyte imbalances, and potential complications such as infection, bleeding,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 42 yo F with ETOH abuse, ETOh cirrhosis who presents with
   liver failure and altered mental status.
   1. Acute liver failure: likely [**3-10**] etoh hepatitis related to recent
   increase in ETOH intake.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies
   - cont prednisone 40 qday, pentoxyphline for elevated discriminant
   function.
    2. Encephalopathy: [**3-10**] etoh withdrawal/DT, hepatitis.
    - continue lactulose, rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
    - Able to wean off proprol overnight.  Will continue to try to wean
   ativan/fentanyl but DT's will be limiting factor.  If unable to achieve
   sufficient mental status for extuabation, would consider precidex in
   the next day or two.
   - cont thiamine, folate, mvi
   -Follow EKGs on Haldol.
    3. Respiratory Failure:  Intubated for airway protection
   -Very tachypneic and abdominal breathing on PSV today.
   -Largest barrier to extubation is mental status at this point.
    4. Anemia: hct stable with INR 1.5
    - no s/sx active bleed since O/P trauma with intubation, transfuse
   goal > 21
    5. Conjunctivitis: erythromycin drops
    6. FEN: TF started.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. She presents with liver failure and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated for airway protection due to respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and is tachypneic. Her secretions have become thicker today. She has a stable hematocrit level but may require transfusion. The patient is also experiencing conjunctivitis and has started treatment with erythromycin drops. She has multiple lines and an arterial line in place. The patient's code status is full code and her current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute liver failure: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis puts her at risk for acute liver failure. This can lead to hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which can be exacerbated by factors such as alcohol withdrawal or infection.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to liver failure makes her susceptible to infections. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count, is important.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be a result of her liver disease and portal hypertension causing abdominal distension and diaphragmatic dysfunction. Close monitoring of her respiratory status is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis who is currently in the ICU. She presents with liver failure and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated for airway protection due to respiratory failure. She is sedated and unable to provide a history. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute liver failure: The patient's recent increase in alcohol intake may have led to acute liver failure. This can progress to hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be due to alcohol withdrawal or hepatitis-related encephalopathy. This can further complicate extubation and weaning off sedatives.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing tachypnea and abdominal breathing on pressure support ventilation (PSV). This suggests ongoing respiratory distress, which is a barrier to extubation.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable, but there may be ongoing blood loss or inadequate production of red blood cells.
5. Conjunctivitis: The patient has scleral icterus and edema, which may indicate conjunctivitis. This can be treated with erythromycin drops.
6. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, resulting in a positive fluid balance. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsened respiratory status.

   Assessment and Plan:
   42 year old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented
   with acute fulminant hepatic failure with multiple electrolyte
   abnormalities, confusion, fevers, & lactate elevation
   .
   #Alcoholic hepatitis:
   Ultrasound with poor study but patent vasculature and no overt ascites
   noted.  Discriminate function is 63 on admit.  Estimated mortality
   given her degree of elevation in the presence of encephalopathy is on
   the order of 45%.  Bilirubin continues to climb.
   - continue steroids d5
   - continue  pentoxiphylline
   - continue tube feeds via OGT
   - liver recs appreciated
   - trend LFTs, synthetic function daily
   - f/up liver recs, appreciate input
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH
   withdrawal. Recent CT head without evidence of any bleeding.
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - try to limit  Fentanyl  and d/c her propofol at this point
   .
   # EtoH withdrawal:
   - Ativan drip to max 8mg/hr now , will wean today
   - now off of propofol completely
   - basal Fentanyl with boluses as needed /  weaning slowly as tolerates
   - continue on haldol 2mg q8h standing, monitor QTC
   - continue mvt/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated, will continue to follow
   .
   #Stool changes: stools more odorous and discolored today. [**Month (only) 11**] just
   simply be lactulose effects and hyperbilirubinemia vs.  recent
   antibiotics with ceftriaxone.
   - will send off C.difficile
   .
   #Electrolyte abnormalities: Chronic issue even as outpatient as she has
   need for Mg and K repletion at home. She has been having low Phos, Mg,
   K  in setting of worse liver failure
   --Will continue to check [**Hospital1 **] lytes and replete as needed
   .
   # Anemia:
   Pt with baseline anemia, also h/o BRBPR at home though none here. Had
   some oral trauma in setting of intubation causing some additional blood
   loss.
   - active type and screen, transfuse hct>21 or active bleeding
   - check Hcts daily
   - continue PPI
   - stool guaiacs
   .
   # Ventilation:
   Overbreathing slightly but will allow given metabolic acidosis.  CXRs
   have been  clear. She had been intubated for airway protection / AMS.
   - Did not tolerate PSV well so will continue to rest on A/C for today
   to maintain safe airway given extreme AMS and encephalopathy.
   .
   # Increased secretions/ recent fevers:  No current leukocytosis or
   fevers and lactate elevation has now corrected so may not be any clear
   infection.  Intubation with AMS on admission so need to be weary of
   aspiration PNAs and VAP.
   -CIS, low threshold to cover with Abx / holding off for now
   -f/up sputum, blood cultures
   -follow CXRs for interval changes
   .
   # Conjunctivitis: Eyes with bilateral yellowish-green thick secretions
   along conjunctivae when admitted.  Much improved eye exam with no
   crusting today.
   -erythromycin eye ointment QID ( day 5 of 7 )
   -continue to monitor ; improving
   .
   # peripheral neuropathy
   - holding gabapentin for now given sedated

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis presenting with acute fulminant hepatic failure, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. She has been intubated for airway protection and is currently sedated. The patient has been diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis, hepatic encephalopathy, and potential ethanol withdrawal. She also has anemia, respiratory issues, increased secretions, recent fevers, conjunctivitis, and peripheral neuropathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition can cause confusion, altered mental status, and even coma if not managed properly.
2. Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient's liver function needs to be closely monitored, as this condition can lead to further liver damage or failure.
3. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient may experience symptoms such as tremors, agitation, seizures, or delirium tremens if not appropriately managed.
4. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state, she is at an increased risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
5. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's altered mental status and risk of aspiration, there is a possibility of developing aspiration pneumonia.
6. Peripheral neuropathy: The patient may experience worsening of her peripheral neuropathy, which can affect her motor and sensory functions.

   #Alcoholic hepatitis:
   Ultrasound with poor study but patent vasculature and no overt ascites
   noted.  Discriminate function is 63 on admit.  Estimated mortality
   given her degree of elevation in the presence of encephalopathy is on
   the order of 45%.  Bilirubin continues to climb.
   - continue steroids d5
   - continue  pentoxiphylline
   - continue tube feeds via OGT
   - liver recs appreciated
   - trend LFTs, synthetic function daily
   - f/up liver recs, appreciate input
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH
   withdrawal. Recent CT head without evidence of any bleeding.
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - try to limit  Fentanyl  and d/c her propofol at this point
   .
   # EtoH withdrawal:
   - Ativan drip to max 8mg/hr now , will wean today
   - now off of propofol completely
   - basal Fentanyl with boluses as needed /  weaning slowly as tolerates
   - continue on haldol 2mg q8h standing, monitor QTC
   - continue mvt/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated, will continue to follow
   .
   #Stool changes: stools more odorous and discolored today. [**Month (only) 11**] just
   simply be lactulose effects and hyperbilirubinemia vs.  recent
   antibiotics with ceftriaxone.
   - will send off C.difficile

   #Electrolyte abnormalities: Chronic issue even as outpatient as she has
   need for Mg and K repletion at home. She has been having low Phos, Mg,
   K  in setting of worse liver failure

   # Ventilation:
   Overbreathing slightly but will allow given metabolic acidosis.  CXRs
   have been  clear. She had been intubated for airway protection / AMS.
   - Did not tolerate PSV well so will continue to rest on A/C for today
   to maintain safe airway given extreme AMS and encephalopathy.

   # Increased secretions/ recent fevers:  No current leukocytosis or
   fevers and lactate elevation has now corrected so may not be any clear
   infection.  Intubation with AMS on admission so need to be weary of
   aspiration PNAs and VAP.

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with acute fulminant hepatic failure. She has multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors:

1. Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient's discrimination function is 63 on admission, indicating a high mortality rate of approximately 45%. Bilirubin levels continue to rise, and the patient is experiencing encephalopathy.

2. Encephalopathy: The patient is most likely suffering from hepatic encephalopathy and ethanol withdrawal. Treatment includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin, limiting Fentanyl, discontinuing propofol, and weaning off sedation as tolerated.

3. EtoH withdrawal: The patient is also experiencing withdrawal symptoms from alcohol. Treatment involves weaning off propofol, reducing Fentanyl doses, and monitoring for any signs of withdrawal.

4. Stool changes: The patient's stools have become more odorous and discolored, which could be due to lactulose effects and hyperbilirubinemia or recent antibiotics. A test for Clostridium difficile has been sent off.

5. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient has chronic issues with electrolyte imbalances, including low magnesium and potassium levels, which need to be repleted regularly.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis presenting with acute fulminant hepatic failure, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. She has been intubated for airway protection and is currently sedated. Her condition is complicated by alcoholic hepatitis, encephalopathy, potential ethanol withdrawal, stool changes consistent with Clostridium difficile infection, electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, ventilation issues, increased secretions, fever, conjunctivitis, and peripheral neuropathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and elevated bilirubin levels suggest hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can worsen if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient's recent fevers and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic coverage is essential.
3. Clostridium difficile infection: Although the stool toxin test came back negative, the patient's odorous and discolored stools raise concerns for C. difficile infection. Continued monitoring and treatment for this infection may be necessary.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has chronic issues with magnesium, potassium, and phosphate repletion. Regular electrolyte monitoring and supplementation are crucial.
5. Anemia: The patient's baseline anemia needs to be addressed, and ongoing monitoring of hemoglobin levels is necessary. Transfusion may be"

   Assessment and Plan:
   42 year old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented
   with acute fulminant hepatic failure with multiple electrolyte
   abnormalities, confusion, fevers, & lactate elevation
   .
   #Alcoholic hepatitis:
   Ultrasound with poor study but patent vasculature and no overt ascites
   noted.  Discriminate function is 63 on admit.  Estimated mortality
   given her degree of elevation in the presence of encephalopathy is on
   the order of 45%.  Bilirubin continues to climb.
   - continue steroids d4, pentoxiphylline
   - continue tube feeds via OGT
   - liver recs appreciated
   - trend LFTs, synthetic function daily
   - liver recs appreciated, f/up additional input
   - no clear evidence of infection (no infiltrate, blood and urine cx
   unremarkable) therefore stopped ceftriaxone yesterday
   .
   # Encephalopathy:
   Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH withdrawal. CT
   head without evidence of any bleeding.
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - try to limit  Fentanyl  and d/c her propofol at this point
   .
   # EtoH withdrawal:
   - Ativan drip to max 8mg/hr now , will wean today
   - now off of propofol completely
   - basal Fentanyl with boluses as needed /  weaning slowly as tolerates
   - continue on haldol 2mg q8h standing, monitor QTC
   - continue mvt/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated, will continue to follow
   .
   #Stool changes: stools more odorous and discolored today. [**Month (only) 11**] just
   simply be lactulose effects and hyperbilirubinemia vs.  recent
   antibiotics with ceftriaxone.
   - will send off C.difficile
   .
   #Electrolyte abnormalities: Chronic issue even as outpatient as she has
   need for Mg and K repletion at home. She has been having low Phos, Mg,
   K  in setting of worse liver failure
   --Will continue to check [**Hospital1 **] lytes and replete as needed
   .
   # Anemia:
   Pt with baseline anemia, also h/o BRBPR at home though none here. Had
   some oral trauma in setting of intubation causing some additional blood
   loss.
   - active type and screen, transfuse hct>21 or active bleeding
   - check Hcts daily
   - continue PPI
   - stool guaiacs
   .
   # Ventilation:
   Overbreathing slightly but will allow given metabolic acidosis.  CXRs
   have been  clear. She had been intubated for airway protection / AMS.
   - Did not tolerate PSV well so will continue to rest on A/C for today
   to maintain safe airway given extreme AMS and encephalopathy.
   .
   # Increased secretions/ recent fevers:  No current leukocytosis or
   fevers and lactate elevation has now corrected so may not be any clear
   infection.  Intubation with AMS on admission so need to be weary of
   aspiration PNAs and VAP.
   -CIS, low threshold to cover with Abx / holding off for now
   -f/up sputum, blood cultures
   -follow CXRs for interval changes
   .
   # Conjunctivitis: Eyes with bilateral yellowish-green thick secretions
   along conjunctivae when admitted.  Much improved eye exam with no
   crusting today.
   -erythromycin eye ointment QID ( day 4 of 7 )
   -continue to monitor ; improving
   .
   # peripheral neuropathy
   - holding gabapentin for now given sedated

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with acute fulminant hepatic failure. She has multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been treated with steroids, pentoxiphylline, tube feeds, lactulose, rifaximin, and antibiotics. Her liver function tests show worsening bilirubin levels and synthetic dysfunction. She also has evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, possible EtoH withdrawal, and anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has recent fevers and elevated lactate levels, which may indicate an ongoing infection. There is also a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia due to her altered mental status and risk of aspiration.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and elevated bilirubin levels suggest hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can worsen if not properly managed with lactulose and rifaximin.

3. EtoH withdrawal: The patient may be experiencing withdrawal symptoms from alcohol, which can manifest as agitation, tremors, seizures, or hallucinations. Benzodiazepines like lorazepam are being used for sedation and to manage withdrawal symptoms.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has low platelet counts and prolonged PT/PTT/increase in"

   #Stool changes: stools more odorous and discolored today. [**Month (only) 11**] just
   simply be lactulose effects and hyperbilirubinemia vs.  recent
   antibiotics with ceftriaxone.
   - will send off C.difficile
   .
   #Electrolyte abnormalities: Chronic issue even as outpatient as she has
   need for Mg and K repletion at home. She has been having low Phos, Mg,
   K  in setting of worse liver failure
   --Will continue to check [**Hospital1 **] lytes and replete as needed
   .
   # Anemia:
   Pt with baseline anemia, also h/o BRBPR at home though none here. Had
   some oral trauma in setting of intubation causing some additional blood
   loss.
   - active type and screen, transfuse hct>21 or active bleeding
   - check Hcts daily
   - continue PPI
   - stool guaiacs
   .
   # Ventilation:
   Overbreathing slightly but will allow given metabolic acidosis.  CXRs
   have been  clear. She had been intubated for airway protection / AMS.
   - Did not tolerate PSV well so will continue to rest on A/C for today
   to maintain safe airway given extreme AMS and encephalopathy.
   .
   # Increased secretions/ recent fevers:  No current leukocytosis or
   fevers and lactate elevation has now corrected so may not be any clear
   infection.  Intubation with AMS on admission so need to be weary of
   aspiration PNAs and VAP.
   -CIS, low threshold to cover with Abx / holding off for now
   -f/up sputum, blood cultures
   -follow CXRs for interval changes
   .
   # Conjunctivitis: Eyes with bilateral yellowish-green thick secretions
   along conjunctivae when admitted.  Much improved eye exam with no
   crusting today.
   -erythromycin eye ointment QID ( day 4 of 7 )
   -continue to monitor ; improving

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with acute fulminant hepatic failure, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. She has been diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis and is experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, EtoH withdrawal, anemia, increased secretions, recent fevers, conjunctivitis, and peripheral neuropathy. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and has been in the ICU for an extended period.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient is exhibiting signs of hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to confusion, altered mental status, and potentially coma if not managed properly.
2. EtoH Withdrawal: The patient is showing symptoms of EtoH withdrawal, which can cause severe complications such as seizures, delirium, and autonomic dysregulation.
3. Infection: Given the presence of fevers, recent antibiotic use, and an elevated lactate level, there is a risk of infection, including Clostridium difficile colitis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI).
4. Anemia: The patient has a baseline anemia and ongoing blood loss, which can further worsen her oxygen-carrying capacity and lead to tissue hypoxia.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has chronic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a chief complaint of alcoholic hepatitis, altered mental status, elevated lactate levels, and recent fevers. She has been in the ICU for an extended period and is currently intubated, sedated, and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but she has shown fluctuations in temperature and blood pressure. The patient has multiple comorbidities including elevated liver enzymes and abnormal kidney function. She has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's recent fevers and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. The presence of C. difficile in the stool and the need for increased abdominal distension evaluation indicate a potential gastrointestinal infection.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic hepatitis and elevated liver enzymes, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's abnormal kidney function, as indicated by the elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, may suggest AKI. This could be due to prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal causes.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been intubated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, presenting with acute fulminant hepatic failure, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. She is being treated for alcoholic hepatitis and ethanol withdrawal. The patient's condition is complicated by several issues including encephalopathy, ethanol withdrawal, stool changes, electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, ventilation difficulties, increased secretions, conjunctivitis, vaginal discharge, and peripheral neuropathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated bilirubin levels, confusion, and recent CT head without evidence of any bleeding indicate the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy. Continuous lactulose and rifaximin therapy, along with limiting Fentanyl and tapering down Ativan, should be continued to manage this condition.

2. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient's symptoms such as agitation, tremors, seizures, hallucinations, and tachycardia suggest ethanol withdrawal. Management includes Ativan drip to a maximum of 8 mg/hr, weaning down to 6 mg/hr today, basal Fentanyl with boluses as needed, and slow weaning as tolerated. Haldol 2 mg q8h standing should be continued, monitoring QTC (ok today). Mvt/thiamine/folate should also be continued.

3. Stool changes and distended abdomen: The patient's stools are od"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with alcoholic hepatitis and withdrawal symptoms requiring intubation for management. The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, lorazepam, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. She is also receiving tube feeds and has been on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ETOH Hepatitis: The patient's condition could worsen due to ongoing liver damage and potential development of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, or hepatorenal syndrome.
2. ETOH Withdrawal: The patient may experience severe withdrawal symptoms, including delirium tremens, seizures, or cardiovascular instability if not managed appropriately.
3. Respiratory Failure: There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, potentially leading to ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotrauma.
4. Electrolyte Imbalances: Close monitoring is required to prevent or manage electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypernatremia, hypokalemia, or hypophosphatemia.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia, due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented with appropriate prophylaxis.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 year old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented
   with acute fulminant hepatic failure with multiple electrolyte
   abnormalities, confusion, fevers, & lactate elevation being treated for
   alcoholic hepatitis and ETOH withdrawal, still intubated for airway
   protection.
   .
   #Alcoholic hepatitis:
   Ultrasound with poor study but patent vasculature and no overt ascites
   noted.  Discriminate function is 63 on admit.  Estimated mortality
   given her degree of elevation in the presence of encephalopathy is on
   the order of 45%.  Bilirubin continues to elevated at 37.8 now .
   - discontinued steroids today as no improvement in bili on this
   - continue  pentoxiphylline
   - continue daily lactulose and rifaxamin as below
   - continue mvt/thiamine/folate
   - continue tube feeds via OGT
   - trend LFTs, synthetic function daily
   - f/up liver recs, appreciate input
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH
   withdrawal. Recent CT head without evidence of any bleeding. Ativan
   tapered down to 6 overnight
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - try to limit  Fentanyl, continue taper down ativan as tolerates,
   taper at 4 today
   .
   # EtoH withdrawal:
   - Ativan drip tapering as she tolerates ( down from max 8mg/hr to
   6mg/hr now , trial of 4mg/hr today)
   - basal Fentanyl with boluses as needed /  weaning slowly as tolerates
   (75 today)
   - continue on haldol 2mg q8h standing, monitor QTC w/EKG
   - continue mvi/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated, will continue to follow
   .
   # Ventilation: Still remains intubated. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to new VAP by
   CXR, increased secretions
   Unable to tolerate SBT [**3-10**] tachypnea
 also may be element of fluid
   overload. She had been intubated for airway protection / AMS.
   - Did not tolerate PSV well so will continue to rest on A/C for today
   to maintain safe airway given extreme AMS and encephalopathy.
   - Keep I/Os with goal -1L negative
 gentle diuresis with PRN 20 IV
   lasix as needed
   - maintaine UOP >40cc/hr
   . .
   # Increased secretions/ recent fevers:  No current leukocytosis but Tm
   to 100.5F and questionable infiltrate overnight on CXR at RLL.
   Lactate elevation has now corrected , but this was likely more related
   to ALF.  Intubation with AMS on admission so need to be weary of
   aspiration PNAs and VAP.  Opted to start therapy overnight as below.
   -continue on Vanco/Cef/Cipro for VAP coverage for now  (day [**3-16**])
   -CIS
   -f/up sputum, blood cultures
   -follow CXRs for interval changes
   #Stool changes/distended abdomen: stools more odorous and discolored
   today. [**Month (only) 11**] just simply be lactulose effects and hyperbilirubinemia vs.
   recent antibiotics with ceftriaxone. Overnight C.difficile  was
   negative. KUB with fluid and air in colon.
   .
   #Electrolyte abnormalities: Chronic issue even as outpatient as she has
   need for Mg and K repletion at home. She has been having low Phos, Mg,
   K  in setting of worse liver failure. Also with hypernatremia with free
   water repletion
   --Will continue to check [**Hospital1 **] lytes and replete as needed
   - continue free water flushes, but decrease if Na continues to be
   improved
   .
   # Anemia:
   Pt with baseline anemia, also h/o BRBPR at home though none here. Had
   some oral trauma in setting of intubation causing some additional blood
   loss.  HCt stable at 26-28 range for several days now.
   - active type and screen, transfuse hct>21 or active bleeding
   - check Hcts daily
   - continue PPI
   - stool guaiacs
   .
   # Conjunctivitis: Eyes with bilateral yellowish-green thick secretions
   along conjunctivae when admitted.  Much improved eye exam with no
   crusting today.
   -erythromycin eye ointment QID ( day 6 of 7 today  )
   -continue to monitor ; improving
   .
   # Vaginal discharge: Patient with malodorous discharge from below. Was
   started on vaginal flagyl overnight. Patient with history of STDs
   - continue vaginal flagyl
   - send urine for chlamydia/gonorrhea, HCV, RPR
   - consider STD testing/f/u when mental status improved
   - social work when mental status improved
   # Peripheral neuropathy
   - holding gabapentin for now given sedated

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis. She presented with acute fulminant hepatic failure, altered mental status (AMS), fevers, and suspected pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and sedation. She has multiple electrolyte abnormalities, including hypernatremia, increased free water, and hypokalemia. Her bilirubin levels remain elevated at 37.8. The patient is being treated for alcoholic hepatitis and ethanol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilation: The patient remains intubated due to new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and inability to tolerate spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). She will continue to rest on assist-control ventilation (A/C) to maintain a safe airway.
2. Increased secretions and fevers: The patient has no current leukocytosis but has a temperature of 100.5F and a questionable infiltrate overnight on chest X-ray at the right lower lobe. Lactate elevation has now corrected, but this was likely more related to acute liver failure (ALF). Intubation with AMS on admission so need to be wary of aspiration pneumonia and VAP. Opted to start therapy overnight as below.
3. Stool changes and distended abdomen: Stools are more odorous and discolored today. This could be due to lactulose effects and hyperbilirubinemia or recent antibiotics"

   - trend LFTs, synthetic function daily
   - f/up liver recs, appreciate input
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH
   withdrawal. Recent CT head without evidence of any bleeding.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - try to limit  Fentanyl, continue taper down ativan as tolerates
   .
   # EtoH withdrawal:
   - Ativan drip tapering as she tolerates ( down from max 8mg/hr to
   6mg/hr now , will wean to 4mg/hr today)
   - basal Fentanyl with boluses as needed /  weaning slowly as tolerates
   - continue on haldol 2mg q8h standing, monitor QTC w/EKG
   - continue mvt/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated, will continue to follow
   .
   #Stool changes/distended abdomen: stools more odorous and discolored
   today. [**Month (only) 11**] just simply be lactulose effects and hyperbilirubinemia vs.
   recent antibiotics with ceftriaxone. Overnight C.difficile  was
   negative
   - f/u KUB
   .
   #Electrolyte abnormalities: Chronic issue even as outpatient as she has
   need for Mg and K repletion at home. She has been having low Phos, Mg,
   K  in setting of worse liver failure
   --Will continue to check [**Hospital1 **] lytes and replete as needed
   .
   # Anemia:
   Pt with baseline anemia, also h/o BRBPR at home though none here. Had
   some oral trauma in setting of intubation causing some additional blood
   loss.  HCt stable at 26-28 range for several days now.
   - active type and screen, transfuse hct>21 or active bleeding
   - check Hcts daily
   - continue PPI
   - stool guaiacs
   .
   # Ventilation: Still remains intubated.
   Unable to tolerate SBT [**3-10**] tachypnea
 also may be element of fluid
   overload. She had been intubated for airway protection / AMS.
   - f/up CXR today
   - Did not tolerate PSV well so will continue to rest on A/C for today
   to maintain safe airway given extreme AMS and encephalopathy.
   - Keep I/Os with goal -1L negative
 gentle diuresis with PRN 20 IV
   lasix as needed
   - maintaine UOP >40cc/hr
   . .
   # Increased secretions/ recent fevers:  No current leukocytosis but Tm
   to 100.5F and questionable infiltrate overnight on CXR at RLL.
   Lactate elevation has now corrected , but this was likely more related
   to ALF.  Intubation with AMS on admission so need to be weary of
   aspiration PNAs and VAP.  Opted to start therapy overnight as below.
   .
   -continue on Vanco/Cef/Cipro for VAP coverage for now
   -CIS
   -f/up sputum, blood cultures
   -follow CXRs for interval changes
   .
   # Conjunctivitis: Eyes with bilateral yellowish-green thick secretions
   along conjunctivae when admitted.  Much improved eye exam with no
   crusting today.
   -erythromycin eye ointment QID ( day 6 of 7 today  )
   -continue to monitor ; improving
   .
   # Vaginal discharge: Patient with malodorous discharge from below. Was
   started on vaginal flagyl overnight. Patient with history of STDs
   - continue vaginal flagyl
   - consider STD testing/f/u when mental status improved
   - social work when mental status improved
   # Peripheral neuropathy
   - holding gabapentin for now given sedated

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with acute fulminant hepatic failure, altered mental status (AMS), and suspected pneumonia. She has been treated for alcoholic hepatitis and ethanol withdrawal. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. She remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to airway protection and AMS. There are concerns about aspiration pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has suspected pneumonia, which could progress to a more severe infection if not properly managed.
2. VAP: Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which requires appropriate antibiotic coverage.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's AMS may be related to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver failure.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has chronic electrolyte abnormalities, including low potassium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, which need to be monitored and managed.
5. Infection: The patient has increased secretions, recent fevers, and a possible infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating a potential infection that needs to be evaluated further.
6. Acute kidney injury: The patient's high lactate levels and fluid balance indicate a possibility of acute kidney injury.
7. Bloodstream infection: There is a risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 year old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented
   with acute fulminant hepatic failure with multiple electrolyte
   abnormalities, confusion, fevers, & lactate elevation being treated for
   alcoholic hepatitis and ETOH withdrawal
   .
   #Alcoholic hepatitis:
   Ultrasound with poor study but patent vasculature and no overt ascites
   noted.  Discriminate function is 63 on admit.  Estimated mortality
   given her degree of elevation in the presence of encephalopathy is on
   the order of 45%.  Bilirubin continues to climb.
   - continue steroids d5 today
   - continue  pentoxiphylline
   - continue tube feeds via OGT
   - trend LFTs, synthetic function daily
   - f/up liver recs, appreciate input
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH
   withdrawal. Recent CT head without evidence of any bleeding.
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - try to limit  Fentanyl, continue taper down ativan
   .
   # EtoH withdrawal:
   - Ativan drip to max 8mg/hr now , will wean today down to 6mg/hr today
   - basal Fentanyl with boluses as needed /  weaning slowly as tolerates
   - continue on haldol 2mg q8h standing, monitor QTC (ok today)
   - continue mvt/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated, will continue to follow
   .
   #Stool changes/distended abdomen: stools more odorous and discolored
   today. [**Month (only) 11**] just simply be lactulose effects and hyperbilirubinemia vs.
   recent antibiotics with ceftriaxone. Overnight C.difficile  was
   negative
   - f/u KUB
   .
   #Electrolyte abnormalities: Chronic issue even as outpatient as she has
   need for Mg and K repletion at home. She has been having low Phos, Mg,
   K  in setting of worse liver failure
   --Will continue to check [**Hospital1 **] lytes and replete as needed
   .
   # Anemia:
   Pt with baseline anemia, also h/o BRBPR at home though none here. Had
   some oral trauma in setting of intubation causing some additional blood
   loss.
   - active type and screen, transfuse hct>21 or active bleeding
   - check Hcts daily
   - continue PPI
   - stool guaiacs
   .
   # Ventilation: Still remains intubated.
   Unable to tolerate SBT [**3-10**] tachypnea
 also may be element of fluid
   overload.  CXRs have been  clear. She had been intubated for airway
   protection / AMS.
   - Did not tolerate PSV well so will continue to rest on A/C for today
   to maintain safe airway given extreme AMS and encephalopathy.
   - Keep I/Os with goal 1L negative. Will give dose of 20 IV lasix now,
   recheck in PM
   .
   # Increased secretions/ recent fevers:  No current leukocytosis or
   fevers and lactate elevation has now corrected so may not be any clear
   infection.  Intubation with AMS on admission so need to be weary of
   aspiration PNAs and VAP.
   -CIS, low threshold to cover with Abx / holding off for now
   -f/up sputum, blood cultures
   -follow CXRs for interval changes
   .
   # Conjunctivitis: Eyes with bilateral yellowish-green thick secretions
   along conjunctivae when admitted.  Much improved eye exam with no
   crusting today.
   -erythromycin eye ointment QID ( day 5 of 7 )
   -continue to monitor ; improving
   .
   # Vaginal discharge: Patient with malodorous discharge from below. Was
   started on vaginal flagyl overnight. Patient with history of STDs
   - continue vaginal flagyl
   - consider STD testing/f/u when mental status improved
   - social work when mental status improved
   # Peripheral neuropathy
   - holding gabapentin for now given sedated

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with alcohol hepatitis and now experiencing withdrawal requiring intubation for management. She has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), presumed to be caused by increased secretions and bibasilar infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient is also suffering from respiratory failure and is intubated for airway protection. She has electrolyte abnormalities, conjunctivitis, and vaginal discharge, which are being treated accordingly. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/61 to 132/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her medical history includes ETOH abuse, ETOH hepatitis, and withdrawal. The patient's current medications include fentanyl, lorazepam, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole. She is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TF) and tube feeds at goal with free water flush. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of VAP, development of new lung infiltrates, ventilator-induced lung injury, further electrolyte imbalances, infection at the insertion sites of central lines or arterial line, stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and potential cardiac complications due to her critical illness."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of ETOH abuse, presenting with alcoholic hepatitis and withdrawal symptoms requiring intubation for management. The patient is currently critically ill and admitted to the ICU. She has several ongoing medical conditions including ETOH hepatitis, ETOH withdrawal, vaginal discharge, electrolyte abnormalities, respiratory failure, and conjunctivitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ETOH withdrawal: The patient may experience severe symptoms such as tremors, agitation, hallucinations, seizures, and delirium tremens.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to airway protection initially, but now she is tachypneic on PSV. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration and the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient has hypernatremia, which can lead to dehydration, neurological complications, and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia): The patient has increased secretions and right lower lobe opacity on CXR, indicating a possible infection. VAP can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of sepsis.
5. Liver failure: The patient has ETOH hepatitis and may develop hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and renal dysfunction.
6. DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis): The patient is at risk for DVT due"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with alcohol hepatitis and withdrawal symptoms. She was intubated for airway protection initially but now has respiratory failure and is on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is being treated with antibiotics. She also has electrolyte abnormalities and conjunctivitis. The patient's condition is critical, and she requires ongoing intensive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's symptoms of fever, increased secretions, and bibasilar infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the development of VAP. This is a potential complication in patients who are mechanically ventilated for an extended period.

2. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia, which indicates an imbalance in sodium levels. This can lead to various complications if not corrected promptly.

3. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and the use of benzodiazepines (Ativan) suggest that she is experiencing withdrawal symptoms. If not managed properly, alcohol withdrawal can lead to severe complications such as seizures or delirium tremens.

4. Hepatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with alcohol hepatitis, which is inflammation of the liver due to excessive alcohol consumption. If not treated appropriately, hepatitis can progress to liver failure.

5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of ETOH abuse who presents with ethanol hepatitis and withdrawal requiring intubation for management, complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current condition includes fever, increased secretions, and bibasilar infiltrates on chest X-ray. The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed fever, increased secretions, and bibasilar infiltrates on chest X-ray. This suggests a possible infection in the lungs, specifically VAP. The plan includes 8 days of antibiotics, follow-up sputum coverage, daily chest X-ray, and pan culture.

2. Ethanol hepatitis: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and is now presenting with hepatitis. The plan includes discontinuing prednisone and initiating pentoxifylline, lactulose, rifaximin, multivitamins, thiamine, and folate. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) will be monitored daily.

3. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient is experiencing withdrawal symptoms from alcohol. The plan includes continuing haloperidol every 8 hours and lorazepam at a decreasing rate of 20% per day. The fentanyl infusion will also be weaned.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 year old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented
   with acute fulminant hepatic failure with multiple electrolyte
   abnormalities, confusion, fevers, & lactate elevation being treated for
   alcoholic hepatitis and ETOH withdrawal, still intubated for airway
   protection.
   .
   #Alcoholic hepatitis:
   Ultrasound with poor study but patent vasculature and no overt ascites
   noted.  Discriminate function is 63 on admit.  Estimated mortality
   given her degree of elevation in the presence of encephalopathy is on
   the order of 45%.  Bilirubin continues to elevated at 37.8 now .
   - discontinued steroids today as no improvement in bili on this
   - continue  pentoxiphylline
   - continue daily lactulose and rifaxamin as below
   - continue mvt/thiamine/folate
   - continue tube feeds via OGT
   - trend LFTs, synthetic function daily
   - f/up liver recs, appreciate input
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH
   withdrawal. Recent CT head without evidence of any bleeding. Ativan
   tapered down to 6 overnight
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - try to limit  Fentanyl, continue taper down ativan as tolerates,
   taper at 4 today
   .
   # EtoH withdrawal:
   - Ativan drip tapering as she tolerates ( down from max 8mg/hr to
   6mg/hr now , trial of 4mg/hr today)
   - basal Fentanyl with boluses as needed /  weaning slowly as tolerates
   (75 today)
   - continue on haldol 2mg q8h standing, monitor QTC w/EKG
   - continue mvi/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated, will continue to follow
   .
   # Ventilation: Still remains intubated. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to new VAP by
   CXR, increased secretions
   Unable to tolerate SBT [**3-10**] tachypnea
 also may be element of fluid
   overload. She had been intubated for airway protection / AMS.
   - Did not tolerate PSV well so will continue to rest on A/C for today
   to maintain safe airway given extreme AMS and encephalopathy.
   - Keep I/Os with goal -1L negative
 gentle diuresis with PRN 20 IV
   lasix as needed
   - maintaine UOP >40cc/hr
   . .
   # Increased secretions/ recent fevers:  No current leukocytosis but Tm
   to 100.5F and questionable infiltrate overnight on CXR at RLL.
   Lactate elevation has now corrected , but this was likely more related
   to ALF.  Intubation with AMS on admission so need to be weary of
   aspiration PNAs and VAP.  Opted to start therapy overnight as below.
   -continue on Vanco/Cef/Cipro for VAP coverage for now  (day [**3-16**])
   -CIS
   -f/up sputum, blood cultures
   -follow CXRs for interval changes
   #Stool changes/distended abdomen: stools more odorous and discolored
   today. [**Month (only) 11**] just simply be lactulose effects and hyperbilirubinemia vs.
   recent antibiotics with ceftriaxone. Overnight C.difficile  was
   negative. KUB with fluid and air in colon.
   .
   #Electrolyte abnormalities: Chronic issue even as outpatient as she has
   need for Mg and K repletion at home. She has been having low Phos, Mg,
   K  in setting of worse liver failure. Also with hypernatremia with free
   water repletion
   --Will continue to check [**Hospital1 **] lytes and replete as needed
   - continue free water flushes, but decrease if Na continues to be
   improved
   .
   # Anemia:
   Pt with baseline anemia, also h/o BRBPR at home though none here. Had
   some oral trauma in setting of intubation causing some additional blood
   loss.  HCt stable at 26-28 range for several days now.
   - active type and screen, transfuse hct>21 or active bleeding
   - check Hcts daily
   - continue PPI
   - stool guaiacs
   .
   # Conjunctivitis: Eyes with bilateral yellowish-green thick secretions
   along conjunctivae when admitted.  Much improved eye exam with no
   crusting today.
   -erythromycin eye ointment QID ( day 6 of 7 today  )
   -continue to monitor ; improving
   .
   # Vaginal discharge: Patient with malodorous discharge from below. Was
   started on vaginal flagyl overnight. Patient with history of STDs
   - continue vaginal flagyl
   - send urine for chlamydia/gonorrhea, HCV, RPR
   - consider STD testing/f/u when mental status improved
   - social work when mental status improved
   # Peripheral neuropathy
   - holding gabapentin for now given sedated

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis. She presented with acute fulminant hepatic failure, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. She is being treated for alcoholic hepatitis and ETOH withdrawal. The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to aspiration risk.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has sputum and blood cultures positive for ESBL E. coli, indicating a possible urinary source for bacteremia. She is febrile overnight, which could be due to aspiration leading to pneumonia. 
2. Alcoholic Hepatitis: The patient's bilirubin levels continue to be elevated despite treatment with steroids. There is concern for poor liver function and potential progression of liver damage.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient exhibits signs consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and ETOH withdrawal. Management includes lactulose and rifaximin.
4. ETOH Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing symptoms of ETOH withdrawal, including agitation, tremors, and hallucinations. Management involves tapering down Ativan and Fentanyl as tolerated.
5. Ventilation Issues: The patient remains intubated due to new VAP and increased secretions. She is unable to tolerate spontaneous breathing trials and may have fluid overload.
6. Anemia: The patient"

She presented with acute fulminant hepatic failure, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. The patient is being treated for alcoholic hepatitis and ETOH withdrawal and remains intubated for airway protection.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Bacteremia and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has positive sputum and blood cultures with ESBL E. coli, indicating a bacterial infection. She is febrile overnight, suggesting an ongoing infection. The possible sources of bacteremia include aspiration leading to pneumonia or the urinary tract. Foley catheter has been changed.

2. Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient's bilirubin levels continue to be elevated, indicating ongoing liver dysfunction. The patient did not respond to steroids, and there is no overt ascites noted. Discriminant function is 63 on admission with an estimated mortality rate of 45%. Bilirubin continues to be elevated at 37.8.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient most likely has hepatic encephalopathy, which is consistent with her liver dysfunction and ETOH withdrawal. Recent CT head without evidence of any bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis of the liver, and altered mental status. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and encephalitis. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and sedation. He has been diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) and is on antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are unstable with tachycardia and fluctuating blood pressure. His fluid balance shows an overall positive balance. The patient's laboratory results indicate deranged liver function tests and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's care plan includes nutrition support and management of electrolyte and fluid disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Infectious complications: The patient has a urinary tract infection and has been started on antibiotics. There is a possibility of other infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infection or pneumonia.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and altered mental status may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by cognitive impairment and changes in the level of consciousness.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates potential renal impairment, which can be exacerbated by fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several ongoing medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not specified, as they are unable to provide history due to sedation and encephalopathy. The patient has no known drug allergies.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including cefepime, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, fentanyl, lorazepam, heparin sodium, and furosemide. These medications were administered on different dates and times.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (101 degrees Fahrenheit), blood pressure ranging from 122/66 mmHg to 143/82 mmHg, heart rate between 113 and 123 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 25 and 39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,289 mL and output of 3,875 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 414 mL. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 94.2 kg.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O.

Physical examination findings are not documented due to the patient being unresponsive and unable to assess various parameters.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.9 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.8 g/dL, elevated blood glucose level of 117 mg/dL, slightly low sodium level (Na+) of 130 mEq/L, normal potassium level (K+) of 4.3 mEq/L, and elevated liver enzymes such as alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST). Other lab results, including renal function tests, electrolyte levels, and cardiac enzymes, are within normal limits.

The patient's blood cultures were taken on multiple occasions, but the results are not mentioned in the progress note.

The patient has several diagnoses, including respiratory failure (not acute respiratory distress syndrome), encephalitis, alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, electrolyte and fluid disorder, alcohol abuse, and altered mental status (not delirium).

The patient's nutrition is being provided through enteral feeding with Fibersource HN at a rate of 40 mL/hour. Glycemic control measures are also in place.

The patient has multiple lines inserted, including a 20-gauge and 18-gauge peripheral IV line, as well as an arterial line. Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with alcohol hepatitis and withdrawal symptoms requiring intubation for management. She has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is now experiencing septicemia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli. The patient has also been diagnosed with respiratory failure and is currently on positive pressure ventilation (PSV). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ESBL e. coli bacteremia: The patient has a high bacterial load in her blood, which increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock. Immediate changes to the antibiotic therapy, specifically switching to meropenem, are necessary to combat the resistant bacteria.

2. VAP: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring, and there is a risk of worsening lung infection. Daily wake-up trials and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) are recommended to minimize the risk of VAP. Weaning off ventilatory support should be considered based on the patient's clinical response.

3. ETOH withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of withdrawal from alcohol. It is important to continue with the prescribed medications such as haloperidol and lorazepam to manage agitation and seizures. Tapering off lorazepam will be done gradually.

4. ETOH hepatitis: The patient's liver function tests should be closely monitored, and medications like pentoxifylline,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of ETOH abuse, presenting with ETOH hepatitis, withdrawal requiring intubation for management, and c/o VAP. She has been diagnosed with ESBL e. coli bacteremia, growing GRN out of urine and ESBL e. coli out of sputum. The patient is critically ill and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The presence of ESBL e. coli bacteremia indicates an active infection, which can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Liver failure: The patient's history of ETOH abuse suggests possible liver damage, and ongoing monitoring of liver function tests is necessary.
4. Withdrawal symptoms: The patient is experiencing withdrawal from alcohol, which can cause agitation, seizures, and delirium tremens.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration leading to respiratory failure.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT.
7. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged ICU stay.

These potential complications require close monitoring and appropriate interventions to prevent their occurrence or"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of ETOH abuse, presenting with ETOH hepatitis and now experiencing withdrawal symptoms requiring intubation for management.
- The patient has been diagnosed with ESBL e. coli bacteremia, with GNR also present in urine and sputum.
- She has been treated with cefipime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin.
- The patient's respiratory failure necessitated intubation initially but now appears to be tachypneic on PSV due to likely anxiety. CXR shows improvement with diuresis.
- The plan is to change to PSV today and potentially extubate the patient tomorrow morning, possibly using precedex.
- The patient's liver disease prognosis is being clarified by the liver team, and a family meeting is planned for Friday, hopefully with the patient participating if she is extubated.
- ICU care includes nutrition through fibersource HN (full) at 40 mL/hour, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and various lines for monitoring and medication administration.
- Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 121/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of "

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with ethanol hepatitis and withdrawal symptoms requiring intubation for management. She has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient also has respiratory failure, for which she was initially intubated for airway protection but now experiences tachypnea on pressure support ventilation (PSV). She has electrolyte abnormalities and is being monitored closely. The patient also has conjunctivitis and vaginal discharge, for which she is prescribed erythromycin and metronidazole, respectively. She is receiving tube feeds through a feeding tube and is on a regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. She is on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has shown signs of fever, increased secretions, and bibasilar infiltrates, indicating a possible VAP. It is important to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy, daily chest X-rays, and pan culture to monitor and treat the infection effectively.

2. Ethanol hepatitis: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and the presence of elevated liver enzymes suggest ethanol hepatitis. It is crucial to monitor liver function tests daily and provide supportive care, including nutritional support and medications such as pentoxifyll"

   - continue daily lactulose and rifaxamin
   - continue tube feeds via OGT
   - trend LFTs, synthetic function daily
   - f/up liver recs, appreciate input
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH
   withdrawal. Recent CT head without evidence of any bleeding.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - try to limit  Fentanyl, continue taper down ativan as tolerates
   .
   # EtoH withdrawal:
   - Ativan drip down to 2mg/hr now
   - basal Fentanyl with boluses as needed /  weaning slowly as tolerates
   - continue on haldol 2mg q8h standing, monitor QTC w/EKG
   - continue mvi/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated, will continue to follow
   .
   # Ventilation:
   Intubated [**3-10**] altered mental status over the weekend. Tachypneic on PSV
   trials. Large belly, edema, suspected VAP are obstacles to coming off
   vent
   - Consider  precedex/extubation
   - Keep I/Os with goal -1L negative
   .
   # Anemia:
   Pt with baseline anemia, also h/o BRBPR at home though none here. Had
   some oral trauma in setting of intubation causing some additional blood
   loss.  HCt stable at 26-28 range for several days now.
   - active type and screen, transfuse hct>21 or active bleeding
   - check Hcts daily
   - continue PPI
   - stool guaiacs
   .
   # Conjunctivitis: continue topical erythromycin
   .
   # Vaginal discharge: Patient with malodorous vaginal discharge. Was
   started on topical metronidazole. Patient with history of STDs. RPR
   negative, urine GC negative. GC not sent, but patient had been treated
   with cefepime which would treat GC.
   - continue vaginal flagyl
   - consider HIV testing when awake
   - social work when mental status improved
   # Peripheral neuropathy
   - holding gabapentin for now given sedated

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis presenting with acute fulminant hepatic failure, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. She is being treated for alcoholic hepatitis and ETOH withdrawal, and remains intubated for airway protection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Bacteremia and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has sputum and blood cultures positive for ESBL E. coli, indicating a bacterial infection. She is still febrile overnight, suggesting an ongoing infection. Possible sources include aspiration leading to pneumonia or a urinary tract infection. The patient is currently on meropenem, an antibiotic effective against ESBL-producing bacteria, for a planned 8-day course.

2. Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient's bilirubin levels are decreasing, but she has not responded to steroids and her MELD score is 24. She is on pentoxifylline, daily lactulose, rifaximin, tube feeds via orogastric tube, and is being monitored for trends in liver function tests and synthetic function.

3. Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and ETOH withdrawal. She is receiving lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy. Fentanyl administration should be limited, and the Ativan drip should be continued as"

The patient is being treated for alcoholic hepatitis and ETOH withdrawal and remains intubated for airway protection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bacteremia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has sputum and blood cultures positive for ESBL E. coli, indicating a possible infection. The presence of fever and leukocytosis suggests ongoing bacteremia. The patient also shows signs of VAP, with symptoms such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening respiratory status.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, as indicated by altered mental status and high levels of bilirubin. This condition can worsen if not managed properly.

3. ETOH withdrawal: The patient is experiencing ETOH withdrawal symptoms, which include agitation, tremors, and confusion. It is important to manage these symptoms to prevent complications.

4. Anemia: The patient has baseline anemia, which may be exacerbated by ongoing blood loss. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and timely transfusion may be necessary to prevent further complications.

5. Vaginal infection: The patient has a malodorous vaginal discharge, suggesting a possible vaginal infection. Appropriate treatment"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 year old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented
   with acute fulminant hepatic failure with multiple electrolyte
   abnormalities, confusion, fevers, & lactate elevation being treated for
   alcoholic hepatitis and ETOH withdrawal, still intubated for airway
   protection.
   .
   # Bacteremia and VAP
   Sputum and blood with ESBL E coli, still febrile overnight. Possible
   aspiration leading to pna. Also possible urinary source for the
   bacteremia. Foley has been changed.
   - Continue meropenem (d1=[**5-27**]), anticipate 8d course for VAP
   - Follow up pending cultures and final sensitivites, CIS
   #Alcoholic hepatitis:
   Bili down today, MELD is 24. On steroids initially, but no response
   stopped also [**3-10**] infection
   Ultrasound with poor study but patent vasculature and no overt ascites
   noted.  Discriminate function is 63 on admit.  Estimated mortality
   given her degree of elevation in the presence of encephalopathy is on
   the order of 45.
   - continue  pentoxiphylline
   - continue daily lactulose and rifaxamin
   - continue tube feeds via OGT
   - trend LFTs, synthetic function daily
   - f/up liver recs, appreciate input
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH
   withdrawal. Recent CT head without evidence of any bleeding.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - try to limit  Fentanyl, continue taper down ativan as tolerates
   .
   # EtoH withdrawal:
   - Ativan drip down to 2mg/hr now
   - basal Fentanyl with boluses as needed /  weaning slowly as tolerates
   - continue on haldol 2mg q8h standing, monitor QTC w/EKG
   - continue mvi/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated, will continue to follow
   .
   # Ventilation:
   Intubated [**3-10**] altered mental status over the weekend. Tachypneic on PSV
   trials. Large belly, edema, suspected VAP are obstacles to coming off
   vent
   - Consider  precedex/extubation
   - Keep I/Os with goal -1L negative
   .
   # Anemia:
   Pt with baseline anemia, also h/o BRBPR at home though none here. Had
   some oral trauma in setting of intubation causing some additional blood
   loss.  HCt stable at 26-28 range for several days now.
   - active type and screen, transfuse hct>21 or active bleeding
   - check Hcts daily
   - continue PPI
   - stool guaiacs
   .
   # Conjunctivitis: continue topical erythromycin
   .
   # Vaginal discharge: Patient with malodorous vaginal discharge. Was
   started on topical metronidazole. Patient with history of STDs. RPR
   negative, urine GC negative. GC not sent, but patient had been treated
   with cefepime which would treat GC.
   - continue vaginal flagyl
   - consider HIV testing when awake
   - social work when mental status improved
   # Peripheral neuropathy
   - holding gabapentin for now given sedated

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with acute fulminant hepatic failure, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. She is being treated for alcoholic hepatitis and ethanol withdrawal. The patient remains intubated for airway protection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bacteremia and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has sputum and blood cultures positive for ESBL E. coli, indicating a possible infection. She is still febrile overnight. This could be due to aspiration leading to pneumonia or a urinary source for the bacteremia. Foley catheter has been changed. The patient is on meropenem, an antibiotic effective against ESBL-producing bacteria.

2. Alcoholic Hepatitis: The patient's bilirubin levels are down, but she has not responded to steroids. Her MELD score is 24, which indicates severe liver disease with a high mortality rate. She is on pentoxifylline, daily lactulose, rifaximin, tube feeds via OG tube, and monitoring of liver function tests.

3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and ethanol withdrawal. Recent CT head showed no evidence of bleeding. She is on lactulose and rifaximin. Lactulose and benzodiazepines are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch, 94.2 kg male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis of the liver. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 130/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range except for low potassium levels. The patient has received various antibiotics including cefepime, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 223.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and alcohol abuse,"

   Assessment and Plan
   42 year old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented
   with acute fulminant hepatic failure with multiple electrolyte
   abnormalities, confusion, fevers, & lactate elevation being treated for
   alcoholic hepatitis and ETOH withdrawal, still intubated for airway
   protection.
   .
   # Bacteremia and VAP
   Sputum and blood with ESBL E coli, still febrile overnight. Possible
   aspiration leading to pna. Also possible urinary source for the
   bacteremia. Foley has been changed.
   - Change to meropenem, anticipate 8d course for VAP
   - DC vanc and cipro
   - Follow up pending cultures and final sensitivites, CIS
   #Alcoholic hepatitis:
   Bilis continue to trend up, did not respond to steroids
   Ultrasound with poor study but patent vasculature and no overt ascites
   noted.  Discriminate function is 63 on admit.  Estimated mortality
   given her degree of elevation in the presence of encephalopathy is on
   the order of 45%.  Bilirubin continues to elevated at 37.8 now .
   - continue  pentoxiphylline
   - continue daily lactulose and rifaxamin as below
   - continue mvt/thiamine/folate
   - continue tube feeds via OGT
   - trend LFTs, synthetic function daily
   - f/up liver recs, appreciate input
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH
   withdrawal. Recent CT head without evidence of any bleeding.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - try to limit  Fentanyl, continue taper down ativan as tolerates
   .
   # EtoH withdrawal:
   - Ativan drip tapering as she tolerates
   - basal Fentanyl with boluses as needed /  weaning slowly as tolerates
   - continue on haldol 2mg q8h standing, monitor QTC w/EKG
   - continue mvi/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated, will continue to follow
   .
   # Ventilation:
   Still remains intubated. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to new VAP by CXR, increased
   secretions
   Unable to tolerate SBT [**3-10**] tachypnea
 also may be element of fluid
   overload. She had been intubated for airway protection / AMS.
   - Reattempt PSV today, consider precedex/extubation tomorrow
   - Keep I/Os with goal -1L negative
 gentle diuresis with PRN 20 IV
   lasix as needed
   .
   # Anemia:
   Pt with baseline anemia, also h/o BRBPR at home though none here. Had
   some oral trauma in setting of intubation causing some additional blood
   loss.  HCt stable at 26-28 range for several days now.
   - active type and screen, transfuse hct>21 or active bleeding
   - check Hcts daily
   - continue PPI
   - stool guaiacs
   .
   # Conjunctivitis: continue topical erythromycin
   .
   # Vaginal discharge: Patient with malodorous vaginal discharge. Was
   started on topical metronidazole. Patient with history of STDs. RPR
   negative
   - continue vaginal flagyl
   - send urine for chlamydia/gonorrhea. Will need HIV testing when awake
   - social work when mental status improved
   # Peripheral neuropathy
   - holding gabapentin for now given sedated

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis. She presented with acute fulminant hepatic failure, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, confusion, fevers, and lactate elevation. She is being treated for alcoholic hepatitis and ETOH withdrawal, and remains intubated for airway protection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bacteremia and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has sputum and blood cultures positive for ESBL E. coli, indicating bacteremia. She is still febrile, suggesting an ongoing infection. This could potentially lead to worsening bacteremia or development of VAP.

2. Alcoholic Hepatitis: The patient's bilirubin levels are elevated, indicating ongoing liver damage. This condition may progress and lead to liver failure or other complications such as encephalopathy.

3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient is showing signs consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, likely due to the underlying alcoholic hepatitis. This condition can cause confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms.

4. ETOH Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing symptoms of ETOH withdrawal, including confusion and agitation. It is important to manage her withdrawal symptoms appropriately to prevent complications such as seizures or delirium tremens.

5. Ventilation Issues: The patient remains intubated and dependent on mechanical ventilation. There are concerns about her ability to"

   42 year old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented
   with acute fulminant hepatic failure with multiple electrolyte
   abnormalities, confusion, fevers, & lactate elevation being treated for
   alcoholic hepatitis and ETOH withdrawal, still intubated for airway
   protection.
   .
   # Bacteremia and VAP
   Sputum and blood with ESBL E coli, still febrile overnight. Possible
   aspiration leading to pna. Also possible urinary source for the
   bacteremia. Foley has been changed.
   - Continue meropenem (d1=[**5-27**]), anticipate 8d course for VAP
   - Follow up pending cultures and final sensitivites, CIS
   #Alcoholic hepatitis:
   Bilis continue to trend up, did not respond to steroids
   Ultrasound with poor study but patent vasculature and no overt ascites
   noted.  Discriminate function is 63 on admit.  Estimated mortality
   given her degree of elevation in the presence of encephalopathy is on
   the order of 45. Bili down today, MELD is 24.
   - continue  pentoxiphylline
   - continue daily lactulose and rifaxamin as below
   - continue mvt/thiamine/folate
   - continue tube feeds via OGT
   - trend LFTs, synthetic function daily
   - f/up liver recs, appreciate input
   .
   # Encephalopathy: Most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and EtoH
   withdrawal. Recent CT head without evidence of any bleeding.
   - continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - try to limit  Fentanyl, continue taper down ativan as tolerates
   .
   # EtoH withdrawal:
   - Ativan drip tapering as she tolerates
   - basal Fentanyl with boluses as needed /  weaning slowly as tolerates
   - continue on haldol 2mg q8h standing, monitor QTC w/EKG
   - continue mvi/thiamine/folate
   - social work input appreciated, will continue to follow
   .
   # Ventilation:
   Still remains intubated. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to new VAP by CXR, increased
   secretions
   Unable to tolerate SBT [**3-10**] tachypnea
 also may be element of fluid
   overload. She had been intubated for airway protection / AMS.
   - Reattempt PSV today, consider precedex/extubation tomorrow
   - Keep I/Os with goal -1L negative
 gentle diuresis with PRN 20 IV
   lasix as needed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with acute fulminant hepatic failure and multiple electrolyte abnormalities. She is still intubated for airway protection and being treated for alcoholic hepatitis and ETOH withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has sputum and blood cultures positive for ESBL E. coli, indicating a possible source of infection. She remains febrile overnight, suggesting an ongoing infection. Aspiration and urinary tract infection are potential sources. The patient is currently on meropenem, an antibiotic effective against ESBL-producing bacteria, for a projected 8-day course.

2. Alcoholic Hepatitis: The patient's bilirubin levels continue to trend up, indicating ongoing liver injury. Despite steroids, there was no response. Further evaluation is needed, including discrimination function, estimated mortality, and monitoring of liver enzymes.

3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient exhibits signs consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and ETOH withdrawal. Treatment includes lactulose and rifaximin. Close monitoring of mental status and electrolyte balance is necessary.

4. ETOH Withdrawal: The patient is being weaned off Fentanyl and Ativan, both used for sedation and withdrawal symptoms. Close monitoring of vital signs and QTC interval is essential.

   42 yo F with ETOH abuse, presents wtih etoh hepatitis and  withdrawal
   requiring intubation for management. Course c/b e. coli bacteremia.
   #. Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection initially but
   now tachypneic on SBT with TVs 100-200, likely [**3-10**] VAP and sedation.
   CXR improved with diuresis.
   - PS today; hope to extubate in the am with sedation plan as below.
   #. ETOH withdrawal
   - Start precedex and wean off fentanyl and ativan gtts and change
   haldol to 1mg prn [**Hospital1 **].
   - Ativan PO prn for agitation, tachycardia, HTN
   - Daily ekg
    #. Fevers: ESBL e. coli bacteremia; also growing out of urine and
   sputum. Staph aureus on sputum culture [**5-24**].
   - On meropenem D2.
   - Vanc added back today. Will follow-up sensitivities from sputum
   #. ETOH hepatitis:
   - Cont pentoxyphiline, lactulose, rifaximin, MV, thiamine, folate
   - S/p 6 day course of prednisone
   - Appreciate liver service failure input
   - Cont trending LFTs daily
   #. Access: PIVs for now; will try to avoid IJ today if possible with
   hopes for PICC tomorrow if afebrile.
   #. GOC: Clarifying prognosis of liver disease with liver team. Planning
   for family meeting on Friday; hopefully patient will be extubated by
   then and possibly able to participate on some level.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with alcoholic hepatitis and withdrawal requiring intubation for airway protection. The patient has since developed respiratory failure, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and sedation. There is also evidence of ETOH withdrawal, fevers due to ESBL e. coli bacteremia, and Staphylococcus aureus on sputum culture. The patient has ethanol-induced hepatitis, and there are concerns about liver disease prognosis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines inserted for treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and has been on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia.

2. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is showing signs of withdrawal, which can lead to severe complications such as seizures, delirium tremens, and autonomic dysregulation.

3. Liver failure: The patient has alcoholic hepatitis and ongoing liver disease, which can progress to liver failure. This can result in hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and decreased synthetic function.

4. Bacteremia and sepsis: The patient has an ESBL-producing e. coli bacteremia and positive sputum culture for Staphylococcus aureus. If these infections spread and lead"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of ethanol (ETOH) abuse who presents with ETOH hepatitis and withdrawal requiring intubation for management. The patient has been diagnosed with e. coli bacteremia and respiratory failure, for which she is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's ETOH withdrawal and bacteremia also pose additional risks. 

It is crucial to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely for any signs of worsening VAP. Regular chest X-rays and respiratory secretions cultures should be obtained. Prophylactic antibiotics may be considered to prevent secondary infections. 

The patient's peripheral vascular status should be assessed regularly due to the presence of bilateral lower extremity edema. This could indicate potential DVT formation, and appropriate prophylaxis with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin should be continued. 

Stress ulcers are a risk in critically ill patients, so sucralfate should be administered to prevent gastric ulcers. 

The patient's liver function is compromised due to ETOH hepatitis, which increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring liver enzymes and managing electrolytes and fluid balance is essential. 

Overall, close monitoring and aggressive management of these potential complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with ethanol hepatitis and requiring intubation for management of suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has been diagnosed with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) e. coli bacteremia and is now being treated with meropenem. The patient also has evidence of liver failure and is experiencing alcohol withdrawal. She is currently on multiple medications, including pentoxifylline, lactulose, rifaximin, multivitamins, thiamine, folate, and prednisone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged intubation. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, daily wake-up calls, and respiratory system compliance assessments are being implemented to reduce this risk.
2. Bacteremia and sepsis: The presence of ESBL e. coli bacteremia increases the risk of sepsis. Monitoring fever curves and repeat blood cultures will help assess the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy.
3. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is experiencing alcohol withdrawal, which can lead to severe complications like seizures and delirium tremens. Continuous monitoring and administration of appropriate medications are necessary to manage these symptoms.
4. Liver failure: The patient has evidence of liver failure due to ethanol hepatitis. Close monitoring of liver function tests and appropriate interventions, such as p"
