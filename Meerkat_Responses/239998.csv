   Assessment and Plan
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   # Bacteremia: Currently does not meet SIRS criteria. Pt admitted with
   +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur today that has not His last episode of
   fever was yesterday, though he still feels weak. BP since admission
   have also been noted to be slightly below pt's baseline (110-120s) in
   the low 100s pt had central line placed in ED. Pt
s ED cultures from
   yesterday afternoon turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC early this AM.
   Concerning that pt
s bld cultures turned positive so quickly, will
   await speciation and sensitivities. Will start on Vancomycin given his
   history of prolonged intubated and hospitalization for MRSA coverage.
   Will also started Ceftriaxone for Strep coverage. As pt received a dose
   of Zosyn in the ED will not add Pseudomonal coverage at this time. If
   pt does start to decompensate will consider starting Pseudomonal
   coverage.
   - f/u OSH bld cultures, f/u ED bld culture speciation
   - Echo to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary pt was due to
   have a repeat echo to check EF). Will discuss with Cards whether they
   would prefer a TTE or a TEE.
   # Hypotension: Pt noted to be hypotensive in the ED with SBP will
   continue small 500cc bolus. Pt likely hypovolemic given his reported
   decrease in urine output over the past few days and Creatinine of 1.3.
   Last night pt
s SBP decreased to low 80s, however he was mentating
   well. Given his low Hct a unit was type and cross matched last night
   however his BP responded to a 250cc bolus. Given his poor EF and the
   fact that he received 4l in the ED transfusion was delayed to due
   concerns of inducing a hypervolemic state. Would accept a sBP of 90s
   when pt is sleeping as long as he is mentating well.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 90s during sleep
   - Will continue bolus NS, caution as pt has EF of 20-25%
   - 1 unit has been cross matched
   - Will hold BP regimen
   # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - Will hold BP regimen given pt's hypotensive state
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Will obtain Echo today
   -Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely hypovolemic hypotension, will continue to
   follow q6hr Na and assess response to NS.
   # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.
   - Will place pt on Heparin gtt in case he needs to undergo any
   procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
   # CRI: Pt's current Creatinine noted to be back to his lowest level of
   1.1, on review of [**Hospital **] rehab records show his lowest Creatinine to be
   1.25 from several days ago. Pt's Creatinine appears to have responded
   to fluid hydration and most likely is pre-renal will continue to trend.
   -Trend Creatinine
   # NIDDM: Will continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will
   place on Cardiac/Diabetic diet.
   # FEN: Will start on pt on cardiac/diabetic diet, replete lytes PRN
   # PPx: Already on Coumadin , PPI.
   # h.o. V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6 minute
   episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is scheduled to
   have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no plans for ICD
   whilst there is a question he may be bacteremic.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a well-appearing Caucasian male with multiple medical issues and complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has been admitted with bacteremia, and his blood cultures have turned positive for GPC. He is already on antibiotics (Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone) for suspected MRSA and Strep coverage. There is a concern for infection of pacemaker wires, and an echocardiogram has been ordered to assess for endocarditis.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been noted to be hypotensive in the ED with a low blood pressure. He is receiving small 500cc boluses and his condition will be monitored. Given his low Hct (hematocrit), a unit of blood has been cross-matched, but the decision to transfuse has been delayed due to concerns of inducing a hypervolemic state.

3. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25% and was admitted for ventricular fibrillation arrest. He is currently on metoprolol and spironolactone for heart failure management. His fluid status needs to be closely monitored, and an echocardiogram will be obtained today.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which is likely due to hypovolemic hypotension. He"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   His blood culture have since returned positive [**3-21**] for GPC
s overnight.
   He remains fluid sensitive but no longer hypotensive and actually would
   like to advance diet today. He denies dyspnea. Rt IJ line placed in EW
   but he has not needed pressors thus far.
   Exam notable for Tm of 99. BP of 101/58 HR 78 RR of 12 with sats of 99%
   on RA . he is oriented to time and place and person and has excellent
   air entry in all lung fields. He does manifest a [**2-20**] PSM at left
   sternal border but there are no features of systemic embolization. He
   has hypoesthesia in ulnar distribution of right hand but strength is
   preserved. ? splinter hemorrhage in subungual region of right ring
   finger will need to be followed.
   Labs notable for WBC 6.9K, HCT of 25, K+ of 3.8 , Cr of 1.1 ( better) ,
   lactate of 1.5. CXR with cardiomegaly but no infiltrate or effusions ,
   EKG is paced at 75.
   Agree with plan to workup for endocarditis on account of high grade
   bactermia and sepsis. He has not shown signs of persistent hemodynamic
   instability and is fluid sensitive. He will need TTE ( possibly TEE)
   and IV antibiotics today ( Vanco/ CFXN). We will follow for stigmata of
   peripheral embolization closely. RIJ line is likely contaminated too
   but would hold off on D/Cing this altogether till we are sure he does
   not need pressors over next 24 hours. If there is evidence for
   vegetation, will request cardiology and cardiothoracic staff to see

","Summary:
The patient is a well-appearing Caucasian male with a history of cardiac issues, including a pacemaker insertion due to ventricular fibrillation arrest. He was admitted to the ICU with suspected infection of pacemaker wires and positive blood cultures for GPC. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/48 to 115/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's medical history includes bacteremia, hypotension, systolic congestive heart failure (sCHF), hyponatremia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), fever and neutropenia (FEN), and peptic ulcer disease (PPx).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient has a high-grade bacteremia and sepsis, which increases the risk of developing endocarditis. An echocardiogram (TTE or possibly TEE) will be performed to assess for vegetations or other signs of endocarditis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been consistently low, indicating ongoing hypotension. Close monitoring of blood pressure and continued fluid hydration will be necessary to maintain adequate perfusion.
3. Systolic"

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   # Enterococcus Bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus sensitive to
   vanco and amp.  Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted
   with +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records.
   His last episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling
   better.. BP since admission have also been noted to be slightly below
   pt's baseline (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in
   ED. Pt
s ED cultures from admission turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC.
   Initially there was concerning that pt
s bld cultures turned positive
   so quickly and he was started on vanco and ceftriaxone which were
   d/c'ed after speciation
   - f/u and send survaillence cultures
   - TEE per cardiology to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary
   pt was due to have a repeat echo to check EF) - already ordered
   - cardiology consult to determine if pacer needs to be removed in light
   of bacteremia
 new pacer placement delayed given bacteremia
   - continue ampicillian for enterococcus (sensitive to vancomycin)
   - will keep IJ line in for now, possible PICC tomorrow, will need to
   send tip for culture
   # Hypotension: Overnight was hypotensive to 70
s while sleeping and
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] t100
s upon awakening, patient was asymptomatic throughout.
   Recevied 500cc bolues with increase in pressures.  On presentation to
   the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to be hypotensive with SBP will continue small
   500cc bolus. Pt likely hypovolemic given his reported decrease in urine
   output over the past few days and Creatinine of 1.3. Last night pt
   SBP decreased to low 80s, however he was mentating well. Given his low
   Hct a unit was type and cross matched last night however his BP
   responded to a 250cc bolus. Given his poor EF and the fact that he
   received 4l in the ED transfusion was delayed to due concerns of
   inducing a hypervolemic state. Would accept a sBP of 90s when pt is
   sleeping as long as he is mentating well.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 80s during sleep
   - 1 unit has been cross matched
   - continue holding BP meds
   # Thrombocytopenia:  99 this morning, baseline 200-300, unclear cause,
   has been recently hospitalized and likely received heparin products.
   INR 2.2.
   - will send smear
   - no HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
    # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's hypotensive state
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo as above
   -Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.
   # Hyponatremia: 131 this morning, stable  Most likely 2/2hypovolemic
   hypotension,
   - trend daily
   # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.
   - continue to hold coumadin as he is therapeutic
   - will need heparin gtt once subtherapeutic in case he needs to undergo
   any procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
    # CRI: 1.0 this morning. Pt's Creatinine appears to have responded to
   fluid hydration and most likely is pre-renal will continue to trend.
   -Trend
   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD whilst there is a question he may be bacteremic.
   # NIDDM: Will continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will
   place on Cardiac/Diabetic diet.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is sepsis. The patient's 24-hour events include being unable to get an echo on Saturday, growth of enterococcus from blood cultures which was sensitive to ampicillin and vancomycin, discontinuation of ceftriaxone and vancomycin, and initiation of 2 gm IV ampicillin every 4 hours. The patient's blood pressures decreased to the 80s while sleeping and they were given a 250 cc normal saline bolus twice, resulting in an increase in pressures to the 100s to 110s. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) was 12, lactate was stable at 1.0, and mixed venous O2 saturation was 59.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/57 to 118/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is ventricular-paced, CVP is 13 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an input of 2290 mL and output of 1200 mL.

Laboratory results show white blood cell count of 8.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, platelet count of 92 K/uL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, blood glucose of 144 mg/dL, sodium of 131 mEq/L, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride of 100 mEq/L, calcium of 7.8 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.0 mg/dL, and phosphate of 2.0 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and bacteremia caused by enterococcus, which is sensitive to vancomycin and ampicillin. The patient also has hypotension, thrombocytopenia, systolic heart failure (sCHF) with an ejection fraction of 20-25%, hyponatremia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), ventricular fibrillation, and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).

The patient's assessment and plan include monitoring blood pressure, allowing a systolic blood pressure of 80s during sleep, cross-matching a unit of blood, holding antihypertensive medications, sending a smear for thrombocytopenia, considering heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and conducting further investigations. The patient is also on various medications for rhythm control and cardiac conditions, and will continue to receive appropriate care in the ICU."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient's medical history includes cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, a pacemaker, and a history of coronary artery disease. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, spironolactone, ASA, simvastatin, heparin, amiodarone, and Coumadin.

The patient's recent events include an inability to obtain an echo on Saturday, growth of enterococcus from blood cultures, and discontinuation of ceftriaxone and vancomycin due to the organism being sensitive to ampicillin. The patient's blood pressure has been low, with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s while sleeping, and has responded to a 250cc normal saline bolus. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 12, lactate level is stable at 1.0, and mixed venous O2 saturation is 59%.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is ventricular paced, and their CVP is 13 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,290 mL since 12 AM, with outputs including 1,200 mL of urine and 300 mL of blood products.

The patient's lab results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 5.7 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 89, and elevated creatinine at 1.1. Other lab values include sodium of 140 mg/dL, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride of 100 mEq/L, glucose of 144 mg/dL, and albumin of 2.9 g/dL. The patient's PT/INR is 2.2, and PTT is 33.0.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for bacteremia with ampicillin, hypotension with cautious fluid resuscitation and consideration of a transfusion, systolic congestive heart failure (sCHF) with careful fluid management, hyponatremia likely due to hypovolemic states, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and chronic renal insufficiency.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and further deterioration of renal function."

   Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted with +GPC x 1
   bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from [**1-1**]. Pt was
   started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric treatment and
   concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt also has a SEM
   II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records. His last
   episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling better.. BP
   since admission have also been noted to be slightly below pt's baseline
   (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in ED. Pt

   500cc bolus. Pt likely hypovolemic given his reported decrease in urine
   output over the past few days and Creatinine of 1.3. Last night pt
   SBP decreased to low 80s, however he was mentating well. Given his low
   Hct a unit was type and cross matched last night however his BP
   responded to a 250cc bolus. Given his poor EF and the fact that he
   received 4l in the ED transfusion was delayed to due concerns of
   inducing a hypervolemic state. Would accept a sBP of 90s when pt is
   sleeping as long as he is mentating well.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 90s during sleep
   - Will continue bolus NS pen, caution as pt has EF of 20-25%

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, and pacemaker placement. He was admitted with bacteremia due to enterococcus infection, which was sensitive to ampicillin. The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 (NIDDM), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI).

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hyponatremia, and sepsis. His blood pressure has been fluctuating, ranging from the 80s to the 100s mmHg. He received multiple boluses of normal saline (NS) to manage his hypotension. The patient's creatinine levels are stable and responding well to fluid hydration, indicating pre-renal azotemia.

The patient's medications include metoprolol for hypertension, spironolactone for CHF, aspirin, simvastatin, and glargine for diabetes. He is also on prophylactic antibiotics (Coumadin for DVT and PPI for stress ulcer).

The patient's upcoming plans include an echocardiogram (echo) to assess for endocarditis and evaluate his EF, a cardiology consult to determine if the pacemaker needs to be removed or replaced, and surveillance cultures"

   Recevied 500cc bolues with increase in pressures.  On presentation to
   the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to be hypotensive with SBP will continue small
   500cc bolus. Pt likely hypovolemic given his reported decrease in urine
   output over the past few days and Creatinine of 1.3. Last night pt
   SBP decreased to low 80s, however he was mentating well. Given his low
   Hct a unit was type and cross matched last night however his BP
   responded to a 250cc bolus. Given his poor EF and the fact that he
   received 4l in the ED transfusion was delayed to due concerns of
   inducing a hypervolemic state. Would accept a sBP of 90s when pt is
   sleeping as long as he is mentating well.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 80s during sleep
   - 1 unit has been cross matched
   - continue holding BP meds

   - no HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
    # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's hypotensive state
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo as above
   -Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.

   hypotension,
   - trend daily
   # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.
   - continue to hold coumadin as he is therapeutic
   - will need heparin gtt once subtherapeutic in case he needs to undergo
   any procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
    # CRI: 1.0 this morning. Pt's Creatinine appears to have responded to
   fluid hydration and most likely is pre-renal will continue to trend.

   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD whilst there is a question he may be bacteremic.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 3497**] has high grade enterococcal bacteremia and is on IV
   Ampicillin q 4 hrs. he has remained hemodynamically stable with no
   features of peripheral embolic phenomena.
   Exam notable for Tm of 98 BP of 105/76 HR of 85 RR of 14 with sats of
   100% on RA.  His chest is clear to auscultation and I do not appreciate
   a new cardiac murmer.
   Labs notable for WBC of5.7 K, HCT of 25.5 , K+ of 3.8 , Cr of 1.0  CXR
   with mild increased interstitial changes at left base.
   Agree with plan to continue IV antibiotics, follow surveillance
   cultures and resite RIJ line  to PICC or Midline once blood cultures
   are clean. He will need a TEE in next 48 hrs and we will arrange for
   transfer to step down cardiology service if no hemodynamic setbacks
   today. Suspicion for source other than valvular or other endovascular
   site is low. Cardiology service is aware.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is stable but prognosis is guarded.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and a pacemaker. He was admitted with positive blood cultures for enterococcus, which is sensitive to ampicillin and vancomycin. The patient's initial treatment included vancomycin and ceftriaxone, but these were discontinued after speciation of bacteria.

The patient's current assessment includes several medical complications:
1. Enterococcus Bacteremia: The patient has high-grade enterococcal bacteremia and is being treated with intravenous ampicillin. He remains hemodynamically stable with no features of peripheral embolic phenomena.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension, including a blood pressure reading of 70/23 mmHg while sleeping. This was treated with fluid boluses, and the patient's blood pressure responded to a 250cc bolus.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low at 99, with a baseline of 200-300. The cause is unclear, but the patient has recently been hospitalized and may have received heparin products. An INR of 2.2 indicates a prolonged clotting time.
4. sCHF (Systolic Heart Failure): The patient has an ejection"

   # Enterococcus Bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus sensitive to
   vanco and amp.  Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted
   with +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records.
   His last episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling
   better.. BP since admission have also been noted to be slightly below
   pt's baseline (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in
   ED. Pt
s ED cultures from admission turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC.
   Initially there was concerning that pt
s bld cultures turned positive
   so quickly and he was started on vanco and ceftriaxone which were
   d/c'ed after speciation
   - f/u and send survaillence cultures
   - TEE per cardiology to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary
   pt was due to have a repeat echo to check EF) - already ordered
   - cardiology consult to determine if pacer needs to be removed in light
   of bacteremia
 new pacer placement delayed given bacteremia
   - continue ampicillian for enterococcus (sensitive to vancomycin)
   - will keep IJ line in for now, possible PICC tomorrow, will need to
   send tip for culture

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo Male with sCHF (EF 20-25% on TTE on [**11-28**]), CAD s/p CABG (3 vs 4?
   vessel), HTN, NIDDM, A-fib on coagulation, s/p PPM, s/p recent CCU stay
   for VF arrest requiring pressor support, h.o. Pseudomonas + bld
   cultures admitted from cardiac rehab for fevers and bacteremia.
   # Enterococcus Bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus sensitive to
   vanco and amp.  Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted
   with +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records.
   His last episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling
   better.. BP since admission have also been noted to be slightly below
   pt's baseline (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in
   ED. Pt
s ED cultures from admission turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC.
   Initially there was concerning that pt
s bld cultures turned positive
   so quickly and he was started on vanco and ceftriaxone which were
   d/c'ed after speciation
   - f/u and send survaillence cultures
   - TEE per cardiology to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary
   pt was due to have a repeat echo to check EF) - already ordered
   - cardiology consult to determine if pacer needs to be removed in light
   of bacteremia
 new pacer placement delayed given bacteremia
   - continue ampicillian for enterococcus (sensitive to vancomycin)
   - will keep IJ line in for now, possible PICC tomorrow, will need to
   send tip for culture
   # Hypotension: Overnight was hypotensive to 70
s while sleeping and
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] t100
s upon awakening, patient was asymptomatic throughout.
   Recevied 500cc bolues with increase in pressures.  On presentation to
   the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to be hypotensive with SBP will continue small
   500cc bolus. Pt likely hypovolemic given his reported decrease in urine
   output over the past few days and Creatinine of 1.3. Last night pt
   SBP decreased to low 80s, however he was mentating well. Given his low
   Hct a unit was type and cross matched last night however his BP
   responded to a 250cc bolus. Given his poor EF and the fact that he
   received 4l in the ED transfusion was delayed to due concerns of
   inducing a hypervolemic state. Would accept a sBP of 90s when pt is
   sleeping as long as he is mentating well.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 80s during sleep
   - 1 unit has been cross matched
   - continue holding BP meds
   # Thrombocytopenia:  99 this morning, baseline 200-300, unclear cause,
   has been recently hospitalized and likely received heparin products.
   INR 2.2.
   - will send smear
   - no HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
   # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's hypotensive state
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo as above
   -Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.
    # Hyponatremia: 131 this morning, stable  Most likely 2/2hypovolemic
   hypotension,
   - trend daily
    # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.
   - continue to hold coumadin as he is therapeutic
   - will need heparin gtt once subtherapeutic in case he needs to undergo
   any procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
   # CRI: 1.0 this morning. Pt's Creatinine appears to have responded to
   fluid hydration and most likely is pre-renal will continue to trend.
   -Trend
   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD whilst there is a question he may be bacteremic.
   # NIDDM: Will continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will
   place on Cardiac/Diabetic diet.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of severe congestive heart failure (sCHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension (HTN), non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and atrial fibrillation on coagulation. He was admitted to the cardiac rehabilitation program for fevers and bacteremia. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which has been managed with fluid resuscitation. His blood cultures grew enterococcus, which is sensitive to vancomycin and ampicillin. The patient is currently on ampicillin for enterococcus bacteremia and will continue with surveillance cultures. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been ordered to assess for endocarditis. The patient's thrombocytopenia may be due to recent hospitalization and heparin products. His sodium level is low, possibly due to hypovolemic hypotension. His atrial fibrillation is currently in sinus rhythm. The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated but responsive to fluid hydration. He has a history of ventricular fibrillation arrest and is scheduled for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) upgrade with possible left ventricular lead placement. The patient's diabetes will be managed with insulin and a cardiac/diabetic diet."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of severe congestive heart failure (sCHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), atrial fibrillation on coagulation, and a permanent pacemaker (PPM). He presented to the ICU with fevers and bacteremia, specifically Enterococcus species sensitive to vancomycin and ampicillin. The patient's blood cultures initially turned positive within 24 hours from admission. He was started on empirical treatment with Flagyl and then switched to targeted therapy after identifying the specific bacteria. The patient's blood pressure has been stable, but slightly below his baseline range. He has experienced hypotension during sleep, which responded to fluid boluses. His thrombocyte count has increased from baseline, and he is likely receiving heparin products during his recent hospitalization. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 20-25% as per a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). He has been on metoprolol and spironolactone for his heart failure management. His sodium level was initially low but has resolved. The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently in sinus rhythm, possibly due to the pacemaker. He has a history of ventricular fibrillation arrest and is scheduled for an ICD upgrade and possible left ventricular lead placement."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo Male with sCHF (EF 20-25% on TTE on [**11-28**]), CAD s/p CABG (3 vs 4?
   vessel), HTN, NIDDM, A-fib on coagulation, s/p PPM, s/p recent CCU stay
   for VF arrest requiring pressor support, h.o. Pseudomonas + bld
   cultures admitted from cardiac rehab for fevers and bacteremia.
   # Enterococcus Bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus sensitive to
   vanco and amp.  Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted
   with +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records.
   His last episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling
   better.. BP since admission have also been noted to be slightly below
   pt's baseline (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in
   ED. Pt
s ED cultures from admission turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC.
   Initially he was started on vanco and ceftriaxone which were d/c'ed
   after speciation when he was placed on ampicillin.
   - f/u and send survaillence cultures
   - TEE per cardiology to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary
   pt was due to have a repeat echo to check EF) - already ordered
   - Appreciate cardiology consult to determine if pacer needs to be
   removed in light of bacteremia
   - continue ampicillian for enterococcus (sensitive to vancomycin)
   - Will need PICC for long term antibiotics; once placed his IJ can be
   pulled.
   # Hypotension: Two nights agao he  was hypotensive to 70
s while
   sleeping and rose to the 100
s upon awakening, patient was asymptomatic
   throughout. Recevied 500cc bolues with increase in pressures.
   Overnight last night he maintained his pressures (lowest SBP was in the
   90
s).  Would accept a sBP of 80s when pt is sleeping as long as he is
   mentating well when awoken.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 80s during sleep
   - continue holding BP meds
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Increased to 123 this morning, baseline 200-300,
   unclear cause, has been recently hospitalized and likely received
   heparin products. INR 1.9.  [**Month (only) 11**] have been dilutional from all of the
   fluids he
s received recently.
   - no HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
   # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's recent hypotension
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo as above
   - Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.  Consider adding back once recovered
   from his acute illness.
   #  Anemia: The patient
s Hct has been in the mid 20
s, today is stable
   at 25.6.  No clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue to trend with a daily Hct.
   - No current idication for transfusion.
    # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Na 137 today.
    # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.  As he will likely have the pacer
   removed, will not restart coumadin (INR 1.9 today).
   - will start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation in case he needs to
   undergo any procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD while there is a question he may be bacteremic.
   - Appreicate cards consult, will f/u recs.
   # NIDDM: BS generally well-controlled.
   - Continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will place on
   Cardiac/Diabetic diet.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), atrial fibrillation on coagulation, and a pacemaker placement. The patient presented to the emergency department with fevers and bacteremia, and was found to have enterococcus bacteremia. He also has a new murmur that may be related to his pacemaker wires.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 130s/50s mmHg range, heart rate in the 70s bpm, respiratory rate in the 18s breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. His physical examination reveals an elderly male in no acute distress, with a new holosystolic murmur noted over the right upper sternal border.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 123 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 92, and hyponatremia that has resolved. The patient's electrolytes and renal function tests are within normal limits.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypotension, thrombocytopenia, syst"

s received recently.
   - no HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
   # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's recent hypotension
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo as above
   - Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.  Consider adding back once recovered
   from his acute illness.
   #  Anemia: The patient
s Hct has been in the mid 20
s, today is stable
   at 25.6.  No clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue to trend with a daily Hct.
   - No current idication for transfusion.
    # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Na 137 today.
    # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.  As he will likely have the pacer
   removed, will not restart coumadin (INR 1.9 today).
   - will start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation in case he needs to
   undergo any procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD while there is a question he may be bacteremic.
   - Appreicate cards consult, will f/u recs.
   # NIDDM: BS generally well-controlled.
   - Continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will place on
   Cardiac/Diabetic diet.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo Male with sCHF (EF 20-25% on TTE on [**11-28**]), CAD s/p CABG (3 vs 4?
   vessel), HTN, NIDDM, A-fib on coagulation, s/p PPM, s/p recent CCU stay
   for VF arrest requiring pressor support, h.o. Pseudomonas + bld
   cultures admitted from cardiac rehab for fevers and bacteremia.
   # Enterococcus Bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus sensitive to
   vanco and amp.  Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted
   with +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records.
   His last episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling
   better.. BP since admission have also been noted to be slightly below
   pt's baseline (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in
   ED. Pt
s ED cultures from admission turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC.
   Initially he was started on vanco and ceftriaxone which were d/c'ed
   after speciation when he was placed on ampicillin.
   - f/u and send survaillence cultures
   - TEE per cardiology to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary
   pt was due to have a repeat echo to check EF) - already ordered
   - Appreciate cardiology consult to determine if pacer needs to be
   removed in light of bacteremia
   - continue ampicillian for enterococcus (sensitive to vancomycin)
   - Will need PICC for long term antibiotics; once placed his IJ can be
   pulled.
   # Hypotension: Two nights agao he  was hypotensive to 70
s while
   sleeping and rose to the 100
s upon awakening, patient was asymptomatic
   throughout. Recevied 500cc bolues with increase in pressures.
   Overnight last night he maintained his pressures (lowest SBP was in the
   90
s).  Would accept a sBP of 80s when pt is sleeping as long as he is
   mentating well when awoken.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 80s during sleep
   - continue holding BP meds
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Increased to 123 this morning, baseline 200-300,
   unclear cause, has been recently hospitalized and likely received
   heparin products. INR 1.9.  [**Month (only) 11**] have been dilutional from all of the
   fluids he
s received recently.
   - no HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
   # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's recent hypotension
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo as above
   - Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.  Consider adding back once recovered
   from his acute illness.
   #  Anemia: The patient
s Hct has been in the mid 20
s, today is stable
   at 25.6.  No clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue to trend with a daily Hct.
   - No current idication for transfusion.
    # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Na 137 today.
    # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.  As he will likely have the pacer
   removed, will not restart coumadin (INR 1.9 today).
   - will start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation in case he needs to
   undergo any procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD while there is a question he may be bacteremic.
   - Appreicate cards consult, will f/u recs.
   # NIDDM: BS generally well-controlled.
   - Continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will place on
   Cardiac/Diabetic diet.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 3497**] is feeling progressively better with increasing PO intake.
   Surveillance cultures have been clean thus far. He remains on IV
   Ampicillin for high grade enterococcal bacteremia.
   Exam notable for Tm of 98.6 BP 126/77 HR of 88 RR of 10 with sats of
   99% on RA . RIJ site is clean. Labs notable for WBC 4.8 K, HCT of 25.6
   , plts of 123K , K+ of 3.4, Cr of 1.1 .No new culture data.
   Agree with plan to proceed with TEE in am [**1-6**]. He will transfer to
   cardiology floor on [**Hospital Ward Name 3508**] today and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s service to
   provide further input based on findings of TEE. I suspect he will need
   at least 6 weeks of IV antibiotics if there is evidence for
   endocarditis. PICC line to be placed accordingly after the procedure.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20-25%, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), atrial fibrillation on coagulation, and a permanent pacemaker (PPM). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for fever and bacteremia caused by Pseudomonas. He also has a new holosystolic murmur, which may be indicative of infective endocarditis. The patient's blood pressure has been stable, and he has shown improvement in his overall condition. He is currently on ampicillin for enterococcal bacteremia and will undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to assess for endocarditis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infective endocarditis: The patient's new holosystolic murmur raises concerns for possible infective endocarditis, which is a bacterial infection of the heart valves.
2. Enterococcal bacteremia: The patient is currently being treated with ampicillin for enterococcal bacteremia. If the infection does not respond to treatment, there may be a need for surgical intervention.
3. CHF exacerbation: Given the patient's history of CHF with a low ejection fraction, it is important to"
