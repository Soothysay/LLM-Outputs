   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with h/o cardiomyopahy (EF 15%), atrial fibrillation, pulmonary
   embolism (on coumadin), adrenal insufficiency, and s/p several recent
   admissions following episode of Klebsilella pneumonia complicated by
   respiratory failure and septic shock. Presents to hospital with
   syncope, hypoxia, hypotension and altered mental status.
    .
   # Hypotension:  Given patient's acute kidney injury (with FeUrea of
   26%), complaint of thirst, low urine output, and physical exam
   consistent with dehydration, his hypotension could be solely attributed
   to hypovolemia.  In setting of fever to 103 in ED, leukocystosis to
   12.6, and recent admissions for sepsis, this seems the most likely
   cause of his hypotension.   We are currently targeting therapy to prior
   ESBL organism with vanc and meropenem.  C diff is another possible
   source, as patient with recent antibiotic course for PNA and several
   episodes loose stools.  There is also the concern for a cardiogenic
   component of hypotension, but with preserved central venous O2 sat this
   would seem to be less likely.  With his hypotension we will have to
   continue to titrate down pressors and maintain an effective cardiac
   output.
   - Norepinephrine to keep MAPs > 65
   - Gently hydrate with 500 mL boluses given EF of 15% and history of
   volume overload, as well as DNR/DNI status
   - continue empiric vancomycin and meropenem pending culture results
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, stool and sputum Cx
   - f/u c diff
   - restart home dose digoxin with the hope of improving cardiac output
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Patient was not initially complaining of dyspnea while at home. Upon
   transit to the ED was noted to have a low oxygen sat in the 70s and was
   placed on NRB and subsequently was placed on BiPAP in the ED. While in
   the emergency department, oxygen sats recovered and supplemental oxygen
   was titrated down. On the floor was maintaining oxygen sat of 100% on
   RA; however, initial ABG showed a pO2 of 56. 100% facemask was applied
   and sat increased appropriately to 441. A-a gradient difficult to
   calculate given unknown exact oxygen percent delivery with face mask.
   - Maintain patient on supplemental 3L NC and titrate down as tolerated
   - continue prn albuterol nebs
   - TTE with bubble study to rule-out intracardiac shunt as cause of his
   odd ABG findings of low pO2 despite observed normal sat
   - Consider CT chest in future to rule-out possibility of organizing
   pneumonia causing A-a gradient
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Improved overnight with MAP > 65 following
   several fluid boluses and increased pressors.  Most likely related to
   decreased perfusion of the brain, although ICU delirium is also a
   possibility given that pt has been in and out of ICU for past several
   months. Will continue to monitor.  NCHCT negative.
   - Continue rehydration and with prn fluid boluses to maintain UOP > 30
   cc/hr and MAP > 65.
   .
   # Fever: Patient noted to be febrile to 103 rectally in the ED.
   Possible that this is component of sepsis with unknown primary source
   vs influenza. No fevers since that time.
   - Empiric vancomycin and meropenem (need to readjust meds as renal
   function worsens or improves)
   - Nasopharyngeal swab for influenza DFA neg and tamiflu stopped
   .
   # Acute kidney injury:
   Recent baseline Cr 1.1 - 1.3 upon discharge on [**2170-11-27**]. At
   presentation to the ED was Cr 2.5. Urine lytes performed in ED revealed
   a FeUrea of 26%.  Cr improved to 1.7 today.
   - Continue to trend BUN/Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold furosemide unless patient becomes acutely dyspneic
   # Hyponatremia:
   Improved to 128 from 123 at discharge on [**2170-11-27**]. 132 this AM. Will
   monitor with rehydration.
   - Trend sodium
   # COPD:
   [**Last Name (un) **] recent PFTs or overall disease status. Reported to be on home
   supplemental oxygen, though unknown when this was started.
   - Investigate indications for home oxygen and history of COPD
   - Continue home albuterol, tiotropium, fluticasone/salmeterol
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 24, current Hct 28.7:
   Likely elevated from baseline because of hemoconcentration.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend with rehydration
   # Adrenal insufficiency:
   Patient on 10 mg hydrocortisone at home.
   - Increase to 50 mg hydrocortisone given stress of acute illness (day 2
   today)
   # h/o PE, on coumadin: Remote chance that a transient PE could explain
   current presentation of hypoxia and hypotension.
   -continue coumadin with goal INR [**1-30**]
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   Stable v-paced rhythm on telemetry at this time. Digoxin 0.5 on
   admission labs.
   - Restart digoxin today as above
   - Hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Hypertension:
   - Hold home antihypertensives
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Hold atorvastatin

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, adrenal insufficiency, and several recent admissions for pneumonia complicated by respiratory failure and septic shock. He presents to the hospital with syncope, hypoxia, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient is currently in the ICU, where he has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be attributed to hypovolemia due to dehydration, especially considering his complaint of thirst, low urine output, and physical exam findings consistent with dehydration. However, there is also a concern for sepsis, given his recent antibiotic use and fever. Cardiogenic hypotension is less likely, but it cannot be completely ruled out. The patient's blood pressure should be closely monitored and titrated down with norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. Gentle hydration with 500 mL boluses should be continued to avoid volume overload, especially considering his low ejection fraction (EF) of 15% and DNR/DNI status.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had low oxygen saturation in the 70s and required BiPAP in the ED. He responded well to supplemental oxygen and is now maintaining oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. However, his initial ABG showed"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with h/o cardiomyopahy (EF 15%), atrial fibrillation, pulmonary
   embolism (on coumadin), adrenal insufficiency, and s/p several recent
   admissions following episode of Klebsilella pneumonia complicated by
   respiratory failure and septic shock. Presents to hospital with
   syncope, hypoxia, and hypotension.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Patient was not initially complaining of dyspnea while at home. Upon
   transit to the ED was noted to have a low oxygen sat in the 70s and was
   placed on NRB and subsequently was placed on BiPAP in the ED. While in
   the emergency department, oxygen sats recovered and supplemental oxygen
   was titrated down. On the floor was maintaining oxygen sat of 100% on
   RA; however, initial ABG showed a pO2 of 56. 100% facemask was applied
   and sat increased appropriately to 441. A-a gradient difficult to
   calculate given unknown exact oxygen percent delivery with face mask.
   - Maintain patient on supplemental 3L NC and titrate down as tolerated
   - continue prn albuterol nebs
   - TTE with bubble study to rule-out intracardiac shunt as cause of his
   odd ABG findings of low pO2 despite observed normal sat
   - Consider CT chest in future to rule-out possibility of organizing
   pneumonia causing A-a gradient
   .
   # Hypotension:
   Given patient's acute kidney injury (with FeUrea of 26%), complaint of
   thirst, low urine output, and physical exam consistent with
   dehydration, his hypotension could be solely attributed to hypovolemia.
   Additionally supporting hypovolemia as cause of hypotension is fact
   that his blood pressure dropped with positive pressure non-invasive
   ventilation in ED, which would have decreased his right heart filling
   pressures causing transient severe hypotension. In setting of fever to
   103 in ED, leukocystosis to 12.6, and recent admissions for sepsis,
   must consider that patient septic as cause of his hypotension. Given
   this, it is reasonable to empirically treat with vancomycin and
   meropenem (target toward ESBL Klebsiella identified in prior
   admission). Slightly reassuring that lactate of 1.9 initially trended
   down to 0.9 with initial ABG in MICU. Will consider whether untreated
   stenotrophomonas from [**2170-11-20**] sputum sample should be treated. C
   diff is another possible source, as patient with recent antibiotic
   course for PNA and several episodes loose stools.
   - Norepinephrine to keep MAPs > 65
   - Gently hydrate with 500 mL boluses given EF of 15% and history of
   volume overload, as well as DNR/DNI status
   - continue empiric vancomycin and meropenem pending culture results
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - f/u c diff and stool studies
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Improved overnight with MAP > 65 following
   several fluid boluses and increased pressors.  Most likely related to
   decreased perfusion of the brain, although ICU delirium is also a
   possibility given that pt has been in and out of ICU for past several
   months. Will continue to monitor.  NCHCT
   - Continue rehydration and with prn fluid boluses to maintain UOP > 30
   cc/hr and MAP > 65.
   .
   # Fever: Patient noted to be febrile to 103 rectally in the ED.
   Possible that this is component of sepsis with unknown primary source
   vs influenza. No fevers since that time.
   - Empiric vancomycin and meropenem (need to readjust meds as renal
   function worsens or improves)
   - Nasopharyngeal swab for influenza DFA
   - Empiric oseltamivir 75 daily for 5 days pending influenza DFA
   .
   # Syncope:
   Patient's enciting event for hospitalization was fall at home today. No
   known head trauma and unclear history of fall at home, though patient
   sank to ground and felt like he may have lost consciousness.  Pacer
   interrogation did not show cardiac cause of syncope.  Given AMS while
   in ICU in context of hypotension, that is the most likely cause of LOC.
   - Continuous cardiac monitoring
   - Cont to hold digoxin while in [**Last Name (un) **]
   - Treat hypotension as above
   # Acute kidney injury:
   Recent baseline Cr 1.1 - 1.3 upon discharge on [**2170-11-27**]. At
   presentation to the ED was Cr 2.5. Urine lytes performed in ED revealed
   a FeUrea of 26%.  Cr improved to 1.7 today.
   - Continue to trend BUN/Cr
   - Renally dose meds and hold digoxin
   - Hold furosemide
   # Hyponatremia:
   Improved to 128 from 123 at discharge on [**2170-11-27**]. 132 this AM. Will
   monitor with rehydration.
   - Trend sodium
   # COPD:
   [**Last Name (un) **] recent PFTs or overall disease status. Reported to be on home
   supplemental oxygen, though unknown when this was started.
   - Investigate indications for home oxygen and history of COPD
   - Continue home albuterol, tiotropium, fluticasone/salmeterol
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 24, current Hct 28.7:
   Likely elevated from baseline because of hemoconcentration.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend with rehydration
   # Adrenal insufficiency:
   Patient on 10 mg hydrocortisone at home.
   - Increase to 50 mg hydrocortisone given stress of acute illness
   # h/o PE, on coumadin:
   Remote chance that a transient PE could explain current presentation of
   hypoxia and hypotension.
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   Stable v-paced rhythm on telemetry at this time. Digoxin 0.5 on
   admission labs.
   - Hold digoxin while in acute kidney injury
   - Hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Hypertension:
   - Hold home antihypertensives
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Hold atorvastatin

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, adrenal insufficiency, and previous admissions for Klebsiella pneumonia. He presents to the hospital with syncope, hypoxia, and hypotension. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially had low oxygen saturation levels and required supplemental oxygen. Further investigation with a bubble study is needed to rule out an intracardiac shunt as a cause of the abnormal arterial blood gas (ABG) findings. Organizing pneumonia should also be considered.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to dehydration, as indicated by his complaint of thirst, low urine output, and physical exam findings consistent with dehydration. However, sepsis is another possibility given the patient's recent admissions for sepsis, fever, leukocytosis, and positive pressure non-invasive ventilation in the emergency department. Empiric treatment with vancomycin and meropenem has been initiated.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved with adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) and fluid resuscitation. Decreased cerebral perfusion or ICU delirium could be contributing factors.

4. Fever: The patient had a high fever in the emergency department, which may indicate an ongoing infection or influenza. Emp"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo male with admission with quite significant hypoxemia with rapid
   resolution and a real minimum of radiographic findings on CXR
   concerning for extrapulmonary shunting.  He did have admission
   additionally significant for hypotension in the setting of cardiac
   dysfunction and hypovolemia with only a single fever arguing strongly
   for infectious or septic source of shock.  With intervention he has
   shown substantial improvement in the past 24 hours. However, patient
   does retain significant hypotension with wean of pressors and we will
   need to further optimize cardiac output to maintain adequate MAP.
   1)SHOCK-Septic or Hypovoelmic--at admission.  We do have concern for
   signfiant contribution from cardiogenic source of hypotension at this
   time but with preserved central venous O2 sat this would seem to be
   less likely.  With his hypotension we will have to continue to titrate
   down pressors and maintain an effective cardiac output.
   -Sputum sent for culture
   -Continue ABX
   -IVF bolus as needed for fall in CVP or decrease in urine output
   -Will continue with pacer at current settings and will have to tolerate
   the bigeminy seen although it dose lead to a realtively high frequency
   of ineffective SV with PVC
s.  I would argue that we need stabilization
   of SVR to allow full and effective wean of pressors to allow cardiac
   output to allow stability.
   -Return to po intake but will have to maintain fluid balance as even in
   the setting of diarrhea
   -Continue with stress dose steroids
   2)Acute Renal Failure--Improved urine flow and improved creatinine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male admitted with significant hypoxemia and rapid resolution. The note suggests a potential extrapulmonary shunt. The patient also had admission hypotension in the setting of cardiac dysfunction and hypovolemia with only a single fever, pointing towards an infectious or septic source of shock. However, the patient has shown substantial improvement in the past 24 hours.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. SHOCK-Septic or Hypovolemic: The patient initially presented with septic or hypovolemic shock. Although there is concern for a significant contribution from cardiogenic sources of hypotension, the preserved central venous O2 saturation suggests that this is less likely. Therefore, the patient will need continued titration of pressors to maintain effective cardiac output.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has improved urine flow and decreased creatinine levels, indicating an improvement in renal function. However, close monitoring and continued support of blood pressure and effective fluid replacement are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient is currently experiencing AFIB, and digoxin is being continued at this time.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient had an altered mental status, but it has since resolved.

5. Cardiomyopathy, Other: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and digoxin is being"

   75 yo M with h/o cardiomyopahy (EF 15%), atrial fibrillation, pulmonary
   embolism (on coumadin), adrenal insufficiency, and s/p several recent
   admissions following episode of Klebsilella pneumonia complicated by
   respiratory failure and septic shock. Presents to hospital with
   syncope, hypoxia, hypotension and altered mental status.
    .
   # Hypotension:  Given patient's acute kidney injury (with FeUrea of
   26%), complaint of thirst, low urine output, and physical exam
   consistent with dehydration, his hypotension could be solely attributed
   to hypovolemia.  In setting of fever to 103 in ED, leukocystosis to
   12.6, and recent admissions for sepsis, this seems the most likely
   cause of his hypotension.   We are currently targeting therapy to prior
   ESBL organism with vanc and meropenem.  C diff is another possible
   source, as patient with recent antibiotic course for PNA and several
   episodes loose stools.  There is also the concern for a cardiogenic
   component of hypotension, but with preserved central venous O2 sat this
   would seem to be less likely.  With his hypotension we will have to
   continue to titrate down pressors and maintain an effective cardiac
   output.
   - Norepinephrine to keep MAPs > 65
   - Gently hydrate with 500 mL boluses given EF of 15% and history of
   volume overload, as well as DNR/DNI status
   - continue empiric vancomycin and meropenem pending culture results
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, stool and sputum Cx
   - f/u c diff
   - restart home dose digoxin with the hope of improving cardiac output
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Patient was not initially complaining of dyspnea while at home. Upon
   transit to the ED was noted to have a low oxygen sat in the 70s and was
   placed on NRB and subsequently was placed on BiPAP in the ED. While in
   the emergency department, oxygen sats recovered and supplemental oxygen
   was titrated down. On the floor was maintaining oxygen sat of 100% on
   RA; however, initial ABG showed a pO2 of 56. 100% facemask was applied
   and sat increased appropriately to 441. A-a gradient difficult to
   calculate given unknown exact oxygen percent delivery with face mask.
   - Maintain patient on supplemental 3L NC and titrate down as tolerated
   - continue prn albuterol nebs
   - TTE with bubble study to rule-out intracardiac shunt as cause of his
   odd ABG findings of low pO2 despite observed normal sat
   - Consider CT chest in future to rule-out possibility of organizing
   pneumonia causing A-a gradient
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Improved overnight with MAP > 65 following
   several fluid boluses and increased pressors.  Most likely related to
   decreased perfusion of the brain, although ICU delirium is also a
   possibility given that pt has been in and out of ICU for past several
   months. Will continue to monitor.  NCHCT negative.
   - Continue rehydration and with prn fluid boluses to maintain UOP > 30
   cc/hr and MAP > 65.
   .
   # Fever: Patient noted to be febrile to 103 rectally in the ED.
   Possible that this is component of sepsis with unknown primary source
   vs influenza. No fevers since that time.
   - Empiric vancomycin and meropenem (need to readjust meds as renal
   function worsens or improves)
   - Nasopharyngeal swab for influenza DFA neg and tamiflu stopped
   .
   # Acute kidney injury:
   Recent baseline Cr 1.1 - 1.3 upon discharge on [**2170-11-27**]. At
   presentation to the ED was Cr 2.5. Urine lytes performed in ED revealed
   a FeUrea of 26%.  Cr improved to 1.7 today.
   - Continue to trend BUN/Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold furosemide unless patient becomes acutely dyspneic
   # Hyponatremia:
   Improved to 128 from 123 at discharge on [**2170-11-27**]. 132 this AM. Will
   monitor with rehydration.
   - Trend sodium
   # COPD:
   [**Last Name (un) **] recent PFTs or overall disease status. Reported to be on home
   supplemental oxygen, though unknown when this was started.
   - Investigate indications for home oxygen and history of COPD
   - Continue home albuterol, tiotropium, fluticasone/salmeterol
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 24, current Hct 28.7:
   Likely elevated from baseline because of hemoconcentration.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend with rehydration
   # Adrenal insufficiency:
   Patient on 10 mg hydrocortisone at home.
   - Increase to 50 mg hydrocortisone given stress of acute illness (day 2
   today)
   # h/o PE, on coumadin: Remote chance that a transient PE could explain
   current presentation of hypoxia and hypotension.
   -continue coumadin with goal INR [**1-30**]
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   Stable v-paced rhythm on telemetry at this time. Digoxin 0.5 on
   admission labs.
   - Restart digoxin today as above
   - Hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Hypertension:
   - Hold home antihypertensives
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Hold atorvastatin

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, adrenal insufficiency, and recent admissions for Klebsiella pneumonia complicated by respiratory failure and septic shock. He presents with syncope, hypoxia, hypotension, and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's acute kidney injury, thirst, low urine output, and physical exam consistent with dehydration may contribute to hypotension. This could be due to hypovolemia, especially given the recent admissions for sepsis. Pressors are being titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, and gentle hydration is being pursued while monitoring for volume overload.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially had low oxygen saturation in the 70s but recovered with BiPAP in the emergency department. An ABG showed a pO2 of 56, and 100% face mask increased the oxygen saturation to 441. A-a gradient calculation was difficult due to unknown exact oxygen percent delivery with the face mask. The patient will be maintained on supplemental oxygen and further investigations such as TTE with bubble study, CT chest, and ABG will be done to rule out intracardiac shunt or organizing pneumonia.

   75 yo M with h/o cardiomyopahy (EF 15%), atrial fibrillation, pulmonary
   embolism (on coumadin), adrenal insufficiency, and s/p several recent
   admissions following episode of Klebsilella pneumonia complicated by
   respiratory failure and septic shock. Presents to hospital with
   syncope, hypoxia, hypotension and altered mental status.
    .
   # Hypotension:  Given patient's acute kidney injury (with FeUrea of
   26%), complaint of thirst, low urine output, and physical exam
   consistent with dehydration, his hypotension could be solely attributed
   to hypovolemia at initial presentation.  In setting of fever to 103 in
   ED, leukocystosis to 12.6, and recent admissions for sepsis, this seems
   the most likely cause of his hypotension.   We are currently targeting
   therapy to prior ESBL organism with vanc and meropenem.  C diff is
   another possible source, as patient with recent antibiotic course for
   PNA and several episodes loose stools.  There is also the concern for a
   cardiogenic component of hypotension.  With his hypotension we will
   have to continue to titrate down pressors and maintain an effective
   cardiac output.
   - give 1U and then another PRBC if tolerates to increase intravascular
   volume
   - Norepinephrine to keep MAPs > 65: try to wean today
   - continue empiric vancomycin and meropenem pending culture results
   (curbside ID about choices and if has enough coverage)
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, stool and sputum Cx
   - f/u c diff
   - restarted home digoxin on [**11-30**]
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Patient was not initially complaining of dyspnea while at home. Upon
   transit to the ED was noted to have a low oxygen sat in the 70s and was
   placed on NRB and subsequently was placed on BiPAP in the ED. While in
   the emergency department, oxygen sats recovered and supplemental oxygen
   was titrated down. On the floor was maintaining oxygen sat of 100% on
   RA; however, initial ABG showed a pO2 of 56. 100% facemask was applied
   and sat increased appropriately to 441. A-a gradient difficult to
   calculate given unknown exact oxygen percent delivery with face mask.
   - Maintain patient on supplemental 3L NC and titrate down as tolerated
   (is on home oxygen-unclear why, so keep on if needed)
   - continue prn albuterol nebs
   - Consider CT chest in future to rule-out possibility of organizing
   pneumonia causing A-a gradient
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Improved overnight after admission with MAP >
   65 following several fluid boluses and increased pressors.  Most likely
   related to decreased perfusion of the brain, although ICU delirium is
   also a possibility given that pt has been in and out of ICU for past
   several months..  NCHCT negative.
   - Continue rehydration and with prn fluid boluses to maintain UOP > 30
   cc/hr and MAP > 65.
   .
   # Fever: Patient noted to be febrile to 103 rectally in the ED.
   Possible that this is component of sepsis with unknown primary source
   vs influenza. No fevers since that time.
   - Empiric vancomycin and meropenem (need to readjust meds as renal
   function worsens or improves)
   - Nasopharyngeal swab for influenza DFA neg and tamiflu stopped
   .
   # Acute kidney injury:
   Recent baseline Cr 1.1 - 1.3 upon discharge on [**2170-11-27**]. At
   presentation to the ED was Cr 2.5. Urine lytes performed in ED revealed
   a FeUrea of 26%.  Cr improved to 1.4 today.
   - Continue to trend BUN/Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold furosemide unless patient becomes acutely dyspneic
   # Hyponatremia:
   Improved to 128 from 123 at discharge on [**2170-11-27**]. 129 this am.. Will
   monitor with rehydration.
   # COPD: [**Last Name (un) **] recent PFTs or overall disease status. Reported to be on
   home supplemental oxygen, though unknown when this was started.
   - Investigate indications for home oxygen and history of COPD
   - Continue home albuterol, tiotropium, fluticasone/salmeterol
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 24, current Hct 28.7:
   Likely elevated from baseline because of hemoconcentration.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - blood as above
   # Adrenal insufficiency:
   Patient on 10 mg hydrocortisone at home.
   - Increased to 50 mg hydrocortisone given stress of acute illness, will
   decrease to home dose tomorrow as has had 3 days at increased dose.
   # h/o PE, on coumadin: Remote chance that a transient PE could explain
   current presentation of hypoxia and hypotension.
   -continue coumadin with goal INR [**1-30**]
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   Stable v-paced rhythm on telemetry at this time.
   - home digoxin
   - Hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Hypertension:
   - Hold home antihypertensives
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Hold atorvastatin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, adrenal insufficiency, and several recent admissions for pneumonia complicated by respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient presents with syncope, hypoxia, hypotension, and altered mental status.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has chronic ulcers on the tops of both first toes.

2. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of AFIB, which is currently stable and being managed with a v-paced rhythm.

3. Altered mental status: The patient has shown improvement in mental status after receiving adequate fluid resuscitation and increased pressors. This could be due to decreased brain perfusion or ICU delirium.

4. Cardiomyopathy, other: The patient has a baseline ejection fraction (EF) of 15%. The recent transthoracic echo shows moderately dilated and globally hypokinetic left ventricle, mild RV dilation with borderline normal function, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

5. Hypertension, benign: The patient's blood pressure is currently controlled, but it is important to monitor and manage his blood pressure appropriately.

6. Fever, unknown origin (FUO, hyperthermia, pyrexia): The patient had"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of adrenal insufficiency, hospitalized previously for Klebsiella pneumonia sepsis and congestive heart failure. He presents with hypoxemia, shock, renal failure, and arrhythmia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving norepinephrine for hypotension. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 106/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is paced, with frequent bigeminy noted. A transthoracic echo revealed biventricular hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of approximately 15%. There is a possible small patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. The patient has allergies to Bactrim, Vancomycin, Ambien, Augmentin, Cephalexin, and IV dye. His last dose of antibiotics was Meropenem on 2170-12-1, and Vancomycin on the same day at 09:23 AM. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for the current presentation. The patient appears comfortable without any pain. Flowsheet data shows ongoing fluid administration and output, with a positive fluid balance of 1,450"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with h/o cardiomyopahy (EF 15%), atrial fibrillation, pulmonary
   embolism (on coumadin), adrenal insufficiency, and s/p several recent
   admissions following episode of Klebsilella pneumonia complicated by
   respiratory failure and septic shock. Presented to hospital with
   syncope, hypoxia, hypotension and altered mental status.
   # Hypotension: Felt to most likely have combination septic and
   cardiogenic shock with low SvO2 two days ago.  Sepsis most likely a
   pulmonary source with h/o ESBL PNA.  Has been hemodynamically stable
   since admission and weaned off pressors.  Has been C Diff negative.
   Got 1 unit PRBC
s yesterday with good effect and appropriate hct bump.
   - Maintain MAP>60-65, will attempt without pressors today
   - Continue empiric vancomycin and meropenem pending culture results for
   likely pulmonary source, have added doxycycline to try to cover
   Stenotrophomonas
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, and sputum culture
   - restarted home digoxin on [**11-30**]
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely related to recurrent
   pneumonias.
   - Maintain patient on supplemental 3L NC and titrate down as tolerated
   - continue prn albuterol nebs
   - Consider CT chest in future to rule-out possibility of organizing
   pneumonia causing A-a gradient
   # Altered Mental Status: Has improved with IV fluid resuscitation and
   blood pressure improvement.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine has decreased to 1.2 from 2.0 on
   admission.  Most liekly improving with better cardiovascular status.
   - Renally dose meds
   # Hyponatremia: Improved to 134 at this time, will monitor
   # COPD: [**Last Name (un) **] recent PFTs or overall disease status. Reported to be on
   home supplemental oxygen, though unknown when this was started.
   - Continue home albuterol, tiotropium, fluticasone/salmeterol
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 24, currently close to baseline although
   given 1 unit PRBC
s yesterday with appropriate bump.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Guaiac positive stools, will investigate if he has had GI w/u in the
   past.  Consider iron studies.
   # Adrenal insufficiency: Patient on 10 mg hydrocortisone at home and
   was getting 50mg IV hydrocort x 3 days here for stress of acute
   illness.
   - Start back on home dose
   # H/o PE, on coumadin: INR elevated today so will hold Coumadin dose
   today.  Unclear risk vs benefit of Coumadin for this patient
   - Will confirm goals of care and readdress Coumadin necessity
   # Atrial fibrillation: Stable v-paced rhythm on telemetry at this time.
   - On home digoxin
   - Hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Hypertension: Holding home antihypertensives
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding atorvastatin
   # Goals of care: Will discuss with family

   embolism (on coumadin), adrenal insufficiency, and s/p several recent
   admissions following episode of Klebsilella pneumonia complicated by
   respiratory failure and septic shock. Presented to hospital with
   syncope, hypoxia, hypotension and altered mental status.
   # Hypotension: Felt to most likely have combination septic and
   cardiogenic shock with low SvO2 two days ago.  Sepsis most likely a
   pulmonary source with h/o ESBL PNA.  Has been hemodynamically stable
   since admission and weaned off pressors.  Has been C Diff negative.
   Got 1 unit PRBC
s yesterday with good effect and appropriate hct bump.
   - Maintain MAP>60-65, will attempt without pressors
   - Continue empiric vancomycin and meropenem pending culture results,
   have added doxycycline to try to cover Stenotrophomonas
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, and sputum culture
   - restarted home digoxin on [**11-30**]
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was not initially complaining
   of dyspnea while at home. Upon transit to the ED was noted to have a
   low oxygen sat in the 70s and was placed on NRB and subsequently was
   placed on BiPAP in the ED. While in the emergency department, oxygen
   sats recovered and supplemental oxygen was titrated down. On the floor
   was maintaining oxygen sat of 100% on RA; however, initial ABG showed a
   pO2 of 56. 100% facemask was applied and sat increased appropriately to
   441. A-a gradient difficult to calculate given unknown exact oxygen
   percent delivery with face mask.
   - Maintain patient on supplemental 3L NC and titrate down as tolerated
   (is on home oxygen-unclear why, so keep on if needed)
   - continue prn albuterol nebs
   - Consider CT chest in future to rule-out possibility of organizing
   pneumonia causing A-a gradient
   # Altered Mental Status: Improved overnight after admission with MAP >
   65 following several fluid boluses and increased pressors.  Most likely
   related to decreased perfusion of the brain, although ICU delirium is
   also a possibility given that pt has been in and out of ICU for past
   several months..  NCHCT negative.
   - Continue rehydration and with prn fluid boluses to maintain UOP > 30
   cc/hr and MAP > 65.
   # Fever: Patient noted to be febrile to 103 rectally in the ED.
   Possible that this is component of sepsis with unknown primary source
   vs influenza. No fevers since that time.

   function worsens or improves)

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, adrenal insufficiency, and previous admissions following an episode of Klebsiella pneumonia complicated by respiratory failure and septic shock. He presented to the hospital with syncope, hypoxia, hypotension, and altered mental status.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient is most likely experiencing a combination of septic and cardiogenic shock with low SvO2 two days ago. He has been hemodynamically stable since admission and has been weaned off pressors. He received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday with good effect and appropriate hematocrit bump.
   - Maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60-65, will attempt without pressors.
   - Continue empiric vancomycin and meropenem pending culture results, have added doxycycline to cover Stenotrophomonas.
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, and sputum culture.
   - Restarted home digoxin on [**11-30**].

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient was not initially complaining of dyspnea while at home. Upon transit to the ED, he was noted to have a low oxygen saturation in the 70s and was placed on nasal cannula and subsequently on BiPAP in the ED. While in the emergency department, oxygen saturation recovered and supplemental oxygen was titrated down. On the floor, he was maintaining oxygen saturation of 100% on room air; however, initial arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pO2 of 56. 100% facemask was applied and saturation increased appropriately to 441. A-a gradient difficult to calculate given unknown exact oxygen percent delivery with face mask.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complicated medical history of adrenal insufficiency, severe cardiomyopathy, and recent hospitalization for Klebsiella pneumonia sepsis and congestive heart failure. He is currently in the ICU with multiple complications. 

The patient's chief complaint is hypotension, and he has been experiencing multifactorial shock, including hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and septic shock. He also has a fever of 101.5°F (38.6°C) and a history of atrial fibrillation, for which he is on coumadin. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 115/46 mmHg to 97/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F). 

His physical examination reveals wheezes on respiratory auscultation, coughing up yellow thin secretions, warm and thin skin with purpuric lesions, and no peripheral edema. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.9 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL, elevated potassium levels at 5.3 mEq/L, and elevated troponin-T levels at 0.02 mg/dL. Imaging shows multifocal"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a complicated medical history including adrenal insufficiency, severe cardiomyopathy, and recent Klebsiella pneumonia sepsis. The patient's current condition is characterized by multifactorial shock (hypovolemic, cardiogenic, +/- septic), hypoxemia, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, and renal failure with hyponatremia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: This is a possibility due to the patient's severe cardiomyopathy. It occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.

2. Septic shock: The patient's recent Klebsiella pneumonia sepsis increases the risk of developing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by severe infection and inflammation.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potential organ damage.

4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is already compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration, which could lead to acute kidney injury or chronic renal failure.

5. Infection: Despite being on antibiotics, there is still a risk of infection due to the patient's weakened immune system and indwelling lines.

6. Arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and the risk of other arr"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with h/o cardiomyopahy (EF 15%), atrial fibrillation, pulmonary
   embolism (on coumadin), adrenal insufficiency, and s/p several recent
   admissions following episode of Klebsilella pneumonia complicated by
   respiratory failure and septic shock. Presented to hospital with
   syncope, hypoxia, hypotension and altered mental status.
   # Hypotension: Felt to most likely have combination hypovolemic, septic
   and cardiogenic shock with low SvO2 two days ago.  Sepsis most likely a
   pulmonary source with h/o ESBL PNA.  Has been hemodynamically stable
   since admission and weaned off pressors.  Has been C Diff negative.
   Got 1 unit PRBC
s yesterday with good effect and appropriate hct bump.
   Now feel like biggest barrier to improvement is volume overload due to
   low EF and recent aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue empiric vancomycin and meropenem pending culture results for
   likely pulmonary source, have added doxycycline to try to cover
   Stenotrophomonas (today is day 3 of doxy, day 5 of vanc/[**Last Name (un) **])
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, and sputum culture
   - Likely has some CHF at this time as is significantly volume up from
   admission, goal -1L negative daily
   - Restart lasix, will give 40mg IV Lasix now and reassess I/O
s in the
   afternoon
 may benefit from a Lasix drip to diurese
   - restarted home digoxin on [**11-30**]
   - will restart home CHF meds later today vs tomorrow including losartan
   and metoprolol
   - daily weights, will need close follow-up with CHF team as an
   outpatient
   - need to check digoxin level as doxy and digoxin can interact
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely related to recurrent
   pneumonias.
   - Maintain patient on supplemental 3L NC and titrate down as tolerated
   - continue prn albuterol nebs
   # Altered Mental Status: Has improved with IV fluid resuscitation and
   blood pressure improvement.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine has decreased to 1.3 from 2.0 on
   admission.  Most liekly improving with better cardiovascular status.
   - Renally dose meds
   # Hyponatremia: Improved to 132 at this time, will monitor
   # COPD: Unknown recent PFTs or overall disease status. Reported to be
   on home supplemental oxygen, though unknown when this was started.
   - Continue home albuterol, tiotropium, fluticasone/salmeterol
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 24, currently close to baseline although
   given 1 unit PRBC
s two days ago with appropriate bump
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Guaiac positive stools, iron studies likely iron def anemia
   # Adrenal insufficiency: Patient on 10 mg hydrocortisone at home and
   was getting 50mg IV hydrocort x 3 days here for stress of acute
   illness.
   - Now back on home dose
   # H/o PE, on coumadin: INR elevated today so will hold Coumadin dose
   today.  Unclear risk vs benefit of Coumadin for this patient
   - Will hold for now given elevated INR
   # Atrial fibrillation: Stable v-paced rhythm on telemetry at this time.
   - On home digoxin
   - Hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Hypertension: Holding home antihypertensives
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding atorvastatin
   # Goals of care: Need to discuss with patient regarding disposition as
   does not want to go to rehab but also likely not going to be able to
   take care of his sister/himself at home after discharge.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, adrenal insufficiency, and previous admissions following an episode of Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient presented to the hospital with syncope, hypoxia, hypotension, and altered mental status. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hypoxemic respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anemia, adrenal insufficiency, history of pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and goals of care involving potential disposition.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Fluid overload: The patient has been significantly volume overloaded due to low ejection fraction and recent aggressive fluid resuscitation. This can lead to congestive heart failure (CHF) and pulmonary edema.

2. Infection: The patient has been treated for suspected pneumonia with antibiotics like vancomycin, meropenem, and doxycycline. The sputum culture results are pending, and there are also pending blood and urine cultures. If the patient develops a new infection or if the current infection does not respond to treatment, it could lead to sepsis and septic shock.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with h/o cardiomyopahy (EF 15%), atrial fibrillation, pulmonary
   embolism (on coumadin), adrenal insufficiency, and s/p several recent
   admissions following episode of Klebsilella pneumonia complicated by
   respiratory failure and septic shock. Presented to hospital with
   syncope, hypoxia, hypotension and altered mental status.
   # Hypotension: Felt to most likely have combination septic and
   cardiogenic shock with low SvO2 two days ago.  Sepsis most likely a
   pulmonary source with h/o ESBL PNA.  Has been hemodynamically stable
   since admission and weaned off pressors.  Has been C Diff negative.
   Got 1 unit PRBC
s yesterday with good effect and appropriate hct bump.
   - Maintain MAP>60-65, will attempt without pressors today
   - Continue empiric vancomycin and meropenem pending culture results for
   likely pulmonary source, have added doxycycline to try to cover
   Stenotrophomonas (today is day 3 of doxy, day 5 of vanc/[**Last Name (un) **])
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, and sputum culture
   - restarted home digoxin on [**11-30**]
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely related to recurrent
   pneumonias.
   - Maintain patient on supplemental 3L NC and titrate down as tolerated
   - continue prn albuterol nebs
   - Consider CT chest in future to rule-out possibility of organizing
   pneumonia causing A-a gradient
   # Altered Mental Status: Has improved with IV fluid resuscitation and
   blood pressure improvement.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine has decreased to 1.3 from 2.0 on
   admission.  Most liekly improving with better cardiovascular status.
   - Renally dose meds
   # Hyponatremia: Improved to 134 at this time, will monitor
   # COPD: Unknown recent PFTs or overall disease status. Reported to be
   on home supplemental oxygen, though unknown when this was started.
   - Continue home albuterol, tiotropium, fluticasone/salmeterol
   # Anemia with baseline Hct 24, currently close to baseline although
   given 1 unit PRBC
s yesterday with appropriate bump
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Guaiac positive stools, will investigate if he has had GI w/u in the
   past
   # Adrenal insufficiency: Patient on 10 mg hydrocortisone at home and
   was getting 50mg IV hydrocort x 3 days here for stress of acute
   illness.
   - Start back on home dose
   # H/o PE, on coumadin: INR elevated today so will hold Coumadin dose
   today.  Unclear risk vs benefit of Coumadin for this patient
   - Will confirm goals of care and readdress Coumadin necessity
   # Atrial fibrillation: Stable v-paced rhythm on telemetry at this time.
   - On home digoxin
   - Hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Hypertension: Holding home antihypertensives
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding atorvastatin
   # Goals of care: Will discuss with family today

   last several days as his I&O have been positive. We are restarting
   furosemide, with aim of neg 1-2 L today. Will also restart losartan if
   he tolerates lasix.  [**Month (only) 8**] need a furosemide gtt to achieve adequate
