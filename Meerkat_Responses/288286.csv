","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with chief complaints of shortness of breath (SOB) and pleural effusion. The patient underwent thoracic drainage of hemothorax with a chest tube, but it was decided against further drainage. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level is trending down from 28 to 26 over the course of the night. The patient experienced a brief supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) overnight, but it rapidly reverted back to normal sinus rhythm.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117/49 to 149/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen delivery and requires respiratory support.

The physical examination reveals jaundice in the eyes/conjunctiva, normocephalic head/ears/nose/throat, no lymphadenopathy in the cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary regions, normal cardiovascular examination including pulse and blood pressure measurements, diminished breath sounds on the left side of the chest, and no lower extremity edema. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal tone.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of cirrhosis. She was admitted with dyspnea and a large pleural effusion. The effusion contained 2.8 liters of bloody fluid, with an improvement of 128K RBCs. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been decreasing, and she received between 2-4 units of blood transfusion.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/49 to 149/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. She is on a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery.

Physical examination reveals jaundice, diminished breath sounds on the left side, and no peripheral edema. Neurological examination shows attentive behavior, purposeful movements, and normal tone.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 53 K/uL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, glucose of 95 mg/dL, and bilirubin levels indicating indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Imaging shows a left-sided effusion and re-expansion pulmonary edema on the left.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Bloody effusion: The cause of the bloody effusion is unclear. Further investigations, including"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of cirrhosis of unclear etiology. She presents with hemothorax and is currently experiencing hypoxia. The differential diagnosis includes trauma, dirty tap, malignant pleural effusion, or spontaneous hemothorax secondary to coagulopathy. The patient has a history of cirrhosis but the exact timing of her OSH Hct of 23 is unclear. Thoracic interventions will be performed following the removal of the large volume of fluid. 

The patient's lab results show liver function abnormalities, including elevated levels of ALT, AST, and bilirubin. Her INR is elevated, indicating synthetic dysfunction. There is also evidence of hemolysis, as indicated by elevated levels of LDH and unconjugated bilirubin. 

The patient's blood pressure is currently within normal limits, but she has a history of hypertension. 

She is receiving supportive care for re-expansion pulmonary edema and supplemental oxygen as needed. A repeat chest X-ray has been ordered in the morning, and a repeat chest CT will be necessary once the lung re-expands to rule out an underlying mass. 

The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, and she is being advanced to a cardiac diet. Her glycemic control is also being monitored. She has multiple lines in place, including an 18-gauge, 20-gauge, and 22-gauge line. Prophylaxis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of cirrhosis of unclear etiology. She presents with hemothorax, which is an abnormal collection of blood in the pleural space around the lungs. The differential diagnosis for her hemothorax includes trauma, dirty tap (infection during pleural fluid collection), malignant pleural effusion, or spontaneous secondary to coagulopathy. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/50-124/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is currently in the ICU.

The patient has liver function abnormalities with elevated levels of bilirubin, ALT, AST, and INR, indicating impaired liver function. This could be due to cirrhosis. The presence of unconjugated bilirubin raises concern for co-existing hemolysis. The patient also has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 53 x 10^9/L.

The patient's pleural fluid analysis shows a high hematocrit (Hct) level of 23%, which may indicate a hemothorax. The plan is to perform thoracic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of cirrhosis of unclear etiology. She presents with hemothorax and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/50 to 124/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient is on supplemental oxygen via a face tent.

The patient has liver function abnormalities and cirrhosis, with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. There is also evidence of coagulopathy, as indicated by an elevated INR. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse but the exact cause of cirrhosis is unclear.

The patient has a hemothorax, which could be due to trauma, dirty tap, malignant pleural effusion, or spontaneous secondary to coagulopathy. A thoracic procedure will be performed to address this issue.

The patient's blood work shows signs of hemolysis, with elevated indirect bilirubinemia. This may be secondary to recent transfusions, but further evaluation is needed to confirm intrinsic hemolysis.

The patient's hypertension is currently under control, and she is being monitored closely for any changes.

The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, with plans to advance her to a cardiac diet. Gly"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of cirrhosis, admitted with a left bloody effusion. The patient's condition remains critical, and several potential medical complications can arise. These complications include:

1. Infection: The patient has an increased risk of developing infections due to her compromised immune system as a result of cirrhosis and the presence of a hemothorax. Infections can be life-threatening and require prompt treatment.

2. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding (hemothorax) which could indicate a coagulation disorder or ongoing bleeding from the liver. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and the need for blood products will be crucial.

3. Respiratory issues: The accumulation of fluid in the chest (effusion) can compromise lung function and lead to respiratory distress. Draining the effusion and ensuring proper respiratory support are essential.

4. Hepatic encephalopathy: Advanced cirrhosis can cause liver dysfunction, leading to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition presents with altered mental status and requires close monitoring and management.

5. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's low urine output indicates possible kidney dysfunction. Adequate fluid resuscitation and monitoring of renal function are necessary.

Potential complications that may arise from the planned procedures include bleeding during the drainage of the effusion or paracentesis, infection at the puncture site, and worsening of the patient's overall condition.

","The patient in the ICU has a chief complaint of hemothorax, which refers to the accumulation of blood in the pleural space around the lungs. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for certain noted changes.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/49 to 127/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on face tent. The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 930 mL of fluids, with an output of 539 mL including both urine and NG output. The patient's blood products and IV fluids are also documented.

The patient's laboratory results indicate low hemoglobin levels at 8.9 g/dL, decreased platelet count at 49 K/uL, slightly elevated glucose levels at 105 mg/dL, and abnormal electrolyte levels such as sodium at 137 mEq/L and potassium at 4.1 mEq/L. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, and there are abnormalities in the coagulation profile with a prolonged PT/INR and PTT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of cirrhosis of unclear etiology. She presents with hemothorax, which could be due to trauma, dirty tap, malignant pleural effusion, or spontaneous secondary to coagulopathy. The patient's hypoxia is likely caused by re-expansion pulmonary edema after removal of a large volume of fluid, as well as a small residual pleural effusion. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hemothorax: The presence of blood in the pleural space can lead to respiratory distress and decreased oxygenation.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's low blood pressure and decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally indicate compromised lung function, leading to reduced oxygen levels in the blood.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count and elevated INR suggest impaired blood clotting ability, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient has liver function abnormalities, including elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, indicating potential liver damage.
5. Hemolysis: The patient's elevated indirect bilirubinemia raises concern for hemolysis, which can occur due to various reasons such as transfusion reactions or underlying conditions.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests potential kidney impairment.
7. Pulmonary edema: The removal of a large volume of pleural fluid may cause re-expansion pulmonary edema"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of cirrhosis of unclear etiology. She presents with hemothorax, which could be due to trauma, dirty tap, malignant pleural effusion, or spontaneous secondary to coagulopathy. The differential diagnosis includes these possibilities. The patient's hypoxia is currently likely secondary to re-expansion pulmonary edema after removal of a large volume of fluid as well as small residual pleural effusion.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient had a thoracentesis procedure where bloody fluid was obtained. This suggests the possibility of bleeding complications, which could be related to her coagulopathy.

2. Infection: The patient's pleural fluid culture is pending, indicating a possible concern for infection. The presence of pleural effusion can increase the risk of infection, such as pneumonia or empyema.

3. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has liver cirrhosis of unclear etiology, with elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). This suggests potential liver dysfunction, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or hepatorenal syndrome.

4. Hemolysis: The patient's elevated indirect bilirubinemia raises concern for hemolysis. This could be secondary to recent blood transfusions, but further evaluation is needed to confirm intrinsic"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of cirrhosis of unclear etiology. She presents with hemothorax and is doing well after a thoracentesis procedure yesterday. The patient has a bloody effusion, which is not classified as hemothorax based on hematocrit levels. A pending blood culture has been ordered.

Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 98/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on face tent. The patient appears comfortable and shows no signs of distress.

Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, more pronounced on the left side. There are no apparent scars on the abdomen, which is non-distended and soft without tenderness. No peripheral edema or cyanosis is observed, and the patient's extremities are warm. Neurological examination shows normal findings, with symmetric reflexes and downward-going toes.

Laboratory results indicate liver function abnormalities, including elevated ALT and AST levels. Hemoglobin levels are within normal range, but platelet count is slightly low at 53,000/mm³. Other lab results, such as white blood cell count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes, are within normal limits. Pleural fluid analysis reveals no organisms seen on gram stain.

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with cirrhosis of unknown etiology presenting with a new left hemothorax and bloody pleural effusion. The patient experienced transient supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) during thoracentesis, in which 1800cc of bloody fluid was removed with a hematocrit (Hct) of 7%. Another episode of transient SVT occurred this morning.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 79 bpm (with a range of 78-108 bpm), blood pressure of 98/49 mmHg (with a range of 98-128/40-55 mmHg), respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (with a range of 16-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95% on face tent.

The patient has diminished breath sounds on the left base, and the chest X-ray shows an improved left effusion. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, platelet count of 53 K/uL, blood glucose of 95 mg/dL, sodium of 139 mEq/L, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, and creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL.

   69 yo female with cirrhosis of unclear etiology, transferred from OSH
   with large pleural effusion. Repeat thoracentesis yesterday with 1.8
   liter bloody fluid- pleural hct 7. Dx para done today.
   For pleural effusion, may be hep. Hydrothorax complicated by initial
   traumatic tap. LDH presumably high (no serum LDH
.) but may be related
   to amount of blood; pleural prot/albumin now consistent with this. Will
   f/u OSH pleural cytology. Repeat CT did not demonstrate lung lesions,
   though as the pleural fluid already appears to be re-accumulating,
   there was too much compressive atelectasis to visualize the LLL. For
   cirrhosis, hepatology continuing to follow; multiple labs pending and
   need to review outside w/u. Urine output falling today, may reflect
   pt
s limted po intake and amt of fluid recently removed- will try
   gentle fluid resuscitation.

The patient is a 69-year-old female with cirrhosis of unknown etiology, presenting with new left hemothorax and bloody pleural effusion. The patient experienced a transient supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) during thoracentesis and another episode of SVT this morning. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 98/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on face tent. The patient is awake, alert, and oriented, with no leg edema. Lab results show anemia, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal coagulation profile. Imaging reveals improvement in the left pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Hydrothorax: This refers to the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space due to liver disease. If not properly managed, it can lead to respiratory distress and further complications.
2. Spontaneous Bacterial Empyema (SBEM): The presence of bloody pleural effusion increases the risk of SBEM, which is an infection within the pleural space. Early identification and appropriate antibiotic treatment are crucial to prevent worsening of the condition.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: As the patient has cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy due to worsening liver function.
2. Infection, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is common in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.
3. Coagulopathy and potential bleeding complications due to low platelet count and prolonged clotting times.
4. Respiratory distress or failure if the pleural effusion worsens or if there are complications from the thoracentesis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of cirrhosis of unclear etiology. She presents with hemothorax and is doing well after thoracentesis yesterday. The patient has liver function abnormalities, including elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, suggesting possible biliary obstruction. There is concern for co-existing hemolysis based on fractionated bilirubin results. The patient's INR is elevated, indicating synthetic dysfunction of the liver.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is borderline hypotensive, which may indicate inadequate fluid resuscitation or ongoing blood loss.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 95%) suggests inadequate oxygenation, possibly due to the presence of bloody effusion or respiratory complications.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status (evident from the decreased urine output) may indicate hepatic encephalopathy, a potential complication of cirrhosis.
4. Coagulopathy: The elevated INR suggests impaired liver function, which increases the risk of bleeding and coagulopathy.
5. Infection: The presence of ascites and recent invasive procedures (e.g., thoracentesis) increase the risk of infection, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
6. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's poor urine output and elevated creatinine levels raise concern for hepatoren"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of cirrhosis of unclear etiology. She presents with recurrent bloody pleural effusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 112/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, regular rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops, and no peripheral edema. Neurological examination shows normal findings. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated platelet count. Liver function tests show mild abnormalities. Imaging reveals a large simple left pleural effusion, relaxation atelectasis in adjacent lung parenchyma, small focus of ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe, nodular liver, and borderline splenomegaly. The patient has been started on Lasix and spironolactone to help remove fluid and is scheduled for follow-up with liver recommendations. The patient's urine output has improved with the administration of 250 mL bolus. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is borderline hypotensive, which may indicate potential hypotension.
2. Hypoxia: Although the patient's oxygen"

","The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of cirrhosis of unclear etiology. She presents with hemothorax and is doing well after thoracentesis yesterday. The patient has bloody hepatic hydrothorax with hypoxia, likely due to ascitic fluid with some bleeding/trauma after the initial thoracentesis. There is a bloody effusion but not hemothorax based on Hct.

The patient also has poor urine output, with a bolus of 250 mL given to account for fluid shifts from the tap yesterday. The patient's cirrhosis appears to be primarily a biliary picture based on liver function tests (LFTs). However, fractionated bilirubin shows predominately unconjugated bilirubin, raising concern for co-existing hemolysis. INR elevation is indicative of synthetic dysfunction.

The patient has been advised to follow up with a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management of her liver condition. She will need further diagnostic tests, including a repeat chest X-ray (PM CXR), interventional procedures (IP/thoracentesis recs), liver recommendations (Liver recs), and a prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time/inr (PT/PTT/INR) test.

In terms of medical complications that can arise, the patient is at risk for developing hepatorenal syndrome due to her liver dysfunction and poor urine output. She may also be at risk for"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis presenting with a large left pleural effusion. The patient underwent paracentesis twice on [**2176-3-2**] and an EEG on [**2176-3-2**] at 03:30 PM. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4 C (99.3 F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/45-128/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97% on nasal cannula. The patient appears comfortable and is not in acute distress.

Physical examination reveals dullness to percussion and diminished breath sounds on the left side, indicating a large pleural effusion. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities and jaundice. Neurological examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately.

Laboratory results indicate low hemoglobin levels at 8.4 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count at 45 K/uL, elevated bilirubin levels at 14 mg/dL, and altered liver function tests with an INR of 2.5. Fluid analysis shows a SAAG (Serum-Ascites Albumin Gradient) greater than 1.5, suggesting that the pleural effusion is likely related to cirrhosis. Imaging reveals b"

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Ms. [**Known lastname 13435**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 347**], whose note above reflects
   my input, as does the ICU team note from today.  I would add/emphasize
   that this 69 y/o woman with cirrhosis and pleural effusion was admitted
   with respiratory distress that was presumably related to re-expansion
   pulmonary edema.  Seen by I.P., and repeat thoracentesis without
   specific diagnosis.  Respiratory distress has resolved.  Differential
   for her effusion remains quite broad.  Will follow cultures, cytology,
   and other pleural studies.  In addition, given her multiple cardiac
   murmurs (?including diastolic), would also check echo.  Can consider
   TFTs if other evidence of hypothyroidism.  To floor.  Discussed with
   patient and family; all questions answered.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis presenting with a large left pleural effusion. The patient underwent paracentesis twice and an EEG was performed. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4 C (99.3 F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/45 to 128/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and has normal sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals dullness on percussion and diminished breath sounds on the left side, indicating the presence of pleural effusion. The patient also has trace edema in both lower extremities and jaundice. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, and has purposeful movements.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased platelet count, and normal liver enzymes. Other lab values, including electrolytes, albumin, and kidney function tests, are within normal limits. Imaging shows bilateral effusions, with the left side being moderate and the right side being small with associated atelectasis. Ascitic fluid analysis shows no growth.

Assessment and plan include cirrhosis of the liver"
