   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5651**] is a 59yo male with cirrhosis and known esophageal varices
   who presents with coffee ground emesis and positive NG lavage.
   .
   1)UGIB: Patient presents with coffee ground emesis and positive NG
   lavage in the setting of known varices. Endoscopy last night showed
   multiple blood clots.
   - Repeat endoscopy this AM performed. Banded 5 esophageal varices.
   - Continue Protonix, octreotride, cipro, flagyl
   - GI has recommended Carafate once patient extubated and can take pos.
   - Active type and screen
   - Hct TID. Transfuse to keep HCT > 30
   .
   2)Respiratory: Patient was electively intubated for airway protection
   for endoscopy. Received Propafol for sedation. RSBI 27.
   - Extubation after re-scope
   .
   3)Cirrhosis: Patient has known cirrhosis [**3-13**] NASH and ETOH. He has
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction given elevated INR. He has hx of
   encephalopathy.
   - Lactualose via NG tube
   - follow up liver recs
   - Hold Nadolol since pt is NPO
   .
   4) Cardiomegaly seen on CXR: Cardiac exam RRR, systolic murmur. No
   recent echo in our system.
   -obtain echo to eval for effusion vs. atrial dilatation
   .
   5) Fever and rising WBC: Patient may have aspirated with EGD or with
   placement of NG tube. CXR shows mild retrocardiac opacity
infiltrate
   vs. atelectasis. Will not start antibiotics unless patient continues to
   be febrile or has persistent leukocytosis.
   -obtain sputum culture prior to extubation.
   .
   4)Type 2 DM: Patient on Lantus and Humilin as an outpatient.
   - Hold outpatient regimen for now given that he is NPO
   .
   5)Peripheral neuropathy: Hold Neurontin for now since he is NPO.
   .
   6)FEN: advance diet to clears, IVFs
   .
   7)Prophylaxis: No heparin SQ given UGIB; pneumoboots; continue PPI
   .
   8)Access: 2 PIVs
   .
   9)Dispo: Pending above work-up

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and known esophageal varices. He presents with coffee ground emesis and positive NG lavage. Endoscopy showed multiple blood clots. The patient was intubated for airway protection during endoscopy. He has evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an elevated INR. He also has a history of encephalopathy. The patient's current condition is unstable, and he requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient presents with coffee ground emesis and positive NG lavage in the setting of known varices. Repeat endoscopy may be necessary to assess the severity and determine the need for further interventions.
2. Respiratory issues: The patient was electively intubated for airway protection during endoscopy. Monitoring of respiratory status and consideration for extubation after re-scope are important.
3. Cirrhosis-related complications: The patient has known cirrhosis with synthetic dysfunction indicated by an elevated INR. He also has a history of encephalopathy. Management of liver failure symptoms, such as lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, and consideration of enema vs. PO via NGT should be addressed.
4. Type 2 DM management: The patient's outpatient regimen for type 2 diabetes should be held due to being NPO.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and known esophageal varices.
- He presents with coffee ground emesis and positive NG lavage, indicating upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).
- Endoscopy revealed multiple blood clots in the stomach.
- The patient was intubated for airway protection during the endoscopy and received propofol for sedation.
- He has evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an elevated INR and a history of encephalopathy.
- The patient has several comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with ethanol (ETOH) use.
- He is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UGIB: The patient has ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypotension, shock, and potential organ failure.
2. Respiratory: Due to the elective intubation for airway protection, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory complications.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient's known cirrhosis puts him at risk for complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatopulmonary syndrome.
4. Type 2 DM: The patient's diabetes may be poorly controlled due to his current NPO"

   FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler imaging was obtained in the
   right upper
   quadrant. The liver echotexture is coarse without evidence of focal
   lesion,
   similar to [**2158-3-7**]. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary
   dilatation.
   The common bile duct measures 5 mm. Gallbladder wall thickening likely
   relates
   to fluid overload. There is no evidence of gallstones or cholecystitis.
   The
   main portal vein and its branches demonstrate normal waveforms and
   flow. The
   IVC and hepatic veins are patent and demonstrate normal anterograde
   flow. The
   main hepatic artery is patent with normal sharp upstroke and
   anterograde flow
   throughout. The splenic vein demonstrates normal waveforms and flow.
   Splenomegaly measuring up to 24 cm is unchanged since [**2158-3-7**].
   Incidentally
   noted is an avascular, anechoic, well circumscribed 1.5 cm lesion in
   the
   spleen which represents cyst.
   IMPRESSION: Stable exam since [**2158-3-7**]. Patent hepatic vasculature.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5651**] is a 59yo male with cirrhosis and known esophageal varices
   who presents with coffee ground emesis and positive NG lavage.
   .
   1)UGIB: Patient presented with coffee ground emesis and positive NG
   lavage in the setting of known varices. Endoscopy  showed multiple
   blood clots. Had 5 esophageal varices banded. HCT over night 37.4 to
   33.0.  No active signs of bleeding. BP stable.
   - Continue Protonix, octreotride
   -D/c cipro, start ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis, given that we
   also treat for CA-pna (see below)
   - Continue Carafate and lactulose
   - Active type and screen
   - Hct TID. Transfuse to keep HCT > 30
   .
   2)Respiratory: Patient was electively intubated for airway protection
   for endoscopy. Extubated successfully yesterday.
   .
   3)Cirrhosis: Patient has known cirrhosis [**3-13**] NASH and ETOH. He has
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction given elevated INR. He has hx of
   encephalopathy.
   - Lactualose via NG tube
   - follow up liver recs
   - Hold Nadolol until HCT stabilizes. Consider restarting nadolol
   tomorrow
   -start Rifaximin
   .
   4) Cardiomegaly seen on CXR: Cardiac exam RRR, systolic murmur. No
   recent echo in our system. Echo from [**6-7**] shows mild MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. No
   obvious effusion or ventricular dysfunction.
   .
   5) Fever and leukocytosis: Patient may have aspirated with EGD or with
   placement of NG tube. CXR shows LLL infiltrate. Sputum culture from
   [**6-7**] growing 4+ GPCs in pairs and clusters. Patient does not have
   abdominal pain.
   -consider starting Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for CA-pneumonia
   -follow up sputum culture
   -obtain UA, Urine culture
   .
   6) Thrombocytopenia: Platelets dropping. Baseline 60-80s. If patient
   actively bleeding, would give FFP. This is likely secondary to liver
   disease. Not getting heparin, so less concerned for HIT.
   -continue to monitor daily
   .
   7)Type 2 DM: Patient on Lantus and Humilin as an outpatient.
   - SSI, qid fingersticks
   .
   8)Peripheral neuropathy: Restart outpatient neurontin
   .
   9)FEN: NPO, aspiration precautions. Maintenance IV fluids.
   .
   10)Prophylaxis: No heparin SQ given UGIB; pneumoboots; continue PPI
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and known esophageal varices who presents with coffee ground emesis and positive NG lavage. He underwent endoscopy, which showed multiple blood clots, and had 5 esophageal varices banded. The patient's HCT decreased from 37.4 to 33.0 overnight, indicating some blood loss but no active signs of bleeding. His vital signs are stable, and he is currently intubated in the ICU. The patient has a history of NASH and ETOH-related cirrhosis, evidence of synthetic dysfunction with an elevated INR, and previous encephalopathy. He also has type 2 diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and is on long-term insulin therapy. The patient is experiencing fever and leukocytosis, with a sputum culture growing 4+ GPCs in pairs and clusters, suggesting a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. Additionally, the patient has thrombocytopenia with a dropping platelet count, likely secondary to liver disease.

Potential medical complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to esophageal varices.
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Hepatic encephalopathy due to liver dysfunction and high ammonia levels.
4. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and known esophageal varices who presented with coffee ground emesis and positive NG lavage. He was electively intubated for airway protection during endoscopy and successfully extubated yesterday. The patient has known cirrhosis with synthetic dysfunction and a history of encephalopathy. He also has type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, and is obese. The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate aspiration or infection, as suggested by the sputum culture growing 4+ GPCs. The patient has thrombocytopenia and is currently receiving various medications including octreotide, pantoprazole, midazolam, and fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to esophageal varices: The patient's presentation with coffee ground emesis and positive NG lavage suggests ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This complication is a concern given the patient's known history of esophageal varices.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient was electively intubated for airway protection during endoscopy and successfully extubated yesterday. However, his current respiratory status is concerning with a low SpO2 level of 90% and the presence of fever and leukocytosis, which may indicate a possible infection or pneumonia.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The"

   FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler imaging was obtained in the
   right upper
   quadrant. The liver echotexture is coarse without evidence of focal
   lesion,
   similar to [**2158-3-7**]. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary
   dilatation.
   The common bile duct measures 5 mm. Gallbladder wall thickening likely
   relates
   to fluid overload. There is no evidence of gallstones or cholecystitis.
   The
   main portal vein and its branches demonstrate normal waveforms and
   flow. The
   IVC and hepatic veins are patent and demonstrate normal anterograde
   flow. The
   main hepatic artery is patent with normal sharp upstroke and
   anterograde flow
   throughout. The splenic vein demonstrates normal waveforms and flow.
   Splenomegaly measuring up to 24 cm is unchanged since [**2158-3-7**].
   Incidentally
   noted is an avascular, anechoic, well circumscribed 1.5 cm lesion in
   the
   spleen which represents cyst.
   IMPRESSION: Stable exam since [**2158-3-7**]. Patent hepatic vasculature.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5651**] is a 59yo male with cirrhosis and known esophageal varices
   who presents with coffee ground emesis and positive NG lavage.
   .
   1)UGIB: Patient presented with coffee ground emesis and positive NG
   lavage in the setting of known varices. Endoscopy  showed multiple
   blood clots. Had 5 esophageal varices banded. HCT over night 37.4 to
   33.0.  No active signs of bleeding. BP stable.
   - Continue Protonix, octreotride, cipro, flagyl
   - Continue Carafate and lactulose
   - Active type and screen
   - Hct TID. Transfuse to keep HCT > 30
   .
   2)Respiratory: Patient was electively intubated for airway protection
   for endoscopy. Extubated successfully yesterday.
   .
   3)Cirrhosis: Patient has known cirrhosis [**3-13**] NASH and ETOH. He has
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction given elevated INR. He has hx of
   encephalopathy.
   - Lactualose via NG tube
   - follow up liver recs
   - Hold Nadolol since pt is NPO
   .
   4) Cardiomegaly seen on CXR: Cardiac exam RRR, systolic murmur. No
   recent echo in our system. Echo from [**6-7**] shows mild MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. No
   obvious effusion or ventricular dysfunction.
   .
   5) Fever and leukocytosis: Patient may have aspirated with EGD or with
   placement of NG tube. CXR shows mild retrocardiac opacity
infiltrate
   vs. atelectasis. Sputum culture from [**6-7**] growing 4+ GPCs in pairs and
   clusters.
   -consider starting Vancomycin for CA-pneumonia
   -follow up sputum culture
   .
   4)Type 2 DM: Patient on Lantus and Humilin as an outpatient.
   - SSI, qid fingersticks
   .
   5)Peripheral neuropathy: Restart outpatient neurontin
   .
   6)FEN: advance diet to full liquids
   .
   7)Prophylaxis: No heparin SQ given UGIB; pneumoboots; continue PPI
   .
   8)Access: 2 PIVs
   .
   9)Dispo: Pending above work-up

","Summary:
The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics and medications for pain control. They have experienced a gastrointestinal bleed, as indicated by the presence of black stool overnight. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slightly low blood pressure. They are on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and have a SpO2 of 95%. The patient's labs show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. There are also concerns about the patient's risk for falls and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The presence of black stool suggests active bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to significant blood loss and potential shock.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating a potential risk for low blood flow to vital organs.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may suggest an ongoing infection, possibly related to the patient's recent antibiotic use.
4. Anemia: The low hemoglobin levels could indicate anemia, which may be due to the gastrointestinal bleed or other underlying causes.
5. Liver dysfunction: Abnormal liver function tests may suggest hepatic involvement, potentially related to the patient's overall condition or medication use.
6. Risk for falls: The patient is labeled as high risk for falls, which could increase the risk of injury if not properly monitored and managed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5651**] is a 59yo male with cirrhosis and known esophageal varices
   who presents with coffee ground emesis and positive NG lavage.
   .
   1)UGIB: Patient presented with coffee ground emesis and positive NG
   lavage in the setting of known varices. Endoscopy  showed multiple
   blood clots. Had 5 esophageal varices banded last AM. HCT stable over
   night.  No active signs of bleeding. BP stable.
   - Continue Protonix, octreotride
   - cont. ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis, given that we
ll also treat
   for CA-pna (see below)
   - Continue Carafate and lactulose
   - Active type and screen
   - Hct TID. Transfuse to keep HCT > 30
   .
   2)Respiratory: Patient was electively intubated for airway protection
   for endoscopy.
   .
   3)Cirrhosis: Patient has known cirrhosis [**3-13**] NASH and ETOH. He has
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction given elevated INR. He has hx of
   encephalopathy.
   - Lactualose
   - follow up liver recs
   - Hold Nadolol until HCT stabilizes. Consider restarting nadolol
   tomorrow
   - cont. Rifaximin
   .
   4) Cardiomegaly seen on CXR: Cardiac exam RRR, systolic murmur. No
   recent echo in our system. Echo from [**6-7**] shows mild MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. No
   obvious effusion or ventricular dysfunction.
   .
   5) Fever and leukocytosis: CXR shows LLL infiltrate. Sputum culture
   from [**6-7**] growing 4+ GPCs in pairs and clusters, now speciated as staph
   aureus. Patient does not have abdominal pain.
   -consider starting Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for CA-pneumonia
   - F/U BCx.
   6) Thrombocytopenia: Platelets dropping. Baseline 60-80s. If patient
   actively bleeding, would give FFP. This is likely secondary to liver
   disease. Not getting heparin, so less concerned for HIT.
   -continue to monitor daily
   .
   7)Type 2 DM: Patient on Lantus and Humilin as an outpatient.
   - SSI, qid fingersticks
   .
   8)Peripheral neuropathy: Restart outpatient neurontin
   .
   9)FEN: NPO as diet except for meds, aspiration precautions. Maintenance
   IV fluids.
   .
   10)Prophylaxis: No heparin SQ given UGIB; pneumoboots; continue PPI
   .
   11)Access: 2 PIVs
   .
   12)Dispo: Floor

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5651**] is a 59yo male with cirrhosis and known esophageal varices
   who presents with coffee ground emesis and positive NG lavage.
   .
   # UGIB: Patient presented with coffee ground emesis and positive NG
   lavage in the setting of known varices. Endoscopy  showed multiple
   blood clots. Had 5 esophageal varices banded last AM. HCT stable over
   night.  No active signs of bleeding. BP stable.
   - Continue Protonix, octreotride as per liver team
   - cont. ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis, given that we
ll also treat
   for CA-pna (see below)
   - Continue Carafate and lactulose
   - Active type and screen
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Patient has known cirrhosis [**3-13**] NASH and ETOH. He has
   evidence of synthetic dysfunction given elevated INR. He has hx of
   encephalopathy.
   - Lactualose
   - follow up liver recs
   - Hold Nadolol as per liver recs
   - cont. Rifaximin
   ..
   # Fever and leukocytosis: CXR shows LLL infiltrate. Sputum culture from
   [**6-7**] growing 4+ GPCs in pairs and clusters, now speciated as staph
   aureus. Patient does not have abdominal pain.
   - Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for CA-pneumonia
   - F/U BCx.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets dropping. Baseline 60-80s. If patient
   actively bleeding, would give FFP. This is likely secondary to liver
   disease. Not getting heparin, so less concerned for HIT.
   -continue to monitor daily
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Patient on Lantus and Humilin as an outpatient.
   - SSI, qid fingersticks
   .
   # Peripheral neuropathy: Restart outpatient neurontin
   .
   # FEN: diabetic diet, aspiration precautions. Maintenance IV fluids.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: No heparin SQ given UGIB; pneumoboots; continue PPI
   .
   # Access: 2 PIVs

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and known esophageal varices. He presented with coffee ground emesis and positive NG lavage, indicating upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Endoscopy showed multiple blood clots, and the patient underwent esophageal varices banding. His hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has been stable overnight, with no active signs of bleeding or hypotension. The patient is currently receiving proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), octreotide, ceftriaxone, Carafate, and lactulose.

Assessment and Plan:
1. UGIB: The patient's presentation with coffee ground emesis and positive NG lavage suggests UGIB due to esophageal varices. No active bleeding is currently observed.
   - Continue Protonix, octreotide as per liver team
   - Continue ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis, given that we will also treat for CA-pna (see below)
   - Continue Carafate and lactulose
   - Active type and screen

2. Cirrhosis: The patient has known cirrhosis secondary to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and alcohol use. He exhibits synthetic dysfunction with an elevated INR and has a history of encephalopathy.
   - Lactulose
   - Follow-up liver recommendations
   - Hold nad"
