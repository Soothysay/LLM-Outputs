   Pt. did not repsond to diltiazem, possibly [**3-16**] volume depletion.
   Clearly not responding to volume resuscitation this time around.  The
   cause of afib is unclear, bu likely [**3-16**] structural disease w/ [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]

   is volume overloaded, likely contributing. Possibly also contributed to
   by hypocalcemia, but unsure if the lab results from ED are valid. Per
   previous OMR d/c summary, she was poor candidate for  anticoagulation
   with coumadin and patient and daughter were in agreement of not
   anticoagulating.  Per discussion w/ daughter, comfort is the goal of

","The patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, gout, and presented with continued fatigue and tachycardia. She was initially given diltiazem 10mg IV, but it did not have an effect on her heart rate and she remained in atrial fibrillation. She had a blood pressure reading of over 100mmHg and was started on amiodarone bolus followed by a drip, which successfully converted her to sinus rhythm at midnight. The patient was able to move around and use the commode without complaints afterward.

Her allergies include sulfa (sulfonamides) and an unknown allergy. Her last dose of antibiotics was not mentioned. The patient is currently on amiodarone infusion at a rate of 0.5 mg/min and has received diltiazem in the past.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38C (100.4F), current temperature of 35.8C (96.5F), heart rate ranging from 72 to 147 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 116/57 to 137/77 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 23 to 27 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, diastolic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, gout, and previous myocardial infarction. She presented with continued fatigue and tachycardia. She was given diltiazem without effect on heart rate, and her atrial fibrillation persisted. The patient also exhibited signs of congestive heart failure, so no more fluids were given while on the floor. She was started on amiodarone bolus followed by drip, which converted her to sinus rhythm at midnight. The patient became asymptomatic, able to move around and use the commode without complaints.

The patient's allergies include sulfa (sulfonamides), with an unknown allergy to another medication. Her last dose of antibiotics was not specified. She is currently on amiodarone infusion and other ICU medications. The patient refused subcutaneous heparin.

Review of Systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

   Pt. did not repsond to diltiazem, possibly [**3-16**] volume depletion.

   cause of afib is unclear, bu likely [**3-16**] structural disease w/ [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]

   tachy [**3-16**] volume depletion (GIB or poor PO intake).  in addition, pt.
   is volume overloaded, likely contributing. Possibly also contributed to
   by hypocalcemia, but unsure if the lab results from ED are valid. Per
   previous OMR d/c summary, she was poor candidate for  anticoagulation
   with coumadin and patient and daughter were in agreement of not
   anticoagulating.  Per discussion w/ daughter, comfort is the goal of
   care at this point.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, diastolic congestive heart failure, atrial flutter, gout. She presented with fatigue and tachycardia, which was found to be due to atrial fibrillation. The patient underwent cardioversion twice but remained in sinus rhythm. She was treated with amiodarone and her symptoms improved. She has been on diuretics for diastolic congestive heart failure and hospice care is being set up. The patient will be discharged home on amiodarone and will go back to rehab.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's recent episode of atrial fibrillation could lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
2. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, which can cause symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath. It may worsen if not properly managed.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension in the emergency department, likely due to volume depletion. This could be a concern during her discharge and if diuretics are restarted.
4. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates potential chronic kidney disease. This may require further evaluation and management.
5. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient has electrolyte imbalances, including hypocalcemia and hyperkalemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo F with PMH of DM2, diastolic CHF, aflutter, gout and presented
   with continued fatigue and tachycardia noted by PT at rehab found to be
   in a.fib.
   # RHYTHM: Patient had converted from a.fib on admission when given
   Amiodarone, however she went back into afib overnight.  Continues to go
   in and out of a.fib.  Was given an Amiodarone bolus and started on an
   infusion overnight.
   -  Continue Amiodarone infusion (already received 1 mg/kg for 6 hours,
   now getting 0.5 mg/kg for 18 hours); once finished will restarted
   Amiodarone 200 mg daily
   -  In the past there was discussion about anticoagulation and it was
   decided that she is not a good candidate given her age and risk for
   bleeding.  No anticoagulation.
   -  Will start Metoprolol 25 mg tid for rate control with Amiodarone.
   -  Will monitor for bradycardia and QT interval prolongation on
   Amiodarone.
   .
   # PUMP.  Diastolic CHF, most recent echo w/ LVEF > 65%, symmetric LVH
   and elevated PAP.  On lasix 80mg QD at rehab.  Patient put out over 3 L
   yesterday to the 80 mg of lasix.
   - Monitor I/Os.
   - Will decrease her lasix to 40 mg daily, given her large output to 80
   mg.
   - Morphine prn for SOB
   # CORONARIES.  CAD documented on previous D/C summaries.  No
   documentation of coronary anatomy in OMR.  Pt. w/o anginal sx currently
   but had SOB as anginal equivalent.
   - Continue ASA
   # Diabetes type 2 with complications: hold oral agents and use insulin
   SS for now. Check finger sticks.
   # Gout: continue allopurinol and colchicine
   # Osteoporosis: continue calcium and vitamin D
   # FEN: heart healthy, diabetic diet. hold IVF for now.
   # ACCESS: PIVs
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with subcutaneous heparin
   -Bowel regimen
   #CODE: DNR/DNI, No pressors.   Patient will be transitioning to hospice
   in the near future.
   #DISPO: patient can be called out to the floor and can likely go back
   to rehab tomorrow once she is finished with the Amiodarone loading.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, diastolic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, gout, and chronic venous stasis changes in the lower extremities. The patient presented with continued fatigue and tachycardia. 

The patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation and converted back to normal sinus rhythm upon admission when given amiodarone. However, she went back into atrial fibrillation overnight and received an amiodarone bolus and started on an infusion. The plan is to continue the amiodarone infusion and restart amiodarone 200 mg daily after finishing the infusion. 

The patient also has diastolic congestive heart failure with a most recent echocardiogram showing left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 65%, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, and elevated pulmonary artery pressures. She was on Lasix 80mg QD at rehab but was put out over 3 liters yesterday despite the Lasix. 

The patient's coronary arteries show documented coronary artery disease, and she has been prescribed aspirin. Her diabetes type 2 with complications is being managed by holding oral agents and using insulin sliding scale. 

The patient has gout and osteoporosis, for which she is continuing allopurinol and colchicine, as well as calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Her diet is heart-healthy and"
