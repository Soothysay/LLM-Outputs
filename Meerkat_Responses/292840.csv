","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of severe COPD who presented with acute onset of shortness of breath (SOB) and chest pain (CP). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. 

1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient is experiencing significant difficulty breathing, and possible etiologies include pulmonary embolism (PE), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and pneumonia (PNA). The patient has been started on steroids for possible COPD exacerbation, continuous oxygen via face tent, therapeutic Lovenox until CTA chest, and empirically treated for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with Levofloxacin.

2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes (CES) suggest possible ischemia. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram (echo) has been ordered.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he presented with fever. Empirical coverage for CAP with Levofloxacin is being continued, and sputum culture, blood cultures, and urinalysis are pending.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has returned to baseline, and fluid management is ongoing.

5. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient's COPD exacerbation is being managed with Atrovent/"

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of severe COPD who presented with acute onset of shortness of breath and chest pain. He is currently on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) due to respiratory failure. The patient has been started on intermittent BiPAP and continues to show improvement in his ABG.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's acute onset of shortness of breath and risk factors for PE, it is important to consider this as a possible etiology. Further assessment with a CT angiogram (CTA) when the patient's respiratory status is more stable is recommended.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's chest pain raises concern for ACS, especially considering his risk factors such as age, male gender, and smoking history. Serial ECGs and cardiac enzymes will help determine if ACS is present.
3. Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP): Although less likely given the acute presentation, pneumonia cannot be completely ruled out. Empirical coverage for CAP with levofloxacin has been initiated.
4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): As the patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, there is a risk of developing ARDS. Close monitoring and appropriate supportive care will be crucial.
5. Delirium or Agitation: The patient's anxiety and agitation may contribute to delirium. Small doses of ativan have been given"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 76-year-old male with severe COPD on home oxygen presenting with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and chest pain (CP).
- The patient's respiratory status has improved on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with BiPAP, and oxygenation is adequate.
- The patient was previously on NIV, but it was stopped and then restarted due to respiratory distress.
- A CT angiography (CTA) is planned to assess for pulmonary embolism (PE), although the patient was unable to undergo the test initially due to respiratory distress while lying flat.
- A lower extremity ultrasound (LE US) was performed, which showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient has a history of severe COPD, for which he uses Atrovent/Albuterol nebs and Spiriva. Spiriva has been temporarily held.
- The patient's leukocytosis is being covered empirically for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
- The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI), and fluid repletion is being pursued.
- The patient has anxiety and agitation, for which he is receiving low-dose diltiazem and occasional doses of lorazepam (Ativan).

","Summary:
The patient presented to the ICU with shortness of breath and required non-invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. They were unable to undergo a CT angiography to assess for pulmonary embolism (PE) because lying flat caused significant respiratory distress. An echocardiogram with bubble study has been ordered to evaluate for PE. A CT chest is also recommended to evaluate a possible lung nodule. The patient continues on intermittent BiPAP.

Infusion of Heparin Sodium at 850 units per hour has been initiated, and lorazepam (Ativan) was given at 05:00 AM on 04-20-2111. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3 C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/54 to 135/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,299 mL and output of 1,150 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,149 mL. They are receiving respiratory support with BiPAP, with a tidal volume of 644 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cmH2O, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) reading of 7.42/39/191//1.

Physical examination reveals a cachectic appearance, comfort on BIPAP, clear oropharynx, normal cardiac S1/S2 sounds, right lower lobe inspiratory wheeze, and no lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows alert orientation, intact mental status, and normal strength in all four extremities. No skin lesions are present.

Lab results from 04-19-2111 show a leukocyte count of 10.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.4 g/dL, sodium of 145 mg/dL, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, glucose of 130 mg/dL, and creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated troponin-T levels and an elevated lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and is receiving ICU care including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath (SOB). The patient was previously placed on non-invasive ventilation but had to be intubated due to respiratory distress and inability to tolerate lying flat. 

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and received antibiotics (levofloxacin and ceftriaxone) on 04/18/2111. They are currently receiving heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications. 

The patient's vital signs as of 06:17 AM on 04/20/2111 show a temperature of 36.3 C (97.4 F), heart rate of 79 bpm with a range of 78-105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/54 (70) mmHg to 135/76 (87) mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute with a range of 20-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows normal sinus rhythm, and fluid balance indicates an intake of 2,299 mL with 115 mL output, resulting in a net fluid balance of 1,149 mL with a negative balance of 75 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through BiPAP, with a tidal volume of 644 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PE"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with severe COPD who presented with acute onset of shortness of breath (SOB) and chest pain (CP) while at rest. The patient was started on non-invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. A CT chest was recommended to evaluate a possible lung nodule. The patient is currently comfortable on intermittent BiPAP with improved arterial blood gas (ABG) results. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient's presentation of acute SOB and CP suggests the possibility of respiratory failure. The severity of COPD and the need for non-invasive ventilation indicate a potential acute respiratory failure, which may progress to more severe conditions such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The acute onset of SOB, especially in a patient with severe COPD, raises concern for a possible PE. Further evaluation, such as a CT angiography (CTA), is needed to confirm or rule out this diagnosis.
3. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's chest pain could be related to ACS, given the risk factors like age, gender, hypertension, smoking history, and ECG changes. Trop-T levels are concerning for myocardial injury, which may suggest ACS.
4. Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP): The patient's fever and leukocytosis raise suspicion for CAP."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but there are some abnormalities in his fluid balance and respiratory support. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including steroids, antibiotics, and medications for his underlying conditions. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTA) has not been obtained yet. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement in his CAD.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with severe COPD and CAD who presents with shortness of breath and chest pain. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing worsened shortness of breath, possibly due to pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or COPD exacerbation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is on respiratory support with BiPAP and nebulizers. His labs show elevated white blood cell count and troponin levels, indicating possible infection and cardiac involvement. The patient is being treated with corticosteroids, antibiotics, and anticoagulation therapy. The medical team is monitoring his condition closely and discussing his care on interdisciplinary rounds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, and elevated white blood cell count could indicate pneumonia. This can be confirmed through a chest X-ray and sputum culture.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's shortness of breath and chest pain could also be caused by a PE. A CT pulmonary angiogram would be needed to diagnose this condition.
3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's pre-existing severe COPD makes it possible that his current symptoms are due to a COPD exacerbation. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary, and bronchodilators may be required.
4. Cardiac Complications: The elevated troponin levels suggest potential cardiac involvement."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with severe COPD and CAD who presents with shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient's condition is critical, and there are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided.

1. Shortness of breath: The patient's worsening shortness of breath could be due to pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), or a COPD exacerbation. The physician has started Solumedrol, Levofloxacin, and continues nebs, bipap, and inhaled CS. A PE CT scan is planned when the patient can lie flat, and heparin gtt has been started for empiric PE.

2. CAD: The patient's CAD is being managed with enzymes trending down, and ASA is being continued.

3. AFib: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and Diltiazem is being used for rate control.

4. FEN (not specified what FEN stands for in this context): A PICC consult has been requested for total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

In terms of potential complications, the patient's critical illness places him at risk for various complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk of respiratory failure.

2. Infection: Pneumonia is suspected, and the patient is on antibiotics. Additionally, the use of invasive lines and the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with severe COPD and CAD. He presented with shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient has worsened shortness of breath, which could be due to pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), or COPD exacerbation. He is currently receiving several medications including solumedrol, levaquin, nebs, bipap, inhaled CS, heparin, and lovenox. His cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating possible improvement in CAD. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation for which he is taking diltiazem. He is critically ill and on full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's worsening shortness of breath could be attributed to pneumonia. This can be confirmed through further diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray or sputum culture.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Another possible cause of the patient's symptoms is a PE. This can be assessed through a CT scan of the chest when the patient is able to lie flat.
3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's severe COPD may lead to exacerbations, which can result in increased shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Close monitoring of respiratory status and providing appropriate bronchodilators and corticosteroids is essential.
4. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CAD, there is a risk of cardiac complications"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of severe COPD who presented with acute onset of shortness of breath (SOB) and chest pain (CP) at rest. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS. 

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/65 mmHg to 170/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and face tent. 

The patient is receiving intermittent BiPAP, solumedrol, omeprazole, furosemide, enoxaparin (Lovenox), and lorazepam. 

The physical examination reveals cachectic appearance, presence of crackles and wheezes on the right side of the lungs, and no lower extremity edema. 

The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, increased potassium, sodium, and chloride levels, as well as elevated liver enzymes. 

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, acute COPD exacerbation, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury, anxiety, and anxiety-related agitation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of severe COPD on home oxygen presenting with acute onset of shortness of breath and chest pain while at rest. He is currently admitted to the ICU and is being treated for respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS). The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: 

- He has intermittent use of BiPAP throughout the day and at night.
- He is on solumedrol, which will be switched to oral prednisone today.
- He is on therapeutic doses of enoxaparin (lovenox) and attempting a CT angiogram of the chest.
- He is still on levofloxacin.
- He is being given lorazepam (ativan) for anxiety, 0.25mg IV bid prn.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to his severe COPD and acute onset of symptoms. He is already receiving BiPAP intermittently, steroids, and other medications to manage his condition. However, he may continue to be at risk for worsening respiratory failure if his COPD exacerbates further or if there are other underlying issues such as a pulmonary embolism or pneumonia.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's immobilization and history of COPD, there is a possibility of a PE. The doctor has ordered a CT angiogram of the chest to investigate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is currently on home oxygen. He presented with acute onset of shortness of breath (SOB) and chest pain (CP) while at rest. The patient has shown significant improvement overnight with the initiation of steroids.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to his severe COPD and acute onset of SOB. This can be a life-threatening condition if not properly managed.

2. Pneumonia (PNA): Given the patient's presentation and history of COPD, there is a possibility of pneumonia. The use of antibiotics and further investigation through sputum culture is recommended.

3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Acute onset SOB can also be caused by a pulmonary embolism. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest should be attempted to rule out this possibility.

4. Cardiac Ischemia: The elevated cardiac enzymes suggest the possibility of cardiac ischemia or a heart attack. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram and stress test is warranted.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Due to the patient's immobility in the ICU, there is a risk of developing deep vein thrombosis. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight hepar"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of emphysema, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has been experiencing shortness of breath and is displaying signs of a potential pulmonary embolism (PE) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient has a positive troponin leak, indicating cardiac involvement. He also presents with anxiety and requires Zoloft and Ativan for procedure management. The patient's condition is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure can be attributed to COPD flare, PE, or ACS. Immediate treatment measures include administering prednisone, continuing enoxaparin for pulmonary embolism, and conducting a CT scan of the chest. If the patient can tolerate lying flat, a PE CT scan may be performed this morning. Continuous treatment with levofloxacin and initiating sputum culture if possible are also recommended.

2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's troponin leak suggests ACS. Management involves continuing ASA, enoxaparin, and diltiazem. Outpatient follow-up with a repeat TTE and possible ETT is advised.

3. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety will be managed with continued Zoloft and Ativan for procedures.

4. Feeding Tube Placement (FEN): The patient requires a trial of oral intake today, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is planned."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of severe COPD who presented with acute onset of shortness of breath and chest pain while at rest. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing exacerbations of severe emphysema. The patient's code status is currently set to full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's history of severe COPD and acute onset of shortness of breath, there is a risk of ARDS, which is a serious lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and symptoms of shortness of breath may indicate an underlying infection such as pneumonia. This condition can worsen the patient's respiratory status and overall prognosis.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) or Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the CT angiogram (CTA) was negative for PE, the patient's risk factors for DVT/PE are present, including immobility in the ICU. Regular monitoring for signs and symptoms of DVT/PE is crucial.
4. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's elevated troponin level suggests cardiac ischemia, which could be a result of reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. Further evaluation, such as repeating an echocardiogram and stress test, may be necessary to assess the severity and prognosis of the cardiac"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of severe COPD on home oxygen presenting with acute onset of shortness of breath and chest pain while at rest. The patient underwent a CT angiogram that was negative for pulmonary embolism and showed no evidence of acute coronary syndrome. The patient has been experiencing exacerbation of severe emphysema and has started receiving intravenous steroids. The patient's code status is currently full code, but the physician wants to discuss it further with the patient's wife and primary care physician before making any changes.

Potential medical complications:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's history of severe COPD and acute onset of shortness of breath, there is a potential risk of developing ARDS, which can lead to significant respiratory distress.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. The physician should closely monitor for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and new infiltrates on chest X-ray.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and decreased circulation can increase the risk of DVT formation. The use of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) is appropriate for DVT prophylaxis.
4. Stress-related complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and chest pain may indicate myocardial ischemia or infarction. Further evaluation with repeat echocardi"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of severe COPD on home oxygen. He presented with acute onset of shortness of breath and chest pain while at rest. A CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism, and there were no signs of acute coronary syndrome. The patient has experienced improvement in his severe emphysema since beginning intravenous steroids.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute Onset SOB: The etiology is unclear given the negative CT angiogram for pulmonary embolism and no signs of acute coronary syndrome. The patient has experienced an exacerbation of severe emphysema, which has improved since starting IV steroids.
   - Lovement was stopped.
   - Continuing 60mg of prednisone daily.
   - Discontinuing levofloxacin as there are no signs of pneumonia on the CT chest.

2. CP: The patient's chest pain is likely due to elevated cardiac enzymes, suggesting ischemia.
   - Repeat echo and stress test are recommended.

3. Nutrition: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was started yesterday, but it will be stopped.
   - Restarting Megace.

4. Anxiety: Continuing home zoloft. Small doses of ativan will be given as needed for agitation.

ICU Care:
- Regular diet.
- Glycemic control.
- PICC line inserted on [**2111-4-21**] at 10:00 AM.
- Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Comments:
- The patient can now lie flat without significant distress.
- CT did not show signs of PE, but there is a left basilar effusion/atelectasis.
- The patient has good aeration at the right base.
- Appetite is better with steroids.
- The patient is quite frail and has advanced fibrotic emphysema in all lung fields and a dilated RV.
- The patient will be best served by transfer to rehab from the ICU setting and will need a slow steroid taper over the next two weeks as he improves.
- PICC line will be kept in place for now in case TPN is needed.
- The patient's primary care physician (PCP) has been updated regarding his course.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of severe COPD and emphysema, there is a risk of respiratory complications such as exacerbations, pneumonia, and respiratory failure.

2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes suggest myocardial ischemia, which can lead to further cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

3. Thromboembolic Complications: Despite the negative CT angiogram, there is still a risk of thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

4. Infection: The patient is at risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with severe COPD on home oxygen presenting with acute onset of shortness of breath (SOB) and chest pain (CP) while at rest. He has been experiencing exacerbation of severe emphysema, which improved since beginning IV steroids. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 125/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula with aerosol-cool. The patient is receiving various medications including famotidine, lorazepam, heparin sodium, and others. The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated troponin-T levels. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and aerosol-cool.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute onset of SOB and CP may indicate respiratory failure, possibly due to exacerbation of severe emphysema or another underlying condition. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: The elevated cardiac enzymes (CEs) suggest potential cardiac ischemia. Further evaluation, such as repeating an echocardiogram and stress test, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate management.
3. Anemia: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of severe COPD and on home oxygen. He presented with acute onset of shortness of breath (SOB) and chest pain (CP) while at rest. The patient's respiratory status improved after starting IV steroids, but he experienced exacerbation of severe emphysema. The patient has been on a slow prednisone taper, complete course of levofloxacin, and nebs. Other problems include anemia, nutrition, anxiety, and potential cardiac issues. The patient's hematocrit continues to trend down, so further evaluation is needed. The patient's appetite is improving, so TPN has been stopped and regular diet restarted along with Megace. Zoloft is being continued for anxiety, and small doses of ativan are given as needed for agitation. The patient is being evaluated for physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT)."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of severe COPD and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. The patient presented with acute onset of shortness of breath and chest pain while at rest. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was performed, which ruled out pulmonary embolism (PE) and there were no signs of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient has been started on IV steroids, which have helped improve his symptoms.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute onset shortness of breath, chest pain, anemia, and anxiety. The anemia is indicated by the patient's decreasing hematocrit levels. The patient is also being treated for nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 125/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula with aerosol-cool. The patient's physical examination and lab results are within normal limits, except for elevated troponin-T levels, which suggest myocardial ischemia or infarction.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of pneumonia, further decline in hematocrit levels leading to"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with severe emphysema and a history of COPD exacerbation. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's chief complaint is coughing after eating with desaturation and possible aspiration events.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.4 C (97.5 F)
- Heart rate: 84 bpm (83-112)
- Blood pressure: 125/67 mmHg (80-177/49-92)
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (17-30)
- Oxygen saturation: 96% on nasal cannula with FiO2 of 3L

The patient's physical examination reveals wheezing in expiration, trace edema in both lower extremities, and muscle wasting. His neurologic examination shows attentive behavior, purposeful movements, and decreased muscle tone.

Laboratory results include:
- Hemoglobin: 9.6 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 206 K/uL
- Blood glucose: 117 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
- Sodium: 27 mEq/L
- Potassium: 3.8 mEq/L
- Calcium: 68 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
- Phosphate: 112 mEq/L
- Lactic acid: 28.9%
- Troponin T: 0.74 ng/mL

The patient's medical history includes severe emphysema with COPD exacerbation, coronary artery disease with demand ischemia, anemia, and anxiety. He is currently on several medications including lorazepam, heparin sodium, levaquin, albuterol, atrovent, advair, dilt XR, sertraline, ASA, prednisone, Pepcid, and Megace.

The patient's current plan includes completing levaquin, tapering steroids, repeat TTE and ETT as an outpatient, continued ASA, and further evaluation for anemia with stool guaiac and iron studies. The patient's disposition is transfer to a rehab or long-term care facility."
