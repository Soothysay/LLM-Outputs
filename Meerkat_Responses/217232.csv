","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including sepsis without organ dysfunction. She was transferred to the MICU for further management of presumed sepsis. The patient's fever re-developed on [9-2] despite being on a regimen of vancomycin/ceftriaxone. Possible sources of infection include intra-abdominal, urinary, or graft site infection. The patient is currently being treated with cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl. CT torso shows no source of infection, and ID recommendations are being followed. The patient's volume status and chronic systolic heart failure are also being managed. Other medical conditions, such as peripheral arterial disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, are being addressed accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has re-developed fevers, indicating ongoing infection and potential sepsis. It is crucial to monitor vital signs, administer appropriate antibiotics, and identify the source of infection.
2. Intra-abdominal source of infection: Given the patient's abdominal pain on palpation and fevers, there is a possibility of an intra-abdominal source of infection, such as Clostridium difficile colitis, mesenteric ischemia, or an abscess. Further investigation and management are necessary.
3. Urinary tract infection: The patient's prior history of pyelonephritis and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical problems who was transferred to the MICU for further management of presumed sepsis. The patient has re-developed fevers despite being on a regimen of vancomycin/ceftriaxone. Possible sources of sepsis include intra-abdominal, urinary, or graft site infection.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 101.7°F, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/46 mmHg to 131/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals occasional crackles in the lungs, soft abdomen with no tenderness, and wounds on the right femoral graft site.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL, elevated glucose levels, elevated lactate levels, and negative urine and blood cultures.

Imaging studies reveal no evidence of pneumonia, abdominal or pelvic collections, or ischemic colitis. A CT head shows no intracranial hemorrhage.

The patient's assessment and plan include sepsis without organ dysfunction, chronic systolic heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is currently on cefepime, vancomycin, and Flagyl, and will have Flagyl discontinued as Clostridium difficile toxin was negative and there is no evidence of an intraabdominal source. Cultures will be difficult to interpret due to continuous treatment and previous antibiotic use over the past year. The CT torso shows no source of infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include persistent fever, which could indicate an ongoing infection or antibiotic resistance, worsening of chronic systolic heart failure due to fluid management, graft site infection, and complications related to peripheral arterial disease."

   #. ?Sepsis: Patient has re-developed fevers on [**9-2**] on a regimen of
   vancomycin/ceftriaxone.  Possible sources include:
   1. Intra-abdominal source- given pain on palpation (thought reduced
   this AM), and fevers on broad spectrum gram positive coverage with
   somewhat limited gram negative/anaerobic coverage.  DDX includes C.
   diff colitis, mesenteric ischemia (given multiple vasculopathies,
   elevated lactate), abscess. But abdominal exam more benign s/p
   disimpaction, nothing on CT
   2. Urine- given prior history of pyelonephritis, original ddx included
   perinephric abscess, but nothing on CT
   3. Graft site infection of right fem-[**Doctor Last Name 114**] graft site- given right foot
   pain and history of resistant E. coli/ MRSA at the wound site. Unlikely
   lung source, given her clear Xray.
   -On cefepime (for pseudomonas coverage), vanco, flagyl. Will d/c flagyl

   -Have been maintaining SBP's >90's w/ fluid boluses (2 liters in 24
   hours); will rebolus for tachycardia
   -All cultures negative to date. Possible if graft infection? If
   persistently febrile, would d/c all antibiotics and culture to try to
   isolate organism.
   #. Volume status/Chronic systolic HF- As evidenced by her ABGs and
   electrolyte profile, she is over-diureses at this time.  Will hold
   current diuresis, and provide fluids as above.  Will also hold ACE for
   now given hypotension.  Will restart ASA and other cardiac meds today

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10381**], a 76-year-old female with multiple medical problems, has been admitted to the MICU for presumed sepsis. She is currently experiencing tachycardia, altered mental status, and fever. The patient has a history of peripheral arterial disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin-dependent diabetes, chronic systolic heart failure, and a recent right femoral bypass graft with wound infections caused by MRSA/E. coli.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to her fevers, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Possible sources of infection include intra-abdominal, urinary, or graft site infection. She is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Organ Dysfunction: There is a concern for organ dysfunction, particularly in the cardiovascular system, given her history of chronic systolic heart failure and potential over-diuresis.
3. Chronic Systolic HF: The patient's ABGs and electrolyte profile suggest over-diuresis. This may indicate inadequate fluid management and should be addressed promptly.
4. Peripheral Arterial Disease: The patient has a history of peripheral arterial disease and recently underwent a right femoral bypass graft. There is a possibility of graft infection, especially considering the previous wound infections with MRSA/E. coli.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is within the hypertensive range, and"

The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She also has a recent right femoral bypass graft with wound infections caused by MRSA and E. coli.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate ranging from 106-110 bpm, blood pressure between 121/44 mmHg and 140/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her weight is currently 71.9 kg.

She has received various treatments including Tylenol for fever, 500cc boluses for low urine output, and lactulose for stooling. The patient has been on multiple antibiotic regimens including cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole, but all cultures have been negative to date.
