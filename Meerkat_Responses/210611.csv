","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU. They have been invasively ventilated since January 23rd, 04:00 AM and had a PICC line inserted on the same day at 04:56 AM. The patient has allergies to sulfa antibiotics, Cozaar (losartan potassium), Captopril, and an unknown allergy to Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim). The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/51 mmHg to 122/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has received a total of 2,505 mL of fluids since midnight. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's respiratory system compliance is good with a respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) of 194, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 21 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 15 cmH2O. The patient's peripheral pulses and skin cannot be assessed due to the invasive ventilation. The patient's neurologic examination is also not assessable. There are no recent laboratory results or images provided in the assessment and plan section. The patient's current medical condition is hypotension but not in shock. The patient has been started on ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code and their disposition is unknown. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications for this patient may include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been invasively ventilated for more than 48 hours, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheter use.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and use of invasive ventilation increase the risk of stress ulcers.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating possible hypotension.
5. ventilator-induced lung injury: The high plateau pressure suggests the possibility of ventilator-induced lung injury.
6. Barotrauma: The high peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) increases the risk of barotrauma.
7. Infection: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU increases the risk of developing hospital-acquired infections.

Please note that further assessment and evaluation by a healthcare professional are necessary to confirm these potential complications and determine appropriate interventions."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o lady with CHF, AF, HTN was discharged from Trauma service
   yesterday after she was admitted here with C7 fracure secondary to fall
   now presents with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Patient became hypotensive after receiving 40 mg IV
   furosemide and cardizem medications.  She has also recieved ativan
   prior to these medications.  She is afebrile and does not have
   leukocytosis.  No signs or symptoms of infection currently.  Patient
   was found to have episodes of really low BP during recent
   hospitalization.  Unlcear etiology. She was started on midodrine. Blood
   pressures responding to hydration indicate that she might have been
   dehydrated.
   - follow cultures
   - random cortisol, ? [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim was normal during last admission
   - discontinued clonidine, monitor for rebound hypertension
   - ideal BP will be SBP 90s given dCHF, however her BP does decrease
   below that while sleeping
   .
   # asymetric weakeness:  No clear history of stroke after comparing
   PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] note.  C-spine without acute changes of C7/T2 fractures.
   - will obtain a NCHCT
   .
   # Chronic vent dependence:  Intubated for ? glottic swelling.  s/p
   pleural effusion drainiage during recent admission.  However it appears

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old lady with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension who was admitted to the trauma service for a C7 fracture secondary to a fall. She presented with hypotension and was found to have episodes of really low blood pressure during her recent hospitalization. The etiology of her hypotension is unclear. She was started on midodrine and blood pressures responded to hydration, suggesting possible dehydration. She also has asymmetric weakness, chronic ventilator dependence, pleural effusion, mildly elevated troponin levels, AF, anemia, thyroid disease, and feeding tube dependence.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to various causes such as dehydration, medication effects, or cardiac dysfunction. It is important to monitor her blood pressure closely and adjust fluid intake and medications accordingly.
2. Asymmetric weakness: The patient's asymmetric weakness may indicate a possible stroke or neurological issue. Further evaluation, including imaging studies, may be necessary to determine the underlying cause.
3. Chronic ventilator dependence: The patient's dependence on a ventilator suggests a compromised respiratory function. Weaning off the ventilator will be crucial, and close monitoring of her respiratory status is necessary.
4. Pleural effusion: The patient has a recurrent pleural effusion, which needs to be managed appropriately. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old lady with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with a C7 fracture secondary to a fall and presented with hypotension. 

The patient has received several medications including furosemide, cardizem, ativan, midodrine, and clonidine. The low blood pressures during recent hospitalization are unclear in etiology, but blood pressures are responding to hydration, suggesting dehydration as a possible cause. Cardiac ischemia is mentioned but considered low in the differential.

The patient has troponin levels within normal limits, indicating no acute cardiac etiologies according to cardiology. There are nonspecific EKG changes present, which could be indicative of demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension.

The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation and has a history of glottic swelling. She had a pleural effusion drained during her recent admission, but the effusion has reaccumulated. It is mentioned as possibly due to diastolic heart failure.

The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled. There is a plan to hold coumadin due to a supratherapeutic INR.

The patient has anemia, which is most likely secondary to recent admission and frequent phlebotomy. It is described as normocytic.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/60 mmHg to 71/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 50%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. She has been receiving metoprolol and other ICU medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to various factors such as medication interactions or underlying medical conditions. Monitoring her blood pressure and maintaining a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 is important to ensure adequate perfusion.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing chronic respiratory failure, which may be related to her underlying heart failure and glottic swelling. Continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters and ensuring proper ventilation support is necessary.
3. Left-sided weakness: The patient has shown left-sided weakness, which needs further evaluation to rule out any potential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was recently discharged after a C7 fracture and is now back in the ICU with hypotension following the administration of Lasix and diltiazem, but her blood pressure improved with intravenous fluids.

The patient has several medical conditions including thyroid cancer, no evidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and chronic respiratory failure. She also has anemia, left-sided weakness, and is suspected to have chronic hypotension possibly due to medication side effects. There is no evidence of infection currently.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6 C (97.9 F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/60 mmHg to 71/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 320 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen of 50%.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished general appearance, normal heart sounds, diminished breath sounds on the right base, soft non-tender abdomen, absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities, and attention with followable simple commands but no assessed movement, tone"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension who was admitted to the ICU for a C7 fracture secondary to a fall. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has several medical complications, including hypotension, abdominal pain, chronic vent dependence, diastolic heart failure, anemia, thyroid disease, asymmetric weakness, and feeding difficulties.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to multiple medications or dehydration. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Abdominal pain: The new onset abdominal pain requires further investigation to rule out any obstruction or other potential causes.
3. Chronic vent dependence: The patient appears to have developed a dependence on the ventilator, as indicated by the need for ongoing mechanical ventilation support. Efforts should be made to wean her off the vent as she tolerates.
4. Diastolic heart failure: The patient's chronic right pleural effusion suggests diastolic heart failure. Optimizing management with beta-blockers (BB) should be considered if her blood pressure can tolerate it.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be secondary to recent admission and frequent phlebotomy. Normocytic anemia is observed.
6. Thyroid disease: The patient has a history of thyroid cancer treated with surgery and radiation"

   furosemide and cardizem medications.  She has also recieved ativan
   prior to these medications.  She is afebrile and does not have
   leukocytosis.  No signs or symptoms of infection currently.  Patient
   was found to have episodes of really low BP during recent
   hospitalization.  Unlcear etiology. She was started on midodrine. Blood
   pressures responding to hydration indicate that she might have been
   dehydrated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for a C7 fracture secondary to a fall and now presents with hypotension. The patient has received multiple medications including furosemide, cardizem, ativan, midodrine, and others. Her blood pressures have been responding to hydration, indicating possible dehydration. The patient has asymmetric weakness with no clear history of stroke, chronic ventilator dependence, mildly elevated troponin levels, atrial fibrillation currently under rate control, anemia, thyroid disease, and difficulty with speech and swallowing. The patient's pleural effusion has reaccumulated, and she is currently on tube feeds. Her INR is supratherapeutic, and she is on levothyroxine for thyroid disease. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending further workup.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to dehydration or an underlying cause. This needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a reaccumulated pleural effusion, which could lead to respiratory complications if not properly managed.
3. Asymmetric Weakness: The patient's asymmetric weakness could be indicative of a stroke or other neurological issues. Further investigation is required to determine the cause and appropriate"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and is currently experiencing tachypnea, tachycardia, agitation, and hypotension. The patient has a history of anxiety, respiratory failure, and hypotension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal pain: There is a possibility of an obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract. Further investigations such as a kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) examination, rectal exam, liver function tests (LFTs), and testing for Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) should be conducted to rule out any underlying causes.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, particularly worsening at night. It is important to continue administering midodrine to improve the situation. The patient's hypotension has shown improvement since admission.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient may have diaphragmatic dysfunction due to paradoxical abdominal movement. An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis should be done to rule out hypercarbia. Diuretic therapy should be initiated to address this issue.
4. Diastolic heart failure/atrial fibrillation: The patient has been prescribed coumadin at a dosage of 1 mg and coreg 3.25 mg. Diuretic therapy should also be started, aiming to remove 1 liter of fluid today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), hypertension (htn), and a recent discharge after a C7 fracture. She returns from rehabilitation with hypotension after receiving lasix and diltiazem, and her blood pressure improved with intravenous fluids (IVF). She continues to experience tachypnea/tachycardia with agitation and complains of abdominal pain. A CT scan of the head was unremarkable except for sinusitis. The patient developed right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain while on the commode. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal pain: Possible obstruction? - Check KUB (kidneys, ureters, bladder), rectal exam, check liver function tests (LFTs), and check for Clostridium difficile (C diff).
2. Hypotension: Worse at night, partially rate-related - Continue midodrine and improve from admission.
3. Respiratory failure: Consider diaphragmatic dysfunction given paradoxical abdominal movement - Check arterial blood gas (ABG) to rule out hypercarbia, diurese, and start appropriate medications.
4. Diastolic heart failure/afib - Start coumadin at 1 mg, start coreg 3.25 [Hospital1], diurese 1L today.
5. Further evaluation needed: Hold tube feeding ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and a recent discharge after a C7 fracture. She has been experiencing hypotension after taking lasix and diltiazem, but her blood pressure improved with intravenous fluids. The patient is currently agitated and complaining of abdominal pain. She has tachypnea/tachycardia with agitation, and her respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 100%. She is also receiving morphine sulfate, metoprolol, lansoprazole, and midodrine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal pain: The patient's complaint of abdominal pain may indicate a possible obstruction. Further evaluation is needed to rule out any gastrointestinal issues, such as checking the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, performing a rectal exam, checking liver function tests, and screening for Clostridium difficile infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has been partially rate-related and worse at night. It is essential to continue monitoring her blood pressure and adjusting treatment accordingly. Midodrine has been initiated, which has shown improvement since admission.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to diaphragmatic dysfunction given the paradoxical abdominal movement. Checking arterial blood gases to rule out hypercarbia, diurezing, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension (HTN). She was admitted to the trauma service for a C7 fracture secondary to a fall and was recently discharged. The patient now presents with hypotension and new-onset abdominal pain. She has been experiencing episodes of low blood pressure during her recent hospitalization, with unclear etiology. The patient has been started on midodrine, and her blood pressures are responding to hydration, indicating potential dehydration.

The patient has a history of chronic ventilator dependence, intubated for glottic swelling, and had a pleural effusion drainage during her recent admission. However, it appears that her pleural fluid has reaccumulated. She underwent a tracheostomy and is currently on ventilatory support. The patient also has diastolic heart failure with chronic right pleural effusion. She is being optimized with beta-blockers (BB) for blood pressure control.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with rate control using BB and warfarin for anticoagulation. She also has anemia, most likely secondary to recent admission and frequent phlebotomy, as well as thyroid disease, with a history of thyroid cancer surgery and radiation. She is on levothyroxine and requires outpatient follow-up.

The patient presents with asymmetric weakness,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old lady with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension (HTN). She was admitted to the ICU with a C7 fracture secondary to a fall. Currently, she presents with hypotension, chronic ventilator dependence, diastolic heart failure, abdominal pain, atrial fibrillation, anemia, thyroid disease, C7-T2 fractures, and feeding difficulties.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be secondary to multiple medications. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and adjust the medication regimen accordingly.
2. Chronic ventilator dependence: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to glottic swelling. However, her pleural effusion has reaccumulated. It is important to monitor her neurologic function, wean off the ventilator as tolerated, and assess arterial blood gases (ABG) regularly.
3. Diastolic heart failure: The patient has a chronic right pleural effusion, which may contribute to her diastolic heart failure. Optimizing management with beta-blockers (BB) should be considered if her blood pressure can tolerate it. Lasix IV can be given as needed for target intake/output (I/O) negative 1L to improve the pleural effusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with chronic respiratory failure and hypotension. He has a history of multiple medical conditions and is currently receiving various medications, including sedatives, pain relievers, and cardiac medications. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with an elevated heart rate (109 bpm) and blood pressure fluctuating between 137/67 mmHg and 183/132 mmHg. He is also experiencing tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute. The patient has a moderate to large right pleural effusion and is receiving tube feeds. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium levels. His glucose levels are well-controlled.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen due to his tachypnea and low oxygen saturation levels.
2. Hypotension: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure indicates ongoing hypotension, which may require further evaluation and management.
3. Pleural effusion: The presence of a moderate to large right pleural effusion needs to be addressed to prevent any complications associated with fluid accumulation in the chest cavity.
4. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count"

   Patient is critically ill.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), hypertension (htn), and a recent discharge after a C7 fracture. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to hypotension following the administration of lasix and diltiazem, which improved with intravenous fluids (IVF). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate (HR) ranging from 69 to 156 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 83/43 mmHg to 61/34 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) ranging from 7 to 39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is in sinus rhythm.

The patient has experienced several events since admission, including the development of right lower quadrant abdominal pain after trying to stool on the commode, delirium, and tachypnea on 15/5, for which she was placed on assisted/critical care ventilation (A/C). 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.8 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 26.6%, platelet count of 296 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.7 mg/d"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. They have been receiving various treatments and medications including Haldol for agitation, Coreg for heart rate control, and volume control for tachypnea. The patient has allergies to sulfa antibiotics, Bactrim, Cozaar, Captopril, and an unknown allergy to morphine sulfate. They are currently on infusions of morphine sulfate and metoprolol. Other medications include lorazepam, lansoprazole, and unspecified other medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Flow Sheet Data:
The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F) with a maximum temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate ranging from 69 to 156 beats per minute, blood pressure between 83/43 mmHg and 61/34 mmHg, respiratory rate between 7 and 39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus, and their height is 66 inches. The fluid balance shows an input of 1,047 mL and output of 1,125 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -78 mL.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), hypertension (htn), and a recent discharge after a C7 fracture. She returned from rehabilitation with hypotension after taking lasix and diltiazem, and her blood pressure improved with intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient's blood pressure tends to run low while sleeping but she remains mentally fine. The goal for fluid intake/output is negative 1 liter (L) today.

On [**1-25**], the patient developed right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain after trying to have a bowel movement on the commode. Kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) examination without obstruction, rectal exam showed no impaction, and there were no further episodes of abdominal pain. Currently, the patient appears delirious and is being managed with haloperidol (Haldol) instead of benzodiazepines.

Overnight, the patient was tachypneic on 15/5 and placed on assist-control ventilation (A/C). The medical team is attempting to wean her off the ventilator and return her to rehabilitation on Monday.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:

1. Hypotension: The patient experiences low blood pressure, particularly during sleep. It is important to monitor and manage her blood pressure to ensure adequate organ"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old lady with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension. She was admitted to the trauma service due to a C7 fracture from a fall and is now presenting with hypotension. The patient's blood pressure is low, especially while sleeping, despite being on multiple medications. There are no signs of infection currently.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be secondary to multiple medications. It is unclear what caused the episodes of really low BP during her recent hospitalization. Midodrine has been started, and her BP improved when clonidine was held. However, her BP still decreases while sleeping.

2. Chronic Vent Dependence: The patient was intubated for glottic swelling and had a pleural effusion drainage during her recent admission. However, her pleural fluid has reaccumulated, indicating transudative effusion as per prior taps. There is a possibility of diaphragmatic dysfunction given her low negative inspiratory force (NIF). It is important to check NIF, wean off the vent as she tolerates, and check arterial blood gas (ABG).

3. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has a chronic right pleural effusion. Optimizing management with beta-blockers (BB) will be tried if her BP can tolerate. Coreg 6.5 mg has"

   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to diastolic heart failure vs.
   autonomic instability vs. medication effect.  No signs of infection
   currently.  Patient was noted to have episodes of really low BP during

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old lady with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension. She was admitted to the trauma service for a C7 fracture secondary to a fall and is now presenting with hypotension. The patient has been intubated due to glottic swelling and has chronic transudative right pleural effusion. She also has anemia, thyroid disease, and a history of thyroid cancer treated with surgery and radiation. The patient's current medications include clonidine, midodrine, Coreg, lasix IV, carvedilol, and levothyroxine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing episodes of low blood pressure, which could be due to diastolic heart failure, autonomic instability, or medication effect. It is important to closely monitor her blood pressure and adjust medications accordingly.
2. Chronic Vent Dependence: The patient appears to have weakened diaphragm and may require long-term mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator should be done gradually and as tolerated.
3. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has chronic transudative right pleural effusion, indicating possible diastolic heart failure. Optimizing management with beta-blockers like Coreg may be necessary if her blood pressure can tolerate it.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has AF, and rate control should be maintained with medications such"

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure, and a recent C7 fracture. She was admitted for hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes chronic respiratory failure, hypotension (not in shock), anxiety, and a C7 fracture. 

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Hypotension: The patient is suspected to have medication-related hypotension. She is being continued on Coreg for atrial fibrillation and midodrine.
2. Diastolic congestive heart failure/atrial fibrillation: The goal is negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters. The patient will continue on Coreg and Coumadin at a dose of 1 mg.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's NIF will be rechecked at -30. She did not tolerate rapid shallow breathing. Weaning will be continued, with an attempt to try [9-1] today.
4. C7 fracture: The patient will try to get a stout collar and will wear a collar until [2-26]. After that, she will be managed by Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 2660].

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction, and a recent C7 fracture. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, tachycardia, and hypotension. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 129/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 0 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

The patient's lab results indicate normal levels for white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, glucose, and electrolytes. However, the creatinine level is slightly elevated at 0.9 mg/dL. 

The patient's plan includes continuing coreg for atrial fibrillation, midodrine for hypotension, and diuretics for diastolic congestive heart failure. The respiratory failure is being managed by gradually weaning off the ventilator support. The C7 fracture requires immobilization with a collar. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if the patient does not tolerate weaning from the ventilator, further hypotension"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o lady with CHF, AF, HTN was discharged from Trauma service
   yesterday after she was admitted here with C7 fracure secondary to fall
   now presents with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to diastolic heart failure vs.
   autonomic instability vs. medication effect.  No signs of infection
   currently.  Patient was noted to have episodes of really low BP during
   recent hospitalization.  BP improved after discontinuing clonidine.
   She continues to have episodes of hypotension while sleeping, but no
   changes in mentation.
   - ideal BP will be SBP 90s given dCHF, however her BP does decrease
   below that while sleeping
   - Continue Midodrine.
   .
   # Chronic vent dependence:  Intubated for ? glottic swelling.  s/p
   thoracentesis for transudative pleural effusion during previous
   admission.   Patient also appears to have weakened diaphragm as
   indicated by low NIF.
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - continue to diurese 0.5 to 1 liter negative today with prn lasix
   - PMV trial once decreasing vent settings
   .
   # Diastolic heart failure:  Has chronic transudative right pleural
   effusion.  Will try to optimize management with BB if BP could
   tolerate.
   -          coreg 6.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], uptitrate as possible
   -          allergic to ace-I and [**Last Name (un) **]
   -          lasix IV prn for target I&O negative 1L for improvement in
   pleural effusion
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - rate control with Carvedilol
   - Target INR [**12-31**], on Coumadin 1 mg daily
   .
   # Anemia:  Most likely secondary to recent admission and frequent

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o lady with CHF, AF, HTN was discharged from Trauma service
   yesterday after she was admitted here with C7 fracure secondary to fall
   now presents with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to diastolic heart failure vs.
   autonomic instability vs. medication effect.  No signs of infection
   currently.  Patient was noted to have episodes of really low BP during
   recent hospitalization.  BP improved after discontinuing clonidine.
   She continues to have episodes of hypotension while sleeping, but no
   changes in mentation.
   - ideal BP will be SBP 90s given dCHF, however her BP does decrease
   below that while sleeping
   - Continue Midodrine.
   .
   # Chronic vent dependence:  Intubated for ? glottic swelling.  s/p
   thoracentesis for transudative pleural effusion during previous
   admission.   Patient also appears to have weakened diaphragm as
   indicated by low NIF.
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - continue to diurese 1 liter negative today
   - PMV trial once decreasing vent settings
   .
   # Diastolic heart failure:  Has chronic transudative right pleural
   effusion.  Will try to optimize management with BB if BP could
   tolerate.
   -          coreg 6.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], uptitrate as possible

   -          lasix IV prn for target I&O negative 1L for improvement in
   pleural effusion
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - rate control with Carvedilol
   - Target INR [**12-31**], on Coumadin 1 mg daily
   .
   # Anemia:  Most likely secondary to recent admission and frequent
   phlebotomy.  Normocytic.
   - normal vit B12 and folate on [**2194-1-14**]
   - HCT improved appropriately after 1uPRBCs on [**12-23**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension. She was admitted to the trauma service for a C7 fracture secondary to a fall and was recently discharged. The patient now presents with hypotension. She has episodes of low blood pressure during recent hospitalization, which improved after discontinuing clonidine. The patient continues to experience hypotension while sleeping but has no changes in mentation. Her ideal blood pressure is in the SBP 90s due to diastolic heart failure. Midodrine is being continued.

The patient is dependent on chronic ventilation, intubated for glottic swelling. She underwent thoracentesis for transudative pleural effusion during a previous admission. The patient also appears to have a weakened diaphragm, as indicated by a negative inspiratory force (NIF) of -30 cmH2O.

The patient has chronic transudative right pleural effusion. Management optimization with beta-blockers is planned if blood pressure can tolerate. Coreg 6.5 mg is being started, and doses will be uptitrated as possible. Lasix IV PRN is given for a target intake/output negative 1 liter for improvement in pleural effusion.

The patient has atrial fibrillation, and rate control is being achieved with carvedilol. The target INR is 12-31,"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o lady with CHF, AF, HTN was discharged from Trauma service
   yesterday after she was admitted here with C7 fracure secondary to fall
   now presents with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to diastolic heart failure vs.
   autonomic instability vs. medication effect.  No signs of infection
   currently.  Patient was noted to have episodes of really low BP during
   recent hospitalization.  BP improved after discontinuing clonidine.
   She continues to have episodes of hypotension while sleeping, but no
   changes in mentation.
   - ideal BP will be SBP 90s given dCHF, however her BP does decrease
   below that while sleeping
   - Continue Midodrine.
   .
   # Chronic vent dependence:  Intubated for ? glottic swelling.  s/p
   thoracentesis for transudative pleural effusion during previous
   admission.   Patient also appears to have weakened diaphragm as
   indicated by low NIF.
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - continue to diurese 0.5 to 1 liter negative today with prn lasix
   - PMV trial once decreasing vent settings
   .
   # Diastolic heart failure:  Has chronic transudative right pleural
   effusion.  Will try to optimize management with BB if BP could
   tolerate.
   -          coreg 6.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], uptitrate as possible
   -          allergic to ace-I and [**Last Name (un) **]
   -          lasix IV prn for target I&O negative 1L for improvement in
   pleural effusion
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - rate control with Carvedilol
   - Target INR [**12-31**], on Coumadin 1 mg daily
   .
   # Anemia:  Most likely secondary to recent admission and frequent
   phlebotomy.  Normocytic.
   - normal vit B12 and folate on [**2194-1-14**]
   - HCT improved appropriately after 1uPRBCs on [**12-23**]
   .
   # Thyroid disease:  Thyroid CA s/p surgery and radiation.
   - continue levothyroxine
   - needs out patient follow up
   .
   # C7-T2 fractures:  No clear history of stroke after comparing PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 1596**].  C-spine without acute changes of C7/T2 fractures.
   - Per Ortho, keep C-collar on x 8 weeks ([**2-26**]).  F/u appt with
   [**Doctor Last Name 2660**] scheduled.
   - will fit with smaller c-collar
   .
   # FEN:  Continue tube feeds
   .
   # PPx:  Systemically anticoagulated, on coumadin.  Continue PPI while
   ventilator-dependent.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old lady with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension (HTN). She was admitted to the ICU for a C7 fracture secondary to a fall and presented with hypotension. The patient has been experiencing episodes of low blood pressure during her recent hospitalization. Her blood pressure improved after discontinuing clonidine, but she continues to have episodes of hypotension while sleeping. There are no signs of infection currently. The patient's ideal blood pressure is in the range of 90s systolic due to diastolic heart failure. 

The patient has chronic vent dependence and was intubated for glottic swelling. She underwent a thoracentesis for transudative pleural effusion during her previous admission. The patient also appears to have a weakened diaphragm as indicated by the negative inspiratory force (NIF). 

The patient has diastolic heart failure with chronic transudative right pleural effusion. The management plan includes optimizing medication with beta-blockers if her blood pressure can tolerate it, and using Lasix IV as needed for target intake/output negative 1 liter for improvement in pleural effusion. 

The patient has atrial fibrillation and is being managed with rate control using Carvedilol and target INR on Coumadin. 

The patient has anemia, which is most likely secondary to recent admission and frequent phle"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, hypotension, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), hypothyroidism, and a C7 fracture. The patient was admitted to the ICU with impaired aerobic capacity, impaired airway clearance, impaired balance, impaired cough, impaired knowledge, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired ventilation, and impaired transfers. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80-158 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the bibasilar chest region and absent pulses in both lower extremities. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, and has purposeful movements. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function with elevated creatinine levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. Troponin T levels are normal, and other lab values including glucose, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers are stable.

Plan:

1. Continue weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Continue diuretic therapy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction, and a recent C7 fracture. He presented with respiratory failure, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient's condition has improved, with improved hypotension and tachycardia. On examination, the patient is awake, alert, and tracheostomized. The chest examination reveals crackles bilaterally, the heart sounds are regular, the abdomen is soft and non-tender, and the neurologic examination shows the patient is alert and oriented with purposeful movements of extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring, and continued weaning of the ventilator should be done as tolerated. The presence of crackles bilaterally in the chest suggests possible fluid overload or worsening heart failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR needs to be managed with anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events. Rate control medications may also be required.
3. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient's diastolic dysfunction may contribute to his acute respiratory failure. Continued management with medications such as coreg and diuretics is appropriate. Monitoring for signs of worsening heart failure is essential.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o lady with CHF, AF, HTN was discharged from Trauma service
   yesterday after she was admitted here with C7 fracure secondary to fall
   now presents with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to diastolic heart failure vs.
   autonomic instability vs. medication effect.   Patient was noted to
   have episodes of really low BP during recent hospitalization.  BP
   improved after discontinuing clonidine.  She continues to have episodes
   of hypotension while sleeping, but no changes in mentation.
   - ideal BP will be SBP 90s given dCHF, however her BP does decrease
   below that while sleeping
   - change midodrine to 10mg qhs given good BP during the day
   .
   # Chronic vent dependence:  Intubated for ? glottic swelling.  s/p
   thoracentesis for transudative pleural effusion during previous
   admission.   Patient also appears to have weakened diaphragm as
   indicated by low NIF.
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - continue to diurese 0.5 to 1 liter negative today with prn lasix
   .
   # Diastolic heart failure:  Has chronic transudative right pleural
   effusion.  Will try to optimize management with BB if BP could
   tolerate.
   -          coreg 6.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], uptitrate as possible
   -          allergic to ace-I and [**Last Name (un) **]
   -          lasix IV prn for target I&O negative 0.5 to 1L for
   improvement in pleural effusion
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - rate control with Carvedilol
   - Target INR [**12-31**], increase Coumadin to 1.5 mg daily
   .
   # Anemia:  Most likely secondary to recent admission and frequent
   phlebotomy.  Normocytic.
   - normal vit B12 and folate on [**2194-1-14**]
   - HCT improved appropriately after 1uPRBCs on [**12-23**]
   .
   # Thyroid disease:  Thyroid CA s/p surgery and radiation.
   - continue levothyroxine
   - needs out patient follow up
   .
   # C7-T2 fractures:  No clear history of stroke after comparing PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 1596**].  C-spine without acute changes of C7/T2 fractures.
   - Per Ortho, keep C-collar on x 8 weeks ([**2-26**]).  F/u appt with
   [**Doctor Last Name 2660**] scheduled.
   .
   # FEN:  Continue tube feeds
   .
   # PPx:  Systemically anticoagulated, on coumadin.  Continue PPI while
   ventilator-dependent.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension (HTN). She was admitted to the ICU with a C7 fracture secondary to a fall and presented with hypotension. The patient has been experiencing episodes of low blood pressure during recent hospitalization, but her mentation remains unchanged. The assessment indicates that her ideal blood pressure should be in the range of 90s systolic due to diastolic heart failure. However, her blood pressure decreases below that while sleeping.

The patient has chronic vent dependence and was intubated for glottic swelling. She underwent a thoracentesis for transudative pleural effusion during her previous admission. There is also evidence of a weakened diaphragm, indicated by low negative inspiratory force (NIF). The plan is to wean off the ventilator as tolerated and continue to diurese 0.5 to 1 liter negative today with prn lasix.

The patient has diastolic heart failure with chronic transudative right pleural effusion. The management plan includes optimizing management with beta-blockers if blood pressure can tolerate, using Coreg 6.5 mg, and uptitrating as possible. Lasix IV prn is given for target I&O negative 0.5 to 1L for improvement in pleural effusion.

The patient also has atrial"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o lady with CHF, AF, HTN was discharged from Trauma service
   yesterday after she was admitted here with C7 fracure secondary to fall
   now presents with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to diastolic heart failure vs.
   autonomic instability vs. medication effect.   Patient was noted to
   have episodes of really low BP during recent hospitalization.  BP
   improved after discontinuing clonidine.  She continues to have episodes
   of hypotension while sleeping, but no changes in mentation.
   - ideal BP will be SBP 90s given dCHF, however her BP does decrease
   below that while sleeping
   - change midodrine to 10mg qhs given good BP during the day
   .
   # Chronic vent dependence:  Intubated for ? glottic swelling.  s/p
   thoracentesis for transudative pleural effusion during previous
   admission.   Patient also appears to have weakened diaphragm as
   indicated by low NIF.
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - continue to diurese 0.5 to 1 liter negative today with prn lasix
   .
   # Diastolic heart failure:  Has chronic transudative right pleural
   effusion.  Will try to optimize management with BB if BP could
   tolerate.
   -          coreg 6.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], uptitrate as possible
   -          allergic to ace-I and [**Last Name (un) **]
   -          lasix IV prn for target I&O negative 0.5 to 1L for
   improvement in pleural effusion
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - rate control with Carvedilol
   - Target INR [**12-31**], on Coumadin 1 mg daily
   .
   # Anemia:  Most likely secondary to recent admission and frequent
   phlebotomy.  Normocytic.
   - normal vit B12 and folate on [**2194-1-14**]
   - HCT improved appropriately after 1uPRBCs on [**12-23**]
   .
   # Thyroid disease:  Thyroid CA s/p surgery and radiation.
   - continue levothyroxine
   - needs out patient follow up
   .
   # C7-T2 fractures:  No clear history of stroke after comparing PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 1596**].  C-spine without acute changes of C7/T2 fractures.
   - Per Ortho, keep C-collar on x 8 weeks ([**2-26**]).  F/u appt with
   [**Doctor Last Name 2660**] scheduled.
   - will fit with smaller c-collar

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old lady with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension (HTN). She was admitted to the ICU for a C7 fracture secondary to a fall and was previously in the trauma service. The patient presents with hypotension, which is most likely secondary to diastolic heart failure, autonomic instability, or medication effect.

The assessment and plan include the following:
- Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure improves after discontinuing clonidine and is being managed with midodrine at a dose of 10 mg qhs.
- Chronic ventilator dependence: The patient is intubated for glottic swelling and underwent a thoracentesis for transudative pleural effusion during a previous admission. Weaning from the ventilator will be done as tolerated, and diuresis with Lasix will be continued to target an input-output negative balance of 0.5 to 1 liter.
- Diastolic heart failure: The patient has a chronic transudative right pleural effusion. Management will include optimizing care with beta-blockers, such as Coreg 6.5 mg, and uptitration as possible. Lasix IV will be given as needed for target I&O negative 0.5 to 1 liter for improvement in pleural effusion.
- Atrial fibrillation: Rate control will be maintained with"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old lady with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension (HTN). She was admitted to the ICU for a C7 fracture secondary to a fall and now presents with hypotension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate (HR) of 77 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 88/39 mmHg to 148/86 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode.

The patient's physical examination reveals a lack of peripheral vascular assessment, skin not assessed, and neurologic examination not performed. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels, normal platelet count (Plt), and slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) levels. The troponin-T level is within normal range.

The assessment and plan include multiple conditions:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing episodes of low blood pressure, possibly due to diastolic heart failure, autonomic instability, or medication effect. No signs of infection are currently present. The patient's blood pressure improves after discontinuing"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old individual with a history of atrial fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction, and a C7 fracture. The patient presents with respiratory failure, tachycardia, and hypotension. The hypotension and tachycardia have improved since admission.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 81 bpm with an irregular rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 55/36 mmHg to 148/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a tracheostomy mask.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, symmetrical chest expansion with bronchial breath sounds at the right base. The abdomen is soft and non-tender with absent bowel sounds. Extremities are absent on the right side and not assessed on the left side. Neurological examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and movement is not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. The blood glucose level is within normal range. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, magnesium, and calcium are also within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired airway clearance, impaired balance"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of chronic respiratory failure, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management of his conditions. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 81 bpm with a normal rhythm of atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 55/36 mmHg to 148/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support. 

The patient has received various medications, including furosemide (Lasix), midodrine, coreg, coumadin, and synthroid. He has also undergone multiple lab tests, which show abnormal results such as elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is well-nourished, has symmetric chest expansion with bronchial breath sounds at the right base, and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. His neurologic examination is also notable for attentive behavior, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli. 

The assessment and plan indicate multiple impairments in various domains, including aerobic capacity/endurance, airway clearance, balance, cough, knowledge, muscle performance, respiration/gas exchange, ventilation, and transfers"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o lady with CHF, AF, HTN was discharged from Trauma service
   yesterday after she was admitted here with C7 fracure secondary to fall
   now presents with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to diastolic heart failure vs.
   autonomic instability vs. medication effect.   Patient was noted to
   have episodes of really low BP during recent hospitalization.  BP
   improved after discontinuing clonidine.  She continues to have episodes
   of hypotension while sleeping, but no changes in mentation.
   - ideal BP will be SBP 90s given dCHF, however her BP does decrease
   below that while sleeping
   - change midodrine to 10mg qhs given good BP during the day
   .
   # Chronic vent dependence:  Intubated for ? glottic swelling.  s/p
   thoracentesis for transudative pleural effusion during previous
   admission.   Patient also appears to have weakened diaphragm as
   indicated by low NIF.
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - continue to diurese 0.5 to 1 liter negative today with prn lasix
   .
   # Diastolic heart failure:  Has chronic transudative right pleural
   effusion.  Will try to optimize management with BB if BP could
   tolerate.
   -          coreg 6.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], uptitrate as possible

   -          lasix IV prn for target I&O negative 0.5 to 1L for
   improvement in pleural effusion
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - rate control with Carvedilol
   - Target INR [**12-31**], increase Coumadin to 1.5 mg daily
   .
   # Anemia:  Most likely secondary to recent admission and frequent
   phlebotomy.  Normocytic.
   - normal vit B12 and folate on [**2194-1-14**]
   - HCT improved appropriately after 1uPRBCs on [**12-23**]
   .
   # Thyroid disease:  Thyroid CA s/p surgery and radiation.
   - continue levothyroxine
   - needs out patient follow up
   .
   # C7-T2 fractures:  No clear history of stroke after comparing PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 1596**].  C-spine without acute changes of C7/T2 fractures.

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
The patient is a 77-year-old lady with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension. She was admitted to the trauma service due to a C7 fracture from a fall and presented with hypotension. The patient has been experiencing episodes of low blood pressure during recent hospitalization, which improved after discontinuing clonidine. She continues to have hypotension while sleeping but no changes in mentation. Her blood pressure goal is set at SBP 90s due to diastolic heart failure. Midodrine was changed to 10mg qhs as it maintains good blood pressure during the day.

The patient is also dependent on chronic ventilation, intubated for glottic swelling, and underwent thoracentesis for transudative pleural effusion during a previous admission. There is evidence of a weakened diaphragm indicated by low negative inspiratory force (NIF). Ventilation is being weaned as tolerated, and diuresis is being continued with Lasix IV prn to target an I&O negative 0.5 to 1 liter for improvement in pleural effusion.

The patient has diastolic heart failure with chronic transudative right pleural effusion. Management optimization with beta-blockers (BB) is planned if blood pressure can tolerate. Coreg 6.5 mg has been started, and the dose may be uptitrated"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old lady with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for a C7 fracture secondary to a fall and is now presenting with hypotension.

The assessment and plan section of the note highlights several issues:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to diastolic heart failure, autonomic instability, or medication effect. The goal is to maintain a systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 90s due to diastolic CHF. Midodrine has been changed to qhs, and the current Coreg dosing will be continued.
2. Chronic vent dependence: The patient is intubated for glottic swelling and has undergone a thoracentesis for transudative pleural effusion during a previous admission. She also appears to have a weakened diaphragm, as indicated by low negative inspiratory force (NIF). The plan is to wean the vent as tolerated and continue diuresis with Lasix.
3. Low-grade fevers: The patient had a temperature of 100.3 last night, and the PICC line was discontinued. There is some increased sputum production but no leukocytosis or worsening ventilator requirements. The chest X-ray shows improvement compared to yesterday, so antibiotics are not needed at this time.
