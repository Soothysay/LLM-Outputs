","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer presenting with respiratory distress in the setting of post-obstructive pneumonia. She has a history of chronic respiratory failure, emphysema, and recent hospitalizations. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, arterial line, and broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia coverage. Interventional pulmonary and radiation oncology have been consulted regarding possible interventions for obstruction relief. She also has a history of NSTEMI/ACS, squamous cell lung cancer, breast cancer (stable), compression fractures (asymptomatic post kyphoplasty), and DVT prophylaxis with SQ heparin. The patient is NPO at present, and her code status is full code. She is currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure and is currently experiencing respiratory distress due to post-obstructive pneumonia. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, leading to worsening respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with post-obstructive pneumonia, which requires broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. There is a risk of treatment failure or development of antibiotic-resistant organisms.
3. Lung Cancer: The patient has newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer, which may require further evaluation and management. There is a risk of disease progression and metastasis.
4. NSTEMI/ACS: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer presenting with respiratory distress in the setting of post obstructive pneumonia. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/51 mmHg to 129/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals no signs of conjunctival pallor, scleral icterus, or neck stiffness. The cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops are heard. The lung examination reveals loud left lower lobe rhonchi and expiratory wheezes throughout. There are no abnormalities noted in the abdomen, extremities, or skin. The patient is sedated and unable to provide any information during the psychosocial assessment.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with neutrophilia, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels, and normal platelet count (Plt). The blood glucose levels are within normal range, while the serum electrolytes show mild hypokalemia (K+) and hyponatremia (Na+). Imaging findings reveal a large parenchymal opacity in the ling"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer presenting with respiratory distress in the setting of post obstructive pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation with acceptable arterial blood gas (ABG) values.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial and requires close monitoring and management. The development of post obstructive pneumonia is a concern, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover for possible MRSA and gram-negative organisms, including pseudomonas.

2. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The patient's cancer diagnosis requires further staging studies, including an MRI head to assess for potential brain metastases. Radiation therapy (XRT) has been started to treat the cancer.

3. Compression Fractures: The patient has a history of asymptomatic compression fractures with kyphoplasty. Bone scan is planned to evaluate for any additional sites of metastatic disease.

4. NSTEMI/ACS: The patient demonstrates demand ischemia, but troponin levels are stable, and a cardiac event has been ruled out.

5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is low while on propofol, and the use of home diltiazem has been held.

6. Other complications: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and bowel regimen"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with a newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer who is currently experiencing respiratory distress due to post obstructive pneumonia. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is already present and requires oxygen and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in her respiratory status if the underlying cause, such as the lung cancer and post obstructive pneumonia, is not effectively managed.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has developed post obstructive pneumonia, which needs to be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential resistant organisms like MRSA and gram-negative bacteria, including pseudomonas. If the pneumonia is not adequately controlled, there is a risk of worsening respiratory distress and sepsis.

3. NSTEMI/ACS: The patient may have ischemic heart disease, which could lead to a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This requires monitoring of cardiac enzymes and further evaluation.

4. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has a newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer. Management of this condition will involve radiation oncology and hematology/oncology consultations. Complications may arise from the treatment or progression of the cancer itself.

5. Compression Fractures: The patient has had compression fractures in the past"

   IMPRESSION:
   1. There is evidence of increase in size in the left infrahilar mass
   which
   occludes the lingular bronchus, though it is difficult to tell the
   precise
   borders of the lesion and size of the lesion given the non-contrast
   technique.
   There is also new collapse of the left lower lobe, though the airway
   remains
   narrowed but patent, as evidenced by air bronchograms throughout the
   left
   lower lobe. Patchy nodular opacities elsewhere within the left upper
   lobe and
   within the right lung are also new, possibly infectious or disease
   related.
   2. Slight increase in left pleural effusion, new trace right pleural
   effusion
   and mild increase in pericardial effusion. Trace free pelvic fluid.
   3. Bulkiness of the left adrenal, unchanged, without a focal lesion
   noted.
   4. Hypodense area within the anterior liver as described, not fully
   characterized using non-contrast CT technique. If indicated, this could
   be
   further evaluated with ultrasound for the presence of a focal lesion.
   5. Calcified lesion of the interpolar left kidney, not fully
   characterized.
   6. Sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
   7. Compression fractures of T8 (treated with vertebroplasty) and T12.
   8. Mild interval increase in size of subcentimeter mediastinal lymph
   nodes,
   nonspecific.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer presenting with respiratory distress in the setting of post-obstructive pneumonia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given are:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and experiencing respiratory distress due to multifactorial reasons including lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and post-obstructive pneumonia.
2. Infection: The patient has shown signs of infection, such as the presence of fever and leukocytosis. There is also evidence of pneumonia on the chest x-ray, which may require antibiotic treatment.
3. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection: The nasal swab tested positive for MRSA, indicating a potential source of infection.
4. Pressure ulcers: The patient is immobile and sedated, increasing the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest.
6. Delirium: The patient's sedation and altered mental status may indicate delirium, which can be common in critically ill patients.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy and history of peptic ulcer disease increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

   Final Report
   INDICATION: Patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Evaluate.
   COMPARISON: CT from [**Hospital3 **] of [**2157-12-6**].
   TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the torso were obtained
   without IV
   contrast. IV contrast was not administered due to patient allergy.
   Coronal
   and sagittal reformatted images were generated.
   CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: The thyroid is heterogeneous in
   density,
   with a calcification of the right lobe (2:2). The patient is intubated,
   with
   the endotracheal tube tip a couple of cm above the carina. A
   nasogastric tube
   is in place, with tip in the body of the stomach.
   Findings related to the patient's lung cancer appear worsened compared
   to
   [**12-6**]. The left infrahilar mass is difficult to precisely
   measure
   given the degree of surrounding opacity on the current study, and the
   non-contrast technique. The lesion which completely obstructs the
   lingular
   bronchus could measure as much as 5.6 x 5.2 cm in greatest axial
   dimensions,
   significantly increased. However, it is unclear how much of the
   opacification
   is due to adjacent pneumonia. The left lower lobe bronchus is narrowed
   due to
   mass effect from the infrahilar lesion, but it is not obstructed, as
   air
   bronchograms are seen throughout the collapsed left lower lobe. The
   left
   lower lobe collapse is new from the prior exam. A spiculated nodular
   opacity
   of the left upper lobe is essentially new from the prior study,
   measuring 1.5
   x 1.1 cm (2:22). A peripheral nodule of the left upper lobe is
   unchanged,
   measuring 3 mm (2:18). A patchy opacity in the posterior aspect of the
   right
   upper lobe is new (2:29). Patchy posterior opacities of the posterior
   right
   lower lobe are new as well, more consolidated in appearance at the
   right base
   (2:45).
   A small left pleural effusion is simple in attenuation, mildly
   increased in
   volume from [**12-6**]. There may be trace right pleural fluid. A
   simple-attenuation pericardial effusion may be mildly increased since
   [**Month (only) 25**].
   There is CT evidence of anemia. The heart appears mildly enlarged, with
   coronary artery calcifications involving the LAD, left circumflex and
   right
   coronary arteries.
   There is no axillary lymphadenopathy. Clips are noted in the right
   axilla,
   and the patient is post right mastectomy. A precarinal node is mildly
   increased in size, measuring 8 mm in the short axis (2:22), previously
   5 mm.
   A pretracheal node measures 5 mm today (2:20), previously 3 mm.
   There is a coarse calcification of the left breast (2:33).
   CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Assessment of the solid organs
   is
   limited in the absence of IV contrast. In the anterior liver, there is
   vague
   hypodensity seen on liver windows (2:57), where an underlying lesion
   cannot be
   entirely excluded. There is no intrahepatic biliary duct dilation. The
   gallbladder appears surgically absent. The spleen is normal in size. A
   splenule is noted (2:51). The pancreas is unremarkable, as is the right
   adrenal. There is bulkiness of the left adrenal which is unchanged,
   without a
   clear focal lesion demonstrated. There is no hydronephrosis of the
   kidneys.
   A calcified lesion of the interpolar left kidney is unchanged, not
   fully
   characterized (2:65). There is no free air or free fluid in the
   abdomen. No
   mesenteric or retroperitoneal nodes meet CT size criteria for
   pathologic
   enlargement. There is a small fat-containing umbilical hernia (2:77).
   The
   abdominal aorta is normal in caliber, though there are moderately
   severe
   atherosclerotic calcifications.
   CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter within the
   bladder. The uterus, adnexa, and rectum are unremarkable. There is
   sigmoid
   diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis. There are small
   amounts
   of free pelvic fluid (2:100). No inguinal or pelvic nodes meet CT size
   criteria for pathologic enlargement.
   BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.
   The
   patient is post vertebroplasty of the T8 vertebral body. There is a
   compression fracture of the T12 vertebral body.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. There is evidence of increase in size in the left infrahilar mass
   which
   occludes the lingular bronchus, though it is difficult to tell the
   precise
   borders of the lesion and size of the lesion given the non-contrast
   technique.
   There is also new collapse of the left lower lobe, though the airway
   remains
   narrowed but patent, as evidenced by air bronchograms throughout the
   left
   lower lobe. Patchy nodular opacities elsewhere within the left upper
   lobe and
   within the right lung are also new, possibly infectious or disease
   related.
   2. Slight increase in left pleural effusion, new trace right pleural
   effusion
   and mild increase in pericardial effusion. Trace free pelvic fluid.
   3. Bulkiness of the left adrenal, unchanged, without a focal lesion
   noted.
   4. Hypodense area within the anterior liver as described, not fully
   characterized using non-contrast CT technique. If indicated, this could
   be
   further evaluated with ultrasound for the presence of a focal lesion.
   5. Calcified lesion of the interpolar left kidney, not fully
   characterized.
   6. Sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
   7. Compression fractures of T8 (treated with vertebroplasty) and T12.
   8. Mild interval increase in size of subcentimeter mediastinal lymph
   nodes,
   nonspecific.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer. She presented with respiratory distress in the setting of post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. She has a history of COPD and is at risk for respiratory failure.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial, including lung cancer, COPD, and post-obstructive pneumonia. She is currently intubated with acceptable arterial blood gases (ABGs). The plan is to decrease PEEP if ABGs improve. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started due to the risk of MRSA and gram-negative infections.

2. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The patient will undergo an MRI of the head to aid in staging. She will begin radiation therapy (XRT) today.

3. Compression Fractures: The patient has asymptomatic compression fractures of T8 and T12, which were treated with vertebroplasty.

4. NSTEMI/ACS: The patient had demand ischemia, but troponin levels are stable, and cardiac enzymes are negative.

5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is low while on propofol, so home diltiazem has been held.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has post-obstructive pneumonia, which increases her risk of developing pneumonia. Broad-spectrum"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure due to emphysema, pneumonia, and lung cancer. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining good hygiene practices, such as proper handwashing, and by regularly assessing and clearing the airway.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as using compression stockings and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, should be implemented to reduce the risk.

3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at higher risk of developing stress ulcers. Prophylactic measures, such as the use of proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists, should be considered to prevent the development of stress ulcers.

4. Nosocomial infections: Due to the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU, there is a risk of nosocomial infections. Infection control measures, including proper hand hygiene and appropriate antibiotic stewardship, should be implemented to minimize the risk.

5. Barotrauma: The patient's compromised lung function due to emphysema and lung cancer puts them at risk of barotrauma. Close monitoring"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure due to emphysema, pneumonia, and lung cancer. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of allergies to iodine and has received various antibiotics. Their vital signs are within normal limits, but they have diminished breath sounds on the chest examination and absent pulses in both lower extremities. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count and troponin levels, along with abnormal kidney and liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's immobility and decreased peripheral pulses increase the risk of DVT, which can potentially lead to a PE.
3. Nosocomial infection: Being in the ICU, the patient is at risk of acquiring additional infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections.
4. Organ dysfunction: The abnormal lab results suggest potential organ dysfunction, including impaired kidney and liver function.
5. Sepsis: Given the patient's critical condition, respiratory failure, and possible infections, there is a risk of developing sepsis.

Please note that these are potential medical complications based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with a newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer. She is currently experiencing respiratory distress due to post obstructive pneumonia. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including radiation therapy, antibiotics, and respiratory support.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for intubation indicate an increased risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management of the patient's ventilation and oxygenation parameters are necessary.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP. Adequate suctioning, positioning, and infection control measures should be implemented to reduce this risk.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility, advanced age, and malignancy are risk factors for DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as early mobilization, compression stockings, and subcutaneous heparin should be implemented.

4. Pneumonia: The patient already has post obstructive pneumonia, which increases the risk of further infections. Monitoring of temperature, white blood cell count, and sputum cultures is important to detect any new or worsening infections promptly.

5. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and decreased tissue perfusion can lead to pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning, appropriate cushioning, and"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   82 year old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer,
   presenting with respiratory distress in setting of post obstructive
   pneumonia.
   #. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multifactorial given lung cancer, COPD
   requiring oxygen and development of post obstructive pneumonia. Now
   intubated with acceptable ABGs. On [**2-2**] the pt had BAL and no stents
   were required. Gram stain negative so far.  Vancomycin d/c'ed on [**2-5**]
   as cx neg.
   - prn ABG to assess oxygenation/ventilation; decrease FiO2 to 50% today
   - Change cipro, zosyn to ctx, levoquin and flagyl for presumed pna
   - Change IV solumedrol to po prednisone, 60mg daily. Continue to taper.
   - Atrovent / Albuterol / Mucomyst
   - F/u am chest xray
    #. SQUAMOUS CELL LUNG CANCER:
   - Cont XRT
   - Hold on staging studies as pt unstable, unclear whether staging scans
   will be relevant as pt may not be able to be weaned off vent given poor
   lung status [**12-19**] COPD
   #. COMPRESSION FRACTURES: Asymptomatic s/p kyphoplasty. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**12-19**]

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer who is presenting with respiratory distress due to post obstructive pneumonia. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated.

The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, which is further complicated by her lung cancer and COPD. She has developed post obstructive pneumonia, for which she is being treated with antibiotics. Her ABGs are acceptable, and her FiO2 has been decreased to 50%.

She also has squamous cell lung cancer and is undergoing radiation therapy (XRT). Staging studies have been put on hold as the patient is unstable and it is unclear whether the staging scans will be relevant given her poor lung status.

The patient has compression fractures of the spine, which were treated with kyphoplasty. She is also at risk for NSTEMI/ACS, hypertension, and DVT. Pain management, bowel regimen, and nutritional support are being provided.

The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU for further management."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, likely related to underlying conditions such as emphysema, pneumonia, lung cancer, and possibly exacerbated by radiation therapy. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation support and antibiotics. The plan is to continue with the current management, including radiation therapy for lung cancer, and weaning off steroids.

There are also comorbidities present, including diabetes mellitus, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and hypertension. These conditions require ongoing management and treatment.

The patient has a PICC line and an arterial line in place for monitoring and administration of medications. Prophylactic measures are being taken to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through a pulmonary formula.

Overall, the patient's condition remains critical, and close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary."

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer presenting with respiratory distress in the setting of post-obstructive pneumonia. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and prn ABG is planned to assess oxygenation and ventilation. The FiO2 has been decreased to 50% today.

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has developed post-obstructive pneumonia. She has been started on a combination of antibiotics including ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.

In addition to her respiratory issues, the patient also has compression fractures of the spine, likely due to metastatic disease from her lung cancer. She has undergone kyphoplasty for treatment. The patient's cancer is being staged, and radiation therapy (XRT) is planned. However, it is unclear whether she will be able to tolerate weaning off the ventilator given her poor lung status.

The patient's cardiovascular system shows evidence of demand ischemia, but troponin levels are stable, and there are no signs of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Her blood pressure is low, and home diltiazem has been held.

The patient is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), so prophylactic measures are being taken, including subcutaneous heparin"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer presenting with respiratory distress due to post obstructive pneumonia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory distress and is intubated, which indicates a high risk of continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilator settings will be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has post obstructive pneumonia, which increases the risk of worsening infection and sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and daily chest x-rays will be important to assess the progression of the pneumonia.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Daily sputum cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary to prevent and treat this complication.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness are risk factors for DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin should be initiated to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events.

5. Nosocomial Infections: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive"

","The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress caused by post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has undergone an MRI of the head and a bone scan for staging purposes.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), a heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 108/52 to 184/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, there are elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and lactic acid. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes COPD, for which she requires oxygen. She also has compression fractures of the spine, likely due to metastatic cancer. Additionally, the patient had an episode of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of demand ischemia but with stable troponin levels.

The patient is currently being treated with multiple antibiotics for presumed pneumonia, corticosteroids for COPD, and other medications for pain management and bowel regimen. She is also receiving tube feeds.

The patient's code status is full code, and her emergency contacts have been listed."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer who presented with respiratory distress in the setting of post-obstructive pneumonia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with acceptable arterial blood gas (ABG) values.

The patient has a history of compression fractures, NSTEMI/ACS, hypertension, and is currently being treated for suspected pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole). She is also receiving sedation with midazolam and analgesia with fentanyl.

Her vital signs show a slightly low blood pressure and heart rate within normal limits. Her respiratory rate is set at 18 breaths per minute with spontaneous ventilation not present. Her oxygen saturation is 94% on a FiO2 of 40%. Her ABG values indicate a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 60 mmHg, and PaO2 of 200, which are within acceptable ranges for a patient on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. Other lab values, including liver function tests and kidney function tests, are also within normal limits.

The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities, including lung cancer,"

- The patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer, presenting with respiratory distress in the setting of post-obstructive pneumonia.
- She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation with acceptable arterial blood gas (ABG) values.
- The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has developed post-obstructive pneumonia.
- She has compression fractures of the spine, for which she underwent kyphoplasty.
- The patient also has a history of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and hypertension.
- She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole, for presumed pneumonia.
- The patient is receiving corticosteroids (prednisone) for her lung cancer treatment.
- Further staging studies are needed to determine the extent of her lung cancer, including a brain metastasis workup.
- The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure due to post-obstructive pneumonia. There is a risk of further deterioration and potential progression to chronic respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

2. Lung Cancer Progression: As the patient has newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer, there is a risk of disease progression and spread to other areas, including the brain. This can lead to additional complications and affect"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer, presenting with respiratory distress in the setting of post obstructive pneumonia.
- She has undergone radiation therapy and is currently intubated with acceptable arterial blood gas (ABG) values.
- The patient also has compression fractures of the spine, which were treated with kyphoplasty, and a history of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- She is on multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, pain management, and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure due to post obstructive pneumonia. This can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially require mechanical ventilation.
2. Lung Cancer: The patient has newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer, which may progress and cause complications such as metastasis or respiratory distress.
3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient's respiratory distress could be related to underlying COPD, which can worsen with infections and result in acute exacerbations.
4. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest. Prophylactic measures are being taken, but there is still a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute on chronic respiratory failure. They have been receiving radiation therapy for cancer and have a history of COPD exacerbation, newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma (SCCa) of the lung with lingula/LLL collapse, postobstructive pneumonia (PNA) on flagyl/levoquin/flagyl, prednisone taper, and bronchodilators. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/53 mmHg to 152/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient already has acute on chronic respiratory failure, which can worsen due to underlying COPD exacerbation, newly diagnosed SCCa of the lung with lingula/LLL collapse, and postobstructive PNA.
2. Cardiac Issues: There is a slight increase in troponin levels, indicating possible demand ischemia. The patient's blood pressure is not well controlled, and there is a need for follow-up ECG.
3. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics for PNA, but there is a possibility of developing further infections due to immunocompromised status from radiation therapy and prolonged ICU stay.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer presenting with respiratory distress in the setting of post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress has led to the need for mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. It is important to closely monitor the patient's ABGs (arterial blood gases) and adjust ventilation settings accordingly.

2. Lung Cancer: The patient has been diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer. This can lead to further complications such as metastasis, tumor-related symptoms, and potential spread to other organs.

3. Post-Obstructive Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress is also attributed to post-obstructive pneumonia. This condition occurs when a blockage in the airways prevents proper clearance of mucus and secretions, leading to infection and inflammation. It is crucial to continue antibiotics and supportive care to manage this condition.

4. Compression Fractures: The patient has asymptomatic compression fractures of the spine, which may be related to her cancer or weakened bone structure. Monitoring for any changes in neurological function or worsening pain is necessary.

5. NSTEMI/ACS: There is a concern for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to demand ischem"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer presenting with respiratory distress in the setting of post-obstructive pneumonia. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is currently intubated with acceptable arterial blood gas (ABG) values. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting an ongoing infection. Her potassium and magnesium levels are low, while her calcium level is within normal range.

The patient's kidney function has shown a sudden rise in creatinine, which may be related to the administration of intravenous lasix yesterday. This indicates the need for close monitoring of her renal function.

The patient also has compression fractures of the spine, which have been managed with kyphoplasty. She will be followed up with a bone scan to evaluate for any metastasis.

There is a concern for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to demand ischemia, but the troponin levels are stable, and the ECG is negative.

The patient's blood pressure is controlled with diltiazem. She is on tube feeds at 40 mL/hour and requires pain management with Tylenol. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen, and access through peripheral intravenous lines (PIVs) and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have been initiated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), lung cancer receiving palliative XRT, respiratory failure secondary to severe underlying COPD, SCCa with LLL/lingula collapse receiving XRT, and postobstructive PNA. The patient has made a DNR decision and is sedated and ventilated. The patient's urine output is poor, and there is no response to diuresis overnight. Fentanyl was increased to 125/hour for agitation. The patient has allergies to iodine and hives as a reaction. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, hypertension, and an oxygen saturation level of 94%. The patient has trace pedal edema and diminished breath sounds throughout with rhonchorous scattered. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and lactic acid levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer,
   presenting with respiratory distress in setting of post obstructive
   pneumonia.
   #. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multifactorial given lung cancer, COPD
   requiring oxygen and development of post obstructive pneumonia. Now
   intubated with acceptable ABGs. On [**2-2**] the pt had BAL and no stents
   were required. Gram stain negative so far.  Vancomycin d/c'ed on [**2-5**]
   as no GP on cultures
   - recheck ABG and adjust accordingly
   - Continue ctx, levoquin and flagyl for presumed pna  (day 6)
   - finished steroid taper today
   - Atrovent / Albuterol / Mucomyst
   - F/u am chest xray
   - not trying pressure support as pt becomes anxious when not sedated.
   #. Leukocytosis: Peaked at 27.4 yesterday, improved today to 17.7. No
   recent diarrhea and already on flagyl making C diff unlikely. Lines
   appear nonerythematous. Most likely cause is obstructed urine outflow,
   now with positive UA.
   - Continue CTX, levoquin and flagyl. Will hold off on adding Vanco even
   though  MRSA screen positive.
   - f/u culture and sensitivities
   - seems to be improving now that obstruction relieved.
   # Anemia: 6pt Hct drop from yesterday in setting of 2L positive. Will
   recheck.
   # Thrombocytopenia: drop from mid 200s to 160s in setting of 10days of
   heparin. Will recheck and eval other possible med induced
   thrombocytopenia prior to eval for HIT.
   # ARF: Likely due to foley obstruction as improved with flushing.
    #. SQUAMOUS CELL LUNG CANCER:
   - Cont XRT
   - Staging studies completed, ? of brain met v vascular event
   - discuss goals of care with family as relief of obstruction likely
   will have side effect of radiation pneumonitis preventing extubation.
   #. COMPRESSION FRACTURES: Asymptomatic s/p kyphoplasty. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**12-19**]
   mets.
   - Per Hem/Onc recs pt will get bone scan when appropriate
   #. NSTEMI / ACS:  demand ischemia in the setting, but trop stable. And
   CE negative.
   # Hypertension: Continue dilt, sedation prn

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has respiratory distress due to newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer and post obstructive pneumonia. She is intubated and receiving oxygen with acceptable arterial blood gases (ABGs). 

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, with white blood cell (WBC) counts peaking at 27.4 yesterday and improving to 17.7 today. This could be due to an infection or obstruction of urine outflow.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has dropped from yesterday, possibly due to blood loss or dilutional anemia from positive fluid balance.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped from the mid-200s to 160s, possibly due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or other medication effects.

5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient had acute renal failure likely due to Foley obstruction, which improved with flushing.

6. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has squamous cell lung cancer requiring ongoing treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

7. Compression Fractures: The patient has asymptomatic compression fractures in the spine, which were treated with kyphoplasty.

8. Non-ST Elevation Myocard"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer presenting with respiratory distress in the setting of post-obstructive pneumonia. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the given information include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial, including her lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the development of post-obstructive pneumonia. It is important to monitor her oxygenation and ventilation parameters closely and adjust the ventilator settings as necessary.

2. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient had an acute rise in creatinine levels, which suggests possible acute kidney injury. This could be due to Foley obstruction, as her creatinine levels improved after the Foley catheter was flushed.

3. Squamous cell lung cancer: The patient has a diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer. Further treatment options such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be considered based on the staging studies completed.

4. Compression fractures: The patient has asymptomatic compression fractures in her spine, which occurred after kyphoplasty. Monitoring for any changes in neurological symptoms or worsening back pain would be important.

5. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)/acute coronary syndrome (ACS): Although the patient had demand ischemia, her troponin levels were stable, and she does not meet criteria for ACS. However,"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer,
   presenting with respiratory distress in setting of post obstructive
   pneumonia.
   #. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Multifactorial given lung cancer, COPD
   requiring oxygen and development of post obstructive pneumonia. Now
   intubated with acceptable ABGs. On [**2-2**] the pt had BAL and no stents
   were required. Gram stain negative so far.  Vancomycin d/c'ed on [**2-5**]
   as no GP on cultures
   - recheck ABG and adjust accordingly
   - Continue ctx, levoquin and flagyl for presumed pna  (day 6)
   - finished steroid taper today
   - Atrovent / Albuterol / Mucomyst
   - F/u am chest xray
   - not trying pressure support as pt becomes anxious when not sedated.
   #. Leukocytosis: Peaked at 27.4 yesterday, improved today to 17.7. No
   recent diarrhea and already on flagyl making C diff unlikely. Lines
   appear nonerythematous. Most likely cause is obstructed urine outflow,
   now with positive UA.
   - Continue CTX, levoquin and flagyl. Will hold off on adding Vanco even
   though  MRSA screen positive.
   - f/u culture and sensitivities
   - seems to be improving now that obstruction relieved.
   # Anemia: 6pt Hct drop from yesterday in setting of 2L positive. Will
   recheck.
   # Thrombocytopenia: drop from mid 200s to 160s in setting of 10days of
   heparin. Will recheck and eval other possible med induced
   thrombocytopenia prior to eval for HIT.
   # ARF: Likely due to foley obstruction as improved with flushing.
    #. SQUAMOUS CELL LUNG CANCER:
   - Cont XRT
   - Staging studies completed, ? of brain met v vascular event
   - discuss goals of care with family as relief of obstruction likely
   will have side effect of radiation pneumonitis preventing extubation.
   #. COMPRESSION FRACTURES: Asymptomatic s/p kyphoplasty. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**12-19**]
   mets.
   - Per Hem/Onc recs pt will get bone scan when appropriate
   #. NSTEMI / ACS:  demand ischemia in the setting, but trop stable. And
   CE negative.
   # Hypertension: Continue dilt, sedation prn

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has been intubated due to respiratory distress caused by post-obstructive pneumonia and multifactorial reasons related to lung cancer and COPD. It is important to monitor and adjust ABGs accordingly.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has been elevated, peaking at 27.4 yesterday and improving to 17.7 today. It is necessary to continue antibiotics and recheck the count.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 32% to 26.8% over the course of a few days. This could be due to blood loss or other causes of anemia. It is important to recheck the hemoglobin levels.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased from mid-200s to 160s within 10 days of heparin treatment. This could be medication-induced thrombocytopenia or other causes. It is important to recheck the platelet count and evaluate for HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) before considering alternative treatments.

5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's kidney function has been affected, likely due to a Foley obstruction that improved with flushing. It is important to monitor renal function closely.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer presenting with respiratory distress due to post-obstructive pneumonia. She has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with acceptable arterial blood gas (ABG) values. 

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and requires supplemental oxygen. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106/51 to 124/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient's hemoglobin concentration has been decreasing over time, from 32% to 25.9%. There is no evidence of active bleeding, and a guaiac test is negative. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, possibly due to post-obstructive pneumonia or Clostridium difficile infection, although stool cultures are negative so far. 

The patient's platelet count is within normal limits, ruling out heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). She also has hypervolemia, which will be addressed with diuretic therapy. Acute renal failure (ARF) was initially suspected but improved after Foley catheter flushing. 

The patient has a history of compression fractures and has undergone kyphoplasty. There are concerns about non-ST-elevation myocardial"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer, presenting with respiratory distress due to post obstructive pneumonia. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, but she has several medical complications including leukocytosis, anemia, hypervolemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, compression fractures, and a history of NSTEMI/ACS. She is currently receiving various medications and treatments to manage her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. She may experience further deterioration in lung function, leading to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The post obstructive pneumonia could worsen, resulting in increased inflammation and infection in the lungs. This may lead to worsening respiratory distress and potential sepsis.
3. Cancer Progression: The patient's newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer could progress, leading to additional complications and reduced overall prognosis.
4. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. If not appropriately managed, it could lead to sepsis or other hematological abnormalities.
5. Anemia: The drop in hemoglobin levels indicates anemia, which may be caused by chronic disease, bleeding, or other factors. If left untreated, it can result in tissue hypoxia and"

","The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer, presenting with respiratory distress in the setting of post-obstructive pneumonia. She is currently intubated and receiving oxygen. Her ABGs are acceptable. The patient had a bronchoscopic lavage and no stents were required. The gram stain was negative. Vancomycin was discontinued as no gram-positive organisms were found on cultures.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory distress, squamous cell lung cancer, leukocytosis, anemia, hypervolemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, compression fractures, NSTEMI/ACS, and hypertension. The respiratory distress is multifactorial and includes lung cancer, COPD, and post-obstructive pneumonia. The leukocytosis is likely due to the patient's post-obstructive pneumonia or Clostridium difficile infection, but C. difficile has tested negative so far.

The patient's anemia is not due to active bleeding, as evidenced by a negative guaiac test. The hypervolemia is being addressed with diuresis, specifically Lasix 10 IV, with the goal of achieving negative fluid balance by the end of the day. The thrombocytopenia is stable at 170s, and there are concerns of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, but this is being monitored. The acute renal failure is likely due to Foley obstruction, which improved"

   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer who presented with respiratory distress in the setting of post-obstructive pneumonia. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are generally stable, but she has had episodes of tachycardia throughout the day. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to post-obstructive pneumonia and chronic respiratory failure secondary to her underlying lung cancer. Continuous monitoring and management of her respiratory status are crucial.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has been elevated, indicating an inflammatory response or infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased, indicating a possible decrease in red blood cells. Close monitoring for signs of active bleeding or need for transfusion is necessary.

4. Hypervolemia: The patient has a positive fluid balance, indicating potential fluid overload. Initiating diuresis with Lasix is recommended to manage this condition.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient initially had a low platelet count, which could be concerning for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, the platelet count has stabilized, and continuous monitoring is still warranted."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to post-obstructive pneumonia and underlying lung cancer. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated. Bronchoscopy was performed to assess airway patency but showed no significant improvement. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
- Heart Rate: 94 bpm
- Blood Pressure: 159/71 mmHg
- Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute
- Oxygen Saturation: 96%

The patient's flow sheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. The patient is receiving midazolam (a sedative) at a rate of 1 mg/hour and fentanyl (a pain medication) at a rate of 50 mcg/hour. Other medications include pantoprazole (an antacid), heparin sodium (for prophylaxis), and antibiotics (levofloxacin, metronidazole, and ceftriaxone).

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of pallor, edema, or cyanosis. The respiratory system examination shows clear breath sounds with distant breath sounds on the left side. The cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds with no murmurs or signs of heart failure. The abdominal examination reveals soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. The"

The patient has been intubated and placed on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume of 452 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 48 mmHg, PaO2 of 250 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count peaking at 27.4, anemia with a hematocrit dropping to 26.6, hypervolemia, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 170s, acute kidney injury likely due to Foley obstruction, and compression fractures of the spine. The patient also had an episode of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) but with stable troponin levels and negative cardiac enzymes.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer presenting with respiratory distress due to post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has secretions in the mainstem bronchi and a tumor at the L subsegmental orifice. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial, including lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and post-obstructive pneumonia. This can lead to further respiratory failure and potential need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has developed post-obstructive pneumonia, which can worsen and lead to a more severe infection, sepsis, or multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the presence of pneumonia and potentially other sources of infection. This can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death.
4. Anemia: The patient has a decreasing hemoglobin level, indicating anemia. If left untreated, this can lead to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.
5. Hypovolemia: The patient has hypovolemia, which can lead to decreased tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. Proper fluid management is crucial.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient initially had thrombocytopenia, but it has improved. Close monitoring is still necessary"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, lung cancer, and pneumonia. They are currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's allergies include iodine, and they have been receiving various antibiotics for treatment. They have multiple lines, including an arterial line and a PICC line. The patient's condition is complicated by underlying malignancy, COPD, and post-obstructive pneumonia. The plan includes tracheostomy placement, nutritional support, and optimization of medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and monitoring respiratory system compliance are being implemented to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins. Prophylactic measures like using compression boots and systemic anticoagulation are necessary to prevent DVT.
3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility can lead to pressure ulcers, which can be painful and difficult to heal. Regular repositioning and pressure area care should be implemented to prevent this complication.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's weakened immune system and prolonged stay in the ICU make them susceptible to nosocomial infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, lung cancer, and pneumonia. The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia as a result of inhaling bacteria present in the ventilator equipment.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially lead to a pulmonary embolism if dislodged.

3. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and pressure from lying in one position for extended periods can result in pressure ulcers or bedsores.

4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of acquiring other nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections such as urinary tract infections or central line-associated bloodstream infections.

5. Barotrauma: The high pressures generated during mechanical ventilation can cause injury to the lungs, leading to barotrauma, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum.

6. Sepsis: Given the presence of lung cancer and pneumonia, there is a risk of the infection spreading throughout the body, leading to sepsis.

7. Cardiac complications: The patient's pre-existing COPD and advanced age may put them at increased risk for cardiac events such as myocardial"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer presenting with respiratory distress due to post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has secretions in the mainstem bronchi and a tumor at the L subsegmental orifice. The patient's family has elected for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has been given a low tidal volume ventilation strategy due to her COPD. The plan is to perform the tracheostomy and PEG procedure as early as tomorrow. The patient will continue to be NPO (nothing by mouth) and likely have a line removed tomorrow. Sedation will be titrated if possible.

The patient has a history of leukocytosis, anemia, hypervolemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure (ARF), compression fractures, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)/acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's condition is multifactorial, including lung cancer, COPD, and development of post-obstructive pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Tracheostomy-related complications such as bleeding, infection, or displacement
3. PEG-related complications such as aspiration pneumonia, infection, or leakage
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer presenting with respiratory distress in the setting of post-obstructive pneumonia. She has secretions in the mainstem bronchi and a tumor at the L subsegmental orifice. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/53-161/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a peak WBC count of 27.4, anemia with a Hct level dropping to 26.6, thrombocytopenia initially concerning for HIT with a platelet count of 186, and acute renal failure likely due to Foley obstruction with a creatinine level of 0.4. Other lab values include elevated levels of LDH, lactic acid, and troponin-T, as well as decreased levels of albumin, potassium, and magnesium.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for respiratory distress, presumed post-obstructive pneumonia, squamous cell lung cancer, leukocytosis, anemia, hypervolemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, compression fractures, NSTEMI/ACS, and hypertension.

- The patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer, presenting with respiratory distress due to post-obstructive pneumonia.
- She underwent tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement today.
- The patient is currently receiving oxygen therapy and has a history of COPD.
- She has been prescribed antibiotics for presumed post-obstructive pneumonia, which she will continue for a full 14-day course.
- Medications will be administered through the PEG, and the patient will not be allowed to consume anything by mouth for 24 hours post-operation.
- She is also receiving albuterol/atropine and methylprednisolone.
- The patient has completed a course of radiation therapy for squamous cell lung cancer.
- There is leukocytosis, but the patient is afebrile, and her white blood cell count is within normal limits.
- Anemia is stable, with a hematocrit level of 29.2%.
- The patient has hypervolemia, and efforts will be made to keep her fluid balance even.
- Thrombocytopenia was initially suspected to be related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), but it is now stable at 215.
- Acute renal failure (ARF) is likely due to Foley obstruction, which improved with flushing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He is mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy and remains in the ICU. The patient complains of throat pain at the tracheostomy site. He has a history of lung cancer with metastasis to the central nervous system and post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient's allergies include iodine, and he has been receiving antibiotics, analgesics, and other medications for his conditions.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure attributed to post-obstructive pneumonia, underlying malignancy, and COPD. Continue current level of care.
2. Lung cancer with metastasis to the CNS. Determine if additional treatment plans are indicated.
3. Pain management for the patient who has undergone tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. Transition to a oral pain regimen.
4. Hypertension. Optimize oral medication regimen.
5. Chronic respiratory failure due to advanced COPD and LLL pneumonia. Optimize medications, taper steroids, and aim for SaO2 >90%.
6. Fluid balance. Replete fluids and monitor input/output.
7. Nutritional support. Resume tube feeding via PEG.
8. Disposition. Plan to initiate screening for placement.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with respiratory distress who is currently ventilator-dependent through a tracheostomy. She has undergone several medical interventions, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, as well as treatment for pneumonia (PNA) with antibiotics.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/63 mmHg to 103/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is alert and follows commands.

Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.8 thousand/mm³, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, and normal platelet count. Kidney function is within normal limits with a creatinine level of 0.3 mg/dL. Other lab values are also within normal range.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory distress, anemia, hypervolemia (upper extremity edema), thrombocytopenia (resolved), acute renal failure (resolved), compression fractures of the spine (post-kyphoplasty), squamous cell lung cancer (already finished course of radiation), and hypertension (better controlled).

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory distress due to worsening lung function, infections"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman with newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer presenting with respiratory distress in the setting of post-obstructive pneumonia. She has undergone tracheostomy placement and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/63 mmHg to 103/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator.

The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics (levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole), pain management with fentanyl and morphine, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis, and other ICU medications.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 13.8 to 12.8 thousand cells/mm³. Other lab values include hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 26.9% to 27.2%, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 174 to 208 thousand cells/mm³, creatinine ranging from 0.3 to 0.4 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 92 to 169 mg/dL. 

The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 435 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%. The patient's ABG values indicate a pH of 7.45, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 253, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 54.

The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities in peripheral vascular status, skin, or neurologic examination due to the sedation.

The assessment and plan include several issues:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient remains stable on the ventilator and will continue to receive appropriate treatments.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient is afebrile, and the WBC count is trending upward. Antibiotic therapy will be continued, and temperatures will be monitored.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is trending slowly down, likely due to chronic disease and phlebotomy. Daily monitoring of HCT will be performed, and transfusion will be considered if the patient is actively bleeding or if the Hct falls below 21%.
4. Hypervolemia: The patient's upper extremities are still volume overloaded, and efforts will be made to keep the fluid balance even.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The platelet count has resolved"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, lung cancer, LLL pneumonia
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE -- attributed to post-obstructive pneumonia,
   underlying malignancy, COPD.  s/p surgical trach.  Continue current
   level of care.
   PNEUMONIA -- LLL post-obstructive, complete 14 days of treatment.
   CANCER, LUNG -- metastatic (CNS); post obstructive LLL pneumonia. s/p 5

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, attributed to post-obstructive pneumonia and underlying malignancy, COPD. The patient has undergone surgical tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for pain management. There is also evidence of metastatic lung cancer with involvement in the central nervous system (CNS) and post-obstructive pneumonia in the left lower lobe (LLL). The patient has hypertension and chronic respiratory failure due to advanced COPD and LLL pneumonia. The patient's current medications include morphine sulfate for pain management, pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and systemic anticoagulation with heparin sodium for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms and chest X-ray findings suggest pneumonia. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Malignancy progression: The presence of metastatic lung cancer with CNS involvement indicates a high risk of disease progression, which may lead to further respiratory compromise and neurological complications.
3. COPD exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD increases the likelihood of exacerbations, characterized by increased shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Exacerbations can result in acute respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP):"

","The patient is an 82-year-old female who is currently in respiratory distress and dependent on a tracheostomy (trach) for ventilation. She has a history of squamous cell lung cancer and has completed a course of radiation treatment. The patient also has hypertension, anemia, leukocytosis, hypervolemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure (ARF), and compression fractures of the spine.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 146/75 to 174/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on ventilator support. The patient is alert and follows commands, with diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Physical examination reveals 3+ pitting upper extremity edema and trace lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.2 K/UL, stable hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab results show normal electrolyte levels and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating within normal range.

The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and various antibiotics that were previously administered for pneumonia.

The assessment and plan include the following:

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female who is currently experiencing respiratory distress and is dependent on a ventilator through a tracheostomy tube. She has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and has completed a course of antibiotics for pneumonia. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 146/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on the ventilator.

The patient's medical history includes compression fractures of the spine, squamous cell lung cancer for which she has completed a course of radiation therapy, and hypertension. She also has a history of anemia, hypervolemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure (ARF), and a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), leukocytosis, and anemia. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's fluid balance is positive by 1,149 mL, indicating fluid overload.

Plan:
1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as necessary.
2. Discontinue antibiotics for pneumonia since the patient has completed her course.
3. Trend temperatures and culture if spikes to rule out urinary tract infection (UTI).
4. Monitor WBC trend and consider further"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. They have been mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy and remain on CPAP/PSV mode. The patient tolerated the tracheostomy collar for three hours. The patient has a history of lung cancer with metastasis to the CNS and post-obstructive pneumonia in the left lower lobe. They have completed 14 days of treatment for pneumonia and received five days of XRT. The patient's pain regimen needs optimization, particularly after the tracheostomy and PEG placement. The patient also has hypertension and chronic respiratory failure due to COPD, exacerbated by LLL pneumonia. Fluids should be expanded, aiming for gentle diuresis, and nutritional support should be resumed via PEG.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed (HOB), performing regular mouth care, and ensuring proper secretion management are crucial in preventing this complication.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots. Prophylactic measures like using compression stockings and systemic anticoagulation should be considered to prevent DVT.

3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the tracheostomy collar can lead to pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and"

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with respiratory distress, who is currently ventilator-dependent through a tracheostomy. She has been attempting to tolerate a trach mask and is doing okay. The patient started on lisinopril 2.5mg yesterday and switched PPI (proton pump inhibitor) as well. 

Allergies include iodine and iodine-containing substances, which cause hives. The patient has received antibiotics such as ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole in the past.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 89 bpm (normal range: 65-108 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 139/68 mmHg to 157/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (normal range: 14-24 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator.

The patient's weight is currently 61.6 kg, which is slightly higher than her admission weight of 59.4 kg. The height remains unchanged at 62 inches.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,527 mL and output of 2,320 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -793 mL. Urine output is 2,320 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female who is currently in respiratory distress and dependent on a ventilator through a tracheostomy tube. She has undergone tracheostomy and peg placement, completed a course of antibiotics, and is tolerating a tracheal mask. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/68 to 157/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has a history of hypertension, leukocytosis, anemia, hypervolemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, compression fractures, and squamous cell lung cancer. The patient's current medications include lisinopril, diltiazem, albuterol/atrovent, and methylprednisolone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's dependence on a ventilator indicates a significant respiratory issue. There is a risk of further respiratory distress or failure if the ventilation support is not adequately managed.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings consistently show high systolic values, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. This may lead to complications such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage if not managed properly.
3. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammation. If not appropriately treated"

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with respiratory distress who is dependent on a tracheostomy tube and ventilator support. She attempted to use a trach mask for 4 hours but became tired and is now doing okay. She was started on lisinopril 2.5mg yesterday and switched her PPI (proton pump inhibitor) as well.

Her allergies include iodine and iodine-containing substances, which cause hives. The last doses of antibiotics she received were ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole, which were discontinued on 02/18/18 at 08:00 AM.

Her current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.0 C (98.6 F)
- Heart rate: 89 bpm (with a normal range of 65-108 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 139/68 mmHg (with a normal range of 115/58-157/93 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 14-24 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on FiO2 of 50%

She is currently on prophylactic heparin sodium for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis with lansoprazole. Her fluid balance shows an intake of 1,527 mL and output of 2,320 mL,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure attributed to post-obstructive pneumonia, underlying malignancy, and COPD. The patient has a history of lung cancer with metastasis to the CNS and has undergone 5 days of XRT (radiation therapy). The patient also has hypertension and requires pain management after undergoing a tracheostomy and PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being mechanically ventilated, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia. Proper measures such as elevating the head of the bed, performing regular mouth care, and ensuring good respiratory hygiene should be implemented to prevent VAP.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Critically ill patients have an increased risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, particularly in the lower extremities. Preventive measures such as the use of compression stockings and systemic anticoagulation may be necessary.

3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. Prophylactic use of H2 blockers can help prevent these ulcers.

4. Nosocomial infections: Given the patient's prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines, there is a risk of developing nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections. Regular monitoring of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure due to post-obstructive pneumonia and underlying malignancy, as well as chronic respiratory failure attributed to COPD. The patient also has lung cancer with metastasis to the CNS and has completed 5 days of radiation therapy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented through measures such as maintaining head-of-bed elevation, performing regular oral care, and selecting appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures should be taken, including the use of compression boots and systemic anticoagulation if deemed necessary.

3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk of developing stress ulcers due to increased gastric acid secretion. Prophylactic H2 blocker therapy should be continued to prevent gastric ulcer formation.

4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance sheet indicates an expansion of fluids. This could lead to fluid overload, which needs to be managed with diuretics and close monitoring of intake and output.

5. Wound infection: Surgical procedures such as tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) carry a risk of wound infection. Infection should be monitored for,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female who is vent-dependent and has been on a tracheostomy collar. She has completed her antibiotic course and is tolerating the tracheostomy mask but had to switch to pressure support ventilation intermittently overnight. The patient has also finished her steroid course.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is stable but still requires ventilator support. If she tires on the tracheostomy mask, it is recommended to switch back to pressure support ventilation. Continuous albuterol and atrovent should be continued, and a consultation for a passy-muir valve should be sought.

2. Hypertension: The patient's systolic blood pressure is in the 130-150s. It is recommended to continue with diltiazem and lisinopril.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated but she remains afebrile. It is advised to trend temperatures and obtain cultures if spikes occur.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels are stable. Measures should be taken to minimize phlebotomy and transfuse if the patient is actively bleeding or has a hematocrit level below 21.

5. Hypervolemia: The patient's upper extremities are still volume overloaded. It is recommended to continue monitoring the patient.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 82-year-old female who is currently ventilator-dependent due to respiratory distress. She has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient has completed her course of antibiotics and is tolerating the tracheostomy mask well. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 79 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 132/46 mmHg to 157/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,227 mL (439 mL PO, 967 mL TF, and 240 mL IVF) and an output of 3,540 mL (1,160 mL urine, -2,313 mL balance). The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 355 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is alert, awake, and answering questions. Her cardiac examination shows regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs or"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with lung cancer with metastasis to the central nervous system and post-obstructive pneumonia in the left lower lobe. He has also been experiencing chronic respiratory failure due to underlying COPD.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, and his vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 132/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds, clear lung sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin with no rashes.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, and electrolyte imbalances such as low sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels. Other lab values including creatinine, total CO2, glucose, and liver function tests are also provided.

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing the current level of care for acute respiratory failure attributed to post-obstructive pneumonia and underlying malignancy. Chronic respiratory failure due to advanced COPD and left lower lobe pneumonia is also noted, with the plan to optimize medications and aim for oxygen saturation above 90%.
