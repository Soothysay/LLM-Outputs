","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with severe diastolic dysfunction, worsening heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and acute-on-chronic worsening dyspnea. The patient presents with acute decompensation of heart failure, likely due to diastolic dysfunction and possibly exacerbated by atrial fibrillation or mitral regurgitation. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been stable since the last fluid bolus, and there are no signs of infection or myocardial infarction. The patient's labs show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels, with slightly elevated lactate levels. The patient is currently receiving diuretics, rate control medication, anticoagulation, and antibiotics.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilation, so there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has severe diastolic dysfunction and worsening heart failure, which can lead to further cardiac deterioration. There is also a risk of arrhythmias, particularly given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation.
3. Renal complications: The patient has an elevated lactate level, indicating possible poor tissue perfusion. There is a risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypoperfusion or medication-related nephrotoxicity.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 89-year-old individual with severe diastolic dysfunction and worsening heart failure. The patient presents with acute-on-chronic worsening dyspnea. The medical team suspects the cause of dyspnea to be either congestive heart failure (CHF), pneumonia (PNA), or myocardial infarction (MI).

The patient's vital signs show a stable blood pressure of 150/89 mmHg, heart rate of 93 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse lung sounds bilaterally with crackles at the bases, no wheezes, and referred ventilator sounds. There is an irregularly irregular heartbeat with a 2/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, and bowel sounds are present. There are no signs of organomegaly or rebound tenderness.

The laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 173 K/uL. The blood glucose level is 111 mg/dL, and troponin-T levels are within normal range. Other lab values are within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
   89 y/o severe diastolic dysfunction with worsening heart failure,
   atrial fibrillation and atrial fibrillation who presents with acute on
   chronic worsening of dyspnea.
   .
   # Dyspnea/ Respiratory Failure: CHF vs PNA vs MI. Given rapid
   decompensation with small fluid bolus, and history of lack of fever,
   cough, no wbc, non-impressive CXR suspect patient in acute on chronic
   diastolic heart failure, either worsened recently by afib (or better
   rate control of afib in a setting were high HR is needed to maintain
   CO) or worsening MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] is likely preload dependent and may have
   been fluid down with increasing lasix.  Unclear if pt flashed in the ED
   or why she acutely compensated, but is now stable from a respiratory
   standpoint.  Lactates improving, received 3L NS in ED.  Hemodynamically
   might be improved with intubation because of positive pressure and
   decreased afterload in setting of MS.
   - ROMI
   - no diuresis tonight, BP stable, no more fluids; will attempt to wean
   vent in AM and if tolerating can gently diurese
   - stop Abx
   - wean vent as able
   - hold BB, ACEI tonight and monitor hemodynamics for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure
   - likely combination of stiff diastolic failure and poor systolic
   function secondary to MR
   - continue PEEP to decrease afterload tonight
   - hold BB, ACEI tonight
   - no diuresis tonight as patient likely was volume down initially,
   probably adequately fluid resuccitated at this point
   - wean vent and add back on ACEI as tolerated
   .
   # Afib: not anticoagulated, rate controlled in 80s-110s at this time,
   did have metoprolol recently increased.
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hemodynamic instability
   - if rate increasing, restart BB at low level
   - cont telemetry
   - no anticoagulation for now
   - cards consult in the AM
   # Diabetes mellitus : stop metformin as patient may need imaging and it
   can cause elevated lactate.
   - stop metformin
   - start HISS
   # Lactate: poor tissue perfusion vs metformin effect much less likely
   infection.  Lactate improved with 3L NS IVFs in ED.
   - trend
   - stop metformin
   - treat heart failure
   # Hypertension: stable SBPs in 110s-120s
   - change to captopril for ease of titration when restarting meds
   # Hyperlipidemia: cont statin
   # Osteoporosis: not due to fosamax until [**9-13**]
   # Glaucoma: no eye drops on OMR med list. cont any home eye drops.
   # h/o Gout: no current symptoms, monitor as diuresis increases risk.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old individual with severe diastolic dysfunction and worsening heart failure, presenting with acute-on-chronic worsening of dyspnea. The patient's condition is being managed in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 150/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's weight is 54.3 kg, and their fluid balance shows an input of 2,409 mL and output of 160 mL since midnight.

The patient is receiving propofol infusion at 30 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 29 mmHg, PaO2 of 506 mmHg, HCO3 of 20 mEq/L, BE of -1, Ve of 5.8 L/min, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 1,265. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, platelet count of 173 K/uL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, troponin T level of 0.02 ng/mL, total CO2 of 21 mmHg, glucose level of 111 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range.

The patient's physical examination findings include a heart rhythm of sinus rhythm, peripheral pulses not assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic examination not assessed.

The patient's assessment and plan include suspicion of acute-on-chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, likely preload-dependent and possibly fluid overloaded initially but now stable. The plan is to wean off the ventilator in the morning, attempt gentle diuresis, stop antibiotics, and continue monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, respiratory failure, arrhythmias, infections (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia), and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring and appropriate management are crucial to prevent these complications."

","The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), mitral regurgitation (MR), atrial fibrillation (AF), and diabetes mellitus (DM). She presented with three days of increasing shortness of breath (SOB). Lasix was increased by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], leading to improvement in lower extremity (LE) edema but no improvement in SOB. She also experienced intermittent chest pain (CP) several times a day. Initially, her oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 93% on 3 liters of supplemental oxygen (O2). A computed tomography (CT) scan showed new small bilateral effusion. She was given levofloxacin and sublingual nitroglycerin (SLNTG), which made her feel a bit better. However, she appeared dry and had an elevated lactate level, so she received a 250 cc bolus and subsequently went into respiratory distress, requiring intubation.

The patient's vital signs on admission included a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 93 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) of 150/89 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 16 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 100%. Her heart rhythm was sinus rhythm (SR). She weighed 54.3 kg at the time"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus. She presented with three days of increasing shortness of breath (SOB) and intermittent chest pain (CP). The patient initially had a low oxygen saturation (93% on 3L), and a computed tomography (CT) scan showed new small bilateral effusion. She was started on levofloxacin and sublingual nitroglycerin, which made her feel better temporarily. However, she then appeared dry and had elevated lactate levels, leading to the administration of a 250 cc bolus. This resulted in respiratory distress and intubation.

The patient has been receiving invasive ventilation since September 7th at 10:39 PM. She underwent a nasal swab test on the same day at 11:30 PM, an electrocardiogram (EKG) at 11:58 PM, and has been kept on propofol infusions overnight. Her lactate levels improved from 3.8 to 1.8.

The patient's allergies are unknown, and she was last given antibiotics on September 7th. Her current medications include propofol, ASA, Lipitor, heparin subcutaneously, and SSI (likely referring to sliding scale insulin). The patient's medical history, social history,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), mitral regurgitation (MR), atrial fibrillation (afib), and diabetes mellitus (DM). She presented with shortness of breath (SOB) for three days, despite increased Lasix dosage. Her left lower extremity (LE) edema improved but SOB did not. She also experienced intermittent chest pain (CP) several times a day. A CT scan showed new small bilateral effusion. She was given levofloxacin and sublingual nifedipine (SLNTG) and felt better. However, she appeared dry and had elevated lactate levels. A 250cc bolus was administered, leading to respiratory distress and subsequent intubation.

24-hour events include invasive ventilation, nasal swab, and EKG. She was kept on propofol infusion overnight. Her lactate levels improved from 3.8 to 1.8.

Allergies: No known drug allergies.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with severe diastolic dysfunction and worsening heart failure. She has recently been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and presents with acute-on-chronic worsening of dyspnea. The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing shortness of breath (SOB) and respiratory failure due to diastolic heart failure exacerbated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). There is a risk of ""flashing"" or sudden respiratory distress at the time of extubation due to the loss of positive pressure support.

Plan:
- Gentle diuresis with lasix IV 10 mg PRN for a goal negative 0.5-1 L fluid balance.
- Rate control with metoprolol, aiming for a heart rate (HR) of 70s-90s.
- Undergoing amiodarone loading.
- On heparin drip.
- Plan for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with cardioversion today.
- Spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is not anticoagulated at home but started on heparin yesterday with a plan for cardioversion. Continue to uptitrate metoprolol for improved rate control and get loaded with amiodar"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with severe diastolic dysfunction and worsening heart failure. She presents with acute-on-chronic dyspnea, likely secondary to worsening CHF. She has recently been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and is experiencing rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci, suggesting possible bacteremia. There are concerns about potential medical complications such as respiratory failure, flashing at the time of extubation, and the need for cardioversion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing severe dyspnea and respiratory failure due to diastolic heart failure with worsening in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure if the underlying heart condition is not adequately managed.
2. Flashing at Extubation: Given the patient's loss of positive pressure support during spontaneous breathing trials, there is a risk of flashing (sudden increase in respiratory rate) at the time of extubation.
3. GPC Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci, indicating possible bacteremia. This may require further evaluation and treatment.
4. Cardioversion: The patient is planned for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with cardioversion today. Cardioversion carries certain risks, including arrhythmias, embolic events, and potential complications related to"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 y/o severe diastolic dysfunction with worsening heart failure,
   recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation who presents with acute on
   chronic worsening of dyspnea, likely secondary to worsening CHF>
   .
   # Dyspnea/ Respiratory Failure.  SOB and respiratory failure likely due
   to diastolic heart failure with worsening in setting of A. fib with
   RVR.  Suspect  that she flashed in the ED in the setting of IVFs.  She
   is tolerating PS well but at risk for flashing at time of extubation
   given loss of positive pressure.
   - gentle diuresis with lasix IV 10 mg PRN for goal negative 0.5-1 L
   - rate control with metoprolol with goal HR of 70s-90s
   - undergoing amiodarone load
   - on heparin drip
   - plan for TEE with cardioversion today
   - SBT today
   .
   # Afib.  Not anticoagulated at home, but started on heparin yesterday
   with plan for cardioversion.  Continue to uptitrate metoprolol for
   improved rate control.  Gettting loaded with amiodarone.
   - uptitrate metoprolol with goal of HR 60s-80s
   - cont telemetry
   - continue heparin for anticoagulation
   - cards following
   - plan for TEE today with cardioversion
   .
   # GPC bacteremia.  Patient with blood cultures positive for GPCs from
   ED.  No signs of infection at present and afebrile.  Started on
   coumadin and will follow surveillance cultures.  Suspect may be a
   contaminant.
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - vanco for now until cultures speciated
   # Diabetes mellitus.  On metformin at home which is being held.
   - hold metformin
   - start HISS
   .
   # Hypertension: stable SBPs in 110s-120s in spite of propofol.
   - continue BB
   # Hyperlipidemia: cont statin
   # Osteoporosis: not due to fosamax until [**9-13**]
   # Glaucoma: no eye drops on OMR med list. cont any home eye drops.
   # h/o Gout: no current symptoms, monitor as diuresis increases risk.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with severe diastolic dysfunction and worsening heart failure. She was recently diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and presents with acute-on-chronic worsening of dyspnea. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. She has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and gout. She is also at risk for venous thromboembolism due to immobilization.

Medical Complications:
1. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has severe diastolic dysfunction leading to worsening heart failure. This condition can result in fluid accumulation and pulmonary edema, causing respiratory distress and potentially respiratory failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AF with RVR): The patient has recently been diagnosed with AF, which can lead to an irregular and often rapid heart rate. The RVR increases the workload on the heart and may further exacerbate heart failure symptoms.
3. GPC Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures from the ED were positive for Gram-positive cocci (GPC), indicating a potential bloodstream infection. Although there are currently no signs of infection, appropriate antibiotic therapy has been initiated, and surveillance blood cultures have been ordered.
4. Potential Contamination: There is suspicion that the positive blood cultures may be a contaminant. This should be monitored closely, and further evaluation may be needed to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of cardiomyopathy and severe mitral regurgitation (MR). She was admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 450 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 12, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 111.

The patient has atrial fibrillation (AF) and is being treated with amiodarone. She has been on heparin since yesterday and is scheduled for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and direct current cardioversion (DCCV) this morning. The patient's blood glucose levels are well-controlled with regular insulin sliding scale.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate ranging from 77 to 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89/64 mmHg to 144/94 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 13 to 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator.

The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy with MR and has experienced a significant diuresis of about -500/day. The family has declined percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as per the cardiologist's recommendation. The patient's chest X-ray shows left atrial enlargement and cardiomegaly, right-sided effusion, and possible hilar fullness.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, further deterioration of cardiac function leading to cardiac arrest, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization, and infection such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of cardiomyopathy, peripheral edema, diabetes mellitus type II, and heart failure (systolic and diastolic). She presents with acute respiratory failure and atrial fibrillation. She was intubated in the emergency department and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) without finding any clot. She was cardioverted to sinus rhythm using 200 joules of defibrillation energy. Following cardioversion, the patient became bradycardic with a heart rate in the 30s and was started on dopamine by the electrophysiologist. The electrophysiologist also recommended holding off on beta-blockers and amiodarone until the bradycardia resolves.

The patient received a total of 30 mg of IV Lasix. Surveillance blood cultures were ordered, but drawing labs was difficult due to the patient's small blood volume. The heparin infusion had to be stopped because there was no access for labs. The patient had blood in the endotracheal tube during suctioning.

The patient's hematocrit (HCT) appears to be on a downward trend, and a type and screen was ordered. The patient became angry in the morning and pulled out her oral gastric tube. Her respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 57.

The patient has a history of atrial flutter,"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient underwent a transesophageal echo (TEE) without signs of clot.
- The patient was cardioverted for atrial fibrillation (AF) using 200 joules and became bradycardic to the 30s. Dopamine was started by the electrophysiologist (EP) and the patient was advised to hold off on beta-blockers and amiodarone until bradycardia resolves.
- A total of 30mg IV lasix was given to the patient.
- Surveillance blood culture (bcx) was ordered, and it was extremely difficult to draw labs due to the patient's small blood volume in the endotracheal tube (ETT) with suctioning.
- Heparin gtt had to be stopped as there was no access for labs.
- The patient's HCT appears to be on a downward trend, but not that far off baseline. A T+S (transfusion) was ordered.
- The patient was angry in the morning and pulled out the oral gastric tube (OGT) with an RSBI (respiratory system assessment bundle index) of 57.
- The patient has a history of cardiomypathy, peripheral edema, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic heart failure (CHF), both systolic and diastolic.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of cardiomyopathy, peripheral edema, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic heart failure.
- She presented with acute-on-chronic worsening dyspnea, likely secondary to worsening CHF.
- She has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and flutter.
- The patient underwent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which showed no spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
- She was cardioverted for atrial fibrillation but developed bradycardia.
- The patient has respiratory failure due to diastolic heart failure.
- She has been started on diuretics, rate control medications, and amiodarone for rate control.
- Her blood cultures are positive for gram-positive cocci (GPCs), which may be a contaminant. Surveillance blood cultures are ongoing.
- The patient's diabetes medication is being held.
- She has stable blood pressures and will continue on blood pressure medications.
- She has hyperlipidemia and osteoporosis.
- The patient's family has been informed of her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's heart failure may progress, leading to further fluid accumulation and respiratory compromise.
2. Thromboembolism: Despite the negative TEE findings, there is still a risk of thrombus formation, which can lead to embolic"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of cardiomyopathy, peripheral edema, diabetes mellitus type II, and heart failure (systolic and diastolic). The patient presented with acute on chronic worsening dyspnea, likely secondary to worsening CHF. She was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and direct current cardioversion (DCCV) yesterday. Following the DCCV, the patient experienced bradycardia and required dopamine. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to diastolic heart failure with worsening in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if not managed appropriately.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has an ongoing diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, which requires rate control and possibly rhythm control measures. Failure to adequately control the heart rate or convert to sinus rhythm may result in hemodynamic instability or embolic events.

3. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's worsening heart failure symptoms suggest an acute exacerbation of her chronic heart failure. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to further decompensation and potential cardiac arrest.

4. Bradycardia: The patient experienced br"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, heart failure (systolic and diastolic), diabetes mellitus type II, and peripheral edema. The patient's current symptoms include acute on chronic worsening of dyspnea, likely secondary to worsening heart failure, and recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 139/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature of 36.3 degrees Celsius. The patient's physical examination reveals sinus bradycardia and normal lung sounds bilaterally.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 178 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.9 g/dL, blood glucose of 100 mg/dL, sodium of 112 mEq/L, potassium of 2.9 mg/dL, chloride of 103 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 18 mEq/L, BUN of 23 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.01 ng/mL.

The patient's plan includes gentle diuresis with lasix IV, rate control with metoprolol, undergoing amiodarone loading, heparin drip, plan for transesophageal echo (TEE) with cardioversion today, and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today. The patient also requires surveillance blood cultures and vancomycin due to positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci. Other ongoing management includes holding metformin, continuing beta-blockers for hypertension, statin for hyperlipidemia, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include worsening heart failure, flash pulmonary edema, arrhythmias, infections (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or central line-associated bloodstream infection), and diabetic ketoacidosis."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with acute pulmonary edema and new-onset atrial fibrillation (afib). The patient underwent cardioversion for the afib and has been experiencing persistent bradycardia, likely due to prior medication use. 

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs show a heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/47 to 139/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature within normal limits.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 178 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 11.9 g/dL, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging and microbiology results are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of CHF, treatment of afib with anticoagulation, potential extubation, transition to coumadin, and no nodal agents while bradycardia persists. The patient is also being started on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) when stable and receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 89F AF, severe dCHF, 3+ MR p/w respiratory
   failure. Cardioverted yesterday.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.9 BP 130/70 HR 80 RR 13 with sat 99 on PSV 5/5
   RSBI 57 UOP 50-70 cc/h. WD woman, alert, follows commands, NAD on vent.
   Coarse BS B. Irreg s1s2. Soft +BS. Labs notable for WBC 8K, HCT 37, K+
   3.7, Cr 0.9.
   Agree with plan to manage diastolic and valvular CHF with gentle
   diuresis and afterload reduction with low dose captopril as able. Will
   attempt vent wean / SBT on 0/0 today with goal of extubation by noon.
   AF resolved with cardioversion, transition to lovenox / coumadin.
   Suspect BCx is a contaminant, will f/u remaining cx results and cover
   with vanco for now. Will place PICC today. Remainder of plan as
   outlined above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with acute pulmonary edema in the setting of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient underwent cardioversion and is now experiencing persistent bradycardia, likely due to prior metoprolol and amiodarone use.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/47 mmHg to 139/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and is intubated.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.1-7.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 35.9-36.1 g/dL, platelet count of 173-203 K/uL, creatinine of 0.9-1.1 mg/dL, troponin T of 0.01 ng/mL, and lactate acid level of 1.9 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, warm skin, and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Neurologically, the patient responds to"
