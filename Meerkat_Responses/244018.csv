","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has a history of allergies to Ceftin and a last dose of antibiotics. He is currently receiving Eptifibatide and Heparin Sodium infusions, as well as other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/47-132/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and is not intubated. Physical examination findings include sinus bradycardia, and peripheral pulses are not assessed. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and kidney function. Troponin-T levels are within normal range, indicating no signs of myocardial infarction. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range as well. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin, which reduces the risk of DVT, but it is still a potential complication due to prolonged immobilization.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Although the patient is not intubated, being in the ICU increases the risk of developing VAP if proper"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old male with past medical history significant for known CAD
   but no MI who presents with anterior STEMI.
   1) STEMI/CAD: The patient had a large anterior STEMI but was
   revascularized with placement of a DES in the proximal LAD.  Since
   catheterization, the patient has been hemodynamically stable and chest
   pain free. CE
s elevated this AM, have not yet peaked.
   -Continue Epifibatide gtt for 18 hours (1pm on [**1-16**])
   -Continue Heparin gtt for 48 hours (5pm on [**1-17**])
   -Continue Aspirin, high dose atorvastatin, holding beta blocker for
   relative bradycardia
   -Cycle cardiac enzymes to monitor resolution of ischemia
   -Echocardiogram to assess for wall motion abnormalities
   -Restart home Ramipril 2.5mg daily at discharge
   -Lipid panel in AM, acknowledging that it may be altered by stress
   reaction to MI
   -Repeat EKG in AM to evaluate for any signs of recurrent ischemia
   2) PUMP: Despite large anterior wall STEMI the patient has no
   signs/symptoms of left ventricular systolic dysfunction at this time.
   No hypotension or signs of cardiogenic shock.
   -Holding off on starting beta blocker given relative bradycardia
   -Echocardiogram to assess for wall motion abnormalities
   -Will start home Ramipril 2.5mg daily over next 2-3 days or at
   discharge
   3) RHYTHM: Patient had 4-5 beats of NSVT at OSH in context of STEMI but
   in NSR since then.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -beta blocker when tolerated
   -Replete electrolytes PRN, K>4, Mg>2
   -If sustained VT would start Lidocaine gtt for post MI arrythmia
   4) DYSAUTONOMIA/PARTIAL COMPLEX SEIZURES: Patient stable on home
   regimen of Phenobarbitol and Lamotrigine.
   - Continue Phenobarbitol and Lamotrigine at home dose
   5) BPH: Continue home Doxasosin 1mg qHS.
   6) HYPERTENSION: Currently normotensive.
   - Begin patient
s home Ramipril 2.5mg daily at discharge
   - Begin low-dose beta-blocker when hr tolerates
   7) HYPERLIPIDEMIA: On Simvastatin at baseline, will use high dose
   atorvastatin in context of acute MI.
   -Continue Atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily
   -Lipid panel pending
   8) Likely metabolic acidosis: Resolved with repeat labs. Likely
   compensatory for respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation in
   context of chest pain and acute myocardial infarction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) but no previous myocardial infarction (MI). He presented with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was revascularized with the placement of a drug-eluting stent (DES) in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). Since the catheterization, the patient has been hemodynamically stable and free of chest pain. His cardiac enzymes are elevated but have not yet peaked.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. STEMI/CAD: The patient had a large anterior STEMI but was successfully revascularized. However, there is a risk of recurrent ischemia or complications related to the stent placement, such as stent thrombosis or restenosis.
2. PUMP Dysfunction: Despite the large anterior wall STEMI, the patient currently shows no signs of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. However, there is still a possibility of developing pump dysfunction in the future, which could lead to heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
3. RHYTHM Disturbances: The patient experienced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) during the onset of STEMI but has been in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) since then. Close monitoring on telemetry is recommended, and beta-blockers may be considered when tolerated.
4. DYSAUTONOMIA/Partial Complex Seizures"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old male with past medical history significant for known CAD
   but no MI who presents with anterior STEMI.
   1) STEMI/CAD: The patient had a large anterior STEMI but was
   revascularized with placement of a DES in the proximal LAD.  Since
   catheterization, the patient has been hemodynamically stable and chest
   pain free. CE
s elevated this AM, have not yet peaked.
   -Continue Epifibatide gtt for 18 hours (1pm on [**1-16**])
   -Continue Heparin gtt for 48 hours (5pm on [**1-17**])
   -Continue Aspirin, high dose atorvastatin, holding beta blocker for
   relative bradycardia
   -Cycle cardiac enzymes to monitor resolution of ischemia
   -Echocardiogram to assess for wall motion abnormalities
   -Restart home Ramipril 2.5mg daily at discharge
   -Lipid panel in AM, acknowledging that it may be altered by stress
   reaction to MI
   -Repeat EKG in AM to evaluate for any signs of recurrent ischemia
   2) PUMP: Despite large anterior wall STEMI the patient has no
   signs/symptoms of left ventricular systolic dysfunction at this time.
   No hypotension or signs of cardiogenic shock.
   -Holding off on starting beta blocker given relative bradycardia
   -Echocardiogram to assess for wall motion abnormalities
   -Will start home Ramipril 2.5mg daily over next 2-3 days or at
   discharge
   3) RHYTHM: Patient had 4-5 beats of NSVT at OSH in context of STEMI but
   in NSR since then.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -beta blocker when tolerated
   -Replete electrolytes PRN, K>4, Mg>2
   -If sustained VT would start Lidocaine gtt for post MI arrythmia
   4) DYSAUTONOMIA/PARTIAL COMPLEX SEIZURES: Patient stable on home
   regimen of Phenobarbitol and Lamotrigine.
   - Continue Phenobarbitol and Lamotrigine at home dose
   5) BPH: Continue home Doxasosin 1mg qHS.
   6) HYPERTENSION: Currently normotensive.
   - Begin patient
s home Ramipril 2.5mg daily at discharge
   - Begin low-dose beta-blocker when hr tolerates
   7) HYPERLIPIDEMIA: On Simvastatin at baseline, will use high dose
   atorvastatin in context of acute MI.
   -Continue Atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily
   -Lipid panel pending
   8) Likely metabolic acidosis: Resolved with repeat labs. Likely
   compensatory for respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation in
   context of chest pain and acute myocardial infarction.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) but no previous myocardial infarction (MI). He presented with an anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent revascularization with the placement of a drug-eluting stent (DES) in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). Since the catheterization, the patient has been hemodynamically stable and free of chest pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. STEMI/CAD: The patient had a large anterior STEMI but was successfully revascularized. However, there is a risk of recurrent ischemia or complications related to the DES placement.
2. PUMP: Despite having a large anterior wall STEMI, the patient currently shows no signs or symptoms of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Monitoring for any changes in cardiac function is essential.
3. RHYTHM: The patient experienced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) during the onset of STEMI but has been in normal sinus rhythm since then. Continuous monitoring for arrhythmias is necessary, and beta-blockers may be considered once the patient's heart rate stabilizes.
4. DYSAUTONOMIA/PARTIAL COMPLEX SEIZURES: The patient is stable on his home regimen of Phenobarbital and Lamotrigine. It is important to continue these medications as prescribed.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old male with past medical history significant for known CAD
   but no MI who presents with anterior STEMI.
   1) STEMI/CAD: The patient had a large anterior STEMI but was
   revascularized with placement of a DES in the proximal LAD.  Since
   catheterization, the patient has been hemodynamically stable and chest
   pain free. CE
s elevated this AM, have not yet peaked.
   -Continue Epifibatide gtt for 18 hours (1pm on [**1-16**])
   -Continue Heparin gtt for 48 hours (5pm on [**1-17**])
   -Continue Aspirin, high dose atorvastatin
   -Start Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID
   -Echocardiogram to assess for wall motion abnormalities
   -Restart home Ramipril 2.5mg daily at discharge
   -Lipid panel in AM, acknowledging that it may be altered by stress
   reaction to MI
   -Continue patient
s home Niacin 500mg PO BID
   -Start Fish Oil 1000mg PO BID
   -Repeat EKG in AM to evaluate for any signs of recurrent ischemia
   - Inpatient stress test
   2) PUMP: Despite large anterior wall STEMI the patient has no
   signs/symptoms of left ventricular systolic dysfunction at this time.
   No hypotension or signs of cardiogenic shock.
   -Start low dose Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID
   -Echocardiogram to assess for wall motion abnormalities
   -Will start home Ramipril 2.5mg daily at discharge
   3) RHYTHM: Patient had 4-5 beats of NSVT at OSH in context of STEMI and
   several episodes overnight of brief runs of NSVT, likely reperfusion
   effect. Patient asymptomatic.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID
   -Replete electrolytes PRN, K>4, Mg>2
   -If sustained VT would start Lidocaine gtt for post MI arrythmia
   4) DYSAUTONOMIA/PARTIAL COMPLEX SEIZURES: Patient stable on home
   regimen of Phenobarbitol and Lamotrigine.
   - Continue Phenobarbitol and Lamotrigine at home dose
   5) BPH: Continue home Doxasosin 1mg qHS.
   6) HYPERTENSION: Currently normotensive.
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID
   - Begin patient
s home Ramipril 2.5mg daily at time of discharge
   7) HYPERLIPIDEMIA: On Simvastatin at baseline, will use high dose
   atorvastatin in context of acute MI.
   -Continue Atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily
   -Continue patient

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of known coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He underwent revascularization with the placement of a drug-eluting stent (DES) in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Since the catheterization, the patient has been hemodynamically stable and free of chest pain. His ejection fraction (EF) is elevated this morning but has not yet peaked.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with an anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient underwent revascularization through the placement of a drug-eluting stent (DES) in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). Since then, the patient has experienced recurrent episodes of chest pain without EKG changes, primarily triggered by emotional stress. The patient has also had one episode with minor EKG changes in V2-V4, which corresponds to the territory of his previous STEMI. The patient has been hemodynamically stable and has been on a heparin drip. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure of 83/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving nitroglycerin and has been weaned off epifibatide. The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolyte levels. The patient's troponin-T levels are within normal range.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old male with past medical history significant for known CAD
   who presents with anterior STEMI.
   .
   #) STEMI/CAD: The patient had a large anterior STEMI but was
   revascularized with placement of a DES in the proximal LAD just at the
   bifurcation of the diag.  Since catheterization, the patient has been
   hemodynamically stable. He has had reccurrent episodes of chest pain
   without EKG changes largely in the context of emotional stress. He had
   one episode on [**1-17**] with soft changes - minor elevations,
   repolarization abnormality - in V2-V4 (the territory of his STEMI
   tombstone morphology)and chest pain free. CE falling as of [**1-16**], being
   rechecked today. Patient received 18 hours of Epifibatide and was kept
   on Heparin after his stenting, mainly because of recurrent chest pain.
   Lipid panel is optimal.
   - titrate ntg drip to off. Turn off heparin 24 hours after chest pain
   resolution
   -Continue Aspirin, high dose atorvastatin
   -Continue patient
s home Niacin 500mg PO BID
   - start fish oil
   - Started on Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID on [**1-16**], tolerated but
   lowered to 6.75 [**Hospital1 **] given brady to 40's and history of symptomatic
   brady on metoprolol. Will try 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] again
   -Echocardiogram to assess for wall motion abnormalities
   -Restart home Ramipril 2.5mg daily at discharge
   - Inpatient stress test
   .
   #) PUMP: Despite large anterior wall STEMI the patient has no
   signs/symptoms of left ventricular systolic dysfunction at this time.
   No hypotension or signs of cardiogenic shock.
   -Start low dose Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID
   -Echocardiogram to assess for wall motion abnormalities
   -Will start home Ramipril 2.5mg daily at discharge
   .
   #) RHYTHM: Patient had 4-5 beats of NSVT at OSH in context of STEMI and
   several episodes on [**12-10**] of brief runs of NSVT, likely reperfusion
   effect. Patient asymptomatic. No events overnight [**Date range (1) 10564**] aside from
   bradycardia to 42.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -Metoprolol Tartrate, discussing dose on rounds
   -Replete electrolytes PRN, K>4, Mg>2
   -If sustained VT would start Lidocaine gtt for post MI arrythmia
   .
   #) DYSAUTONOMIA/PARTIAL COMPLEX SEIZURES: Patient stable on home
   regimen of Phenobarbitol and Lamotrigine.
   - Continue Phenobarbitol and Lamotrigine at home dose
   .
   #) BPH: Continue home Doxasosin 1mg qHS.
   .
   #) HYPERTENSION: Currently normotensive.
   - Metoprolol Tartrate, dose as above
   - Begin patient
s home Ramipril 2.5mg daily at time of discharge
   .
   #) HYPERLIPIDEMIA: On Simvastatin at baseline with optimal lipid panel.
   This does not necessarily reflect the stability of his CAD. Will use
   high dose atorvastatin in context of acute MI.
   -Continue Atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily
   -Continue patient
s home Niacin 500mg PO BID
   - Fish Oil 1000 mg PO BID
   .
   #) Likely metabolic acidosis: Resolved with repeat labs. Likely
   compensatory for respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation in
   context of chest pain and acute myocardial infarction.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of known coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He underwent revascularization through the placement of a drug-eluting stent (DES) in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient has been hemodynamically stable since the catheterization but has experienced recurrent episodes of chest pain without EKG changes, mainly triggered by emotional stress. One episode showed soft EKG changes, including minor elevations and repolarization abnormalities in V2-V4, the territory of his previous STEMI.

The patient received 18 hours of eptifibatide and was kept on heparin after stenting due to recurrent chest pain. His lipid panel is optimal. The plan is to titrate the nitroglycerin drip to off, turn off heparin 24 hours after chest pain resolution, continue aspirin, high-dose atorvastatin, and continue the patient on home medications including niacin, fish oil, metoprolol, and ramipril. An echocardiogram will be performed to assess for wall motion abnormalities, and an inpatient stress test is planned.

   Imaging: ECHO [**1-17**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The interatrial septum is
   aneurysmal. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler, but
   cannot be fully excluded. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated
   cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The aortic arch is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation
   with normal valve morphology. Interatrial septal aneurysm.
   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old male with past medical history significant for known CAD
   who presents with anterior STEMI.
   .
   #) STEMI/CAD: The patient had a large anterior STEMI but was
   revascularized with placement of a DES in the proximal LAD just at the
   bifurcation of the diag.  Since catheterization, the patient has been
   hemodynamically stable. He has had reccurrent episodes of chest pain
   without EKG changes largely in the context of emotional stress. He had
   one episode on [**1-17**] with soft changes - minor elevations,
   repolarization abnormality - in V2-V4 (the territory of his STEMI
   tombstone morphology)and chest pain free. CE falling to normal as of
   [**1-18**]. Patient received 18 hours of Epifibatide and was kept on Heparin
   after his stenting, mainly because of recurrent chest pain. Lipid panel
   is optimal. Is roughly 24 hours without heparin and nitro. [**Month/Year (2) **] on [**1-17**]
   showed preserved systolic and diastolic function with 1+MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 10577**]mal atrial septum
   - Continue Aspirin, high dose atorvastatin. Patient loaded with Plavix
   and started on 150 qDay
   - Continue patient
s home Niacin 500mg PO BID
   - continue fish oil
   - Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID
   - Restart home Ramipril 2.5mg daily at discharge
   - Inpatient stress test
   - PT before d/c
   .
   #) PUMP: Despite large anterior wall STEMI the patient has no
   signs/symptoms of left ventricular systolic dysfunction at this time.
   No hypotension or signs of cardiogenic shock.  [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **];
   -Start low dose Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID
   -Will start home Ramipril 2.5mg daily at discharge
   .
   #) RHYTHM: Patient had 4-5 beats of NSVT at OSH in context of STEMI and
   several episodes on [**12-10**] of brief runs of NSVT, likely reperfusion
   effect. Patient asymptomatic. No events overnight [**Date range (1) 10564**] aside from
   bradycardia to 42.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   -Replete electrolytes PRN, K>4, Mg>2
   -If sustained VT would start Lidocaine gtt for post MI arrythmia
   .
   #) DYSAUTONOMIA/PARTIAL COMPLEX SEIZURES: Patient stable on home
   regimen of Phenobarbitol and Lamotrigine.
   - Continue Phenobarbitol and Lamotrigine at home dose
   .
   #) BPH: Continue home Doxasosin 1mg qHS.
   .
   #) HYPERTENSION: Currently normotensive.
   - Metoprolol Tartrate, dose as above
   - Begin patient
s home Ramipril 2.5mg daily at time of discharge
   .
   #) HYPERLIPIDEMIA: On Simvastatin at baseline with optimal lipid panel.
   This does not necessarily reflect the stability of his CAD. Will use
   high dose atorvastatin in context of acute MI.
   -Continue Atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily
   -Continue patient
s home Niacin 500mg PO BID
   - Fish Oil 1000 mg PO BID
   .
   #) Likely metabolic acidosis: Resolved with repeat labs. Likely
   compensatory for respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation in
   context of chest pain and acute myocardial infarction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a past medical history of known coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with an anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He was revascularized with the placement of a drug-eluting stent (DES) in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient has been hemodynamically stable since the catheterization. He has experienced recurrent episodes of chest pain without EKG changes, primarily in the context of emotional stress. One episode occurred on [**1-17**] with minor EKG changes and chest pain. The patient received 18 hours of EPIFIBATIDE and was kept on heparin due to recurrent chest pain. His lipid panel is optimal. He has been off heparin and nitroglycerin for approximately 24 hours. An echocardiogram performed on [**Month/Year (2) **] showed preserved systolic and diastolic function with mild mitral regurgitation and a mildly dilated left atrium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient had a large anterior STEMI, which indicates a significant blockage in the coronary arteries. There is a risk of recurrent ischemic events or progression of CAD.

2. Heart Failure: Although the patient's current ejection fraction is preserved, there is still a possibility of developing heart failure due to the previous myocardial infarction"
