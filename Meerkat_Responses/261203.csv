   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. The chief complaint is MS (multiple sclerosis), neurogenic bladder, and recurrent UTI (urinary tract infection) leading to fever and urosepsis.

The patient has undergone several interventions including the placement of nephrosotomy tubes bilaterally due to evidence of bilateral pyelonephritis on CT scan. They were briefly on levophed and successfully weaned off. The patient has a history of allergies to erythromycin, penicillins, latex, and a localized rash with ciprofloxacin. The last dose of antibiotics was piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 07/31/2126 at 06:33 AM.

The patient is currently receiving various medications such as norepinephrine, midazolam, fentanyl, vancomycin IV, calcium carbonate, vitamin D, Colace, ritalin, lansoprazole PO, paroxetine, neurontin, MVI, ferrous sulfate, lidocaine patch, and heparin s/c.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature (Tmax) of 38.6째C (101.4째F), current temperature (Tcurrent) of 38.6째C (101.4째F), heart rate (HR) of 113 bpm with a range of 84-145 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 65/36 mmHg to 149/78 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute with a range of 14-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 23.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 27.7 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 236 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 2.2 mg/dL, glucose level of 138 mg/dL, and other lab values including PT/PTT/INR, differential white blood cell count, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and electrolyte levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include acute renal failure, obstructive and likely prerenal/acute tubular necrosis (ATN), monitoring post nephrostomy tubes, intravenous fluid (IVF) to maintain urine output, and monitoring for polyuria post-obstructive. The patient also has a stage III decubitus ulcer, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and is currently being treated with vancomycin and Zosyn. Consultations have been made for renal and bladder stones, a possible urethrovaginal fistula, and a wound consult for the dec"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They have a history of multiple sclerosis (MS), neurogenic bladder, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and are currently experiencing fever and urosepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with bilateral pyelonephritis, for which nephrosotomy tubes have been placed. They have been on various medications, including norepinephrine, midazolam, fentanyl, and vancomycin, among others. The patient's vital signs indicate a high temperature, increased heart rate, low blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. The patient has evidence of bilateral pyelonephritis on CT scan. The physical examination reveals general anxiety, pale conjunctiva, normal heart sounds, peripheral vascular issues, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen with inserted tubes, bilateral lower extremity edema, and contractures. Neurological assessment shows the patient follows simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli but movement, tone, and skin assessment could not be evaluated. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, potassium, and creatinine levels, as well as low sodium and magnesium levels. The patient has a history of renal failure, decubitus ulcer, sepsis, renal and bladder stones, suspected urethrovaginal fistula, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT"

   Obstructive and likely prerenal/ATN, will monitor post nephrostomy
   tubes, IVF to maintain U/O, will monitor for polyuria post-obstructive.
 DECUBITUS ULCER (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   Stage III, follow up wound consult.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   BP improved, off pressors, bolus as necessary. Would prefer neo over
   levo given SVT episode. On vanco/zosyn, follow up culture data. Prior
   growth of Pseudomonas and proteus
 Renal and bladder stones:
   Consult urology for managment of struvite stones. also ? urethrovaginal
   fistula.
 SVT: on levo and then in IR suite..currently in sinus tach and
   febrile. will check EKG now to confirm.
 Hyponatremia: likely hypovolemic, continue to monitor post IVF and

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) and a chronic Foley catheter, presenting with fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis. The patient has a wound on the coccyx with growth of gram-negative rods (GNR), infected urine with GNR and gram-positive cocci (GPC) in pairs and chains, and bacteremia with GNR. The patient's recent urinary tract infection (UTI) is likely secondary to Proteus, as evidenced by the presence of stones on the CT scan. The patient had bacteremia earlier this year with MRSA and Proteus.

The patient's current conditions include sepsis/hypotension/leukocytosis, acute renal failure, sacral ulcer, hyponatremia, multiple sclerosis, depression/anxiety, anemia, chronic pain, and hyperkalemia. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and hyperkalemia.

The patient's plan includes intravenous fluids as needed, follow-up on blood culture, urine culture, and wound culture, continuation of neo as needed, attempt to wean by increasing IVF boluses, repeat blood culture, remove PICC line and culture tip, and continue vancomycin/Zosyn for now due to prior sensitivities.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, progression of sacral ulcer, acute renal failure, electrolyte"

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis and bladder cancer, currently admitted with fever and hypotension. She has a chronic Foley catheter and a recent urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient also has a history of renal abscess from nephrolithiasis and previous bacteremia with MRSA and proteus. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 101.4째F, blood pressure of 116/67 mmHg, heart rate of 73 bpm, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, clear oropharynx, neck stiffness (baseline per pt), no localized pain or tenderness, bilateral neprhostomy tubes, warm and well-perfused extremities, and intact cranial nerves. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 23.5 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels at 2.2 mg/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 126 mEq/L, and hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 5.2 mEq/L. The blood culture from 07/30 grew gram-negative rods, and the wound culture from 07/31 also grew gram-negative rods. The urine culture from the kidney on 07/31 showed gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis and bladder stones, admitted for fever and hypotension in a likely setting of urinary tract infection. The patient has been experiencing urosepsis, and her condition is complicated by several medical conditions and complications.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension/Leukocytosis: The patient presents with hypotension, fevers, and leukocytosis. Urine appears infected with Gram-negative rods (GNR) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC). Bacteremia with GNR is also present. Additionally, the patient has a chronic Foley catheter and a history of recent urinary tract infection (UTI). Infection is likely secondary to Proteus, based on stones seen on CT scan. The patient had bacteremia earlier this year with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Proteus.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's urine sodium (FENa) of 144 indicates renal or post-renal failure. However, it is unclear how much intravenous fluid (IVF) the patient received by the time these labs were checked in the emergency room. The patient has nephrolithiasis and is now s/p bilateral nephrostomy tubes. Renal function has improved, but the patient is experiencing post-obstructive diuresis. The patient also has an infection, as mentioned above"

The patient is on prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prevention. 

The patient has a history of renal failure, decubitus ulcer, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The renal failure has resolved post bilateral nephrostomy tubes, and the patient will be replacing polyuria with maintenance fluids while adjusting medication doses for recovering renal function. The decubitus ulcer was assessed by the wound care service. 

The sepsis without organ dysfunction plan includes bolus administration of normal saline, weaning of pressors as tolerated, continuation of Zosyn and vancomycin, and awaiting culture results. Daily cultures are needed, and if positive, the PICC line should be discontinued and the catheter tip sent for testing. An echo will be checked to rule out vegetations. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 23.5 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin at 8.9 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen at 80 mg/dL, low potassium at 3.2 mEq/L, and mildly elevated creatinine at 2.2 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's imaging shows small bilateral pleural effusions. 

The patient's physical examination reveals thin appearance, no PERRL, neck contractures, normal cardiovascular examination, symmetric breath sounds, and bilateral lower extremity edema. The neurologic examination was not assessed. 

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except as noted above. The flow sheet data includes hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other ICU medications. 

Overall, the patient's main concerns are urosepsis, resolved renal failure, decubitus ulcer, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis leading to organ dysfunction, further deterioration of renal function, development of pressure ulcers due to immobility, and possible pulmonary complications due to the presence of pleural effusions."

","The patient's chief complaint is urosepsis. The patient has a history of renal failure, decubitus ulcer, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 C (101 F), blood pressure ranging from 126/69 to 133/79 mmHg, heart rate of 81 bpm, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is hemodynamically stable.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and glucose levels are within normal range. The electrolyte levels are slightly imbalanced, with potassium at 4.7 mg/dL and magnesium at 1.8 mg/dL. The coagulation profile shows an elevated prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), but normal international normalized ratio (INR). 

The patient's chest X-ray reveals small bilateral pleural effusions. 

The patient's plan includes replacing polyuria with maintenance fluids, adjusting medication doses for recovering renal function, monitoring electrolyte depletion, and weaning off pressors. The patient is also being treated with Zosyn and vancomycin for sepsis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, development of pressure ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) and bladder dysfunction. She was admitted with fever and hypotension, likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has a decubitus ulcer on her sacrum and is experiencing sepsis without organ dysfunction. She has acute renal failure, which has since resolved, as well as hyponatremia that has also resolved. The patient's anemia is slightly below baseline and may be due to fluids and her procedure. She has chronic pain managed with a fentanyl patch and PRN tylenol. Her hyperkalemia has resolved with IV fluids.

Potential Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a stage III or IV decubitus ulcer on her sacrum, which increases the risk of infection and poor wound healing.
3. Acute Renal Failure: Although the patient's acute renal failure has resolved, there is a risk of it recurring if the urinary tract infection spreads or if there are complications from other factors.
4. Hyponatremia: While the patient's hyponatremia has resolved, monitoring for its recurrence is essential, especially if the patient's renal function deteriorates.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs close monitoring, and transfusion"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of urosepsis, bilateral hydronephrosis, and renal failure. She has been experiencing fatigue, and her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. The patient's vital signs show a sinus rhythm, blood pressure within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 98%. She is receiving various medications including heparin sodium, lansoprazole, gabapentin, dilaudid, and lidocaine patch. The patient has allergies to erythromycin, penicillins, latex, and a localized rash from ciprofloxacin. She is currently on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and her nutritional needs are being met through Nutren 2.0.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's initial presentation included acute renal failure, which has since resolved after the placement of nephrostomy tubes and intravenous fluids. However, there is a risk of renal function deterioration if proper management and follow-up care are not provided.
2. Decubitus ulcer: The patient was admitted with a pre-existing decubitus ulcer, which requires ongoing wound care and specialized beds for pressure relief.
3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: Although the patient's hemodynamics have improved, and she is off pressors, there is still a risk of sepsis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old female admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of urosepsis, bilateral hydronephrosis, and renal failure. The patient experienced a supraventricular tachycardia episode with hypotension, but responded well to increased neo drip, leading to improvement in blood pressure and weaning off neosynephrine. The patient was also successfully disimpacted. The patient's allergies include erythromycin, penicillins, latex, and a localized rash from ciprofloxacin. The patient received vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) as antibiotics.

The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems remain unchanged except for fatigue in the constitutional system and the presence of edema in the lower extremities. Vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.3째C, heart rate between 63-156 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 79/52 mmHg to 134/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10-20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 6,160 mL and output of 2,402 mL, resulting in a balance of 3,758 mL. The patient received respiratory support but did not require supplemental oxygen. Physical examination"
