He has no known drug allergies and is currently receiving pantoprazole for stress ulcers and heparin sodium as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for cough and absence of dyspnea. His vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/66 to 152/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of -125 mL (-825 mL total) and urine output of 275 mL (825 mL total). He is receiving 150 mL of intravenous fluids per hour. His ABG results are pending. The patient's physical examination reveals a thin appearance with an unchanged neck mass, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, and soft non-tender abdomen. His extremities are absent pulses on the right side and absent on the left side. Neurological examination is not assessed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with metastatic thyroid cancer admitted to the ICU for palliative radiation treatment. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate between 71-96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112-133/62-66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient has a history of tracheal deviation due to a large neck mass. He previously experienced symptoms of a viral upper respiratory infection but did not require antibiotics. The patient's laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, while other values are within normal limits. The patient has a history of metastatic papillary thyroid cancer and is scheduled for radiation mapping today, with potential initiation of radiation therapy in the afternoon. There is also a concern for right internal jugular vein occlusion, possibly caused by compression from the neck mass. Anticoagulation therapy has been withheld due to the risk of bleeding. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) pending tracheal stenting, and his glycemic control is being managed with insulin sliding scale. He is receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition remains in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch tall individual with a current temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 113/68 to 145/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is receiving radiation therapy for metastatic papillary thyroid cancer and has been transported to the basement for treatment. They have been returned and are currently on supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. The patient's vital signs are stable, with no acute distress noted. However, they have not been assessed for peripheral pulses, skin condition, or neurologic status.

The patient has received a total of 1,200 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 230 mL in urine. The blood products and drains balance shows a negative 680 mL and 230 mL respectively. The patient is not on respiratory support, but their ABG results are pending.

Laboratory values show a white blood cell count of 9.3 and 12.9, hemoglobin level of 40.3 and 37.6 g/dL, platelet count of 298 and 360 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.9 and 1.0 mg/dL, and glucose level of 127 and 160 mg/dL. Other lab results include PT/PTT/INR levels of 13.6/28.6/1.2, calcium level of 10.0 mg/dL, magnesium level of 2.4 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 2.9 mg/dL.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure due to metastatic papillary thyroid cancer. The patient has undergone radiation therapy and does not currently require stenting. Steroids are being continued to anticipate radiation-induced edema, and the patient is being treated with a proton pump inhibitor and insulin sliding scale while on steroids.
2. Metastatic papillary thyroid cancer, post radiation therapy, and monitoring for edema and stridor. Review of endocrine and radiation oncology recommendations is needed.
3. Uncertain right internal jugular vein occlusion, previously noted on 2-7 MRI neck. This is likely due to compression from the neck mass. No current indication for anticoagulation is present.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of metastatic papillary thyroid cancer, who received radiation therapy (XRT) on 02-13-2111. The patient experienced respiratory distress after the radiation treatment and was transported to the ICU. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 113/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent radiation therapy.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of -680 mL over the past 24 hours, with intake of 520 mL by mouth and total output of 1,200 mL, including 230 mL of urine output. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of ///28/. The patient appears to be in no acute distress and has a soft and non-tender abdomen with bibasilar crackles in the chest. The patient's peripheral vascular examination reveals decreased pulses in the left lower extremity.

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 9.3 on 02-13-2111 and 12.9 on 02-14-2111, hemoglobin of 40.3 g/dL, platelet count of 298,000 on 02-13-2111 and 360,000 on 02-14-2111, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 127 mg/dL, and other electrolyte levels within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of metastatic papillary thyroid cancer and recently underwent radiation therapy. There is no current indication for stenting or anticoagulation. The patient should continue to be monitored for radiation-induced edema and stridor. Steroids should be continued in anticipation of radiation-induced edema.
2. Metastatic papillary thyroid cancer: The patient should be monitored for any complications related to the cancer, such as bleeding or further spread. Review of endocrine and radiation oncology recommendations is advised.
3.?RIJ occlusion: There is a previously noted right internal jugular vein occlusion, likely due to compression from the neck mass. No current indication for anticoagulation is present.

ICU Care:
Nutrition: The patient is on a soft diet.
Glycemic control: Insulin sliding scale is being used.
Lines: The patient has a 20-gauge line inserted on 02-12-2111.
Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving heparin subcutaneously for deep vein thrombosis prevention, and pantoprazole orally for stress ulcer prophylaxis. There is no ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient's chief complaint is tracheal compression. The patient received XRT yesterday without any events. The patient has a history of thyroid cancer and is currently undergoing radiation oncology treatment. They also have leukocytosis, which is likely due to steroids, and their Foley catheter was removed. The patient has an internal jugular vein thrombosis but is not receiving anticoagulation due to a high bleeding risk. They are on SQ Heparin and PPI for high-dosed steroids. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Airway obstruction: The tracheal compression can lead to airway obstruction, which is a medical emergency.
2. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection or inflammatory response.
3. Thrombosis: The internal jugular vein thrombosis poses a risk of further clot formation and potential embolization.
4. Complications from XRT: Radiation therapy can have side effects such as tissue damage, inflammation, and secondary infections.
5. Steroid-related complications: Long-term use of high-dose steroids can lead to various complications including immune suppression, bone loss, and increased risk of infections."

   Assessment and Plan
 AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, CENTRAL / UPPER: Receiving XRT, continue steroids
   w/ taper as per rad onc (Prednisone 60mg)
 THYROID CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM): Rad onc following
 LEUKOCYTOSIS: likely [**2-7**] steroids; will check CXR given cough (no
   other sxs - no dysuria or diarrhea, never had Foley catheter). Culture
   is spikes.
 IJ THROMBOSIS: No anticoagulation given bleeding risk
   ICU Care

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of tracheal compression.
- The patient received XRT yesterday and had no events.
- The patient's allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, other ICU medications, and other medications are documented.
- The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remains unchanged except where noted above and below.
- The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and oxygenation are monitored and recorded.
- The patient's peripheral vascular status, skin condition, neurologic assessment, and lab results are also documented.
- The patient has a history of thyroid cancer and is receiving radiation oncology treatment.
- The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely due to steroids, and a potential airway obstruction.
- The patient has an inferior vena cava (IJ) thrombosis but no anticoagulation is given due to bleeding risk.
- The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and VAP precautions.
- The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is called out.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction: The patient's tracheal compression may worsen, leading to further obstruction of the airway.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may"
