   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for
   weakness, PNA found on [**Hospital 10067**] transferred from oncology service for
   hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia:  Gas on floor with 50% FiO2 7.51/30/65 when sating 92%, but
   now sating at 95-100% on 50%.  Most likely from right middle lobe PNA
   seen on CXR.  Has thick, fluorescent green mucous in oropharynx which
   is foul smelling - likely pseudomonas.  Other possible etiologies
   include PE, CHF exacerbation though those are less likely.
   - will double cover for pseudomonas with Cefepime and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] also
   treat with vancomycin for broad coverage, ID already approved
   - high flow face mask to keep sats 93-95% give likely has COPD given
   long tobacco history
   - patient is currently refusing suctioning and has a poor cough reflex
   - concern for inability to clear secretions, wife to come in to help
   convince patient to be suctioned which is essential to stave off
   further aspiration and potential need for intubation
   - consider CTA to eval for PE though not clinically stable enough
   currently
   - check BNP to r/o CHF exacerbation
   # Respiratory Alkalosis: Co2 on gas 30, normal bicarb.  Likely from
   hyperventilation and blowing off too much CO2 in an attempt to properly
   oxygenate in the setting of respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   - O2 as above
   - trend gas
   # Hyponatremia:  119 on admission and on repeat, but rose to 126 this
   morning after fluids and then lasix, so unclear which had an effect.
   Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia as patient appears dry on exam with
   thick secretions and has no e/o fluid overload on exam.  FeNa is 0.46%
   indicating hypovolemia. Urine and seruum osmolality low.
   - IVF maintenance of NS 100cc/hr for 1 L
   - pm lytes and trend
   # Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA:  Follwed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**].  Is

   - e-mailed Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3805**] to make aware of admission/transfer
   - has G-tube in place for feeding, will c/s nutrition for TF
   recommendations and keep pt NPO
   - management per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3805**]
   # HTN:  On atenolol and HCTZ at home, both were held on admission.  Pt
   has been mildly HTN in the 150's with hr 90-100.
   - will restart BB, but give metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] for shorter acting med

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted for weakness and pneumonia. The patient is currently experiencing hypoxia, likely due to a right middle lobe pneumonia. He has thick, foul-smelling secretions in his oropharynx, suggestive of pseudomonas infection. The patient is refusing suctioning and has a poor cough reflex, which is concerning for aspiration and potential need for intubation. The patient also has hyponatremia, likely hypovolemic in nature, and respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, stage III squamous cell throat cancer, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient's current medications include atenolol and HCTZ for hypertension, and ASA 325mg daily for CVA. The patient has a G-tube in place for feeding. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126-161 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's imaging shows right middle lobe pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, who was admitted for weakness and pneumonia. He was transferred from the oncology service for hypoxia. The patient has several medical complications:

1. Hypoxia: The most likely cause of hypoxia is a right middle lobe pneumonia seen on the chest X-ray. Other possible etiologies include pulmonary embolism (PE) or congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient's serum sodium level is low, with a serum osmolarity that is also low. This suggests hypotonic hyponatremia. The differential diagnosis includes hypovolemic (dehydration), euvolemic (SIADH from pneumonia), or hypervolemic (CHF). The patient has jugular venous distension (JVD) and an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, making CHF likely. However, the patient also has a high urine osmolarity, which makes SIADH likely as well. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause of hyponatremia.

3. Aspiration risk: The patient has severe dysphagia and is at high risk for aspiration, especially with reduced/weak cough reflex. The physician recommends keeping the patient NPO (nothing by mouth) and starting g-tube feeds.

   68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for
   weakness, PNA found on [**Hospital 10067**] transferred from oncology service for
   hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia:  Gas on floor with 50% FiO2 7.51/30/65 when sating 92%, but
   now sating at 95-100% on 50%.  Most likely from right middle lobe PNA
   seen on CXR.  Has thick, fluorescent green mucous in oropharynx which
   is foul smelling - likely pseudomonas.  Other possible etiologies
   include PE, CHF exacerbation though those are less likely.
   - will double cover for pseudomonas with Cefepime and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] also
   treat with vancomycin for broad coverage, ID already approved
   - high flow face mask to keep sats 93-95% give likely has COPD given
   long tobacco history
   - patient is currently refusing suctioning and has a poor cough reflex
   - concern for inability to clear secretions, wife to come in to help
   convince patient to be suctioned which is essential to stave off
   further aspiration and potential need for intubation
   - consider CTA to eval for PE though not clinically stable enough
   currently
   - check BNP to r/o CHF exacerbation
   # Respiratory Alkalosis: Co2 on gas 30, normal bicarb.  Likely from
   hyperventilation and blowing off too much CO2 in an attempt to properly
   oxygenate in the setting of respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   - O2 as above
   - trend gas
   # Hyponatremia:  119 on admission and on repeat, but rose to 126 this
   morning after fluids and then lasix, so unclear which had an effect.
   Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia as patient appears dry on exam with
   thick secretions and has no e/o fluid overload on exam.  FeNa is 0.46%
   indicating hypovolemia. Urine and seruum osmolality low.

   - has G-tube in place for feeding, will c/s nutrition for TF
   recommendations and keep pt NPO
   - management per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3805**]
   # HTN:  On atenolol and HCTZ at home, both were held on admission.  Pt
   has been mildly HTN in the 150's with hr 90-100.
   - will restart BB, but give metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] for shorter acting med

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer admitted for weakness and pneumonia. He was transferred from the oncology service for hypoxia and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/55 mmHg to 161/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 50% FiO2. He is using accessory muscles to breathe and has copious thick secretions visible in his mouth and oropharynx.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxia, respiratory alkalosis, and hyponatremia. The hypoxia is likely due to a right middle lobe pneumonia seen on chest X-ray. The respiratory alkalosis is likely from hyperventilation in response to respiratory distress and hypoxia. The hyponatremia may be hypovolemic in nature, as the patient appears dry on examination with thick secretions and has no evidence of fluid overload.

The patient's medical history includes stage III squamous cell throat cancer, hypertension, and a history of small strokes. He is currently being treated with cefepime, vancomycin, and lorazepam.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory distress leading to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male admitted with hypoxemic respiratory compromise secondary to pneumonia. The patient has a right middle lobe opacity and is experiencing a high volume of secretions, which requires close monitoring and intensive nursing and respiratory care therapy to maintain airway patency.

The patient's medical history includes a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the neck, for which treatment has a 50% 5-year survival rate. However, the patient also has limitations in regards to swallow and chronic aspiration.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 110 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 119/54 mmHg to 161/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on high flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, increased potassium level, decreased bicarbonate level, elevated blood glucose levels, and prolonged PT/PTT/INR.

The assessment and plan include treatment for pneumonia with ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime, along with chest physiotherapy and suctioning to aid in secretion clearance. The concern is significant for possible intubation, with a current FiO2 of 0.5. The healthcare team"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for
   weakness, PNA found on [**Hospital 10067**] transferred from oncology service for
   hypoxia.
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation. Most likely from right middle
   lobe PNA seen on CXR.  Sputum culture grew out GNR, speciation pending.
    Other possible etiologies include PE and CHF exacerbation which are
   less likely at this time.
   - on ventilator, adjust settings today
   - continue double cover for pseudomonas with Cefepime and Cipro, also
   continue Vancomycin for broad coverage
   - f/u sputum cultures
   .
   # Sepsis: pt meets the criteria for sepsis. The source of infection is
   most likely pulmonary given his RML pneumonia on CXR. Sputum culture
   grew out GNR, speciation pending.  GI source is less likely since pt
   had no diarrhea, abdominal pain or any other GI complaints prior to
   intubations, however, would check LFT and C. diff . GU source is less
   likely given negative UA. Patient has no skin breakdown. No new murmur
   to warrant a TTE at this point. No sinusitis so wouldn
t get a CT sinus
   at this time.
   - continue double cover for pseudomonas with Cefepime and Cipro, also
   continue Vancomycin for broad coverage
   - f/u on sputum culture speciation of GNR and sensitivities
   - follow up blood and urine cultures
   - check LFT and C. diff
   - maintain MAP goal >65, CVP>[**10-11**] and UOP>30cc/hr
   - follow lactate
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Mostly likely hypotonic hyponatremia (serum osm is
   low). Diff incl hypovolemic (dehydration), euvolemic (SIADH from
   pneumonia), hypervolemic (CHF).  Pt Initially improved from 119 at
   admission with IVF, but is currently still low.  Pt has JVD and elev
   BNP making CHF likely while pt has high urine osm making SIADH likely.
   - check uric acid levels (supposed to be elev in SIADH)
   - fluid restrict to 1500 cc today
   - CXR to eval for CHF -> if c/w CHF, diurese gently with Lasix
   - PM lytes, urine lytes, urine cx
   # Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA:  Follwed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**].  Is
   s/p XRT  and cetuximab, last dose [**2184-6-21**].
   - f/u Onc recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3805**] following)
   - S&S following
   - TF were held during suctioning [**2-2**] risk of aspiration, but can be
   restarted today
   - f/u SW recs
   .
   # HTN:  On atenolol and HCTZ at home, both  held on admission
   - continue  metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 7**] for now
   - continue to hold HCTZ
   .
   # H/O CVA:  Per notes, had h/o of 'small strokes'.  No residual
   deficits.
   - continue ASA 325mg qd

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer admitted for weakness and pneumonia. He was transferred from the oncology service due to hypoxia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, sepsis, hyponatremia, and stage III squamous cell throat cancer.

Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation and is on mechanical ventilation. The most likely cause of respiratory failure is right middle lobe pneumonia seen on chest X-ray. Other possible etiologies include pulmonary embolism and congestive heart failure exacerbation, which are less likely at this time.

Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, and the source of infection is most likely pulmonary given his right middle lobe pneumonia on chest X-ray. Sputum culture grew out a gram-negative rod (GNR), and speciation is pending. GI and GU sources are less likely, but further investigations will be done.

Hyponatremia: The patient has hypotonic hyponatremia with a low serum osmolarity. The differential includes hypovolemic (dehydration), euvolemic (SIADH from pneumonia), and hypervolemic (CHF). The patient initially improved from 119 at admission with IV fluids but is currently still low. The patient has jugular venous distention (JVD) and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) making"

   # Sepsis: pt meets the criteria for sepsis. The source of infection is
   most likely pulmonary given his RML pneumonia on CXR. Sputum culture
   grew out GNR, speciation pending.  GI source is less likely since pt
   had no diarrhea, abdominal pain or any other GI complaints prior to
   intubations, however, would check LFT and C. diff . GU source is less
   likely given negative UA. Patient has no skin breakdown. No new murmur
   to warrant a TTE at this point. No sinusitis so wouldn
t get a CT sinus
   at this time.
   - continue double cover for pseudomonas with Cefepime and Cipro, also
   continue Vancomycin for broad coverage
   - f/u on sputum culture speciation of GNR and sensitivities
   - follow up blood and urine cultures
   - check LFT and C. diff

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, who was admitted for weakness and found to have pneumonia (PNA). He is currently experiencing respiratory failure and has been intubated. The source of infection is most likely pulmonary given his diffuse bilateral infiltrate on the chest X-ray. Sputum culture grew out Gram-negative rods (GNR), speciation pending. Other possible etiologies include pulmonary embolism (PE) and congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, which are less likely at this time.

The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, with the pulmonary source being the most likely. GI and GU sources are less likely. The patient has hyponatremia, likely due to hypovolemia, and is receiving double cover for pseudomonas with Cefepime and Cipro, along with Vancomycin for broad coverage. Blood and urine cultures are pending. The patient's lactate level is elevated.

The patient's medical history includes stage III squamous cell throat cancer, hypertension, and a history of small strokes without residual deficits. He is currently on metoprolol for hypertension and ASA for his history of CVA. Depression is also noted, but anti-depressants may be considered when the patient is not sedated.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) at 38.4°C (101.2°F), heart rate (HR) at 132 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 109/55 mmHg to 187/110 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 98% on 100% FiO2. The patient's physical examination reveals the use of accessory muscles to breathe, drowsiness, and copious thick secretions visible in the mouth and oropharynx. Other findings include jugular venous distention (JVD), regular rapid heart rate (RR), and diffuse rhonchi in the lungs.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 21.6 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hb) at 9.2 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 153 mg/dL, decreased sodium (Na+) at 25 mEq/L, elevated lactate at 1.6, and other abnormalities. Imaging shows diffuse bilateral infiltrate on chest X-ray.

Plan:

1. Continue double cover for pseudomonas with Cefepime and Cipro, also continue Vancomycin for broad coverage.
2. Follow up on sputum culture speciation of GNR and sensitivities.
3. Follow up on blood and urine cultures.
4. Check liver function tests (LFT) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff).
5. Maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal >65, central"

   68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for
   weakness, PNA found on [**Hospital 10067**] transferred from oncology service for
   hypoxia.
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation. Most likely from PNA seen on
   CXR.  Sputum culture grew out GNR, speciation pending.  Other possible
   etiologies include PE and CHF exacerbation which are less likely at
   this time.
   - on ventilator AC setting, FiO2 was decreased from 100% to 70%, check
   ABG and re-adjust setting accordingly.
   - as this is likely CAP and aspiration pneumonia, would d/c cefepime
   and cipro as he doesn
t have any risk factors or past infection with
   pseudomonas, and put him on vanc, levo and zosyn
   - f/u sputum culture GNR speciation and sensitivities.
   .
   # Sepsis: pt meets the criteria for sepsis. The source of infection is
   most likely pulmonary given his pneumonia seen on CXR. Sputum culture
   grew out GNR, speciation pending.  GI source is less likely since pt
   had no diarrhea, abdominal pain or any other GI complaints prior to
   intubations, however, would check LFT and C. diff . GU source is less
   likely given negative UA. Patient has no skin breakdown. No new murmur
   to warrant a TTE at this point. No sinusitis so wouldn
t get a CT sinus
   at this time.
   - continue vanc, zosyn and levo
   - f/u on sputum culture speciation of GNR and sensitivities
   - follow up blood and urine cultures
   - check LFT and C. diff

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted for weakness and pneumonia. He was transferred from the oncology service due to hypoxia. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. His condition has worsened, with diffuse bilateral infiltrates seen on the chest X-ray. The sputum culture grew out a gram-negative rod, with speciation and sensitivities pending. The patient meets the criteria for sepsis and respiratory failure. He is also hyponatremic, with a FeNa of 0.11 and urine Na of 18. The most likely cause of hyponatremia is hypovolemic. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, a history of cerebrovascular accidents, and depression. He is being treated with various medications, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and aspirin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia, and there is a risk of further deterioration if the underlying infection does not improve or if new complications arise.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction if not promptly treated.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia with a FeNa of 0.11 and urine Na of 18, indicating a possible hypovolemic etiology"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient has throat cancer and is experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia (pna). They were intubated and placed on invasive ventilation at 02:00 AM on 09/18/2184. The patient also has a fever of 101.2°F at 03:00 AM on 09/18/2184.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin. They are also receiving propofol infusion, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and lorazepam (Ativan).

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 99 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 109/55 mmHg to 187/110 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%. The patient's temperature is elevated at 101.2°F.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted fever. The patient's flow sheet data shows ongoing fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds (BS) in the lungs, a benign abdominal exam, and no extremity edema.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 21.6 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 26.9%, platelet count (Plt) of 347 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.6 mg/dL, troponin T of 0.01 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 131 to 153 mg/dL. Other lab values, including electrolytes and cardiac enzymes, are also provided.

Radiology results show a worsening multifocal pneumonia (CXR) and sputum culture growing Gram-negative rods (GNR) from the endotracheal tube (ETT).

The assessment and plan include weaning FiO2, continuing antibiotics, and following the culture results for respiratory failure/pna. The patient's throat cancer is not an active issue at this time. Additionally, the patient has hyponatremia, which requires IVF.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), drug-related complications (such as antibiotic resistance), and complications related to the patient's underlying throat cancer."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient is on invasive ventilation and has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient's temperature is currently at 101.2°F (38.4°C), heart rate is 132 bpm, blood pressure is 109/55 mmHg, respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient's vital signs have been fluctuating throughout the day. The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including cefipime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin. The patient is also receiving propofol infusion and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum culture will be important to identify any signs of infection.
2. Nosocomial infection: Being in the ICU, the patient is susceptible to nosocomial infections, which can include bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, or wound infections. Regular assessment of vital signs and laboratory parameters, along with appropriate infection control measures, can help prevent and identify such infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and the use of central venous catheters increase"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of throat cancer who is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and pneumonia. The patient is sedated and intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been experiencing fever and his condition has been deteriorating.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This is supported by the worsening multifocal pneumonia seen on the chest X-ray.
2. Hospital-acquired infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the ongoing treatment and his underlying cancer, making him more susceptible to hospital-acquired infections.
3. Sepsis: The presence of fever and worsening condition could indicate sepsis, which is a systemic inflammatory response to infection.
4. Barotrauma: The high peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) and plateau pressures (Plateau) indicate the potential risk of barotrauma, which is lung injury caused by excessive pressure during mechanical ventilation.
5. Fluid imbalance: The fluid balance sheet shows a positive balance of 932 mL over the past 24 hours, indicating potential fluid overload, which can contribute to respiratory distress and other complications.
6. Throat cancer recurrence: Although currently not an active issue, the patient's history of throat cancer poses a long-term risk of recurrence or complications related to the cancer itself."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Wanted to change to Zosyn for better GPC and anaerobic coverage
   (given ? CAP versus ASP versus ? pseudomonas) but ID would not approve,
   ID team feels flagyl + cefepime is equivalent coverage
   - Added levoflox for atypical coverage and to continue double coverage
   pseudomonas, so currently on vanc+levo+cefepime+flagyl
   - A-line placed
   - Ventilator: FiO2 decreased to 50%. ABG looked good.
   - Had a fever to 100.5 at 4pm, didn't culture as he already had blood
   culture sent in the am.
   - BP low, given LR and NS boluses
   - Hct 21 this am, trending down. ordered T+S and 2u pRBC

   hypoxia.
   # Respiratory failure:  [**2-2**] to PNA. Continues to be intubated.  Sputum
   culture grew out GNR, speciation pending.  Other possible etiologies
   include PE and CHF exacerbation which are less likely at this time.
   - on ventilator AC setting, FiO2 was decreased from 100% to 70%, check
   ABG and re-adjust setting accordingly.
   - as this is likely CAP and aspiration pneumonia, would d/c cefepime
   and cipro as he doesn
t have any risk factors or past infection with
   pseudomonas, and put him on vanc, levo and zosyn
   - f/u sputum culture GNR speciation and sensitivities.
   .
   # Sepsis: pt meets the criteria for sepsis. The source of infection is
   most likely pulmonary given his pneumonia seen on CXR. Sputum culture
   grew out GNR, speciation pending.  GI source is less likely since pt
   had no diarrhea, abdominal pain or any other GI complaints prior to
   intubations, however, would check LFT and C. diff . GU source is less
   likely given negative UA. Patient has no skin breakdown. No new murmur
   to warrant a TTE at this point. No sinusitis so wouldn
t get a CT sinus
   at this time.
   - continue vanc, zosyn and levo
   - f/u on sputum culture speciation of GNR and sensitivities
   - follow up blood and urine cultures
   - check LFT and C. diff
   - maintain MAP goal >65, CVP>[**10-11**] and UOP>30cc/hr
   - maintain ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  FeNa 0.11. Urine Na 18. Mostly likely hypovolemic
   hyponatremia.
   - maintain MAP goal >65, CVP>[**10-11**] and UOP>30cc/hr
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA:  Follwed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**].  Is
   s/p XRT and cetuximab, last dose [**2184-6-21**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted for weakness and pneumonia. He was transferred from the oncology service for hypoxia. The patient continues to be intubated due to respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. His sputum culture grew out a gram-negative rod (GNR), with speciation and sensitivities pending. Other possible etiologies include pulmonary embolism (PE) and congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, which are less likely at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia, which has required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The risk of further respiratory failure may be present if the GNR infection does not respond to the current antibiotic regimen or if there is a development of antibiotic resistance.

2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, likely secondary to the pulmonary infection indicated by the presence of pneumonia on chest X-ray and positive GNR growth in the sputum culture. The source of infection is most likely pulmonary, but other sources such as gastrointestinal (GI), genitourinary (GU), or skin infections should be considered and ruled out.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia with a low serum sodium level. The fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 0.11, suggesting hypovole"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for
   weakness, PNA found on [**Hospital 10067**] transferred from oncology service for
   hypoxia.
   # Respiratory failure:  [**2-2**] to PNA. Continues to be intubated.  Sputum
   culture grew out GNR, speciation pending.  Other possible etiologies
   include PE and CHF exacerbation which are less likely at this time.
   - on ventilator AC setting, FiO2 was decreased to 40% this AM, satting
   well.
   - continue currently abx coverage with vanc, levo, cefepime and flagyl
   - f/u sputum culture GNR speciation and sensitivities
   - f/u on today
s CXR
   - try to PS
   - continue chest PT
   .
   # Sepsis: pt meets the criteria for sepsis. The source of infection is
   most likely pulmonary given his pneumonia seen on CXR. Sputum culture
   grew out GNR, speciation pending.  GI source is less likely since pt
   had no diarrhea, abdominal pain or any other GI complaints prior to
   intubations, however, would check LFT and C. diff . GU source is less
   likely given negative UA. Patient has no skin breakdown. No new murmur
   to warrant a TTE at this point. No sinusitis so wouldn
t get a CT sinus
   at this time.
   - continue vanc, cefepime, flagyl and levo
   - f/u on sputum culture speciation of GNR and sensitivities
   - follow up blood and urine cultures
   - maintain MAP goal >65, CVP>[**10-11**] and UOP>30cc/hr
   - maintain ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # Anemia
   - Hct is down to 21 today
   - giving 2U pRBCs
   - check post-tranf Hct
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  FeNa 0.11. Urine Na 18. Na currently 131, much
   improved.
   - maintain MAP goal >65, CVP>[**10-11**] and UOP>30cc/hr
   - continue to monitor

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted for weakness and pneumonia. He was transferred from the oncology service for hypoxia and is currently intubated due to respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. The sputum culture grew out a gram-negative rod, with speciation and sensitivities pending. Other possible etiologies include pulmonary embolism and congestive heart failure exacerbation, which are less likely at this time.

The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, most likely pulmonary given his pneumonia seen on chest X-ray. Sepsis source is less likely to be gastrointestinal or genitourinary. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, cefepime, and metronidazole.

The patient has anemia with a hematocrit of 21, and 2 units of packed red blood cells have been ordered. The patient also has hyponatremia, which has improved significantly. Fluid management goals include maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65, central venous pressure (CVP) 10-11, and urine output (UOP) >30cc/hr.

The patient has a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, treated with radiation therapy and cetuximab. The last dose was on [**2184-6-21**]. The patient's oncology recommendations should be followed, and symptoms"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Wanted to change to Zosyn for better GPC and anaerobic coverage
   (given ? CAP versus ASP versus ? pseudomonas) but ID would not approve,
   ID team feels flagyl + cefepime is equivalent coverage
   - Added levoflox for atypical coverage and to continue double coverage

   - A-line placed
   - Ventilator: FiO2 decreased to 50%. ABG looked good.
   - Had a fever to 100.5 at 4pm, didn't culture as he already had blood
   culture sent in the am.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for
   weakness, PNA found on [**Hospital 10067**] transferred from oncology service for
   hypoxia.
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation. Most likely from PNA seen on
   CXR.  Sputum culture grew out GNR, speciation pending.  Other possible
   etiologies include PE and CHF exacerbation which are less likely at
   this time.
   - on ventilator AC setting, FiO2 was decreased from 100% to 70%, check
   ABG and re-adjust setting accordingly.
   - as this is likely CAP and aspiration pneumonia, would d/c cefepime
   and cipro as he doesn
t have any risk factors or past infection with
   pseudomonas, and put him on vanc, levo and zosyn
   - f/u sputum culture GNR speciation and sensitivities.
   .
   # Sepsis: pt meets the criteria for sepsis. The source of infection is
   most likely pulmonary given his pneumonia seen on CXR. Sputum culture
   grew out GNR, speciation pending.  GI source is less likely since pt
   had no diarrhea, abdominal pain or any other GI complaints prior to
   intubations, however, would check LFT and C. diff . GU source is less
   likely given negative UA. Patient has no skin breakdown. No new murmur
   to warrant a TTE at this point. No sinusitis so wouldn
t get a CT sinus
   at this time.
   - continue vanc, zosyn and levo
   - f/u on sputum culture speciation of GNR and sensitivities
   - follow up blood and urine cultures
   - check LFT and C. diff
   - maintain MAP goal >65, CVP>[**10-11**] and UOP>30cc/hr
   - maintain ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  FeNa 0.11. Urine Na 18. Mostly likely hypovolemic
   hyponatremia.
   - maintain MAP goal >65, CVP>[**10-11**] and UOP>30cc/hr
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA:  Follwed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**].  Is
   s/p XRT and cetuximab, last dose [**2184-6-21**].
   - f/u Onc recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3805**] following)
   - S&S following
   - TF were held during suctioning [**2-2**] risk of aspiration, but can be
   restarted today
   .
   # HTN:  On atenolol and HCTZ at home, both  held on admission
   - continue  metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 7**] for now with holding parameter
   - continue to hold HCTZ
   .
   # H/O CVA:  Per notes, had h/o of 'small strokes'.  No residual
   deficits.
   - continue ASA 325mg qd
   .
   # Depression:
   - can consider anti-depressants when pt is not sedated

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, who was admitted for weakness and pneumonia. He has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The sputum culture grew out a gram-negative rod (GNR), with speciation and sensitivities pending. The patient meets the criteria for sepsis and the source of infection is most likely pulmonary. He is currently on multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Zosyn. Other potential etiologies for his respiratory failure include pulmonary embolism and congestive heart failure exacerbation, which are less likely at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, with the source of infection likely being pulmonary due to pneumonia. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic coverage and monitor for any signs of deterioration.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of the ventilator settings and ABG results will be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia with a low urine sodium concentration, suggesting hypovolemic hyponatremia. Fluid management should focus on maintaining an appropriate mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal of >65, central venous pressure (CVP) between 10-11, and urine output"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch tall individual with a weight of 938 pounds. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, set with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and a plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/57 to 148/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for new or worsening respiratory symptoms, such as fever, increased sputum production, or changes in oxygenation, should be done regularly. Cultures should be obtained, and appropriate antibiotics should be administered based on the sensitivity results.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an intubated male in the ICU. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics due to concerns of pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 129/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient has been given various medications including propofol, pantoprazole, heparin, and others. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range except for hyponatremia. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with compensation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and multiple antibiotic usage, there is a risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy accordingly is important.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As a precautionary measure, the patient is receiving prophylactic heparin to prevent the development of DVT due to prolonged immobility.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole to prevent the development of stress-related gastrointestinal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure due to pneumonia. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's fever has been managed with antibiotics and IV fluids. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 129/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has been receiving various medications, including propofol, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other antibiotics. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for a low-grade fever. The patient's medical and family history, as well as his past medical history, social history, and risk factors, remain unchanged.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This condition occurs when a patient acquires pneumonia during or after mechanical ventilation.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium to prevent DVT. However, there is still a risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, especially if the patient is immobile or has other risk factors.

3. Stress ulcer: The patient is receiving pantoprazole to prevent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, who was admitted for weakness and subsequently found to have pneumonia (PNA).
- He was transferred from the oncology service for hypoxia and is currently intubated.
- The patient's respiratory status has been improving, with decreased FiO2 requirements and stable oxygen saturation.
- Sputum culture revealed a GNR infection, with pending speciation and sensitivity results.
- The patient meets criteria for sepsis, most likely due to pulmonary sources given the pneumonia seen on CXR.
- Other potential sources of infection (GI, GU) are less likely based on the patient's symptoms and test results.
- Laboratory values show anemia with iron deficiency and improved hematocrit after receiving 2 units of pRBCs.
- Hyponatremia has improved, with a urine sodium of 18 and calculated free water clearance of 0.11.
- The patient has a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, treated with XRT and cetuximab, and is being followed by an oncologist.
- The patient also has a history of hypertension, managed with atenolol and HCTZ at home, but both medications were held on admission.
- He has a history of CVA with no residual deficits and is taking ASA 325mg qd.

His sputum culture grew out a gram-negative rod (GNR), speciation pending. He meets the criteria for sepsis, likely due to pulmonary infection. Other possible etiologies include pulmonary embolism and congestive heart failure exacerbation. His anemia is likely due to iron deficiency, and his sodium levels have improved. He also has a history of hypertension, previous strokes, depression, and stage III squamous cell throat cancer treated with radiation and cetuximab.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of pneumonia suggest a risk of continued respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's current condition meets the criteria for sepsis, indicating a systemic inflammatory response due to infection. The source of infection is likely pulmonary given his pneumonia.
3. Anemia: The patient's iron deficiency anemia may contribute to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues and may require ongoing monitoring and management.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels have improved, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
5. Prolonged ventilation:"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for
   weakness, PNA found on [**Hospital 10067**] transferred from oncology service for
   hypoxia.
   # Respiratory failure:  [**2-2**] to PNA. Continues to be intubated.  Sputum
   culture grew out GNR, speciation pending.  Other possible etiologies
   include PE and CHF exacerbation which are less likely at this time.
   - on ventilator AC setting, FiO2 was decreased to 40% this AM, satting
   well.
   - continue currently abx coverage with vanc, levo, cefepime and flagyl
   - f/u sputum culture GNR speciation and sensitivities
   - f/u on today
s CXR
   - try to PS
   - continue chest PT
   .
   # Sepsis: pt meets the criteria for sepsis. The source of infection is
   most likely pulmonary given his pneumonia seen on CXR. Sputum culture
   grew out GNR, speciation pending.  GI source is less likely since pt
   had no diarrhea, abdominal pain or any other GI complaints prior to
   intubations, however, would check LFT and C. diff . GU source is less
   likely given negative UA. Patient has no skin breakdown. No new murmur
   to warrant a TTE at this point. No sinusitis so wouldn
t get a CT sinus
   at this time.
   - continue vanc, cefepime, flagyl and levo
   - f/u on sputum culture speciation of GNR and sensitivities
   - follow up blood and urine cultures
   - maintain MAP goal >65, CVP>[**10-11**] and UOP>30cc/hr
   - maintain ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # Anemia
   - Hct is down to 21 today
   - giving 2U pRBCs
   - check post-tranf Hct
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  FeNa 0.11. Urine Na 18. Na currently 131, much
   improved.
   - maintain MAP goal >65, CVP>[**10-11**] and UOP>30cc/hr
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA:  Follwed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**].  Is
   s/p XRT and cetuximab, last dose [**2184-6-21**].
   - f/u Onc recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3805**] following)
   - S&S following
   - continue TF
   .
   # HTN:  On atenolol and HCTZ at home, both  held on admission
   - continue  metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 7**] for now with holding parameter
   - continue to hold HCTZ
   .
   # H/O CVA:  Per notes, had h/o of 'small strokes'.  No residual
   deficits.
   - continue ASA 325mg qd

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of SCCA, currently presenting with right middle lobe pneumonia. He was intubated due to hypoxemic respiratory compromise and is now on PSV support. The patient has been weaning off the ventilator and is expected to have limited extubation due to mental status and sputum volume. He is also experiencing hypoxemia, respiratory failure, and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a primary concern, as indicated by his initial hypoxemic respiratory compromise leading to intubation. Continued weaning from the ventilator will be crucial in managing this condition.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels pose a significant risk and must be closely monitored and managed. Proper oxygen delivery and ventilation support are essential to address this issue.

3. Hyponatremia (Low Sodium, Hypoosmolality): The patient's sodium levels are low, indicating a possible electrolyte imbalance. This can lead to various symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or even cardiac arrest. Careful monitoring and correction of sodium levels are necessary.

4. Pneumonia: The patient's right middle lobe pneumonia needs to be treated effectively to prevent further complications. Antibiotics and other supportive measures should be continued to aid in clearing the infection.

5. Delirium or Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status may"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer. He was admitted for weakness and pneumonia (PNA) and transferred from the oncology service for hypoxia. The patient continues to be intubated and on ventilatory support. The sputum culture grew out a Gram-negative rod (GNR), with speciation and sensitivities pending. The possible etiologies for respiratory failure include pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), and congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation.

The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, and the source of infection is most likely pulmonary given the pneumonia seen on chest X-ray. The sputum culture results indicate a GNR, with speciation and sensitivities pending. Other sources of infection, such as gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU), are less likely.

The patient has iron deficiency anemia, which has been treated with 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). His sodium level has improved, and fluid balance is being monitored.

The patient's oncology recommendations will be followed by Dr. [First Name8 (NamePattern2)] [Last Name (NamePattern1)] 3805. The patient is status post XRT and cetuximab, with the last dose on [2184-6-21].

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of SCCA (specific type of cancer) who has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to right-sided pneumonia. The patient was unable to maintain secretion clearance, but there has been an improvement in oxygenation and ventilation. The patient is now on a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with a favorable respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). The plan is to move forward with extubation this morning. The patient is currently on a combination of antibiotics (gentamicin, cefepime, flagyl), atrovent nebulizer, and will continue with close suctioning and antibiotics. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated for an extended period. Close monitoring and adherence to proper ventilation techniques, such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and assessing RSBI, can help reduce the risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of developing DVT. The patient is receiving prophylactic subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin to prevent DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and the use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of stress ul"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, who was admitted for weakness and found to have pneumonia. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The sputum culture grew out a Gram-negative rod, which is pending speciation and sensitivity. Other possible etiologies for his condition include pulmonary embolism and congestive heart failure exacerbation, but these are less likely at this time.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/58 mmHg to 145/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is being weaned off sedation and is awake, able to follow simple commands.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, normal platelet count of 124 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including low sodium and magnesium levels. The blood cultures from September 16th and 18th were negative, while the sputum culture from September 18th grew a GNR, with speciation and sensitivity pending. The urine cultures from September 17th and 18th were also negative.

The patient meets the criteria for sepsis,"

   treatment and has good cough in response to stimulus
   Pneumonia-Vanco/Levofloxacin/Cefepime/Flagyl to continue
   Pulmonary Secretions-Will continue to suction PRN and encourage cough
   and deep breath
   Pulmonary Edema
He has negative fluild balance yesterday and will
   continue negative fluid balance today
   Upper Airway Edema
Given improvement in cuff leak prior to steroid
   dosing we will not continue with steroid dosing
   So
Will trial extubation today, will have airway cart available for

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for
   weakness, PNA found on [**Hospital 10067**] transferred from oncology service for
   hypoxia.
   # Respiratory failure:  [**2-2**] to PNA. Continues to be intubated.  Sputum
   culture grew out GNR, speciation pending.  Other possible etiologies
   include PE and CHF exacerbation which are less likely at this time.
   - on PS 5/5, RSBI 69, doing well
   - per RT, secretions improved
   - plan for extubation today with airway cart at bedside and anesthesia
   present in case needed reintubation
   - continue currently abx coverage with cefepime (d7) and levo (d5)
   - d/c vanc and flagyl as no other bugs are growing in cultures
   - f/u sputum culture GNR speciation and sensitivities
   - continue chest PT, frequent suctioning
   - continue 24 hrs of IV steroids that was started early thei AM to
   reduce edema for successful extubation
   - pt received one dose of Lasix yesterday evening, can continue given
   the CXR looks like pleural effusions persist
   .
   # Sepsis: pt meets the criteria for sepsis. The source of infection is
   most likely pulmonary given his pneumonia seen on CXR. Sputum culture
   grew out GNR, speciation pending.  GI source is less likely since pt
   had no diarrhea, abdominal pain or any other GI complaints prior to
   intubations.  LFTs are wnl and C Diff is negative x1. GU source is less
   likely given negative UA. Patient has no skin breakdown. No new murmur
   to warrant a TTE at this point. No sinusitis so wouldn
t get a CT sinus
   at this time.
   - treat the underlying infection by continuing cefepime and levoquin
   - f/u on sputum culture speciation of GNR and sensitivities
   - follow up blood and urine cultures
   - maintain MAP goal >65, CVP>[**10-11**] and UOP>30cc/hr
   - maintain ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate (has been normal)
   .
   # Anemia: Fe/TIBC ratio= 10.6%, showing iron deficiency. B12, folate
   levels are wnl.
   - hold iron supplements in setting of ICU
   - continue to monitor daily Hcts and transfuse if <21 or active
   bleeding
   - check PM Hct
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Currently resolved.
   - maintain MAP goal >65, CVP>[**10-11**] and UOP>30cc/hr
   - continue to monitor

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, who was admitted for weakness and pneumonia. He has been intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The sputum culture grew out a Gram-negative rod, which is pending speciation and sensitivity. The patient's recent attempts at extubation have been unsuccessful, possibly due to airway edema or a tumor. The plan is to try another extubation attempt on Thursday after giving a short course of steroids to reduce edema. The patient also has anemia, hyponatremia, hypertension, a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to be intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if extubation attempts fail or if the underlying cause of pneumonia worsens.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, with the likely source of infection being pulmonary due to pneumonia. If the infection spreads or if there is no improvement with the current antibiotic regimen, the patient may develop further complications such as septic shock.
3. Extubation Failure: The patient's previous attempts at extubation have been unsuccessful, indicating a high risk of extubation failure if not properly managed. This can lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation and associated complications.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, who was admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU. The patient's main issues include respiratory failure due to pneumonia, sepsis, and anemia.

Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to be intubated due to respiratory failure caused by pneumonia and secretions. The sputum culture grew out a gram-negative rod, with speciation pending. The CXR from yesterday showed worsening of multifocal airspace opacities affecting the right lung more than the left. The plan is for extubation today with an airway cart at bedside and anesthesia present in case reintubation is needed.

Sepsis: The source of infection is most likely pulmonary given the patient's pneumonia seen on CXR. The sputum culture grew out a gram-negative rod, speciation pending. Other sources such as gastrointestinal or genitourinary are less likely since there were no symptoms prior to intubation, and the patient has negative urine analysis and no skin breakdown. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and there are no new murmurs to warrant a trans-thoracic echocardiogram at this point.

Anemia: The patient has iron deficiency anemia with a Fe/TIBC ratio of 10.6%. Iron supplements should be held in the setting of the ICU, and daily Hcts should be monitored. If the Hct is less than"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, sepsis, anemia, hyponatremia, hypertension, and a history of CVA.

The patient was initially intubated due to respiratory failure and had a successful extubation this morning. However, he required reintubation yesterday because of inadequate cuff leak. The sputum gram stain showed 1+ gram-negative rods, and the respiratory culture grew out Staph aureus coag + with rare growth. The patient's blood culture from September 16th and 18th is negative, and the urine culture from September 17th and 18th is also negative.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 137/58 to 160/144 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's lung examination revealed diffuse rhonchi anteriorly, and the chest X-ray showed worsening of multifocal airspace opacities affecting the right lung more than the left. The latest chest X-ray showed improvement in haziness located in the bilateral bases.

The patient's laboratory results include a white blood cell count ranging from 12.4 to 13.1 thousand/mL"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for [**Hospital 10251**]
   transferred from oncology service for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory failure:  [**2-2**] to PNA and secretions. Continues to be
   intubated.  Sputum culture grew out GNR, speciation pending.  CXR from
   yesterday appeared consistent with pulmonary edema, and patient was
   diuresed last night with good urinary output.
   - on PS 5/5
   - per RT, secretions improved; good cough present
   - plan for extubation today with airway cart at bedside and anesthesia
   present in case needed reintubation
   - continue currently abx coverage with vanco (d8), cefepime (d8), and
   levo (d6)
   - d/ced flagyl as no other bugs are growing in cultures
   - f/u sputum culture GNR speciation and sensitivities
   - continue chest PT, frequent suctioning
   - continue 24 hrs of IV steroids that was started early thei AM to
   reduce edema for successful extubation
   - pt received one dose of Lasix yesterday evening, can continue given
   the CXR looks like pleural effusions persist
   .
   # Sepsis: no longer requiring pressors and stable blood pressures.  The
   source of infection is most likely pulmonary given his pneumonia seen
   on CXR. Sputum culture grew out GNR, speciation pending.  GI source is
   less likely since pt had no diarrhea, abdominal pain or any other GI
   complaints prior to intubations.  LFTs are wnl and C Diff is negative
   x1. GU source is less likely given negative UA. Patient has no skin
   breakdown. No new murmur to warrant a TTE at this point. No sinusitis
   so wouldn
t get a CT sinus at this time.
   - treat the underlying infection by continuing cefepime and levoquin
   - f/u on sputum culture speciation of GNR and sensitivities
   - follow up blood and urine cultures
   - maintain MAP goal >65, CVP>[**10-11**] and UOP>30cc/hr
   - maintain ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate (has been normal)

   # Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA:  Followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**].
   Is s/p XRT and cetuximab, last dose [**2184-6-21**].
   - pt noted to have a increased right neck mass per nursing
   - f/u Onc recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3805**] following): can consider CT neck if the
   neck mass seems to be impeding the airway
   - S&S following

   # Anemia: Fe/TIBC ratio= 10.6%, showing iron deficiency. B12, folate
   levels are wnl.
   - hold iron supplements in setting of ICU
   - continue to monitor daily Hcts and transfuse if <21 or active
   bleeding
   - check PM Hct
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Currently resolved.
   - maintain MAP goal >65, CVP>[**10-11**] and UOP>30cc/hr
   - continue to monitor

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, who was admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress. He continues to be intubated due to respiratory failure caused by pneumonia. His sputum culture grew out a gram-negative rod, with speciation pending. The patient received one dose of Lasix yesterday evening, and his urine output has been good. He is on pressure control ventilation with a PS of 5/5, and the plan for extubation today includes having an airway cart at bedside and anesthesia present in case of reintubation. The patient is also being treated for sepsis, likely pulmonary in origin, with antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and levoquin). His blood pressures are stable, and his lactate levels are normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. The need for extubation may depend on several factors, including improvement in secretions and lung function.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture grew out a gram-negative rod, indicating a possible bacterial infection. The speciation and sensitivities of the organism are pending. The patient is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

3. Sepsis: The patient is being treated for sepsis, likely of pulmonary origin. The source of infection appears to be the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with right middle lobe pneumonia who is intubated and experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure due to excessive secretions. His condition has improved, with reduced infiltrates on chest X-ray and better mental status. However, there are concerns about his upper airway anatomy, making extubation uncertain. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/56 mmHg to 159/144 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature within normal range. The patient has been receiving various medications, including steroids, antibiotics, and other ICU medications. Lab results show mild hyponatremia and hypoxemia, but overall stable values. The plan is to notify anesthesia and proceed with extubation, continue suctioning as needed, and continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia. The patient also has a diagnosis of respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and hypoxemia, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, or atelectasis.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are slightly below normal, indicating persistent hypoxemia. This may require adjustment of oxygen delivery devices or further investigation into underlying causes"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for [**Hospital 10251**]
   transferred from oncology service for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory failure:  [**2-2**] to PNA and secretions but s/p successful
   extubation this AM.  Sputum culture grew out GNR, speciation pending.
   CXR from yesterday appeared consistent with pulmonary edema, and
   patient was diuresed last night with good urinary output.
   -extubated successfully.  Continue to monitor O2 sats and for signs of
   fatigue
   - continue currently abx coverage with vanco (d8), cefepime (d8), and
   levo (d6)
   - d/ced flagyl as no other bugs are growing in cultures
   - f/u sputum culture GNR speciation and sensitivities
   - continue suctioning
   - pt received one dose of Lasix yesterday evening, can continue 10mg
   lasix IV times one in the AM, given the CXR looks like pleural
   effusions persist
   - consider MIE
   .
   # Sepsis: no longer requiring pressors and stable blood pressures.  The
   source of infection is most likely pulmonary given his pneumonia seen
   on CXR. Sputum culture grew out GNR, speciation pending.  GI source is
   less likely since pt had no diarrhea, abdominal pain or any other GI
   complaints prior to intubations.  LFTs are wnl and C Diff is negative
   x1. GU source is less likely given negative UA. Patient has no skin
   breakdown. No new murmur to warrant a TTE at this point. No sinusitis
   so wouldn
t get a CT sinus at this time.
   - treat the underlying infection by continuing cefepime and levoquin
   - f/u on sputum culture speciation of GNR and sensitivities
   - follow up blood and urine cultures
   - maintain MAP goal >65, CVP>[**10-11**] and UOP>30cc/hr
   - maintain ScvO2 >70%

   - pt noted to have a increased right neck mass per nursing
   - f/u Onc recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3805**] following): can consider CT neck if the
   neck mass seems to be impeding the airway
   - S&S following

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress. He has been in the ICU and has had multiple medical complications. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure but was successfully extubated this morning. He is currently on invasive ventilation with high flow nasal cannula, and his oxygen saturation remains in the high 90s. The patient has been given lasix to promote urine output, which has been successful. He is receiving multiple antibiotics and tube feeds. His physical examination shows diffuse rhonchi in the anterior chest and no signs of edema. Lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count and slightly low hemoglobin levels. The patient's imaging shows improvement in haziness located in the bilateral bases, indicating potential pleural effusions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation and invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. Although he was successfully extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if the underlying infection or other factors worsen.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture grew out a Gram-negative rod, indicating a possible pneumonia. Further speciation and sensitivity testing is pending. The worsening of multifocal airspace opacities on the CXR suggests an ongoing pulmonary infection.
3. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation was consistent with sepsis, likely secondary to the pulmonary infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of small cell carcinoma of the lung (SCCA) who presented with right middle lobe pneumonia and significant secretion production. He required intubation but was successfully extubated yesterday. The patient's ongoing care focuses on secretion clearance, and he has been able to wean down on FIO2 requirements. His current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 159/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight has increased from 58.9 kg at admission to 70.2 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a total input of 638 mL and total output of 2010 mL. The patient is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen, and his ABG results show a pH of 7.6, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, and PaO2 of 22 mmHg. 

Medical Complications:
1) Pneumonia: The patient has right middle lobe pneumonia, which is being treated with a combination of antibiotics including Levofloxacin, Cefepime, and Vancomycin for an 8-day course. Frequent suctioning and monitoring of sputum results are ongoing.
2) Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure was secondary to pneumonia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress. He was transferred from the oncology service and has been in the ICU since then. The patient had successful extubation this morning. His sputum culture grew out a gram-negative rod (GNR), with sensitivity pending. He also has methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in his sputum. The patient has completed an 8-day course of cefepime and vancomycin, and will discontinue levofloxacin today. His Lasix dose will be increased PRN to diurese further. He will continue with nebs, suctioning, and MIE. The patient's blood cultures from 9/16 and 9/18 are negative. His urine culture from 9/17 and 9/18 is negative as well. He has a history of small strokes but no residual deficits, and he is currently taking ASA 325mg qd. The patient's wife has given consent for full code status. The patient's disposition will remain in the ICU due to copious secretions requiring frequent suctioning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, as indicated by his need for a face tent and previous intubation. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if he develops further pneumonia or if"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, who was admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress. He was transferred from the oncology service and experienced respiratory failure due to pneumonia. The patient underwent successful extubation and is currently being monitored for oxygen saturation and signs of fatigue. His sputum culture grew out a Gram-negative rod (GNR), speciation pending. He has shown improvement in haziness located in the bilateral bases on the CXR. The patient has been diuresed last night with good urinary output. He is being treated for sepsis, with the source of infection likely pulmonary. His blood pressure remains high, and he is being treated with hydralazine. The patient also has a history of anemia consistent with aplastic crisis drug (ACD), hypertension, and depression. He is currently receiving IV antibiotics, and his fluid status is being monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure due to pneumonia. There is a risk of recurrence if his lung infection worsens or if he develops any complications related to mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient is being treated for sepsis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition if not properly managed. There is a risk of organ dysfunction and failure if the infection spreads.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains high despite medication. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who is recovering from right middle lobe pneumonia with acute respiratory failure. He was extubated on 9/23. The patient has a history of hypertension and cerebrovascular accident, and he is currently receiving treatment for hypoxemia and respiratory failure. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 175/71 to 198/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is alert and oriented, with purposeful movement and normal muscle tone. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient continues to have significant secretions requiring frequent nursing care and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation. He may be at risk for recurrent respiratory failure if his secretions are not adequately managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite being on home medications for hypertension. The addition of an ACE inhibitor has been prescribed, but close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to prevent hypotension.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels have been elevated on multiple occasions. Close monitoring and management of blood glucose levels are important to prevent complications related to hyperglycemia.
4. Infection: Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, there is a risk of developing new infections due to the patient's critically ill"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, who was admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress. He was transferred from the oncology service and had been experiencing respiratory failure, which required intubation. The patient successfully underwent extubation this morning. His sputum culture showed the presence of a gram-negative rod (GNR) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).

The patient has completed an 8-day course of cefepime, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. His blood cultures from September 16th and 18th were negative, as well as his urine culture. The patient's C. difficile test has been negative twice. Imaging revealed bilateral pleural effusions with stable basilar consolidations.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently stable on a face tent and no longer requires pressors. The source of infection is likely pulmonary given the pneumonia seen on chest X-ray. Sputum culture grew out GNR, speciation pending. The plan is to continue nebs, suctioning, and MIE.

2. Sepsis: The patient is no longer requiring pressors and has stable blood pressures. The source of infection is most likely pulmonary. The plan is to treat the underlying infection and follow up on sputum culture speciation of GNR and sensitivities. 

3. Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA: The patient is s/p XRT and cetuximab, with the last dose on June 21st. There is a noted increased right neck mass per nursing. It is recommended to follow up with oncology for further recommendations.

4. HTN: The patient's blood pressure remains uncontrolled. The plan is to continue home PO medications and add Lisinopril 5 mg daily.

5. Anemia: The patient has consistent with ACD. B12 and folate levels are within normal limits. The plan is to continue monitoring and transfuse if Hct <21 or active bleeding.

6. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is 130 this morning. The plan is to maintain MAP goal >65, CVP >10-11, and UOP >30cc/hr.

7. H/O CVA: The patient had a history of'small strokes' but no residual deficits. The plan is to continue ASA 325mg qd.

8. Depression: The patient can consider anti-depressants when not sedated. Follow up with social work recommendations.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: Fibersource HN (Full) at 40 mL/hour.
- Glycemic Control: Continue to monitor and manage as necessary.
- Lines: 20 Gauge - placed on September 19th.
- Prophylaxis: DVT - SC heparin, stress ulcer - P"

   transferred from oncology service for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory failure:  [**2-2**] to PNA and secretions but s/p successful
   extubation [**9-26**].  Sputum culture grew out GNR, speciation pending.
   Also has MSSA in sputum.
   - continued large amounts of secretions with decreased ability to clear
   - satting well on face tent currently; desats to low 90
s off of face
   tent.
   - already completed 8d course of cefepime and vanco
   - discontinued levofloxacin [**9-25**] after completing 8d course
   - d/ced flagyl as no other bugs are growing in cultures
   - f/u sputum culture GNR speciation and sensitivities ([**9-18**]) [**9-26**]
   culture was no growth
   - conisder Lasix PRN to diurese further
   - continue nebs, suctioning, MIE
   - PT consult with increased ambulation
   .
   # Sepsis: no longer requiring pressors and stable blood pressures.  The
   source of infection is most likely pulmonary given his pneumonia seen
   on CXR. Sputum culture grew out GNR, speciation pending.
   - leukocytosis is trending up but patient remains afebrile with
   improved CXR and clinical improvement; consider infectious etiology vs.
   recent steroids (prior to extubation)
   - pan culture today;  f/u on sputum culture speciation of GNR and
   sensitivities.  Fu blood and urine cultures
   - treat the underlying infection
 8d course of cefepime, vanco and
   levoquin.
   - SBP > 90
   .
   # Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA:  Followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**].
   Is s/p XRT and cetuximab, last dose [**2184-6-21**].
   - pt noted to have a increased right neck mass per nursing
   - f/u Onc recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3805**] following): can consider CT neck if the
   neck mass seems to be impeding the airway
   - S&S following
   .
   # HTN:  better controlled
   - continue home PO meds atenelol 100mg daily and HCTZ 25mg daily
   - added Lisinopril 5 mg daily as BP still uncontrolled
   .
   # Anemia: consistent with ACD. B12, folate levels are wnl.
   - hct trending upwards, now 26.  Continue to monitor, will check in AM
   - hold iron supplements in setting of ICU
   - continue to monitor daily Hcts and transfuse if <21 or active
   bleeding
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Na 130 this AM.  Hypovolemic hyponatremia?
   - maintain MAP goal >65, CVP>[**10-11**] and UOP>30cc/hr
   - continue to monitor
   - urine lytes today
   .
   # H/O CVA:  Per notes, had h/o of 'small strokes'.  No residual
   deficits.
   - continue ASA 325mg qd

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress. He was transferred from the oncology service and has been in the ICU for several days.

Key findings from the progress note include:
- The patient has been experiencing increased leukocytosis and has had multiple positive cultures for GNR (Gram-negative rods) and MSSA (Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus).
- He was previously treated with a combination of cefepime, vancomycin, and levofloxacin for 8 days, but the infection did not clear.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved since being extubated, but he continues to have difficulty clearing secretions and requires frequent suctioning.
- His blood pressure remains uncontrolled despite medication adjustments, and he has been started on lisinopril.
- The patient's anemia is consistent with ACD (anemia of chronic disease), and his B12 and folate levels are normal.
- His sodium level is low at 130 mEq/L, and there is a concern for hypovolemic hyponatremia.
- The patient has a history of small strokes but currently does not have any residual deficits.
- He is being considered for increased ambulation.
- His blood sugars have been high, and he will be started on a insulin sliding scale.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress. He has been experiencing respiratory failure, sepsis, and anemia. He has undergone several interventions, including extubation, antibiotic therapy, and chest physiotherapy. The patient's condition has improved, but he still requires close monitoring and management of his secretions. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and depression. His current medications include aspirin, lisinopril, atenolol, and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of hypoxic respiratory distress indicates a risk for respiratory failure. Although he successfully underwent extubation, there is still a potential for recurrent respiratory failure due to copious secretions and decreased ability to clear them.
2. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of sepsis, which can be life-threatening if not promptly managed. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt treatment are crucial in preventing complications associated with sepsis.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be closely monitored, as it can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia. Regular transfusions may be necessary to maintain an adequate hemoglobin level"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer who was admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient was transferred from the oncology service and has been in the ICU since then.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

- Respiratory failure: The patient had difficulty clearing secretions but was successfully extubated this morning. Sputum culture grew out GNR (gram-negative rod), speciation pending. MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) is also present in the sputum. The patient continues to have large amounts of secretions with decreased ability to clear them. He is currently well-oxygenated on a face tent.
- Sepsis: The patient no longer requires pressors and has stable blood pressures. The source of infection is most likely pulmonary given the pneumonia seen on the chest X-ray.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress. He has been extubated but requires respiratory support due to ongoing secretions. The sputum culture initially grew gram-negative rods, but subsequent cultures showed no growth. The patient has been treated with antibiotics including cefepime, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. He is currently on heparin prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP bundle. The patient's vitals include a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/74 to 173/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation in the mid to upper 90s on a face tent. The patient's labs show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 24.6 K/uL and an elevated lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L. The patient's recent medications include atenolol, HCTZ, lisinopril, and iron supplements. The patient's conditions include respiratory failure, sepsis, stage III squamous cell throat cancer, hypertension, anemia, hyponatremia, history of CVA, depression, and high blood sugars.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted to the ICU for weakness and pneumonia. He is still requiring oxygen and has been extubated successfully. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress due to pulmonary secretions. His sputum culture grew out GNR, and MSSA was also found in the sputum. The patient has completed an 8-day course of cefepime and vancomycin, and levofloxacin was discontinued after completing an 8-day course. Flagyl was stopped as no other bugs grew in cultures. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and he is no longer requiring vasopressors. His leukocytosis is trending up, but he remains afebrile with improved chest X-ray and clinical improvement. The source of infection is most likely pulmonary given his pneumonia seen on the chest X-ray. The patient's sodium levels have improved to 134. He has a history of hypertension, anemia, hyponatremia, previous cerebrovascular accident, and depression. The patient's blood sugars are elevated, and he is receiving sliding-scale insulin. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and his vital signs are stable. He is expected to continue in the ICU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to pulmonary secretions and pneumonia.
2. Sepsis secondary to the pulmonary infection.
3. Hyponat"

   68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for [**Hospital 10251**]
   transferred from oncology service for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory failure:  [**2-2**] to PNA and secretions but s/p successful
   extubation [**9-26**].  Sputum culture grew out GNR, speciation pending.
   Also has MSSA in sputum.
   - continue to have moderate amounts of secretions
   - Start incentive spirometer today
   - will do trial with nasal cannula today
   - already completed 8d course of cefepime and vanco
   - discontinued levofloxacin [**9-25**] after completing 8d course
   - d/ced flagyl as no other bugs are growing in cultures
   - f/u sputum culture GNR speciation and sensitivities ([**9-18**]) [**9-26**]
   culture was no growth
   - continue nebs, suctioning, MIE
   - PT consult with increased ambulation
   - Continue MIE
   .
   # Sepsis: no longer requiring pressors and stable blood pressures.  The
   source of infection is most likely pulmonary given his pneumonia seen
   on CXR. Sputum culture grew out GNR, speciation pending.
   - leukocytosis is trending down and patient remains afebrile with
   improved CXR and clinical improvement; consider infectious etiology vs.
   recent steroids (prior to extubation);
   - pan cultures pending
   - treat the underlying infection
 8d course of cefepime, vanco and
   levoquin.
   - SBP > 90
   .
   # Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA:  Followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**].
   Is s/p XRT and cetuximab, last dose [**2184-6-21**].
   - pt noted to have a increased right neck mass per nursing
   - f/u Onc recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3805**] following): can consider CT neck if the
   neck mass seems to be impeding the airway
   - S&S following
   .
   # HTN:  better controlled
   - continue home PO meds atenelol 100mg daily and HCTZ 25mg daily
   - continue Lisinopril 5 mg daily as BP still uncontrolled (re-started
   [**9-25**])
   .
   # Anemia: consistent with ACD. B12, folate levels are wnl.
   - hct trending down, now 23.  Continue to monitor
   - hold iron supplements in setting of ICU
   - continue to monitor daily Hcts and transfuse if <21 or active
   bleeding
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Na improved to 134 this AM.  Hypovolemic hyponatremia?
   - maintain MAP goal >65, CVP>[**10-11**] and UOP>30cc/hr
   - continue to monitor
   - urine lytes if Na decreases
   .
   # H/O CVA:  Per notes, had h/o of 'small strokes'.  No residual
   deficits.
   - continue ASA 325mg qd
   .
   # Depression: currently stable
   - can consider anti-depressants if patient
s symptoms worsen
   - f/u SW recs
   # High Blood Sugars: Continue HISS

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for [**Hospital 10251**]
   transferred from oncology service for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory failure:  Resolved.  Likely secondary  to PNA and
   secretions and s/p successful extubation [**9-26**].  Sputum culture grew out
   GNR, speciation pending.  Also has MSSA in sputum.  Continues to have
   significant amounts of secretions, which appear to mostly upper airway,
   but difficult to distinguish whether he might have some lower airway
   sputum as well.  He did complete a full course of antibiotics for the
   pneumonia (levofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin) and is no longer
   septic.  No growth on [**9-26**] sputum culture.
   - Start incentive spirometer today
   - continue nebs, suctioning
   - Continue MIE
   - Continue ambulating with PT
   .
   # Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA:  Followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**].
   Is s/p XRT and cetuximab, last dose [**2184-6-21**].
   - pt noted to have a increased right neck mass per nursing
   - f/u Onc recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3805**] following): can consider CT neck if the
   neck mass seems to be impeding the airway
   - S&S following
   .
   # HTN:  better controlled
   - continue home PO meds atenelol 100mg daily and HCTZ 25mg daily
   - continue Lisinopril 5 mg daily as BP still uncontrolled (re-started
   [**9-25**])
   .
   # Anemia: consistent with ACD. B12, folate levels are wnl.  Hct stable
   at 23 now, though have trended down over hospitalization.
   - hold iron supplements in setting of ICU
   - continue to monitor daily Hcts and transfuse if <21 or active
   bleeding
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Na improved and stable at 137 this AM.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been
   Hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - continue to trend
   - urine lytes if Na decreases
   .
   # H/O CVA:  Per notes, had h/o of 'small strokes'.  No residual
   deficits.
   - continue ASA 325mg qd
   .
   # Depression: currently stable
   - can consider anti-depressants if patient
s symptoms worsen
   - f/u SW recs
   # Hyperglycemia: Continue HISS

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer who was admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has been through several medical interventions, including extubation, completion of a full course of antibiotics for pneumonia, and treatment for anemia and hyponatremia. The patient's current condition includes significant amounts of secretions in the upper airway, which may also involve the lower airway. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to pneumonia and secretions, worsening of the patient's anemia, and uncontrolled hypertension. 

The patient's current medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly abnormal kidney function. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 149/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient's overall assessment includes respiratory failure that has resolved, likely secondary to pneumonia and secretions, as well as stage III squamous cell throat cancer for which the patient has undergone radiation therapy and cetuximab treatment. 

Further management of the patient's condition involves starting an incentive"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for [**Hospital 10251**]
   transferred from oncology service for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory failure: Likely secondary  to PNA and secretions and s/p
   successful extubation [**9-26**].  Sputum culture grew out GNR, speciation
   pending.  Also has MSSA in sputum.  Continues to have significant
   amounts of secretions, which appear to mostly upper airway, but
   difficult to distinguish whether he might have some lower airway sputum
   as well.  He did complete a full course of antibiotics for the
   pneumonia (levofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin) and is no longer
   septic.  No growth on [**9-26**] sputum culture. Currently increased wob,
   likely secondary to mucus and secretions as patient
s cough is
   decreasing in effort.
   - Aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - continue nebs, suctioning
   - Continue MIE
   - Continue ambulating with PT
   .
   # Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA:  Followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**].
   Is s/p XRT and cetuximab, last dose [**2184-6-21**].
   - pt noted to have a increased right neck mass per nursing
   - f/u Onc recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3805**] following): can consider CT neck if the
   neck mass seems to be impeding the airway
   - S&S following
   .
   # HTN:  better controlled
   - continue home PO meds atenelol 100mg daily and HCTZ 25mg daily
   - continue Lisinopril 5 mg daily as BP still uncontrolled (re-started
   [**9-25**])
   .
   # Anemia: consistent with ACD. B12, folate levels are wnl.  Hct stable
   at 23 now, though have trended down over hospitalization.
   - hold iron supplements in setting of ICU
   - continue to monitor daily Hcts and transfuse if <21 or active
   bleeding
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Na improved and stable at 133 this AM.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been
   Hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - continue to trend
   - urine lytes if Na decreases
   .
   # H/O CVA:  Per notes, had h/o of 'small strokes'.  No residual
   deficits.
   - continue ASA 325mg qd
   .
   # Depression: currently stable
   - can consider anti-depressants if patient

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress, likely secondary to pneumonia and secretions. The patient successfully extubated on 9/26 and completed a full course of antibiotics for pneumonia (levofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin). However, he continues to have difficulty coughing due to the inability to close his glottis, stridor, and increased secretions.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate in the mid-120s, blood pressure ranging from 160-170 systolic, respiratory rate in the mid-20s, and oxygen saturation around 99% on a face tent. His physical examination reveals diffuse rhonchi anteriorly, likely due to upper airway obstruction, and no murmurs or jugular venous distention.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 16.5 to 24.6 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin levels between 22.7 and 26.9 g/dL, and platelet count between 46 thousand/mm3 and 745 thousand/mm3. Other lab values indicate metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia, potential respiratory acidosis, and no new culture data.

   code status today, but pt was very focused on just going home and did
   not cooperate with discussion)
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer. He was admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress and transferred from the oncology service. The patient's current condition and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had respiratory failure, which has since resolved. This was likely secondary to pneumonia and secretions. He successfully underwent extubation on 9/26. The sputum culture grew a gram-negative rod (GNR), with speciation pending. There is also MSSA in the sputum. The patient completed a full course of antibiotics for pneumonia (levofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin) and is no longer septic. No growth was observed on the 9/26 sputum culture.

2. Stage III Squamous Cell Throat Cancer: The patient is a survivor of XRT (radiation therapy) and cetuximab. His last dose of cetuximab was on 6/21/2184. There has been an increased right neck mass noted by nursing. The oncology recommendations suggest considering a CT neck if the neck mass seems to be impeding the airway.

3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is better controlled. He should continue taking his home PO medications, including atenolol 100mg daily and HCTZ 25mg daily. Lisinop"

   =====================
   Episode of respiratory distress unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] likely scenario would be
   mucus plug given his relatively weak cough. Patient appears better now.
   Acute pulmonary edema from ischemia seems less likely given ECG and
   lack of response to lasix. Doubt pulmonary embolism without change in
   oxygen saturations. Concern this AM about presence of stridor. I
   continue to believe that his problems with coughing are largely related
   to an inability to close his glottis. Would like ENT to see him re:
   evaluation of possible paralyzed vocal cord or other structural problem
   given his hx of neoplasm.
   Hct stable. Not at transfusion threshold.
   Alkalemia probably related to negative fluid balance the last few days.
   Push repleation of KCl.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted for respiratory distress. He was transferred from the oncology service and has been diagnosed with pneumonia and secretions. The patient is experiencing worsening ability to cough, no gag reflex, and stridor. He completed a full course of antibiotics for the pneumonia and is no longer septic. The patient's current issues include respiratory failure due to pneumonia and secretions, metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia, stage III squamous cell throat cancer, hypertension, anemia, hyponatremia, history of CVA, depression, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening ability to cough, stridor, and lack of gag reflex suggest a potential respiratory failure due to increased secretions and mucus plugging. Aggressive pulmonary toileting/chest PT, nebs, suctioning, and MIE should be continued.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has hypokalemia and contraction alkalosis from Lasix, which may be causing worsening tachypnea to compensate for worsening alkalosis. Treating metabolic alkalosis by replacing K+ to 4.5 and addressing the underlying cause should be considered.
3. Stage III Squamous Cell Throat Cancer: The patient has a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, for which he received XRT and cetuximab"

   labored. Increased O2 to 70%, O2 sat increased to low 80s. unable to
   suction anything orally. RT gave nebs and used the In-exsufflator with
   good effect. Pt able to cough out large amount of thick tan secretions
   and breathing more comfortably. Currently moving from face mask to face
   tent at FiO2 at 50%. Desats more on face tent to low 90s high 80s and
   high 90s on face mask.
   - ENT looked down patient's throat and saw greenish secretions caked in
   back of throat --> started saline spray in addition to continuing
   humidified air with mask
   - because pt appears to have increased blood pressures at night, likely
   bc all bp meds are in AM, his atenolol was switched to start in PM

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing worsening respiratory failure due to pneumonia and secretions, despite completing a full course of antibiotics. He is also at risk for acute airway obstruction due to thick matted dried secretions above the vocal cords. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 169/55 to 171/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient's temperature is within normal range. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 17.6 to 24.6 thousand/mm3, slightly elevated hemoglobin levels, and a platelet count ranging from 532 to 629 thousand/mm3. Renal function tests show normal creatinine levels, and liver function tests are within normal limits. Electrolyte levels indicate hypokalemia. 

The patient's ability to cough is worsening, likely due to an inability to close the glottis, and he has no gag reflex. The patient has been started on nebulizers, suctioning, mechanical insufflation-exufflation (MIE), and saline spray to manage respiratory distress. 

The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, possibly contributing to his worsening tachypnea. This"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress and is currently experiencing worsening ability to cough, stridor, and no gag reflex. The patient has completed a full course of antibiotics for pneumonia and is no longer septic. The differential diagnosis includes increased secretions and mucus plugging versus pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia, stage III squamous cell throat cancer, hypertension, anemia consistent with anemia of chronic disease (ACD), hyponatremia, history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and depression.

In terms of treatment, the patient is receiving aggressive pulmonary toileting and chest physiotherapy, nebulizers, suctioning, and saline spray. There is a discussion about the possibility of tracheostomy (trach) placement to improve airway patency and prevent adverse events. The patient's potassium levels are being corrected to address metabolic alkalosis, and there is consideration for a computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck to evaluate a right neck mass. Blood pressure management is being adjusted, and the patient is being monitored for hyperglycemia.

Overall, the patient is in critical condition due to respiratory failure and requires aggressive management of his respiratory status. The potential medical complications that can arise"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted for respiratory distress. He has been transferred from the oncology service and has a background of hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is currently experiencing worsening secretions and mucus plugging, with a sputum culture growing out GNR and MSSA. He has completed a full course of antibiotics for pneumonia and is no longer septic. The patient's respiratory effort has decreased, and he is showing improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening ability to cough, lack of gag reflex, and stridor indicate a high risk for recurrent respiratory failure due to increased secretions and mucus plugging.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's hypokalemia and worsening metabolic alkalosis may contribute to his tachypnea. Replacing potassium and addressing the underlying cause of the alkalosis is crucial.
3. Stage III Squamous Cell Throat Cancer: The patient has a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, which may be causing the increased neck mass and potential airway obstruction.
4. Hypertension: The patient's uncontrolled blood pressure requires further management, including adjusting medication doses and considering additional antihypertensive medications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is consistent with ACD, and close monitoring of Hcts with transfusion if <21 or active bleeding is recommended"

   68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for [**Hospital 10251**]
   transferred from oncology service for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory failure: Likely secondary  to PNA and secretions and s/p
   successful extubation [**9-26**].  Sputum culture grew out GNR, speciation
   pending.  Also has MSSA in sputum.  worsening ability to cough (likely
   cannot close glottis), no gag reflex, stridorous this AM.  He did
   complete a full course of antibiotics for the pneumonia (levofloxacin,
   cefepime, vancomycin) and is no longer septic.  Currently increased wob
   and patient
s cough is decreasing in effort. DDx: increased secretions
   and mucus plugging (more likely) vs  PE
   - aggressive pulmonary toileting/chest PT
   - continue nebs, suctioning, MIE, saline spray
   - conversation w wife about trach; if potentially curable, trach may
   help him do better for longer
   - Readdress code status
   - talk to social work about scheduling meeting
   - ENT: since no surgery of neck, it does not matter where trach is
   placed
   - Screening for pulmonary rehab; will touch base with case management
   today.
   # Metabolic Alkalosis:  hypokalemia may be contributing.  [**Month (only) 51**] have also
   had some contraction alkalosis with the lasix.  This may be the cause
   of worsening tachypnea early this AM to compensate for a worsening
   alkalosis.
   - help treat metabolic alkalosis by replacing K+ to 4.5 ; likely has
   the respiratory acidosis in response to a worsening metabolic alkalosis
   - gave 40 meq of K this AM
   # Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA:  Followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**].
   Is s/p XRT and cetuximab, last dose [**2184-6-21**].
   - pt noted to have a increased right neck mass per nursing
   - f/u Onc recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3805**] following): can consider CT neck if the
   neck mass seems to be impeding the airway
   - S&S following
   - oncologist believes that patient has 50% survival chance, so trach
   may be beneficial to prevent adverse events in the meantime w increased
   secretions and possib mucus plugging complications
   .
   # HTN:  He continues to get all meds in AM; has increased BP in AM just
   prior to meds.
   - Will check BP this PM at [**2174**]; if elevated with give metoprolol
   - will change atenolol to evening dose tomorrow since she already
   received her AM dose.
   - continue home PO meds atenelol 100mg daily and HCTZ 25mg daily
   - continue Lisinopril 5 mg daily as BP still uncontrolled (re-started
   [**9-25**])
   .
   # Anemia: consistent with ACD. B12, folate levels are wnl.  Hct stable
   at 23 now, though have trended down over hospitalization.
   - hold iron supplements in setting of ICU
   - continue to monitor daily Hcts and transfuse if <21 or active
   bleeding
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Na improved and stable at 135 this AM.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been
   Hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - continue to trend
   - urine lytes if Na decreases
   .
   # H/O CVA:  Per notes, had h/o of 'small strokes'.  No residual
   deficits.
   - continue ASA 325mg qd
   .
   # Depression: currently stable
   - can consider anti-depressants if patient
s symptoms worsen
   - f/u SW recs if any
   # Hyperglycemia: Continue HISS

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted for respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. He completed a full course of antibiotics for the pneumonia and is no longer septic. The patient's current issues include worsening ability to cough, no gag reflex, stridor, and increased secretions and mucus plugging. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to increased secretions and mucus plugging, metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia, stage III squamous cell throat cancer progression, hypertension, anemia, hyponatremia, history of CVA, depression, and hyperglycemia.

Based on the information provided, the patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer. The patient's current condition indicates a need for aggressive pulmonary toileting, chest physiotherapy, nebulizers, suctioning, and saline spray. Additionally, the patient may benefit from tracheostomy placement to improve airway management and prevent further complications such as mucus plugging. 

It is also important to address the patient's metabolic alkalosis by replacing potassium and treating the underlying cause. The patient's hypertension needs to be managed with medication adjustments and lifestyle modifications. 

Further evaluation is required for the patient's anemia, hyponatremia, history of CVA, depression, and hyperglycemia."

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and pneumonia. The patient's condition is worsening, as evidenced by the need for increased FiO2 and cough assistance to improve oxygen saturation levels. The patient has stridor and dried secretions partially obstructing the larynx. There are concerns about acute airway obstruction, and the healthcare team is considering laryngoscopy and removal of secretions with forceps. If these measures fail, the patient may require a tracheostomy. The patient is at risk for acute respiratory failure. Other assessments include ineffective coping, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired airway clearance, impaired balance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired cough, impaired muscle performance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, hypoxemia, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute airway obstruction due to dried secretions partially obstructing the larynx.
2. Acute respiratory failure, which can progress to respiratory arrest if not promptly managed.
3. Hypoxemia, which may require increased FiO2 support or mechanical ventilation.
4. Ineffective coping due to the critical illness and potential limitations in communication.
5. Impaired airway clearance, leading to further accumulation of secretions and potential for recurrent obstruction.
6. Impaired balance and transfers due to muscle weakness or deconditioning.
7. Impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, possibly related to the underlying condition or medications.

   MSSA in sputum.  He did complete a full course of antibiotics for the
   pneumonia (levofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin) and is no longer septic.
   Worsening ability to cough (likely cannot close glottis), no gag
   reflex, stridor increasing, and worsening WOB and tachypnea overnight
   with hypercapnea.. ENT consulted: very thick matted dried secretions
   above the vocal cords. At risk for acute airway obstruction. CXR
   unremarkable.
   - C/S ENT for trach this weekend as laryngeal clearing by ENT was only
   a short term fix and patient has tenious airway.
   - aggressive pulmonary toileting/chest PT
   - continue nebs, suctioning, MIE, saline spray

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer. He was admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress and had pneumonia with growth of GNR and MSSA in sputum. The patient completed a full course of antibiotics but is now experiencing worsening respiratory distress due to thick matted dried secretions above the vocal cords, leading to stridor and increased work of breathing. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on bipap. His physical examination reveals secretions in the back of the throat, no gag reflex when suctioned, flat jugular venous pressure, regular heart rhythm, and diffuse rhonchi anteriorly in the lungs. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 24.6 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, platelet count of 780 thousand/mm3, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, glucose of 159 mg/dL, and an ECG showing decreased left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% with mild global systolic dysfunction. 

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and secretions, worsening ability to cough, no gag reflex, str"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress. He was transferred from the oncology service and had previously completed a full course of antibiotics for pneumonia. The patient is now experiencing worsening ability to cough, no gag reflex, rhonchi increasing, and worsening work of breathing, indicating respiratory failure. The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, leukocytosis, and anemia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 130/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on bipap. The patient is awake, alert, and oriented but has secretions in the back of his throat. His neck is flat, with no jugular venous distension or murmurs. His lungs show diffuse rhonchi anteriorly, likely due to upper airway obstruction. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place and no edema.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 24.6 thousand/mm3, hematocrit of 25.5%, platelet count of 546 thousand/mm3, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, glucose level of 175 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's CXR is unremarkable, and an echoc"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo male with history of SCCA--neck, now admitted with right middle
   lobe pneumonia with respiratory failure and now with prolonged ICU
   course with continued hypoxia and difficulty with secrection clearance.
   He has had continued respiratory distress and difficulty with secretion
   clearance and has evolved a picture of chronic respiratory acidosis and
   now has had evolution of significantly decreased mental status all very
   concerning for progression of his respiratory failure now to the point
   of being unable to maintain adequate stability of his airway for
   clearance of secretions and evolved elevations in CO2 yesterday
   although pH remained normal in the setting of what may well have been
   at the time respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.  This morning
   BIPAP was discontinued
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -ALb/Atrovent to aid in minimization of bronchospasm
   -Patient does have evidence of persistent secretions but was able to
   tolerate BIPAP overnight
   -He may have had some edema/irritation following upper airway
   suctioning performed
   -If we are unable to maintain patient with stable capacity to maintain
   adequate secretion clearance will need to consider tracheostomy
   placement.
   -In addition, patient has continued high respiratory rate and high
   tidal volme which would argue for significant dead space ventilation at
   this time in the setting of persistent respiratory acidosis.
   -We will need to establish source of metabolic alkalosis and will look
   to urine Cl- to establish need for fluid replacement which is
   likely
will pursue Normal Saline this morning
   -Given high RR and high Vt suggested this morning dead space
   ventilation is impessive and this may be fixed defect with underlying
   lung disease
although this could be a contribution from hypovolemia and
   increased zone 1 physiology concern for fixed defect is significant.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the neck, currently admitted with right middle lobe pneumonia and respiratory failure. He has had a prolonged ICU course with continued hypoxia and difficulty with secretion clearance. The patient's respiratory distress and difficulty with secretion clearance have led to chronic respiratory acidosis. His mental status has also decreased significantly, indicating a progression of respiratory failure and inability to maintain an adequate airway for secretion clearance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and he requires assistance with ventilation. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been attempted but discontinued due to inadequate stability in maintaining adequate secretion clearance. Tracheostomy placement may be necessary if the patient cannot maintain a stable airway for secretion clearance.
2. Secretion Clearance Impairment - The patient has persistent secretions and impaired ability to clear them, which can increase the risk of pneumonia and further respiratory complications.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis - The patient has evidence of metabolic alkalosis, and the source needs to be established. Normal saline will be pursued for fluid replacement.
4. Dead Space Ventilation - The patient's high respiratory rate and tidal volume suggest significant dead space ventilation. This may be due to fixed defects in underlying lung disease or hypovolemia and increased zone 1 physiology concerns.
5. Ineffective Coping - The patient demonstrates ineffective coping mechanisms, including impaired aerobic capacity/end"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted for respiratory distress. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to pneumonia and secretions, with previous successful extubation. He completed a full course of antibiotics for pneumonia (levofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin) and is no longer septic. The patient's worsening ability to cough, lack of gag reflex, increasing rhonchi, and worsening work of breathing (WOB) and tachypnea prompted the decision to place a tracheostomy to secure the airway. After the tracheostomy, the patient showed significant improvement in terms of decreased work of breathing and increased comfort.

The patient's recent chest X-ray showed worsening left lower lobe (LLL) opacity, indicating a possible new pneumonia. The sputum culture grew out gram-negative rods (GNR) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl was initiated. Aggressive pulmonary toileting and chest physiotherapy are being provided to address mucus plugging.

The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, which improved with IV fluid hydration, likely due to contraction alkalosis. The increased bicarbonate level is being treated by replacing potassium to maintain a level of 4.5"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, who was admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress. He had completed a full course of antibiotics for pneumonia and was no longer septic. However, his respiratory condition worsened, and he became unable to cough effectively, leading to increased rhonchi, worsening work of breathing (WOB), and tachypnea.

Pulmonary toileting and chest physical therapy will also be continued to manage mucus plugging.

Additionally, the patient has metabolic alkalosis, which has improved with IV fluid hydration. Aggressive treatment for metabolic alkalosis will involve replacing potassium to maintain a level of 4.5, and urine chloride levels will be monitored.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has undergone several interventions. The key points from the note are as follows:

- The patient had significant improvement in respiratory status after being placed on a tracheostomy (trach) by ENT on Saturday afternoon. The patient is currently on a trach mask at 40% FiO2 and will be weaned as tolerated.
- The patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) was in the 80s, so they were given 2L NS boluses and then continued on 150cc/hr NS, resulting in improvement to SBP in the 130s.
- The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count increased to 20.9.
- The patient showed some ST changes on telemetry, EKG with new T wave inversions in V2-V5. However, the patient is currently CP-free, cycling CE's.
- The patient is sleeping well and resting comfortably. Tube feeds are being held post-procedure per ENT.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- The patient received a dose of cefazolin at 10:00 PM.
- The patient is receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) since 7:57 AM.
- The patient's medical and family history remain unchanged.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/46 mmHg to 149/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,161 mL and output of 1,100 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,061 mL.
- The patient is receiving respiratory support through a trach mask at 40% FiO2, with spontaneous ventilation.
- Physical examination findings include awake, alert, and oriented patient with secretions in the back of the throat, no gag reflex when suctioned, flat JVP, and no edema.
- Lab results show elevated WBC count of 20.9 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hb) of 7.5 g/dL, normal sodium (Na+) level of 143 mg/dL, slightly elevated potassium (K+) level of 4.6 mEq/L, and decreased magnesium (Mg2+) level of 0.8 mg/dL.
- The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 89 mg/dL and 196 mg/dL.
- The patient's troponin-T level remains low at 0.07 ng/mL.
- The patient has a history of hypotension, ineffective coping, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired airway clearance, impaired balance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired cough, impaired muscle performance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, hyponatremia, hypoxemia, and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Infection: The patient's increased WBC count and lack of specific infection details may indicate a risk for infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count, is crucial.

2. Cardiac issues: The patient's EKG changes with T wave inversions in V2-V5 and elevated troponin-T levels suggest possible cardiac involvement. Continuous cardiac monitoring and further evaluation for ischemia or myocardial infarction are necessary.

3. Respiratory issues: The patient's respiratory status requires close monitoring, especially since they are on a trach mask at 40% FiO2. Weaning from the tracheostomy and adjusting the FiO2 based on oxygen saturation levels will be essential.

4. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,161 mL and output of 1,100 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,061 mL. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is required to prevent fluid overload or dehydration.

5. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's tube feeds are being held post-procedure per ENT, which suggests possible gastrointestinal procedures or concerns. Monitoring for any signs of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal distension, is important.

6. Hypotension: The patient's SBP has been in the 80s and 130s, indicating episodes of hypotension. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate interventions to maintain adequate blood pressure are necessary.

7. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted for respiratory distress. He was transferred from the oncology service and has since developed worsening respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia and secretions. The patient underwent a successful extubation on 9/26, but his ability to cough worsened, and he developed rhonchi and increased work of breathing (WOB) two nights ago. The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, leukocytosis, and a right neck mass. He has a history of hypertension, anemia, hyponatremia, CVA, depression, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, and he is currently on a tracheostomy with supplemental oxygen. There is a risk of acute airway obstruction due to thick matted secretions above the vocal cords.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has worsening metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to frequent suctioning and dryness. There is a need to treat this condition by replacing potassium and using NS boluses as needed.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, which may indicate an infection. However, the patient does not appear clinically infected. Further monitoring and daily CBCs are recommended.
4. Right Neck Mass: The patient has a right neck mass, which may be imp"

   68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for [**Hospital 10251**]
   transferred from oncology service for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory failure: Likely secondary  to PNA and secretions and s/p
   successful extubation [**9-26**].  Sputum culture grew out GNR.  Also has
   MSSA in sputum.  He did complete a full course of antibiotics for the
   pneumonia (levofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin) and is no longer septic.
   Worsening ability to cough (likely cannot close glottis), no gag
   reflex, rhonchi increasing, and worsening WOB and tachypnea two nights
   ago.  He was re-evaluated by ENT yesterday morning, who agreed to place
   a tracheostomy to help secure his airway.  After tracheostomy patient
   with significantly decreased work of breathing, much more comfortable.
   - Repeat CXR this morning showed an increasing LLL opacity, given
   leukocytosis concerning for pneumonia, will recheck sputum culture and
   begin treatment for HAP
   - aggressive pulmonary toileting/chest PT as patient is still mucus
   plugging
   - continue nebs, suctioning, MIE, saline spray
   - conversation w patient and wife about trach; if potentially curable,
   trach may help him do better for longer
   - Readdress code status
   - consider talking to social work about scheduling meeting
   - ENT: since no surgery of neck, it does not matter where trach is
   placed
   - Screening for pulmonary rehab pending
   # Metabolic Alkalosis:  Worsening. [**Month (only) 51**] have also had some contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dry by labs.  Also, frequent suctioning
   can cause this. Given 500 cc of NS overnight with minimal effect on
   acid/base.  Worsening metabolic alkalosis on top of a respiratory
   acidosis.
   - help treat metabolic alkalosis by replacing K+ to 4.5
   - NS boluses prn
   - Check urine Cl- today
   # Leukocytosis: Initially thought due to steroids patient received. Now
   increasing. Patient remains afebrile and clinically does not appear
   infected. Respiratory status thought due to secretions, but cannot rule
   out infection as possible inciting factor. Diff shows left shift.
   - continue to monitor for s/sx of infection
   - daily cbc
   - Pan-culture today
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Since no clinical signs of infection, will not treat yet
   # Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA:  Followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**].
   Is s/p XRT and cetuximab, last dose [**2184-6-21**].
   - pt noted to have a increased right neck mass per nursing
   - f/u Onc recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3805**] following): can consider repeat CT neck if
   the neck mass seems to be impeding the airway
   - S&S following
   .
   # HTN:  Stable
   - Continue atenolol qhs
   - continue home PO meds atenelol 100mg qhs and HCTZ 25mg daily
   - continue Lisinopril 5 mg daily as BP still uncontrolled (re-started
   [**9-25**])
   .
   # Anemia: consistent with ACD. B12, folate levels are wnl.  Hct stable
   at 23 now, though have trended down over hospitalization.
   - hold iron supplements in setting of ICU
   - continue to monitor daily Hcts and transfuse if <21 or active
   bleeding

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress and was transferred from the oncology service. The patient has been experiencing worsening ability to cough, no gag reflex, rhonchi increasing, and worsening work of breathing and tachypnea. He underwent a successful extubation on 9/26 but developed respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and secretions. He completed a full course of antibiotics (levofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin) and is no longer septic. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/46 mmHg to 149/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm. The patient has been placed on a tracheostomy due to worsening respiratory status and decreased work of breathing. The repeat chest X-ray showed increasing left lower lobe opacity, indicating worsening pneumonia. The patient's WBC count has been increasing, which is concerning for possible infection. The patient's metabolic alkalosis is worsening, and there is evidence of contraction alkalosis. The patient's condition requires aggressive pulmonary toileting, chest physiotherapy, nebulizer treatments, suctioning, and consideration for tracheostomy placement. Further evaluation and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of SCCA lung, currently experiencing persistent and recurrent respiratory distress due to right middle lobe pneumonia. The patient underwent a tracheostomy, which has improved the ability to maintain airway patency and clear secretions. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 135/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 20.9 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, and slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. Imaging reveals a left-sided opacity in the lower lobe, indicating a possible new infiltrate. The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, pneumonia, and complications from the tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to clear secretions adequately due to abnormal upper airway anatomy post-tracheostomy may lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of leukocytosis, persistent high secretion volumes, and a left-sided opacity on imaging suggests ongoing infection. If not effectively treated, the pneumonia could worsen and potentially spread to other areas of the lungs.
3. Hypotension: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch, 58.9 kg male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress, pneumonia, and anemia. He has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone tracheostomy over the weekend. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.9°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 94/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on several medications including heparin sodium, atrovent, albuterol, insulin, atenolol, lisinopril, and flagyl. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and abnormal kidney function. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Neurological examination reveals the patient is attentive and oriented to time, place, and person. The patient has impaired airway clearance, balance, muscle performance, and ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has impaired ventilation and is experiencing respiratory distress, which could lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, as indicated by symptoms such as increased sputum production, fever, and abnormal chest sounds. This condition can worsen and lead to further respiratory complications if not treated appropriately.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, indicating anemia"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer. He was admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress and transferred from the oncology service. 

The patient initially had respiratory failure likely secondary to pneumonia and secretions, but successfully underwent extubation on 9/26. Subsequently, he developed worsening upper airway obstruction and rhonchi, leading to the placement of a tracheostomy on 10/2. 

A chest x-ray from 10/3 showed a new left lower lobe pneumonia, and sputum culture preliminary results indicated the presence of Staphylococcus aureus. The patient has been treated with vancomycin pending sensitivities for the pneumonia. Aggressive pulmonary toileting and chest physiotherapy have been initiated. 

Additionally, the patient experienced a troponin leak with hypotension post-procedure on 10/2, which responded to fluids. There were also ST changes on telemetry and t-wave inversions in V2-V5, but without chest pain. Cardiac enzymes showed elevated troponins, but normal CK and CK-MB. 

The patient is currently being managed with aspirin, beta-blocker, and ACE inhibitor therapy. 

The patient also presented with metabolic alkalosis, resolving with IV fluid hydration, and leukocytosis, which is resolving with antibiotic treatment for pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA admitted for [**Hospital 10251**]
   transferred from oncology service for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory failure: Initially likely secondary to PNA and secretions
   and s/p successful extubation [**9-26**].  Sputum culture grew out GNR.  Also
   had MSSA in sputum.  For which he completed a full course of
   antibiotics (levofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin).  Patient had a
   tracheostomy done on [**10-2**] for increased work of breathing due to upper
   airway obstruction, worsening ability to cough (likely cannot close
   glottis), no gag reflex, rhonchi increasing, and worsening WOB and
   tachypnea, with significantly improved breathing post trach.  Chest
   x-ray from [**10-3**] showed a new LLL pneumonia, sputum culture preliminary
   with Staph Aureus
   - PNA being treated with vanc pending sensitivities
   - aggressive pulmonary toileting/chest PT
   - continue nebs, suctioning, saline spray
   - Screening for pulmonary rehab pending
   - Post op trach care as per ENT
 will change trach on POD #5
   # Troponin Leak: patient with some hypotension post procedure on [**10-2**],
   that responded overnight to fluids, same night he had ST changes on
   telemetry, and was found to have t wave inversions in V2-V5.  Cardiac
   enzymes showed elevated troponins to 0.07 and 0.06 with normal CK and
   CK-MB
s, thought to be due to demand ischemia in the setting of his
   procedure and hypotension to the 90
s systolic.  Has had no chest
   pain.
   -continue his aspirin, beta blocker and ACEi
   # Metabolic Alkalosis:  significantly improved with IV fluid hydration,
   significant portion of increased HCO3 likely related to contraction
   alkalosis
   # Leukocytosis: Resolving with antibiotic treatment for PNA
   - sputum culture
   # Stage III Squamous Cell Throat CA:  Followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3805**].
   Is s/p XRT and cetuximab, last dose [**2184-6-21**].
   - airway secure now with trach in place

   # HTN:  Blood pressure has stabilized
   - continue atenolol qhs as BP tolerates
   - continue Lisinopril 5 mg daily as BP tolerates

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer who was admitted for respiratory distress. He has been treated for pneumonia and now presents with new lung involvement, as shown on the chest x-ray. The patient's recent interventions include a tracheostomy, which was performed due to increased work of breathing, upper airway obstruction, and worsening ability to cough. The patient also had an episode of hypotension post-procedure, which responded to fluids, and showed ST changes on telemetry along with t-wave inversions in V2-V5. His cardiac enzymes were elevated, indicating a troponin leak. The patient's metabolic alkalosis has improved with IV fluid hydration, and he is currently being treated for leukocytosis, which is resolving with antibiotic treatment. Other ongoing issues include anemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and depression. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, admitted to the hospital for hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and secretions. He underwent successful extubation but required a tracheostomy due to increased work of breathing, upper airway obstruction, worsening ability to cough, no gag reflex, rhonchi increasing, and worsening WOB (work of breathing) and tachypnea. The patient's breathing improved post trach.

2. Lower Left Lobe Pneumonia: A chest x-ray from [**10-3**] showed a new LLL pneumonia. The sputum culture preliminary results indicate MR [First Name (Titles)] [Last Name (Titles)]. The patient is being treated with vancomycin for a total of 15 days. Aggressive pulmonary toileting/chest PT, nebs, saline spray, and post op trach care as per ENT are also recommended. The tracheostomy will be changed on POD #5.

3. Anemia: The patient's HCT (hematocrit) has trended down over the course of his hospitalization, with today's HCT being 20.8. A type and screen will be done, and the patient will receive a transfusion of 1 unit"

- The patient is doing better, clearing secretions from the tracheostomy tube.
- Oxygen saturations have been good on the tracheostomy mask.
- The white blood cell (WBC) count is coming down.
- The patient is afebrile, meaning no fever.
- The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a tracheostomy mask, and arterial blood gas (ABG) results show adequate oxygenation.
- The patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress.
- Cardiovascular examination reveals normal pulse and blood pressure.
- Respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds with coarse large airway sounds.
- Abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present.
- Extremities have no edema or cyanosis.
- Neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented.
- Laboratory results indicate anemia (low hemoglobin level) and normal electrolyte levels.
- The patient's WBC count has improved, indicating a positive response to antibiotics.
- The patient has hypoxemia (low oxygen level) and respiratory failure, but not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient also has anemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, who was admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress. He had completed a full course of antibiotics for MSSA and GNR infections. The patient underwent a tracheostomy on 10/2 due to increased work of breathing and upper airway obstruction. A new left upper lobe pneumonia was noted on chest x-ray. The sputum culture grew MRSA. The patient's HCT has trended down over hospitalization, so he received a transfusion of 1 unit PRBC. He also has metabolic alkalosis, leukocytosis, stage III squamous cell throat CA, hypertension, hyponatremia, h/o CVA, and depression. The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and atenolol. His current vital signs are as follows: Tmax 38.2°C (100.7°F), Tcurrent 37.4°C (99.4°F), HR 79 bpm (75-98 bpm), BP 139/57 mmHg (77-164/40-83 mmHg), RR 23 breaths/min (18-31 breaths/min), SpO2 100%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, pneumonia, and oropharyngeal cancer. He has anemia and MRSA growing from sputum cultures. The patient received blood transfusions yesterday and has shown improvement in his Hct levels. He is currently on various medications including vancomycin for MRSA, heparin for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2 C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 118/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable except for right lower extremity edema. His laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL and leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.2 K/uL. His electrolytes are within normal limits, but he has a slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. The patient's medical complications include ineffective airway clearance, impaired balance, impaired muscle performance, impaired ventilation, hypoxemia, and acute respiratory failure. The plan is to continue vancomycin for MRSA and start physical therapy. The patient's tracheostomy tube will be changed to a smaller size to enable him to use a P-M valve for speaking. His Hct level"

   GNR.  Also had MSSA in sputum.  For which he completed a full course of
   antibiotics (levofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin).  Patient had a
   tracheostomy done on [**10-2**] for increased work of breathing due to upper
   airway obstruction, worsening ability to cough (likely cannot close
   glottis), no gag reflex, rhonchi increasing, and worsening WOB and

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress. He had completed a full course of antibiotics for pneumonia (PNA) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). A tracheostomy was performed on 10/2 due to increased work of breathing and upper airway obstruction. Chest x-ray showed a new left upper lobe pneumonia. The patient is currently being treated for PNA with vancomycin for a total of 14 days. He requires aggressive pulmonary toileting, chest physical therapy, nebulizers, and saline spray. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has been trending down, but with no active signs of bleeding or positive guaiac test, indicating that the anemia could be due to repeated phlebotomy and ongoing inflammation suppressing his bone marrow. The patient also has facial swelling, white-yellow tongue plaques, metabolic alkalosis, leukocytosis, stage III squamous cell throat cancer, hypertension, hyponatremia, history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and depression. He is currently on various medications including atenolol, lisinopril, ASA, and an antidepressant. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and he is expected to continue receiving ICU care until he is ready for pulmonary rehabilitation placement."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of stage III squamous cell throat cancer, who was admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has been in the ICU for an unknown duration and has had multiple medical issues and interventions. Currently, the patient is on day #5 of antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), has a tracheostomy, and is receiving respiratory support with a trach mask on 40% FiO2. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has decreased significantly, and they are showing signs of anemia. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but they are on the hypertensive side, indicating the need for adjustment in their antihypertensive medication. The patient's cancer is being treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The patient also has a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and depression. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's dependence on respiratory support and the presence of thick yellow secretions suggest a risk of continued respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient is already being treated for VAP, indicating a susceptibility to infections due to the tracheostomy and prolonged intubation.
3. Anemia: The patient's decreasing HCT levels indicate the need for further evaluation and management of anemia.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is on the hypertensive side, requiring careful monitoring and potential"
