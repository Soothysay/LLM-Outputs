   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old male with obesity, DM, COPD who developed respiratory
   distress and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by thoracics.
   #. Cellulitis/soft tissue infection:  Patient has been on seven days of
   broad spectrum antibiotics.  Per ENT notes his infection was
   improving.  Although S. areus and Group A strep grew from culture data,
   OSH ID team felt that it was likely a polymicrobial infection that
   required broad spectrum antibiotics.  From an ENT stand point they had
   wanted to extubate him and were considering changing him to oral
   antibiotics.
   -ENT consult for as predominantly upper airway issue: ABX choice and
   duration.
   -Continue Zosyn and Clindamycin, consider changing Vanc to Unasyn.
   Discuss with ENT if need both zosyn and clinda.
   -Obtain Cx data here if possible (not ideal as has been on days of
   antibiotics). Sputum, blood and any fluid from ear canal
   -Pain control with IV pain medication and sedation for now.
   -t/c repeat imaging (first load OSH into our sytstem)
   .
   #. Extubation: Overnight, he maintained his saturation.  He received
   extra sedation by nursing staff for being in pain, aside from sedation
   he should tolerate pressure support well. Patient has had difficuilty
   extubating initially secondary to sedation then later due to lack of a
   cuff leak.  He may not have a cuff leak given his body habitus.
   Underlying lung disease should play little in extubation as this seems
   to be a primarily upper airway problem.  [**Name (NI) **] may require a trach given
   his upper airway swelling.
   -Daily SBT and RSBI
   -Pressure support as tolerated
   -Check trach leak
 in this patient would not extubate without a trach
   leak.
   -Will wean down on FiO2 tonight.
   -Thoracics consult if unable to extubate for trach placement.
   .
   #. Diabetes: Holding oral hypoglycemics.  Covering with insulin sliding
   scale.
   .
   #. Hypertension: Blood pressures not elevated.  Holding
   anti-hypertensives.  Will restart when needed.
   .
   #. CRI: Baseline cr: aprox 1.3-1.5. Currently 1.2.  Acute renal failure
   from OSH resolved.  Will continue hydration.  Continue to hold ACEi.
   .
   #. COPD: Patient not on medicaiton at home for COPD.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 6224**].
   Patient with smoking history, unclear how long, quit a few years ago.
   No record of being home on O2.
   .
   #. Decubitus Ulcer: Present on admission.  Will discuss with nursing
   what stage it is at and consult wound care if appropriate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. He has been intubated and on broad-spectrum antibiotics for seven days. The patient's current condition shows improvement in his infection but difficulty with extubation. He is sedated, receiving pain medication, and being closely monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular bronchoscopic evaluations are necessary.
2. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer that needs to be assessed and managed by the nursing staff and wound care team.
3. Diabetes management: The patient's diabetes should be carefully managed with insulin sliding scale to maintain blood glucose levels within the target range.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension should be monitored, and antihypertensive medications may be restarted as needed.
5. Acute renal failure: Although the patient's acute renal failure from OSH has resolved, close monitoring of renal function and hydration status is essential.
6. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD should be managed appropriately, and if necessary, respiratory support can be provided.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old male with obesity, DM, COPD who developed respiratory
   distress and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by thoracics.
   #. Cellulitis/soft tissue infection:  Patient has been on seven days of
   broad spectrum antibiotics.  Per ENT notes his infection was
   improving.  Although S. areus and Group A strep grew from culture data,
   OSH ID team felt that it was likely a polymicrobial infection that
   required broad spectrum antibiotics.  From an ENT stand point they had
   wanted to extubate him and were considering changing him to oral
   antibiotics.
   -_ENT consult for guidance with management.
   -Continue Zosyn and Clindamycin, consider changing Vanc to Unasyn.
   -Obtain Cx data here if possible (not ideal as has been on days of
   antibiotics). Sputum, blood and any fluid from ear canal
   -Pain control with IV pain medication and sedation for now.
   .
   #. Extubation: Overnight, he maintained his saturation.  He received
   extra sedation by nursing staff for being in pain, aside from sedation
   he should tolerate pressure support well. Patient has had difficuilty
   extubating initially secondary to sedation then later due to lack of a
   cuff leak.  He may not have a cuff leak given his body habitus.
   Underlying lung disease should play little in extubation as this seems
   to be a primarily upper airway problem.  [**Name (NI) **] may require a trach given
   his upper airway swelling.
   -Daily SBT and RSBI
   -Pressure support as tolerated
   -Will wean down on FiO2 tonight.
   -Thoracics consult if unable to extubate for trach placement.
   .
   #. Diabetes: Holding oral hypoglycemics.  Covering with insulin sliding
   scale.
   .
   #. Hypertension: Blood pressures not elevated.  Holding
   anti-hypertensives.  Will restart when needed.
   .
   #. CRI: Baseline cr: aprox 1.3-1.5. Currently 1.2.  Acute renal failure
   from OSH resolved.  Will continue hydration.  Continue to hold ACEi.

   73 yo male with a history of DM, Obesity and admitted to [**Hospital **] Hosp
   with respiratory distress following infectious prodrome--seen with ear
   pain, neck pain and throat pain.  In the ED there he had significant
   edema, erythema in neck and started on CTX/Unasyn and Steroids.  He was
   trialed on NIPPV with pharyngitis and no evidence of abscess seen.  He
   then had intubation required with severe resp acidosis on [**5-23**] and
   unable to place tracheostomy and patient intubated in OR with ETT
   sutured to lip.  CT scan--retro-pharyngeal edema/fluid and hematoma and
   gas overlying area of attempted trach intervention.  Follow up imaging
   showed some decrease in edema but patient with no cuff leak heard and
   patient to [**Hospital1 5**] for further care.
   1)Respiratory Failure-This was in large part upper airway issue but
   also compounded by significant restrictive ventilatory defect.  In this
   setting patient with minimal cuff leak leaving significant concern for
   possible issue post extubation.  He also has reported difficult anatomy
   for emergent trach placement which makes consideration of strategies
   for extubation important.  In regards to pulmonary process
there is
   minimal evidence of significant pulmonary parenchymal insult although
   imaging is limited.
   -Will move to PSV today
   -ETT secured in place
   -Would favor thoracics evaluation for trach placement to allow safe
   ventilatory support weaning and discontinuation if ENT unable to place
   trach which was the case at the OSH.
   2)Pharyngitis-Likely plymicrobial, has continued fever, elevation in
   WBC count and bandemia.  We have significant deep tissue infection in
   neck and will continue with broad spectrum coverage for what may well
   have been peri-odonatal infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and admitted to the hospital with respiratory distress following an infectious prodrome. He presented with ear pain, neck pain, and throat pain. In the emergency department, he had significant edema and erythema in the neck area. The patient was started on CTX/Unasyn and steroids. He was then trialed on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with pharyngitis but no evidence of abscess seen. Due to severe respiratory acidosis, the patient required intubation and was taken to the operating room for endotracheal tube (ETT) placement. A CT scan showed retro-pharyngeal edema/fluid and hematoma, as well as gas overlying the area of attempted tracheostomy intervention. Follow-up imaging showed some decrease in edema, but the patient had no cuff leak heard. The patient was transferred to another hospital for further care.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Respiratory Failure - The patient has an upper airway issue compounded by a restrictive ventilatory defect. There is concern for possible issues post-extubation due to minimal cuff leak and difficult anatomy for emergent trach placement. Strategies for extubation should be considered. Imaging is limited, showing minimal evidence of significant pulmonary parenchymal insult.
   - Will move to pressure support ventilation (PSV) today.
   - ETT secured in place.
   - Favor thoracic evaluation for trach placement to allow safe ventilatory support weaning and discontinuation if ENT unable to place trach.

2) Pharyngitis - Likely polymicrobial, the patient continues to have fever, elevation in white blood cell count, and bandemia. There is significant deep tissue infection in the neck, and broad-spectrum coverage for what may well have been a peri-odontal infection should be continued.
   - Vancomycin/Zosyn/Clindamycin.
   - ENT consult to aid in evaluation and treatment of infection.

3) Acute Renal Failure - Continue to maintain adequate volume support, likely pre-renal state.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old man with obesity, DM, COPD who developed respiratory
   distress and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection transferred
   to [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by
   thoracics.
   # Cellulitis/soft tissue infection/low grade temperature:  Patient has
   been on seven days of broad spectrum antibiotics.  Per ENT notes his
   infection was improving.  Although S. areus and Group A strep grew from
   culture data, OSH ID team felt that it was likely a polymicrobial
   infection that required broad spectrum antibiotics.  From an ENT stand
   point they had wanted to extubate him and were considering changing him
   to oral antibiotics. ID and ENT services are now following here, and ID
   has recommended for continued broad spectrum coverage with Zosyn and
   vancomycin. MRI yesterday shows possible abscess in right myelohyoid
   muscle. This may need to be drained by ENT.
   -f/u ENT recs
   -any new culture data should be sent for fungal cultures in addition to
   bacterial
   -pain control with IV pain medication and sedation for now
   -already cultured this morning for low grade temperature to 100.7
   -f/u final MRI read
   # Extubation: Overnight, he maintained his saturation.  He received
   extra sedation by nursing staff for being in pain, aside from sedation
   he should tolerate pressure support well. Patient has had difficuilty
   extubating initially secondary to sedation then later due to lack of a
   cuff leak.  He may not have a cuff leak given his body habitus.
   Underlying lung disease should play little in extubation as this seems
   to be a primarily upper airway problem.  [**Name (NI) **] may require a trach given
   his upper airway swelling.
   -pressure support trial today
   -thoracics consult today; may need to go to OR for tracheostomy
   placement
   -repeat ABG

   # Diabetes: Holding oral hypoglycemics.  Covering with insulin sliding

   # Hypertension: Blood pressures not elevated.  Holding
   anti-hypertensives.  Will restart when needed.
   #.CRI: Baseline cr: approx 1.3-1.5. Currently 1.2.  Acute renal failure
   from OSH resolved.  Will continue hydration.  Continue to hold ACEi.
   -check urine electrolytes
   # COPD: Patient not on medicaiton at home for COPD.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 6224**].
   Patient with smoking history, unclear how long, quit a few years ago.
   No record of being home on O2.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Present on admission.  Will discuss with nursing
   what stage it is at and consult wound care if appropriate.

   73 year old man with obesity, DM, COPD who developed respiratory
   distress and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection transferred
   to [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by
   thoracics.
   # Cellulitis/soft tissue infection/low grade temperature:  Patient has
   been on seven days of broad spectrum antibiotics.  Per ENT notes his
   infection was improving.  Although S. areus and Group A strep grew from
   culture data, OSH ID team felt that it was likely a polymicrobial
   infection that required broad spectrum antibiotics.  From an ENT stand
   point they had wanted to extubate him and were considering changing him
   to oral antibiotics. ID and ENT services are now following here, and ID
   has recommended for continued broad spectrum coverage with Zosyn and
   vancomycin. MRI yesterday shows possible abscess in right myelohyoid
   muscle. This may need to be drained by ENT.
   -f/u ENT recs
   -any new culture data should be sent for fungal cultures in addition to
   bacterial
   -pain control with IV pain medication and sedation for now
   -already cultured this morning for low grade temperature to 100.7
   -f/u final MRI read
   # Extubation: Overnight, he maintained his saturation.  He received
   extra sedation by nursing staff for being in pain, aside from sedation
   he should tolerate pressure support well. Patient has had difficuilty
   extubating initially secondary to sedation then later due to lack of a
   cuff leak.  He may not have a cuff leak given his body habitus.
   Underlying lung disease should play little in extubation as this seems
   to be a primarily upper airway problem.  [**Name (NI) **] may require a trach given
   his upper airway swelling.

","The patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent history of respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. He was transferred to the ICU for failure to extubate and possible tracheostomy placement.

The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for seven days, which were initiated due to suspicion of a polymicrobial infection. Despite this, the patient's infection is still improving, and there is a concern for possible abscess formation in the right mylohyoid muscle, as shown on the MRI. The ID team recommends continuing broad-spectrum coverage with Zosyn and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/51 to 167/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is intubated and sedated but arousable. Physical examination reveals right ear erythema and induration, right facial erythema and induration, right submandibular induration, thick neck, trach attempt scar, bilateral chest wall tenderness, edema in the lower extremities, and scrotal edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies,"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old man with obesity, DM, COPD who developed respiratory
   distress and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection transferred
   to [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by
   thoracics.
   #. Cellulitis/soft tissue infection:  Patient has been on seven days of
   broad spectrum antibiotics.  Per ENT notes his infection was
   improving.  Although S. areus and Group A strep grew from culture data,
   OSH ID team felt that it was likely a polymicrobial infection that
   required broad spectrum antibiotics.  From an ENT stand point they had
   wanted to extubate him and were considering changing him to oral
   antibiotics. ID and ENT services are now following here, and ID has
   recommended for continued broad spectrum coverage with Zosyn and
   vancomycin
   -f/u ENT recs today
   -any new culture data should be sent for fungal cultures in addition to
   bacterial
   -pain control with IV pain medication and sedation for now.
   -f/u MRI read
   #. Extubation: Overnight, he maintained his saturation.  He received
   extra sedation by nursing staff for being in pain, aside from sedation
   he should tolerate pressure support well. Patient has had difficuilty
   extubating initially secondary to sedation then later due to lack of a
   cuff leak.  He may not have a cuff leak given his body habitus.
   Underlying lung disease should play little in extubation as this seems
   to be a primarily upper airway problem.  [**Name (NI) **] may require a trach given
   his upper airway swelling.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old obese male with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent history of respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. He was transferred to the ICU for failure to extubate and possible tracheostomy placement. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for seven days and has shown improvement in his infection. However, there are concerns regarding his upper airway swelling, which may require a tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cellulitis/soft tissue infection: The patient's infection has improved with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is a risk of recurrence or worsening if the appropriate antibiotic therapy is not continued or if the infection becomes resistant to the current treatment.
2. Extubation difficulties: The patient has had difficulty extubating due to sedation and lack of a cuff leak. There is a risk of airway compromise and respiratory distress if he is unable to be extubated successfully.
3. Tracheostomy placement: The patient may require a tracheostomy due to his upper airway swelling and difficulty with extubation. Tracheostomy placement carries its own risks, including bleeding, infection, and damage to structures in the neck.
4. Diabetes management: The patient's diabetes should be closely monitored and managed with insulin sliding scale to maintain glycemic control. Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia can have adverse effects on"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo male with a history of DM, Obesity and admitted to [**Hospital **] Hosp
   with respiratory distress following infectious prodrome--seen with ear
   pain, neck pain and throat pain.  In the ED there he had significant
   edema, erythema in neck and started on CTX/Unasyn and Steroids.  He was
   trialed on NIPPV with pharyngitis and no evidence of abscess seen.  He
   then had intubation required with severe resp acidosis on [**5-23**] and
   unable to place tracheostomy and patient intubated in OR with ETT
   sutured to lip.  CT scan--retro-pharyngeal edema/fluid and hematoma and
   gas overlying area of attempted trach intervention.  Follow up imaging
   showed some decrease in edema but patient with no cuff leak heard and
   patient to [**Hospital1 5**] for further care.
   1) Acute respiratory Failure-This was in large part upper airway issue
   but also compounded by significant restrictive ventilatory defect.  In
   this setting patient with minimal cuff leak leaving significant concern
   for possible issue post extubation.  He also has reported difficult
   anatomy for emergent trach placement which makes consideration of
   strategies for extubation important.  In regards to pulmonary
   process
there is minimal evidence of significant pulmonary parenchymal
   insult although imaging is limited. Repeat CXR pending.
   -Will move to PSV today
   -ETT secured in place
   -Would favor thoracics evaluation for trach placement to allow safe
   ventilatory support weaning and discontinuation if ENT unable to place
   trach which was the case at the OSH.
   2)Myohoid collection, likely abscess - has continued fever, elevation
   in WBC count (improving) and bandemia.  We have significant deep tissue
   infection in neck and will continue with broad spectrum coverage for
   what may well have been peri-odonatal infection.
   -Vanco/Zosyn
   -ENT consult to aid in evaluation and treatment of infection--
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -continue to maintain adequate volume support, likely pre-renal state.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted to the hospital with respiratory distress following an infectious prodrome and symptoms of ear, neck, and throat pain. In the emergency department, he had significant edema and erythema in the neck area. He was started on CTX/Unasyn and steroids. The patient was then trialed on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with pharyngitis but no evidence of abscess seen. However, he required intubation due to severe respiratory acidosis on [**5-23**] and was unable to have a tracheostomy performed. Instead, an endotracheal tube was sutured to his lip. A CT scan showed retro-pharyngeal edema/fluid and hematoma, as well as gas overlying the area of attempted tracheostomy. He was transferred to another hospital for consideration of tracheostomy.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient has upper airway issues compounded by a restrictive ventilatory defect. There is concern for possible issues post-extubation, and the patient has minimal cuff leak. Difficult anatomy for emergent tracheostomy placement makes consideration of strategies for extubation important. Pulmonary process imaging is limited, but there is minimal evidence of significant pulmonary parenchymal insult. A repeat"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old man with obesity, DM, COPD who developed respiratory
   distress and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection transferred
   to [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by
   thoracics.
   # Cellulitis/soft tissue infection/low grade temperature:  Patient has
   been on seven days of broad spectrum antibiotics.  Per ENT notes his
   infection was improving.  Although S. areus and Group A strep grew from
   culture data, OSH ID team felt that it was likely a polymicrobial
   infection that required broad spectrum antibiotics.  From an ENT stand
   point they had wanted to extubate him and were considering changing him
   to oral antibiotics. ID and ENT services are now following here, and ID
   has recommended for continued broad spectrum coverage with Zosyn and
   vancomycin. MRI yesterday shows possible abscess in right myelohyoid
   muscle. This may need to be drained by ENT.
   -f/u ENT recs
   -any new culture data should be sent for fungal cultures in addition to
   bacterial
   -pain control with IV pain medication and sedation for now
   -already cultured this morning for low grade temperature to 100.7
   -f/u final MRI read
   # Extubation: Overnight, he maintained his saturation.  He received
   extra sedation by nursing staff for being in pain, aside from sedation
   he should tolerate pressure support well. Patient has had difficuilty
   extubating initially secondary to sedation then later due to lack of a
   cuff leak.  He may not have a cuff leak given his body habitus.
   Underlying lung disease should play little in extubation as this seems
   to be a primarily upper airway problem.  [**Name (NI) **] may require a trach given
   his upper airway swelling.
   -pressure support trial today
   -thoracics consult today; may need to go to OR for tracheostomy
   placement
   -repeat ABG
   -CXR
   # Diabetes: Elevated FSG likely in setting of infection and off home
   oral hypoglycemics
   -Added lantus and tightened regular insulin sliding scale
   -Monitor FSG and adjust coverage as needed
   # Hypertension: Blood pressures not elevated.  Holding
   anti-hypertensives.  Will restart when needed.
   #.CRI: Baseline cr: approx 1.3-1.5. Currently 1.2.  Acute renal failure
   from OSH resolved.  Will continue hydration.  Continue to hold ACEi.
   -check urine electrolytes
   # COPD: Patient not on medicaiton at home for COPD.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 6224**].
   Patient with smoking history, unclear how long, quit a few years ago.
   No record of being home on O2.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Present on admission.  Will discuss with nursing
   what stage it is at and consult wound care if appropriate.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who developed respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. He was transferred to another hospital for failure to extubate and possible tracheostomy placement.

The patient's current condition shows that he is intubated, sedated, and arousable. He has a fever of 100.9°F and an increasing blood pressure after receiving mouth care. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/52 to 187/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has edema in his lower extremities and scrotum.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin, and glucose levels. His blood cultures show growth of Streptococcus aureus and Group A streptococcus, and his urinalysis reveals the presence of red blood cells, protein, and moderate uric acid.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. He developed an infection that required broad-spectrum antibiotics and possible tracheostomy placement. The patient has been intubated and sedated, but is arousable. He has low-grade fevers, elevated white blood cell count, and possible abscess formation in the right mylohyoid muscle. The medical team is considering continued broad-spectrum coverage with Zosyn and vancomycin, as well as drainage of the abscess if necessary. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and various interventions are being planned, including pressure support trial, thoracic consult for tracheostomy placement, repeat arterial blood gas analysis, chest X-ray, and evaluation of diabetes, hypertension, acute renal failure, COPD, and decubitus ulcer."

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old man with obesity, DM, COPD who developed respiratory
   distress and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection transferred
   to [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by
   thoracics.
   # Respiratory failure: Consideration for upper airway edema in setting
   of soft tissue infection with difficulty extubating at OSH secondary to
   sedation then later due to lack of a cuff leak. Today, cuff leak
   present which suggests improving edema. Possible that he may be able to
   tolerate extubation although some concern for ongoing fevers despite
   improved WBC and h/o difficult intubation (low-lying cricoid)
   - Continue PSV today with plan to reduce sedation today for possible
   extubation in AM with Anesthesia present
   - F/u ENT and thoracics recs as may require trach if still needing
   drainage
   # Cellulitis/soft tissue infection/low grade temperature: Pt with soft
   tissue infection and possible myelohyoid abscess. He has been on eight
   days of broad spectrum antibiotics with normalization of leukocytosis
   and improvement in edema although still spiking low fevers. Although S.
   areus and Group A strep grew from culture data, OSH ID team felt that
   it was likely a polymicrobial infection that required broad spectrum
   antibiotics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. He was transferred to the ICU for failure to extubate and possible tracheostomy placement. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for eight days, showing improvement in leukocytosis and edema, but still experiences low-grade fevers. He has a history of difficult intubation due to a low-lying cricoid. The plan is to continue pressure support ventilation (PSV) and reduce sedation for possible extubation in the morning with anesthesia support. There are ongoing fevers despite improved white blood cell (WBC) count, and further evaluation is needed. The patient has an elevated fasting blood sugar (FBS) likely due to infection and off home oral hypoglycemics. Insulin coverage has been added, and regular insulin sliding scale will be adjusted as needed. The patient's creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated, and gentle free water bolus will be given as needed. Hypertension medications are being held for now. The patient's COPD management is unclear, and no record of being on home oxygen is available. A decubitus ulcer was present on admission but is stable per nursing. The patient is on tube feeds, sliding scale insulin, and various prophylactic measures."

   73 yo male with a history of DM, Obesity and admitted to [**Hospital **] Hosp
   with respiratory distress following infectious prodrome--seen with ear
   pain, neck pain and throat pain.  In the ED there he had significant
   edema, erythema in neck and started on CTX/Unasyn and Steroids.  He was
   trialed on NIPPV with pharyngitis and no evidence of abscess seen.  He
   then had intubation required with severe resp acidosis on [**5-23**] and
   unable to place tracheostomy and patient intubated in OR with ETT
   sutured to lip.  CT scan--retro-pharyngeal edema/fluid and hematoma and
   gas overlying area of attempted trach intervention.  Follow up imaging
   showed some decrease in edema but patient with no cuff leak heard and
   patient to [**Hospital1 5**] for further care.
   1) Acute respiratory Failure-This was in large part upper airway issue
   but also compounded by significant restrictive ventilatory defect.
   Currently has cuff leak but I'm hesitant to extubate given ongoing
   fevers and difficult intubation. Will do SBT today and wean sedation
   for possible extubation with anesthesia present in AM.
   -Will c/w PSV today. If requires drainage procedure, may require trach
   2)Myohoid collection, possible abscess - has continued low grade fever,
   improved leukocytosis. Significant deep tissue infection in neck, will
   continue with broad spectrum coverage for what may well have been
   peri-odonatal infection.
   -Vanco/Zosyn, ENT involved
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -continue to maintain adequate volume support, likely pre-renal state.
   - likely chronic kidney disease from DM

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and respiratory distress following an infectious prodrome. The patient was admitted to the hospital with significant edema and erythema in the neck. He was started on antibiotics and steroids, and then intubated due to severe respiratory acidosis. The patient also had a tracheostomy attempted but was unsuccessful, leading to further imaging showing retro-pharyngeal edema/fluid and hematoma.

The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, with the issue being both upper airway obstruction and restrictive ventilatory defect. There is a cuff leak, but the physician is hesitant to extubate due to ongoing fevers and difficult intubation. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be conducted today to potentially wean sedation for possible extubation with anesthesia present in the morning.

The patient also has a myohoid collection, possible abscess, with continued low-grade fever and improved leukocytosis. There is a deep tissue infection in the neck, and broad-spectrum coverage will continue for what may have been a peri-odonatal infection. ENT involvement and Vancomycin/Zosyn will be continued.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing acute renal failure, with ongoing volume support and a likely pre-renal state. Chronic kidney disease from DM is also suspected.

In terms of access and miscellaneous procedures, the patient has a right PICC"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and decubitus ulcer. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit. His heart rate is within normal range, blood pressure is elevated, respiratory rate is low, oxygen saturation is at 94%, and he is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's weight has remained relatively stable since admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,395 mL, output of 1,780 mL, and a positive balance of 2,615 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates sinus rhythm and normal heart rhythm. The patient's neurological status is not assessed. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated potassium and creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood glucose levels are also elevated. The patient is currently receiving midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and various other medications. An MRI is ordered to assess for abscess.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient has multiple lines and catheters, which can increase the risk of infection.
3. Deep vein thrombosis ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who developed respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. He was transferred to the ICU for failure to extubate and possible tracheostomy placement. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with respiratory support on CPAP/PSV mode. He has been febrile since admission, with a maximum temperature of 101.1°F. There is evidence of an upper airway edema secondary to soft tissue infection, making extubation dangerous. He requires a tracheostomy prior to extubation for safety. The patient has a history of DM, with fasting serum glucose levels still elevated despite the addition of Lantus. His renal function is near baseline, and he has acute renal failure. The patient also has a decubitus ulcer present since admission. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to upper airway edema secondary to soft tissue infection. Extubation could be risky without a tracheostomy, leading to further CO2 retention and respiratory distress.
2. Cellulitis/Soft Tissue Infection: The patient has soft tissue infection with possible abscess formation, as indicated by fevers and improving leukocytosis. There is a risk of worsening infection or abscess formation if appropriate antibiotic coverage"

   73 year old man with obesity, DM, COPD who developed respiratory
   distress and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection transferred
   to [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by
   thoracics.
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely cause is upper airway edema
   secondary to soft tissue infection.  It would be very dangerous to
   extubate him given his anatomy causing CO2 retention.  He will likely
   need a trach prior to extubation for safety.
   - continue PSV
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for now; would switch to meropenem if
   any clinical decline to cover for resistant gram negative rods
   - discuss with ENT and thoracics the possibility of trach
   # Cellulitis/soft tissue infection:  Still having fevers, but
   leukocytosis is improving.  He has soft tissue infection with possible
   abscess seen on previous MRI.. Although S. areus and Group A strep grew
   from culture data, OSH ID team felt that it was likely a polymicrobial
   infection that required broad spectrum antibiotics.
   -continue vancomycin and zosyn
   -F/u culture data and CIS >101
   -F/u ID, ENT, thoracics recs
   -discuss with ENT if further imaging is indicated
   -pain control with IV pain medication and sedation for now

   - increase lantus
    -Monitor FSG and adjust coverage as needed
   #.CRI: Baseline cr: approx 1.3-1.5. Currently 1.6.  FENa not definitive
   but may have pre-renal component given hypernatremia
   -Gentle free water bolus prn and repeat lytes
   # Hypertension: Blood pressures not elevated.  Holding
   anti-hypertensives.  Will restart when needed.
   # COPD: Patient not on medication at home for COPD.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 6224**].
   Patient with smoking history, unclear how long, quit a few years ago.
   No record of being home on O2.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. He was transferred to the ICU for failure to extubate and possible tracheostomy placement.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, type II DM, and a decubitus ulcer present at admission. His vital signs show a temperature of 101.1°F, blood pressure ranging from 139/61 mmHg to 180/79 mmHg, heart rate between 95-102 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is intubated and sedated but arousable.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function with increased creatinine (Cr) levels.

The assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, continued vancomycin and zosyn for soft tissue infection, discussion with ENT and thoracics regarding tracheostomy placement, monitoring of culture data and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, pain control with IV pain medication, adjustment of diabetes medication, management of chronic kidney injury (CKI), and consideration of COP"

   73 yo male with a history of DM, obesity, OSA admitted to [**Hospital **]
   Hosp with respiratory distress following infectious prodrome--seen with
   ear pain, neck pain and throat pain.  In the ED there he had
   significant edema, erythema in neck and started on CTX/Unasyn and
   Steroids.  He was trialed on NIPPV with pharyngitis and no evidence of
   abscess seen.  He then had intubation required with severe resp
   acidosis on [**5-23**] and unable to place tracheostomy and patient intubated
   in OR with ETT sutured to lip.  CT scan--retro-pharyngeal edema/fluid
   and hematoma and gas overlying area of attempted trach intervention.
   Follow up imaging showed some decrease in edema but patient with no
   cuff leak heard and patient to [**Hospital1 5**] for further care.
        R pharygeal space infection, resp failure
   1) Acute respiratory Failure-This was in large part upper airway issue
   but also compounded by significant restrictive ventilatory defect.
   Currently has cuff leak but I'm hesitant to extubate given ongoing
   fevers and difficult intubation. Will do SBT today and wean sedation
   for possible extubation with anesthesia present in AM.
   Will c/w PSV today. Doing well with minimal vent support but sedation
   remains issue and has developed resp failure/worsening co2 retenion on
   spont bretahing trial.  Would be good candidate for extubation to PAP
   but given ear and phayrgneal infeviton mask ventialtion may be
   difficult--pt will liekly require trach.  Thoracics following.
   now concern for developing VAP--repeat cx's and consider briadening
   with double GNR coverage or sewitch to [**Last Name (un) **] if any sign of clincial
   decline.
   2)Phayrngeal space infection--continued low grade fever, improving
   leukocytosis.
   Continue broad spectrum coverage with Vanco/Zosyn, ENT involved
   3)Acute Renal Failure on CRI---imporved to baseline
   -continue to maintain adequate volume support, likely pre-renal state

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea. He was admitted to the hospital with respiratory distress following an infectious prodrome, characterized by ear pain, neck pain, and throat pain. The patient had significant edema and erythema in the neck and was started on antibiotics (CTX/Unasyn) and steroids. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) was attempted, but the patient required intubation due to severe respiratory acidosis on [5-23]. The patient underwent a tracheostomy in the operating room with an endotracheal tube sutured to the lip. A CT scan showed retro-pharyngeal edema/fluid and hematoma, as well as gas overlying the area of attempted tracheostomy intervention. Follow-up imaging showed some decrease in edema, but the patient had no cuff leak heard and was transferred to [Hospital1] for further care.

The patient's current conditions include:
1) Acute respiratory failure - This was caused by an upper airway issue but was also compounded by a significant restrictive ventilatory defect. Currently, the patient has a cuff leak but may not be extubated due to ongoing fevers and difficult intubation. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be conducted today, and sedation will be weaned for possible extubation with anesthesia present in the morning. Proportional assist"

   Initially upper airway issue (stridor) but also compounded by
   significant restrictive ventilatory defect and obesity. Currently does
   have cuff leak. Currently doing well with PSV.
         I remain hesitant to extubate at this time given ongoing fevers,
   possible need for OR and reimaging with known very difficult airway.
   Also now with increasing secretions and concern for developing VAP.
   Further, pt developed worsening acidosis and co2 retention during sbt
   yesterday. Sedation likely factoring in though pt has probable
   significant OSA as well.  Would be a good candidate for extubation to
   NIPPV but given R ear and phayrgneal/throat infection mask ventilation
   may be difficult.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), respiratory failure, and right-sided cellulitis/pharyngeal space soft tissue infection. The patient was transferred to another hospital for failure to extubate and possible tracheostomy placement by thoracics.

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, and decubitus ulcer (present at admission). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 50%, and has a cuff leak. The respiratory support device is an endotracheal tube.

The patient has ongoing fevers, possible need for OR and reimaging with known very difficult airway. There is also concern for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to increasing secretions. The patient developed worsening acidosis and CO2 retention during spontaneous breathing trial (sbt) yesterday. Sedation may be a factor, but the patient likely has significant OSA as well.

The plan is to continue PSV today, and the thoracics will follow up on the patient, suspecting that a tracheostomy will be required for safe extubation. Broad-spectrum coverage with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam will be continued, and repeat chest X-rays will be done. If there is any clinical"

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
 DECUBITUS ULCER (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   73 year old man with obesity, DM, COPD who developed respiratory
   distress and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection transferred
   to [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by
   thoracics.  His upper airway obstruction persists and his anatomy will
   likely make tracheostomy placement difficult.
   # Upper airway obstruction:  The patient remains ventilator dependent
   due to an upper airway obtruction possibly related to edema from his
   neck cellulitis, ? abscess.  Any extubation could result in close of
   his airway, and his difficult anatomy has made trachestomy quite
   difficult.   His trachea is also narrowed, as seen on bronchoscopy
   yesterday.  Furthermore, outside hospital operative report indicates
   that trachea is located under the sternum, complicating the option of
   tracheostomy.
   - Discuss with thoracics the possibility of tracheostomy
   - continue mechanical ventilation for now with current settings
   - ABG
   .
   # Cellulitis/soft tissue infection:  CT neck showed significant edema
   but it is unclear if there is a drain-able abscess.  After discussion
   with ENT, MRI with gadolinium would be most helpful to evaluate
   further, but given elevated creatinine this would carry its own risks.
   The patient
s fever curve is trending down while on Vanc/Zosyn.  His
   leukocytosis is resolving as well.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn
   - Vanc level [**6-2**] therapeutic; check again tomorrow given rapidly
   changing renal function
   - discuss with renal and radiology if a MRI might be feasible.
   .
   # DM:  Fingersticks have been elevated.
   - Continue Tube Feeds
   -  continue Lantus, HISS
   -  look through fingerstick values and change insulin as needed
   .
   #.CRI: Baseline cr: Creatinine increased to 2.0 today from baseline
   1.3-1.5.  UOP also poor. No recent contrast studies that might have led
   to ARF.  Most likely he is intra-vascularly depleted.
   - check urine lytes
   - trial of bolus  fluids
   - continue to monitor
   # Hypertension: Blood pressures not elevated.  Holding
   anti-hypertensives.  Will restart when needed.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Present on admission, stable per nursing with no
   need for wound consult at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
- He was transferred to the hospital for respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection.
- The patient remains ventilator-dependent due to upper airway obstruction, possibly related to edema from neck cellulitis and/or abscess.
- Tracheostomy placement is complicated due to the patient's difficult anatomy and the location of the trachea under the sternum.
- The patient's fever curve is trending down while on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, and leukocytosis is resolving.
- CT neck showed significant edema but unclear if there is a drainable abscess.
- An MRI with gadolinium would be helpful to evaluate further, but given elevated creatinine levels, it carries its own risks.
- The patient has acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, and a pre-existing decubitus ulcer.
- Other medical issues include hypertension, which is not currently elevated, and poor glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper Airway Obstruction: The patient's upper airway obstruction persists, making extubation risky. Difficulty in tracheostomy placement complicates the management of respiratory support.
2. Cellulitis/Soft Tissue Infection: The presence of significant edema in the neck region raises concerns about a possible abs"

 DECUBITUS ULCER (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   73 year old man with obesity, DM, COPD who developed respiratory
   distress and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection transferred
   to [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by
   thoracics.  His upper airway obstruction persists and his anatomy will
   likely make tracheostomy placement difficult.
   # Upper airway obstruction:  The patient remains ventilator dependent
   due to an upper airway obtruction possibly related to edema from his
   neck cellulitis, ? abscess.  Any extubation could result in close of
   his airway, and his difficult anatomy has made trachestomy quite
   difficult.   His trachea is also narrowed, as seen on bronchoscopy
   yesterday.  Furthermore, outside hospital operative report indicates
   that trachea is located under the sternum, complicating the option of
   tracheostomy.
   - Discuss with thoracics the possibility of tracheostomy
   - continue mechanical ventilation for now with current settings
   - ABG
   .
   # Cellulitis/soft tissue infection:  CT neck showed significant edema
   but it is unclear if there is a drain-able abscess.  After discussion
   with ENT, MRI with gadolinium would be most helpful to evaluate
   further, but given elevated creatinine this would carry its own risks.
   The patient
s fever curve is trending down while on Vanc/Zosyn.  His
   leukocytosis is resolving as well.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn
   - Vanc level [**6-2**] therapeutic; check again tomorrow given rapidly
   changing renal function
   - discuss with renal and radiology if a MRI might be feasible.
   .
   # DM:  Fingersticks have been elevated.
   - Continue Tube Feeds
   -  continue Lantus, HISS
   -  look through fingerstick values and change insulin as needed
   .
   #.CRI: Baseline cr: Creatinine increased to 2.0 today from baseline
   1.3-1.5.  UOP also poor. No recent contrast studies that might have led
   to ARF.  Most likely he is intra-vascularly depleted.
   - check urine lytes
   - trial of bolus  fluids
   - continue to monitor
   # Hypertension: Blood pressures not elevated.  Holding
   anti-hypertensives.  Will restart when needed.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Present on admission, stable per nursing with no
   need for wound consult at this time.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who developed respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. He was transferred to the hospital for failure to extubate and possible tracheostomy placement. 

The patient remains ventilator dependent due to an upper airway obstruction possibly related to edema from his neck cellulitis, and there is a concern about the presence of an abscess. His trachea is also narrowed, as seen on bronchoscopy yesterday. The location of the trachea under the sternum complicates the option of tracheostomy.

The patient's fever curve is trending down while on vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). His leukocytosis is resolving as well. CT neck showed significant edema but it is unclear if there is a drain-able abscess. An MRI with gadolinium would be most helpful to evaluate further, but given the elevated creatinine, this would carry its own risks.

The patient has acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, and a decubitus ulcer present at admission. The patient's blood pressures are not elevated, so antihypertensives are being held, and they will be restarted when needed. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has a history of acute renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, decubitus ulcer, and respiratory failure not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

On the day of admission, the patient underwent bronchoscopy and was bronchoscoped for a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The trachea was found to be collapsed, and a neck/chest CT scan is pending to determine if there is an abscess. An OSH tracheostomy report indicates that the cricothyroid membrane is behind the manubrium, and therefore, a sternotomy would be required to perform a tracheostomy.

The patient's urine output has been poor overnight at 25 cc/h. The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and heparin sodium.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate ranging from 67 to 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/42 mmHg to 168/64 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

","The patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who developed respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. He was transferred to the ICU for failure to extubate and possible tracheostomy placement by thoracics. The patient remains ventilator dependent due to upper airway obstruction from neck cellulitis, possibly an abscess. Any extubation could result in closure of his airway, and his difficult anatomy makes tracheostomy quite difficult.

The patient's fever curve is trending down while on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. His leukocytosis is also resolving. It is unclear if he has edema from infection versus abscess in his neck. The patient's respiratory failure is not ARDS.

The patient has acute renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, and a decubitus ulcer present on admission. His blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. He is receiving tube feeds and insulin therapy for glycemic control.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/42 mmHg to 168/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated platelet count. Blood cultures are pending, and imaging studies reveal an enlarged edematous left submandibular gland, stranding in the bilateral parapharyngeal space, air-fluid opacification involving all sinuses, and degenerative changes in the spine with straightening of the cervical spine.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of respiratory failure, cellulitis/soft tissue infection, diabetes mellitus, and other comorbidities."

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old obese male with diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and respiratory failure due to right-sided cellulitis/pharyngeal space soft tissue infection. He was transferred to the hospital for failure to extubate and possible tracheostomy placement. The patient continues to experience acute respiratory failure, low-grade fevers, pharyngeal space infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His condition is complicated by tracheal narrowing and difficulty with the tracheostomy procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is initially caused by an upper airway issue (stridor), compounded by restrictive ventilatory defect and obesity. It is now further complicated by VAP. The patient requires a tracheostomy to safely extubate, but the low trachea and bronchoscopic findings of tracheal narrowing raise concerns about the procedure's difficulty.
2. Low-Grade Fevers: The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers, which could indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation.
3. Pharyngeal Space Infection: Although the patient's leukocytosis is improving, the presence of fevers suggests that the pharyngeal space infection is still present.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has VAP, which is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn). Imaging"

   Primary issues remain:
   # Acute respiratory Failure
        Initially upper airway issue (stridor),compounded by significant
   restrictive ventilatory defect and obesity and now complicated further
   by VAP.  Not currently at point where he is ready to consider
   extubation as he has not tolerated PS weans and now intubated for 1.5
   wks.  We have discussed in detail with both ent and thoracics
   consideration of  trach placement to more safely wean and ultimately
   extubate this pt.   Their input is appreciated.
        On bronch there was sig tracheal narrowing which Is likely
   contributing to poor tolerance of PS in addition to obesity and VAP.
   Suspect the tracheal appearance is related to airway edema from et
   trauma or his neck/pharyngeal space infection. His chest/tracheal/upper
   airway anatomy would require mediastinal trach with resection of
   superior sternal plate which is an aggressive and possibly permanent
   procedure making pursuit of trach placement at this time in course far
   less appealing for this pt.   We will continue to support on vent and
   continue to reassess for extubation trial as neck infection improves
   and VAP resolves. Any future extubation attempt  would be approached
   conservatively
likely  over scope to protect airway given above
   findings.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old obese male with diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and acute respiratory failure due to a pharyngeal space infection. He has been intubated for the past 1.5 weeks and is currently on mechanical ventilation with concerns of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's respiratory failure is complicated by tracheal narrowing, which may be related to airway edema from endotracheal tube trauma or the neck/pharyngeal space infection. There is a consideration for tracheostomy placement, but it would be an aggressive procedure and potentially permanent. The patient will continue to be supported on the ventilator and reassessed for extubation trials as the neck infection improves and VAP resolves.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is initially due to an upper airway issue, compounded by restrictive ventilatory defect and obesity. It is now complicated further by VAP. The patient has not tolerated pressure support weans and is intubated for 1.5 weeks. Tracheal narrowing contributes to poor tolerance of PS (pressure support) in addition to obesity and VAP.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has low-grade fevers, pharyngeal space infection, and evidence of worsening leukocytosis. These findings suggest an ongoing infectious process. Broad-spectrum coverage with Vancomycin ("

   73 yo obese M with DM, OSA, with resp failure and right sided

   Primary issues remain:
   # Acute respiratory Failure
        Initially upper airway issue (stridor), compounded by significant
   restrictive ventilatory defect and obesity and now complicated further
   by VAP.  Remains vent dependent as he has not tolerated PS weans and
   now intubated for 1.5 wks.  We have discussed in detail with both ent
   and thoracics consideration of  trach placement to more safely wean and
   ultimately extubate this pt.   Their input is appreciated.
        On bronch there was sig tracheal narrowing which Is likely
   contributing to poor tolerance of PS in addition to obesity and VAP.
   Suspect the tracheal appearance is related to airway edema from et
   trauma or his neck/pharyngeal space infection. His chest/tracheal/upper
   airway anatomy complicates possible trach placement which would require
   mediastinal trach with resection of superior sternal plate.  This is an
   aggressive and possibly permanent procedure making pursuit of trach
   placement at this time in course far less appealing for this pt.
        Continue MV
        Reassess for extubation trial as neck infection improves and VAP
   resolves.
       Any future extubation attempt  would be approached conservatively
likely  over scope to protect airway given above findings.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old obese male with diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, respiratory failure, and right-sided cellulitis/pharyngeal space soft tissue infection. The patient was transferred to the hospital for failure to extubate and possible tracheostomy placement by thoracics.

The patient's primary issues include acute respiratory failure, which is initially due to an upper airway issue (stridor), compounded by significant restrictive ventilatory defect and obesity, and now complicated further by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has not tolerated pressure support weans and remains intubated for 1.5 weeks. The attending physician and team have discussed in detail with both the ENT and thoracic surgeons the consideration of tracheostomy placement to more safely wean and ultimately extubate the patient. Their input is appreciated.

During bronchoscopy, significant tracheal narrowing was observed, which is likely contributing to the patient's poor tolerance of pressure support in addition to obesity and VAP. The tracheal appearance is suspected to be related to airway edema from endotracheal tube trauma or the patient's neck/pharyngeal space infection. The patient's chest/tracheal/upper airway anatomy complicates possible tracheostomy placement, which would require mediastinal tracheostomy with resection of the superior sternal plate.

   73 year old man with obesity, DM, COPD who developed respiratory
   distress and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection transferred
   to [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by
   thoracics.  His upper airway obstruction persists and his anatomy will
   likely make tracheostomy placement difficult.
   # Upper airway obstruction:  His respiratory status The patient remains
   ventilator dependent due to an upper airway obtruction possibly related
   to edema from his neck cellulitis, ? abscess.  Any extubation could
   result in close of his airway, and his difficult anatomy has made
   trachestomy quite difficult.   His trachea is also narrowed, as seen on
   bronchoscopy yesterday.  Furthermore, outside hospital operative report
   indicates that trachea is located under the sternum, complicating the
   option of tracheostomy.
   - Discuss with thoracics the possibility of tracheostomy
   - continue mechanical ventilation for now with current settings

   # Cellulitis/soft tissue infection:  CT neck showed significant edema
   but it is unclear if there is a drain-able abscess.  After discussion
   with ENT, MRI with gadolinium would be most helpful to evaluate
   further, but given elevated creatinine this would carry its own risks.

s fever curve is trending down while on Vanc/Zosyn.  His
   leukocytosis is resolving as well.

   1.3-1.5.  UOP also poor. No recent contrast studies that might have led
   to ARF.  Most likely he is intra-vascularly depleted.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who developed respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. He was transferred to the hospital for failure to extubate and possible tracheostomy placement by thoracics. 

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains ventilator dependent due to upper airway obstruction possibly related to edema from neck cellulitis, potentially an abscess. Any extubation could result in closure of his airway, and his difficult anatomy has made tracheostomy quite difficult. 
2. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level increased to 2.0 today from 1.3-1.5. Poor urine output (UOP) is also noted. No recent contrast studies that might have led to acute renal failure (ARF) are mentioned. It is likely that he is intravascularly depleted.
3. Diabetes mellitus type II: Fingersticks have been elevated, indicating poorly controlled blood sugar levels.
4. Decubitus ulcer: Present on admission, stable per nursing with no need for wound consult at this time.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. He was transferred to the ICU for failure to extubate and possible tracheostomy placement.

The patient remains ventilator-dependent due to upper airway obstruction, possibly related to edema from neck cellulitis, and there is a possibility of abscess formation. Any extubation could result in closure of his airway, and his difficult anatomy has made tracheostomy quite difficult. His trachea is also narrowed, as seen on bronchoscopy yesterday. Furthermore, an operative report indicates that the trachea is located under the sternum, complicating the option of tracheostomy.

The patient's fever curve is trending down while on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. His leukocytosis is resolving as well. The CT neck showed significant edema but it is unclear if there is a drainable abscess. After discussion with ENT, MRI with gadolinium would be most helpful to evaluate further, but given the elevated creatinine, this would carry its own risks.

The patient's fingersticks have been elevated, indicating poorly controlled DM. It is recommended to continue tube feeds, Lantus, and HISS. The fingerstick values should be reviewed and insulin regimen should be adjusted accordingly.

 DECUBITUS ULCER (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   73 year old man with obesity, DM, COPD who developed respiratory
   distress and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection transferred
   to [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by
   thoracics.  His upper airway obstruction persists and his anatomy would
   make tracheostomy placement difficult.
   # Upper airway obstruction:  Likely secondary to edema near cellulitis
   as well as narrowed trachea.   His respiratory status seems to be
   improving, as he is now tolerating pressure support.  Outside hospital
   operative report indicates that trachea is located under the sternum,
   and thoracics has said that they will not want to do a tracheostomy for
   this reason, as it would likely be very difficult to reverse.
   - broncoscopy today by thoracics to confirm narrowed trachea
   - wean pressure support as tolerated after broncoscopy
   - may consider extubation in the next few days if tolerating less
   pressure support
   - may need diuresis prior to extubation
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old obese man with diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute respiratory failure. He was transferred to the ICU for failure to extubate and possible tracheostomy placement due to upper airway obstruction. The patient's respiratory status seems to be improving, and he is now tolerating pressure support. A bronchoscopy will be performed today by thoracics to confirm narrowed trachea. The patient may be considered for extubation in the next few days if tolerating less pressure support and may need diuresis prior to extubation.

The patient has cellulitis/soft tissue infection on the right side, with significant edema but unclear if there is a drainable abscess. Fever curve is trending down while on Vanc/Zosyn, and leukocytosis is resolving as well. The antibiotic regimen will be continued, and the vancomycin level today was elevated, so the dose will be held and discussed with renal dosing.

The patient also has acute renal failure with stable creatinine levels after increasing to 2.0 yesterday from baseline 1.3-1.5. Poor urine output responded to fluid bolus and blood yesterday, indicating intra-vascularly depletion. Fluids will be given PRN low urine output, and renal medications including vancomycin will be monitored.

The patient has type II diabetes mellitus and a pre-existing decubitus"

 DECUBITUS ULCER (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   73 year old man with obesity, DM, COPD who developed respiratory
   distress and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection transferred
   to [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by
   thoracics.  His upper airway obstruction persists and his anatomy will
   likely make tracheostomy placement difficult.
   # Upper airway obstruction:  The patient remains ventilator dependent
   due to an upper airway obtruction possibly related to edema from his
   neck cellulitis, ? abscess.  Any extubation could result in close of
   his airway, and his difficult anatomy has made trachestomy quite
   difficult.   His trachea is also narrowed, as seen on bronchoscopy
   yesterday.  Furthermore, outside hospital operative report indicates
   that trachea is located under the sternum, complicating the option of
   tracheostomy.
   - Discuss with thoracics the possibility of tracheostomy
   - continue mechanical ventilation for now with current settings
   - ABG
   .
   # Cellulitis/soft tissue infection:  CT neck showed significant edema
   but it is unclear if there is a drain-able abscess.  After discussion
   with ENT, MRI with gadolinium would be most helpful to evaluate
   further, but given elevated creatinine this would carry its own risks.
   The patient
s fever curve is trending down while on Vanc/Zosyn.  His
   leukocytosis is resolving as well.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn
   - Vanc level [**6-2**] therapeutic; check again tomorrow given rapidly
   changing renal function
   - discuss with renal and radiology if a MRI might be feasible.
   .
   # DM:  Fingersticks have been elevated.
   - Continue Tube Feeds
   -  continue Lantus, HISS
   -  look through fingerstick values and change insulin as needed
   .
   #.CRI: Baseline cr: Creatinine increased to 2.0 today from baseline
   1.3-1.5.  UOP also poor. No recent contrast studies that might have led
   to ARF.  Most likely he is intra-vascularly depleted.
   - check urine lytes
   - trial of bolus  fluids
   - continue to monitor
   # Hypertension: Blood pressures not elevated.  Holding
   anti-hypertensives.  Will restart when needed.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Present on admission, stable per nursing with no
   need for wound consult at this time.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old man with obesity, DM, COPD who developed respiratory
   distress and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection transferred
   to [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by
   thoracics.  His upper airway obstruction persists and his anatomy would
   make tracheostomy placement difficult.
   # Upper airway obstruction:  Likely secondary to edema near cellulitis
   as well as narrowed trachea.   His respiratory status seems to be
   improving, as he is now tolerating pressure support.  Outside hospital
   operative report indicates that trachea is located under the sternum,
   and thoracics has said that they will not want to do a tracheostomy for
   this reason, as it would likely be very difficult to reverse.
   - broncoscopy today by thoracics to confirm narrowed trachea
   - wean pressure support as tolerated after broncoscopy
   - may consider extubation in the next few days if tolerating less
   pressure support
   - may need diuresis prior to extubation
   .
   # Cellulitis/soft tissue infection:  ENT following.  CT neck showed
   significant edema but it is unclear if there is a drain-able abscess.
   Fever curve is trending down while on Vanc/Zosyn.  His leukocytosis is
   resolving as well.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn
   - vanc level today was elevated; hold dose and discuss dosing with
   renal
   .
   # DM:  Fingersticks were elevated; sliding scale increased.  FS have
   been better over the past 12 hours.
   - NPO currently for bronch; resume TF after and f/u FS
   -  continue Lantus, HISS
   ..
   #.CRI: Creatinine stable today after increasing to 2.0 yesterday from
   baseline 1.3-1.5.  UOP was poor but responded to fluid bolus and blood
   yesterday.  Most likely he is intra-vascularly depleted; urine lytes
   are consistent with this etiology.
   - fluids PRN low urine output.
   - continue to monitor
   - renally dose meds including vancomycin
   # Hypertension: Blood pressures not elevated.  Holding
   anti-hypertensives.  Will restart when needed.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Present on admission, stable per nursing with no
   need for wound consult at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure (acute renal failure, ARF), type II diabetes mellitus, and a decubitus ulcer present at admission. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy which revealed a ""saber sheath"" trachea and lots of granulation tissue in the trachea, likely from an endotracheal tube. The healthcare team decided to extubate the patient instead of performing a sternotomy/trach or stent due to the potential trauma involved.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/50-208/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus rhythm heart rhythm. The patient's weight is currently 106.7 kg, and his height is 64 inches.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,091 mL of IV fluids, with outputs totaling 3,100 mL including 1,150 mL of urine output. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with a CMV/ASSIST ventilator mode, set Vt of 550 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 12 breaths per minute, P"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 6453**] is more awake on current level of sedation and has a string
   grip and gag reflex. His sats are 92% on cuurent FiO2 of 40%. He is
   still on fentanyl ( 100) and versed ( 1). He has decreased BS at left
   base but minimal wheezing. he does manifest
   minimal edema.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.5  BP 170/77 HR of 84 RR of 16 with sats of
   92% on 50% /5 PEEP . Labs notable for WBC 8.3 K, HCT of 27.5 , K+ 4.0 ,
   Cr 1.8, lactate of 1.2. CXR with atelectasis left base, effusions Rt>
   left.
   Agree with plan to decrease sedation and attempt extubation (anasthesia
   on standby) today with BiPAP on hold for hypoventilation. He will need
   help with secretion clearance and wheezing post extubation. gentle
   diuresis may help if he doesn't auto-diurese.
   We will continue antibiotics for now for at least 14 day course.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who developed respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. He was transferred to the hospital for failure to extubate. The patient has a saber sheath trachea and is currently intubated.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note include:
1. Upper airway obstruction: The patient's difficult anatomy, specifically the saber sheath trachea, may pose challenges during extubation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory distress and COPD, which increases the risk of respiratory failure post-extubation.
3. Cellulitis/soft tissue infection: The patient's right neck cellulitis is improving, but there is still a risk of infection spreading or developing new infections.
4. Diabetic complications: The patient has diabetes, which increases the risk of complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
5. Hypertension: The patient is markedly hypertensive, indicating a need for careful monitoring and management of blood pressure.
6. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer, which could worsen if not properly managed.
7. Medication interactions: With multiple medications being administered, there is a risk of drug interactions or adverse effects.

It is important to closely monitor the"

","The patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who developed respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. He was transferred to the ICU for failure to extubate. The patient has a saber sheath trachea. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Upper airway obstruction/Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved, with a current RISB (rapid shallow breathing index) of 61, which indicates a good response to spontaneous breathing trials. The plan is to extubate the patient, taking into consideration his difficult anatomy. Lasix will be administered intravenously to achieve a net negative fluid balance of 1.5 liters today. After extubation, the patient will be kept in a sitting position with legs down to minimize pressure on the lungs from his large abdomen.

2. Cellulitis/soft tissue infection: The patient is afebrile, and his white blood cell count is trending down, indicating improvement. Vanc/Zosyn will continue to be administered.

3. DM: Lantus and HISS will be continued.

4. CRI (chronic renal insufficiency): The patient's creatinine level is trending down to 1.8, and he has good urine output. Diuresis will be maintained as before, and medications will be monitored and dosed accordingly.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. He has been diagnosed with a saber sheath trachea and is currently intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper airway obstruction: The patient's neck cellulitis is improving, but there is still a risk of upper airway obstruction due to the presence of a saber sheath trachea. Extubation may be challenging.
2. Cellulitis/soft tissue infection: Although the patient's neck is softening, and fever curve is down trending, there is still a risk of complications from the cellulitis/soft tissue infection. Monitoring for signs of worsening infection or abscess formation is important.
3. Diabetic complications: The patient has diabetes mellitus, which increases the risk of various complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary.
4. Hypertension: The patient experienced marked hypertension overnight, indicating a potential cardiovascular complication. Blood pressure should be closely monitored and appropriate antihypertensive medications adjusted accordingly.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.9, and there is an increasing urine output. Renal function should be monitored regularly, especially considering the use of neph"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. 

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypertension: The patient continues to be hypertensive despite medication adjustments. Possible causes could be pain or underlying conditions.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress is likely secondary to underlying lung disease (COPD and OSA) as well as volume overload. He has been extubated but requires BiPAP support.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable at 1.8, and there has been improvement in urine output since receiving a blood transfusion two days ago. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly are advised.

4. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's diabetes management includes Lantus and HISS.

5. Decubitus ulcer: The patient had a pre-existing decubitus ulcer present upon admission, which is currently stable without any immediate need for wound consultation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's underlying lung disease and volume overload pose a risk for further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. Uncontrolled hypertension: Despite medication"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 6453**] has extubated for more than 24 hrs but has needed BiPAP for
   tachypnea and intermittent desturations. He complains of pain.  His
   sats are 95% on face tent O2. His voice is hoarse but he is oriented to
   person. He does have diffuse wheezing but this too has improved c/w
   with [**2177-6-7**]. anasarca remains.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.5  BP 170/77 HR of 84 RR of 16.
   Labs notable for WBC 11.5 K, HCT of 23.5 , K+ 3.4 , Cr 1.8, alb of 2.4.
   CXR with atelectasis left base, effusions Rt> left.but improved
   aeration.
   Agree with plan to use BiPAP on as needed basis during the day but
   conistently with sleep. He will benefit from 1 unit pRBC today to allow
   diuresis too. I suspect as his pain is better controlled, he will start
   to get OOB to chair and this will help with ventilation. Nebs will be
   used on a standing basis for now.
   We will continue antibiotics for now for at least 14 day course.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill and will need ICU level care for now. Suspect
   he may become a candidate for rehab soon.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. He was transferred to the ICU for failure to extubate.

The patient has been extubated for more than 24 hours but required BiPap for tachypnea and intermittent desaturations. He complains of pain, has a hoarse voice, but is oriented to person. His oxygen saturation (sats) are 95% on face tent oxygen. He has diffuse wheezing but this has improved along with improvement in right ear erythema and induration, right facial erythema and induration, and right sub-mandibular induration.

His vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 217/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 97%. The patient's weight has decreased from 115.1 kg to 106.7 kg.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 23.3%, creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 135 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 3.4 mEq/L, and glucose of 116 mg/dL.

Radiology shows persistent opacities within both lower lungs, likely a combination of pleural effusion, adjacent basilar atelectasis and/or consolidation, left greater than right. Minimal residual perihilar haziness and peribronchial cuffing, improved compared to earlier studies.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypertension, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and decubitus ulcer (present at admission). 

The assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory Failure: Continue BiPap on as-needed basis during the day but consistently with sleep. Increase lasix for goal 500 cc net negative today.
2. Cellulitis/soft tissue infection: Continue Vanc/Zosyn. Define antibiotic course (discuss with ID).
3. Anemia: Give 1 unit pRBC today. Guaiac stools. Continue to monitor.
4. Hypertension: Increase hydralazine, start labetalol. Improve pain control by increasing morphine.
5. DM: Continue Lantus, HISS.
6. CRI: Creatinine stable today at 1.8, urine output good. Continue to monitor.
7. Decubitus Ulcer: Present on admission, stable per nursing with no need for wound consult at this time.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis secondary to cellulitis/soft tissue infection, exacerbation of hypertension, worsening renal function, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and progression of decubitus ulcer."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of decubitus ulcer. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and right-sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection. The patient underwent invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying lung disease (COPD) may contribute to respiratory failure, especially if he develops further respiratory distress or infection.

2. Cellulitis/Soft Tissue Infection: Although the patient's right neck cellulitis is improving, there is still a risk of infection spreading or developing new infections, which could lead to worsening cellulitis or systemic infection.

3. Diabetic Complications: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus, and uncontrolled blood glucose levels can increase the risk of diabetic complications such as ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's current renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. This increases the risk of developing AKI, especially if there is inadequate fluid management or ongoing renal insult.

5. Hypertension: The patient continues to be hypertensive despite medication adjustments. If left uncontrolled, hypertension may lead to end-organ damage or complications.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 73-year-old male with obesity, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with right neck cellulitis after extubation.
- The patient is currently awake, alert, and following commands. He has a history of respiratory failure due to an obstructing lesion, but is able to support his own airway.
- The patient has ongoing hypertension that is being managed with multiple medications, and there is a goal to relieve volume overload.
- His WBC count is resolving, indicating improvement in cellulitis/soft tissue infection.
- The patient has anemia, but his hct is stable after a transfusion yesterday.
- The patient's creatinine levels are stable, and urine output is good.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and the presence of right neck cellulitis could potentially lead to respiratory failure if the cellulitis worsens or if there is a recurrence of airway obstruction.
2. Hypertension: The patient's ongoing hypertension needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Cellulitis/Soft Tissue Infection: Although the patient's WBC count is resolving, there is still a risk of worsening infection or development of complications such as abscess formation.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia should be closely monitored, and further interventions may be necessary to address this condition.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old obese male with diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with right neck cellulitis. The patient underwent an attempted extubation but did not tolerate noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and required increased labetalol for hypertension. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient received vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) antibiotics. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/42 mmHg to 151/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination revealed bilateral expiratory rhonchi and wheezing, a thick neck with tracheostomy scar and improving cellulitis, and stable lower extremity edema. The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. The patient's blood products and fluid balance were also documented. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Although the patient was extubated successfully, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure, especially considering the presence of COPD."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been admitted to the ICU for right neck cellulitis and is currently on extubation. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature range of 35.6-37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 73-93 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 90/42 to 151/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11-17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high-flow nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination reveals right ear erythema and induration with crusting, decreased right facial erythema and induration, and right sub-mandibular induration. He has a thick neck with tracheostomy scar and improving induration on the right neck. His lungs show bilateral expiratory rhonchi and wheezing. The heart examination reveals regular rhythm without murmurs or extra sounds. The abdomen is soft with no masses or hepatosplenomegaly. The patient has stable lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows that he is awake, alert, oriented, and moving all four extremities.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) on day 6, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 23.3-30.6%, and platelet count (Plt) ranging from 241-349. Other lab values such as creatinine, TCO2, glucose, PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, and differential white blood cell count are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Upper airway obstruction/respiratory failure: The patient's airway obstruction persists due to his cellulitis, but he can support his own airway. Diuretic therapy will be continued to relieve volume overload, with a goal of 1.5-2 liters daily.
2. Cellulitis/soft tissue infection: The patient is afebrile, and his WBC count is improving. Antibiotic therapy with Vanc/Zosyn will be continued. The course of treatment will be clarified with ENT and ID consultants, although a two-week course has been recommended so far.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels have stabilized after transfusion yesterday. Daily hematocrit monitoring will be continued.
4. Hypertension: The patient remains hypertensive. The pain regimen and labetalol dosage will be uptitrated to 60mg IV q6. Hydralazine and amlodipine will also be continued.
5. DM: Lantus and HISS will continue.
6. CRI: The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.8, and urine output is good. Renal dos"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent respiratory failure who presented with right neck cellulitis after being extubated. The patient has a history of aspiration, impaired aerobic capacity, impaired balance, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired transfers, hypertension, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, and a pre-existing decubitus ulcer.

The patient's current condition includes upper airway obstruction/respiratory failure, which has been resolved and the patient is now extubated. He is maintaining oxygen saturation in the mid-90s on high-flow nasal cannula. An MRI of the neck is pending to further evaluate the soft tissues. A repeat bedside speech and swallow evaluation will be conducted today.

The patient also has cellulitis/soft tissue infection in the neck area. An MRI will be used to follow up on the improvement in the soft tissues. The infectious disease (ID) team recommends a likely three-week course of treatment, depending on the results of the MRI.

Other conditions being managed include anemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient's blood pressure is being controlled with labetalol, and adjustments to the medication dosage will be made as necessary. Oral medications may be transitioned if the patient's speech and swallow evaluation improves. The patient's diabetes management involves the"

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had upper airway obstruction leading to respiratory failure, but it has been resolved after extubation. The patient is currently maintaining oxygen saturation in the mid-90s on high flow face mask.

2. Cellulitis/Soft Tissue Infection: The patient has neck cellulitis, and he is receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). An MRI of the neck is pending to follow up on the improvement of soft tissues.

3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable.

4. Hypertension: The patient has labile hypertension, and his labetalol dose has been increased to 60 IV Q6. The goal is to better control his blood pressure, with a maximum systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 160 overnight. Titration of the beta-blocker will be done as needed for BP control, and transitioning to oral medications will be considered after speech and swallow evaluation.

5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes management includes continuing with Lantus and HISS.

   # Respiratory failure:  Now extubated but with ongoing hypercarbia and
   high O2 requirement, likely secondary to baseline COPD and OSA
   physiology.  Also has bilateral effusions that may be contributing to
   hypoxia.  He has been net negative yesterday without Lasix.  He has not
   tolerated Bipap but may benefit from a re-trial in the future.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent right neck cellulitis following extubation. He has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, delirium, cellulitis/soft tissue infection, anemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and decubitus ulcer. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ongoing hypercarbia and high O2 requirement, likely secondary to baseline COPD and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) physiology. Bilateral effusions may contribute to hypoxia. Complications can include worsening respiratory distress, need for re-intubation, or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 1.7 and decreased urine output. Complications can include worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for dialysis.
3. Delirium: The patient is likely experiencing ICU delirium related to recent prolonged intubation, medications (such as fentanyl), hypercarbia, and other factors. Complications can include increased agitation, falls, pressure injuries, and potential worsening of underlying comorbidities.
4. Cellulitis/soft tissue infection: The patient has right neck"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent respiratory failure who was admitted to the ICU. The patient presented with neck cellulitis and was successfully extubated. Bedside speech and swallow evaluation revealed aspiration of thin liquids and soft signs of aspiration versus pharyngeal residue of purees.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and recent respiratory failure indicate a high risk for recurrent respiratory failure, particularly due to aspiration.
2. Infection: The patient has neck cellulitis, which increases the risk of developing a soft tissue infection or systemic infection.
3. Decubitus Ulcer: The presence of a decubitus ulcer on admission suggests that the patient may be at risk for developing pressure ulcers during his stay in the ICU.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, which may require close monitoring and adjustment of medications.
5. Hypertension: The patient has labile hypertension, which needs to be managed with appropriate antihypertensive therapy.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus, and glycemic control should be maintained through insulin therapy.
7. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia, which should be monitored and managed accordingly.

These potential complications highlight the importance of close monitoring and appropriate interventions to prevent further"

   73 year old man with obesity, DM, COPD with R neck cellulitis s/p
   extubation with ongoing high oxygen requirement and hypercarbia.
   # Respiratory impairment:  Now extubated.  O2 requirement is slowly
   decreasing, but he does have ongoing hypercarbia and high O2
   requirement.  Likely multifactorial secondary to baseline COPD, OSA
   physiology, volume overload with bilateral effusions, and upper airway
   obstruction secondary to saber-sheath trachea.  Diuresis is limited by
   tendency for renal failure.
   - upright positioning to optimize anatomy
   - monitor I/O; diuresis PRN to goal net even
   -  repeat ABG
   -  would attempt re-trial of bipap if respiratory status declines
   - transition to nasal cannula oxygen today if possible (although may be
   difficult given that he breaths mostly through his mouth)
   .
   # Delirium:  Perhaps somewhat improved today.  Infectious work-up
   yesterday was not revealing.  ABG and chemistry indicative of chronic
   CO2 retention that is not a likely large contributor to current mental
   status, although this remains on the differential.  Also, he is again
   hypernatremic today, which may contribute.  Perhaps the largest
   contributor is likely ICU delirium related to recent prolonged
   intubation, etc.
   - optimize sleep/wake cycle hygiene
   - repeat ABG as above
   - correct hypernatremia, as below
   - would consider zyprexa if agitated
   .
   # Cellulitis/soft tissue infection:  Today is day 21 of vanc and
   zosyn.  MRI showed with improvement in soft tissue swelling.   After
   discussion with ID, 21 days should be a sufficient antibiotic course
   - discontinue vancomycin and zosyn today

   # Anemia:  stable
   # Hypertension: Well controlled on labetolol to 60 IV Q6 on [**6-9**],
   amlodipine 10 mg and hydralazine 40 mg IV q6h.  At home he was on HCTZ
   and lisinopril in addition to amlodipine (no beta blocker per admission
   note).   Would prefer to convert all meds to PO at this point.
   - change hydralazine to PO (1:1 conversion per pharmacist)
   - stop labetalol
   - restart lisinopril at 5 mg (home dose is 10 mg but concern for renal
   function)
   - stop labetalol (will consider restarting PO if BP elevated on this
   new regimen)
   - continue amlodipine
   .
   # DM:  continue Lantus, HISS
   #.CRI: creatinine stable currently.
   - continue to monitor
   - gentle diuresis
   # hypernatremia:  free water deficit ~5 L, trying to increase free
   water by PO yesterday but he did not take in enough to correct Na
   - D5W at 125 cc/h for 1 L and re-check

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and right neck cellulitis. He was recently extubated and is still requiring high levels of oxygen and has hypercarbia. The patient's respiratory function is impaired due to baseline COPD, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) physiology, volume overload with bilateral effusions, and upper airway obstruction caused by a saber-sheath trachea. There is also a concern for acute renal failure. The patient has a history of delirium, cellulitis/soft tissue infection, anemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a decubitus ulcer present on admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Impairment: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to various factors including COPD, OSA physiology, volume overload, and upper airway obstruction. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions such as re-trial of bipap and transitioning to nasal cannula oxygen are recommended.

2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, possibly related to recent prolonged intubation and hypernatremia. Optimizing sleep/wake cycle hygiene, correcting hypernatremia, and considering zyprexa if agitation persists are suggested.

3. Cellulitis/Soft Tissue Infection: The patient has shown improvement in soft tissue swelling based on the MRI results. After discussing with"

 DECUBITUS ULCER (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   73 year old man with obesity, DM, COPD with R neck cellulitis s/p
   extubation.  Bedside speech and swallow evaluation revealed aspiration
   of thin liquids and soft signs of aspiration vs. pharyngeal residue of
   purees.
   # Respiratory failure:  Now extubated but with ongoing hypercarbia and
   high O2 requirement, likely secondary to baseline COPD and OSA
   physiology.  Also has bilateral effusions that may be contributing to
   hypoxia.  He has been net negative yesterday without Lasix.  He has not
   tolerated Bipap but may benefit from a re-trial in the future.
   -  repeat ABG
   -  consider further weaning of O2 as tolerated
   -  attempt re-trial of bipap
   -  wean O2 as tolerated
   - monitor I/O
   .
   # Delirium:  Most likely ICU delirium related to recent prolonged
   intubation, etc.  Also on the differential would be infection (UA
   yesterday questionably dirty), drug effect (fentanyl recently started),
   hypercarbia (although he appears well compensated and more likely he is
   at his baseline CO2).
   - d/c fentanyl
   - f/u urine cx
   - optimize sleep/wake cycle hygeine
   - repeat ABG as above
   - would consider zyprexa if agitated
   .
   # Cellulitis/soft tissue infection:  on vanc and zosyn.  MRI today with
   improvement in soft tissue swelling.
   - f/u ID recs regarding course of vanc/zosyn (likely 3 weeks)
   - f/u final read MRI
   - continue zosyn/vanc
   - check vanc trough tomorrow given changing renal function
   # Anemia:  stable
   # Hypertension: improved now on increased labetolol to 60 IV Q6 on
   [**6-9**], also on amlodipine 10 mg and hydralazine 40 mg IV q6h
   - f/u BP
   - consider transition to PO meds if able to tolerate
   # DM:  continue Lantus, HISS
   #.CRI: creatinine improved today at 1.7, urine output good.
   - continue to monitor
   - renally dose meds including vancomycin
   # hypernatremia:  free water deficit ~5 L, trying to increase free
   water by PO yesterday but failed
   - D5W today
   - will replete with D5 if not

   Disposition: in the ICU pending improvement in delirium and respiratory
   status (possible call-out vs rehab tomorrow)
","The patient is a 73-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent history of neck cellulitis. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation. The patient has been extubated but still requires supplemental oxygen and has ongoing hypercarbia. He also has bilateral effusions contributing to hypoxia.

The patient's delirium is likely related to recent prolonged intubation, medication effects, infection, or hypercarbia. His cellulitis has improved with antibiotic therapy, but further monitoring and treatment are required.

Other medical conditions include anemia, hypertension, DM, and renal failure. The patient has a history of decubitus ulcer present at admission, which is currently stable. The patient's laboratory results show some abnormalities such as elevated creatinine, hypernatremia, and slightly elevated total bilirubin.

The patient's current plan includes optimizing sleep/wake cycle hygiene, repeat ABG, weaning off oxygen as tolerated, and considering a trial of bipap if tolerated. The patient will continue on vancomycin and zosyn for cellulitis, and his renal function will be monitored closely.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, delirium, infection, and further deterioration of renal function."

   Cxr [**6-12**]:
   As was previously mentioned, there is extensive narrowing of the AP
   diameter
   of almost entire intrathoracic trachea, which might be related to
   saber-sheath
   trachea but also may represent interval development of mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy (not very likely given the overall unchanged width of
   the
   mediastinum). The left retrocardiac atelectasis has increased in the
   interim
   with more of the left mediastinal shift. Bilateral pleural effusions
   are
   present, mild to moderate.

 DECUBITUS ULCER (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   73 year old man with obesity, DM, COPD with R neck cellulitis s/p
   extubation with ongoing high oxygen requirement and hypercarbia.
   # Respiratory impairment:  Now extubated.  O2 requirement is slowly
   decreasing, but he does have ongoing hypercarbia and high O2
   requirement.  Likely multifactorial secondary to baseline COPD, OSA
   physiology, volume overload with bilateral effusions, and upper airway
   obstruction secondary to saber-sheath trachea.  Diuresis is limited by
   tendency for renal failure.
   - upright positioning to optimize anatomy
   - monitor I/O; diuresis PRN to goal net even
   -  repeat ABG
   -  would attempt re-trial of bipap if respiratory status declines
   - transition to nasal cannula oxygen today if possible (although may be
   difficult given that he breaths mostly through his mouth)
   .
   # Delirium:  Perhaps somewhat improved today.  Infectious work-up
   yesterday was not revealing.  ABG and chemistry indicative of chronic
   CO2 retention that is not a likely large contributor to current mental
   status, although this remains on the differential.  Also, he is again
   hypernatremic today, which may contribute.  Perhaps the largest
   contributor is likely ICU delirium related to recent prolonged
   intubation, etc.
   - optimize sleep/wake cycle hygiene
   - repeat ABG as above
   - correct hypernatremia, as below
   - would consider zyprexa if agitated
   .
   # Cellulitis/soft tissue infection:  Today is day 21 of vanc and
   zosyn.  MRI showed with improvement in soft tissue swelling.   After
   discussion with ID, 21 days should be a sufficient antibiotic course
   - discontinue vancomycin and zosyn today
   .
   # Anemia:  stable
   # Hypertension: Well controlled on labetolol to 60 IV Q6 on [**6-9**],
   amlodipine 10 mg and hydralazine 40 mg IV q6h.  At home he was on HCTZ
   and lisinopril in addition to amlodipine (no beta blocker per admission
   note).   Would prefer to convert all meds to PO at this point.
   - change hydralazine to PO (1:1 conversion per pharmacist)
   - stop labetalol
   - restart lisinopril at 5 mg (home dose is 10 mg but concern for renal
   function)
   - stop labetalol (will consider restarting PO if BP elevated on this
   new regimen)
   - continue amlodipine
   .
   # DM:  continue Lantus, HISS
   #.CRI: creatinine stable currently.
   - continue to monitor
   - gentle diuresis
   # hypernatremia:  free water deficit ~5 L, trying to increase free
   water by PO yesterday but he did not take in enough to correct Na
   - D5W at 125 cc/h for 1 L and re-check
   .
   # elevated Tbili:  resolved today

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired transfers, hypertension, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure (acute renal failure, ARF), type II diabetes mellitus, and a decubitus ulcer present at admission. The patient has been receiving various medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, furosemide, heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, and hydralazine. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/57 mmHg to 164/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient's weight has decreased from 115.1 kg to 106.7 kg since admission. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,238 mL (611 mL in the last 24 hours), output of 1,300 mL (810 mL in the last 24 hours), resulting in a deficit of 938 mL (-199 mL in the last 24 hours). The patient is on respiratory support with high flow nasal cannula and has an ABG result of ///31. Laboratory results show elevated white"
