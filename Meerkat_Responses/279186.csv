","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual with no acute distress. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/50-115/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90%. The patient is receiving dopamine infusion at a rate of 7 mcg/kg/min and has a history of cefazolin administration.

The patient has been monitored with hemodynamic and fluid balance measurements. Over the past 24 hours, the total intake of fluids has been 2900 mL, with an output of 1300 mL via blood products and 686 mL via urine. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a medium concentration mask, and the most recent ABG results indicate a pH level of 7.25.

Physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor, normocephaly, symmetric chest expansion, and crackles in the lungs. The patient is unable to stand, has trace edema in both extremities, and displays warm skin. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to time, and demonstrates purposeful movement with normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit (Hct) levels,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, sick sinus syndrome (SSS) post pacemaker placement, aortic stenosis post aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) post transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), and a recent total hip replacement (THR). The patient presented with hypotension after THR and is currently on dopamine to increase cardiac contractions. There are concerns about his systolic dysfunction and the need for central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring. The patient's post-operative course has been generally uneventful, but he required drainage pull today. He is experiencing pain, which is being managed with morphine PCA. The patient is also being restarted on coumadin and will resume ortho recs. His hypertension is currently well-controlled, and he is holding home lasix and terazosin. His AVR is doing well, and he is no longer anticoagulated. His atrial fibrillation is being monitored on telemetry, and he will have daily INRs. The patient's SSS s/p pacemaker placement is functioning well. He has a history of BPH and is currently holding terazosin. The patient is on a cardiac healthy diet (FEN). He has been given instructions for bowel preparation (PPx) and has a full code status. Communication with the patient and his sister has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 93-year-old female with a history of hypertension, aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and recent left total hip replacement (THR). She has been admitted to the ICU for persistent postoperative hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/57 to 115/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on medium concentration mask. The patient is dependent on a pacemaker for heart rate and has evidence of pulmonary edema. Laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, normal creatinine levels, and elevated cardiac enzymes. The patient's ejection fraction is impaired.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient continues to experience hypotension, which is likely due to a combination of hypovolemia and impaired cardiac output with chronotropic limitation. The goal is to stabilize the patient's blood pressure by weaning dopamine as possible today, administering IVF bolus as needed, and maintaining a jugular venous pressure (JVP) below 8 cm H2O to avoid pulmonary congestion.
2. S/P Total Hip Replacement: The patient will be moved to anticoagulation due to the recent hip replacement surgery and history of atrial fibrillation. This is important to prevent deep vein throm"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a medical history of hypertension (HTN), sick sinus syndrome (SSS) with a permanent pacemaker, aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AFib), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) status post transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), and femoral neck fracture (FEN) for which he underwent total hip replacement (THR). 

The patient presented with hypotension after THR and required fluid resuscitation and a decrease in dopamine dose. He also has significant cardiac insufficiency at baseline. The patient's pressure drops with the use of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), which may be the reason he is unable to wean off pressors. The plan is to switch to oral pain regimen today.

The patient is doing well post-THR, with pain well controlled. He is planned to switch to oral pain medication to enable weaning off pressors. 

The patient's hypertension medications, including lasix and terazosin, are being held until normotensive. He will continue taking ASA 81 mg qd.

The patient is doing well post-AVR with no active issues.

Anticoagulation is being restarted today due to atrial fibrillation, and the patient's INR will be monitored daily. Telemetry will also continue.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of multi lumen start on 08/28/2133 at 05:39 PM. The patient has no known drug allergies and received a dose of cefazolin on 08/28/2133 at 08:00 AM. The patient is currently receiving dopamine infusion at 6 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications. There have been no changes to the patient's medical and family history.

Vital signs as of 08/29/2133 at 07:54 AM show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), current temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate within normal range (70-71 bpm), blood pressure slightly low (94/48 mmHg), respiratory rate (20 insp/min) within normal range, oxygen saturation at 94% on nasal cannula, and heart rhythm is ventricular paced. Hemodynamic monitoring shows total in 3,342 mL, total out 1,610 mL, fluid balance +732 mL, and urine output 1,495 mL.

Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and an ABG result of 29. Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, movement, and tone.

Lab results show leukocyte count ranging from 6.2 to 10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin ranging from 20.8 to 30.4 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 105 to 158 K/uL, creatinine ranging from 0.8 to 0.9 mg/dL, troponin T ranging from 0.02 to 0.03 ng/mL, glucose ranging from 93 to 111 mg/dL, and other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status and disposition are also documented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low at 94/48 mmHg, indicating a potential risk of hypotension. Monitoring and appropriate interventions may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Fluid overload: The fluid balance (+732 mL) suggests fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent further fluid accumulation.
3. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and elevated troponin T levels may indicate an ongoing infection or myocardial injury. Further investigation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, symptomatic bradycardia post pacemaker placement, aortic valve replacement, and atrial fibrillation. He presented with hypotension after total hip replacement. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/48 to 123/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is on dopamine infusion at 6 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications. He has a central line, two peripheral lines, and is receiving IV fluids. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient presented with hypotension after total hip replacement. This condition is being managed with fluids and a decreased dose of dopamine. The patient's blood pressure drops with the use of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), which may be the reason he cannot wean off pressors. The plan is to switch to oral pain regimen today.
2. Cardiac insufficiency: The patient has significant cardiac insufficiency at baseline, which could contribute to his hypotension.
3. S/P THR: The patient is doing well post total hip replacement, with controlled pain. It is planned to switch to oral pain medication to enable weaning off pressors.
4. Hyp"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe systolic heart failure, supraventricular tachycardia (SSS) with a pacemaker, aortic valve replacement (AVR), and atrial fibrillation. He presents with hypotension after undergoing total hip replacement (THR). The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has low blood pressure (86/52 mmHg) and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9. His blood count shows a slight drop in hemoglobin from 30.4 to 26.3 g/dL. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including opioids for pain control, and is receiving dopamine as a pressor. His lab results show normal levels of white blood cells, platelets, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which can be attributed to his known systolic heart failure and previous experience of postoperative hypotension after surgery. It is important to monitor his vital signs closely and adjust medications accordingly.

2. Anemia: The decrease in hemoglobin level from 30.4 to 26.3 g/dL suggests the development of anemia. Further investigation is required to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and antico"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, sick sinus syndrome (SSS) with a pacemaker, aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) status post transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), and a recent total hip replacement (THR). He presented with hypotension after THR. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 86/52 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. He is receiving dopamine at 3 mcg/kg/min and has been responsive to fluids. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite fluid resuscitation and dopamine infusion. Close monitoring and further evaluation are needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
2. Pain Control: The patient's pain regimen has been increased, and there are concerns about weaning off pressors due to PCA causing hypotension. Switching to a PO pain regimen may help in weaning off pressors.
3. Cardiac Insufficiency: The patient has significant cardiac insufficiency at baseline, which can contribute to hypotension and fluid balance issues. Monitoring and optimizing cardiac function are important.
4. Anticoagulation: The patient's anticoagulation status is being closely monitored due to recent restart of Coumadin and subtherapeutic INR levels. Regular monitoring of INR and adjusting the dose of Coumadin will be necessary.
5. BPH: The patient's home medication of terazosin, which is used for BPH, needs to be held in the setting of hypotension.
6. Fluid Balance: Close monitoring of the patient's fluid balance is essential to avoid fluid overload, especially considering his cardiac insufficiency and recent surgery.
7. Infection Risk: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other infections due to prolonged ICU stay. Prophylactic measures such as stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis are in place."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and aortic valve replacement, who recently underwent left total hip replacement. He is currently in the ICU due to hypotension that has been intermittent despite fluid resuscitation. The patient's blood pressure has historically been sensitive to narcotics, which he uses for chronic arthritis pain. The pain medications will be adjusted to decrease the need for narcotics and try alternative options like Tylenol and Ultram.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation indicates a potential complication. It is important to closely monitor and manage his blood pressure to prevent further complications.

2. Dilutional anemia: The patient's decreased hematocrit (Hct) could be partly dilutional due to fluid administration. Close monitoring of the patient's blood parameters is necessary, and further transfusion of packed red blood cells may be required.

3. Subtherapeutic INR: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is still subtherapeutic, indicating that the anticoagulant medication, Coumadin, may need to be increased. This is important to prevent thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

4. Narcotic sensitivity: The patient's sensitivity to narcotics should be taken into consideration when managing his pain. Alternative pain management strategies should be implemented to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, severe systolic heart failure, successful aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation, and a pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome. He presented with hypotension after undergoing total hip replacement (THR). The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/55 to 138/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within the target range of 6-14 mmHg. Fluid balance is positive, with a total input of 1,626 mL and total output of 1,105 mL since 12 AM. The patient is receiving various medications, including enoxaparin (Lovenox), opioids for pain control, and increased Coumadin dosage to achieve a therapeutic INR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, which can be attributed to his known systolic heart failure and previous issues with blood pressure control after surgery. Close monitoring and appropriate management of fluid balance and pressor weaning are crucial.
2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level has dropped from 30% to 26%,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a medical history of hypertension, systolic heart failure, permanent pacemaker, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He presented with hypotension after undergoing total hip replacement surgery. The patient's blood pressure has been stable since being weaned off dopamine, and he has been started on standing Tylenol for pain control. His hemoglobin level has dropped from 30% to 26%. The patient's other systems remain unchanged from admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's history of systolic heart failure and previous episodes of low blood pressure after surgery increase the risk of hypotension. Close monitoring of pressures and ongoing management will be necessary to maintain stable blood pressure.
2. Anemia: The drop in hemoglobin level from 30% to 26% indicates a possible development of anemia. Further investigation and appropriate management should be considered to address this condition.
3. Anticoagulation: The patient's atrial fibrillation requires anticoagulation. However, the current INR level is subtherapeutic, indicating the need for adjustment in the Coumadin dosage to achieve therapeutic levels.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension should be managed by holding home medications and gradually reintroducing them if blood pressure remains within normal limits.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's imm"
