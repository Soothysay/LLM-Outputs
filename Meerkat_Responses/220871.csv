   62 y/o F with DM, diabetic glomerulosclerosis, nephrotic syndrome,
   chronic hepatitis B, HTN, and asthma presenting with fever, rigors,
   abdominal pain , SOB, gram negative bacteremia.
   .
   #. Fevers: Negative RUQ U/S. Positive U/A, GNR in blood, likely
   urosepsis.
   - Continue ceftriaxone
   - f/u urine cultures
   - f/u blood culture sensitivities
   .
   # SOB: Most likely asthma underlying and sepsis causing increased
   respiratory drive. Improved. No O2 requirement.
   - Standing nebs
   - Steroids if she starts wheezing
   .
   #Elevated Cardiac enzymes/ST depression on admission EKG: Resolved w/
   IVF and decreased rate. Likely demand ischemia, as ST depressions
   resolved w/ decreased rate.  Elevated CKs concerning for other muscle
   process.
   - Trend CK to peak
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr improved w/ IVF, at baseline
   - Continue holding ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 284**], consider restarting on floor.
   .
   # Diabetes: Follwed at [**Last Name (un) 294**].  Insulin recently changed to glargine
   [**Hospital1 **] for better control. Suboptimal control
   - Cont. home glargine 35 units [**Hospital1 **]
   - Humalog SS
   .
   # HTN: Patient's BP was elevated in ED and continues to be slightly
   elevated in ICU.  Likely in setting of acute illness/stress.  Given
   concern for sepsis holding BP meds while in ICU
   - Hold ACE and CCB
   - If BP stable in am will restart
   .
   # Hepatitis B: stable, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. HCC screening has been
   negative. Last Hep B VL was negative on [**10-14**]. Transaminases slightly
   above baseline, likely in setting of acute illness, but would consider
   muscle process if trend upward.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, diabetic glomerulosclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, chronic hepatitis B, hypertension, and asthma. She presented with fever, rigors, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and gram-negative bacteremia. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/51 mmHg to 149/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. 

On physical examination, she has slight right facial droop, trace edema in lower extremities bilaterally, and tender abdomen with positive bowel sounds. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose level of 315 mg/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, and elevated troponin-T level of 0.13. Other lab results include elevated CK and CKMB levels, as well as elevated LDH levels. 

The patient's assessment and plan include suspected urosepsis, asthma exacerbation, elevated cardiac enzymes with resolved ST depression on admission EKG, acute on chronic renal failure, poorly controlled diabetes, elevated blood pressure, stable hepatitis B, anemia, hypercholesterolemia, history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual right-sided hemiparesis, and ongoing fluid resuscitation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of asthma, development of respiratory failure, progression of renal failure, worsening of diabetes control, uncontrolled hypertension, potential hepatic decompensation, further decline in neurologic status, and risk of thromboembolic events."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with DM, diabetic glomerulosclerosis, nephrotic syndrome,
   chronic hepatitis B, HTN, and asthma presenting with fever, rigors,
   abdominal pain and SOB, found to have UTI and likely asthma
   exacerbation.
   .
   .
   #. Fevers: patient had significant fever to 105 by EMS associated with
   rigors.  Meets criteris for SIRS given fever, bandemia, tachycardia and
   tachypnea.  Lactate elevated to 3.2, now improved with IVF.  UA here
   grossly positive and pt. gives h/o UTI symptoms.  CXR negative for
   infiltrate.  CT abd. and RUQ US negative for abdominal source and
   therefore UTI most likely.  Rigors and high temp concerning for
   pyelo/urosepsis.  Patient has h/o recurrent UTIs in past, cultures has
   been polymicrobial including E. coli, Klebsiella and VRE.  Received
   vanc/zosyn in ED.  Cultures have been pan-[**Last Name (un) 206**]. in past aside from
   VRE.  Temp coming down after tylenol in ED.  Has been hemodynamically
   stable without hypotension.
   - Start ceftriaxone given h/o pan-[**Last Name (un) 206**]. e coli and klebs.
   - Follow up blood/urine culture from ED, narrow abx based on ID/[**Last Name (un) 206**].
   - FOllow fever curve, WBC
   - CIS
   - IVF to maintain MAP>65 and UOP >50cc/hr
   .
   # SOB: Came on acutely in setting of sepsis.  Had audible wheezing in
   the ED which is consistent with her diagnosis of asthma.  Likely had
   increased respiratory drive in setting of high fevers rather than
   primary asthma exacerbation.  CXR in ED did not show worsened pulmonary
   edema which was also thought to be possible in setting of HTN and IVF.
   Has no h/o CHF with normal EF on TTE in [**2113**], however does have
   cardiomegaly on CXR and mild pulmonary engorgement so may be a
   component of CHF which is new from TTE in [**2113**].  Received solumedrol
   and duonebs with rapid improvement in symptoms.  Currently resp. status
   is stable, tachypnea resolving with decreased temp.  Unlikely cardiac
   given no changes on EKG, however trop slightly elevated at 0.05.
   - Standing nebs
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Hold steroids given unlikely primary pulmonary cause for tachypnea,
   if rsp. status worsens or becomes more wheezy will consider pred.
   taper.
   - repeat CE in am
   - EKG in am
   - repeat TTE in am
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr elevated to 1.4 here. Baseline
   1.1.  Has h/o nephrotic syndrome.  Renal biopsy with Diabetic
   Glomerulosclerosis. Elevated Cr most likely pre-renal in setting of
   sepsis.
   - Cont. to follow after IVF hydration
   - if remains elevated will send urine lytes, renal US
   - Holding ACE and [**Last Name (un) 284**]
   - Holding lasix

   # Diabetes: Follwed at [**Last Name (un) 294**].  Insulin recently changed to glargine
   [**Hospital1 **] for better control.  Also changed to Humalog SS. Last A1c shows
   suboptimal control.   FS here elevated to 237, likely in setting of
   acute infection.
   - Cont. home glargine 35 units [**Hospital1 **]

   # HTN: Patient's BP was elevated in ED and continues to be slightly
   elevated in ICU.  Likely in setting of acute illness/stress.  Given
   concern for sepsis and possible hypotension will hold off on treating
   and see where BP goes.
   - Hold ACE and CCB
   - If BP stable in am will restart

   # Hepatitis B: stable, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. HCC screening has been

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 62-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, nephrotic syndrome, chronic hepatitis B, hypertension, and asthma.
- She presented with fever, rigors, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath (SOB) and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) and likely asthma exacerbation.
- The patient had significant fever to 105 degrees Fahrenheit associated with rigors, meeting criteria for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). Lactate levels were elevated but improved with intravenous fluids (IVF). Urinalysis was positive, and the patient had a history of UTI symptoms.
- A computed tomography (CT) abdomen and right upper quadrant ultrasound were negative for an abdominal source, supporting the diagnosis of a UTI. Cultures from previous UTIs were polymicrobial, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).
- The patient received vancomycin and zosyn in the emergency department and her temperature improved after administering Tylenol.
- She was started on ceftriaxone due to her history of pan-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella. Blood and urine cultures from the emergency department were sent for follow-up, and antibiotic therapy will be narrowed based on the results.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with respiratory distress. The patient is unable to provide history due to a language barrier. Allergies include a reaction to propranolol (In deral). The patient has been receiving antibiotics, specifically ceftriaxone, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

Review of systems reveals no constitutional symptoms, eye problems, ear, nose, and throat issues, cardiovascular complaints, nutritional support concerns, respiratory distress, gastrointestinal problems, genitourinary issues, musculoskeletal pain, or neurologic symptoms. There are no signs of abuse, and the patient appears comfortable without any reported pain. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.7 C (99.9 F), a heart rate of 92 bpm with normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 138/55 mmHg to 166/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient has received a total of 3,915 mL of fluids, with 600 mL given orally, 715 mL through intravenous fluids, and 935 mL as total output including urine, NG, and stool. 

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, normal pupils, normocephalic head, no cervical adenopathy, normal cardiovascular examination, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds with prolonged expiratory phase, soft and non-tender abdomen"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with respiratory distress. They have a history of allergies to Inderal (Propranolol Hcl) and worsening of rheumatoid arthritis. The patient is unable to provide their own history due to a language barrier. They have been admitted to the ICU and received treatment for sepsis, GNR bacteremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). Other conditions being monitored and managed include asthma exacerbation, tachycardia, hypertension, fluid hypovolemia, renal function, and chronic hepatitis B. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but they require ongoing medical support in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient already has sepsis and GNR bacteremia. It is crucial to continue monitoring and managing this condition to prevent further deterioration.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The UTI could potentially worsen or lead to kidney-related complications if not properly treated.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: The elevated CPK levels suggest possible cardiac ischemia. Close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to rule out any cardiac issues.
4. Asthma Exacerbation: The patient's asthma may worsen due to the stress of sepsis and other comorbidities. Optimal medication management is essential to prevent respiratory complications.
5. Hypertension: Although the patient's hypertension is currently stable, it should be monitored closely to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, diabetic glomerulosclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, chronic hepatitis B, hypertension, and asthma. She presented with fever, rigors, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and was found to have gram-negative bacteremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 154/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is currently afebrile and has shown improvement in her symptoms. 

The patient has been diagnosed with urosepsis and is being treated with ceftriaxone. Her respiratory issues are believed to be caused by asthma, which has been exacerbated by sepsis, but she no longer requires supplemental oxygen. 

There are concerns regarding elevated cardiac enzymes and ST depression on admission EKG, which resolved with intravenous fluids and decreased heart rate. This suggests demand ischemia. Elevated CK levels indicate a potential muscle process. 

The patient also has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with creatinine levels improving after intravenous fluids. She is receiving IVF boluses as needed and restarting ACE inhibitor therapy. 

Her diabetes is not well controlled, so the insulin dose has been increased. Blood pressure medications were temporarily stopped due to sepsis, but now need to be restarted."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, diabetic glomerulosclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, chronic hepatitis B, hypertension, and asthma. The patient presented with fever, rigors, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and was found to have gram-negative bacteremia. The initial assessment suggests urosepsis, likely due to a urinary tract infection.

The patient's respiratory status improved with nebulizers and steroids, indicating an underlying asthma exacerbation. The elevated cardiac enzymes and ST depression on admission EKG, which resolved with intravenous fluids and decreased heart rate, suggest demand ischemia. The patient's creatinine level improved with intravenous fluids, indicating acute-on-chronic renal failure. 

The patient's diabetes management involves continuous home glargine insulin and Humalog SS. Blood pressure medications are being held in the ICU due to elevated blood pressure readings, possibly due to acute illness or stress. The patient's hepatitis B is stable, with negative viral load and slightly elevated transaminases. 

Other assessments include monitoring hematocrit due to a drop to 32% after large volume fluid resuscitation, continuing statin therapy for hypercholesterolemia, monitoring serial neuro exams for unmasking of old deficits related to a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and considering a CT head if there are acute mental status changes or neuro exam changes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old overweight male with no acute distress. He has a history of chronic hepatitis B, asthma, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis. The patient was admitted to the ICU with sepsis due to GNR bacteremia, likely originating from a urinary tract infection. He is responding well to current therapy and his vital signs are stable. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated CPK levels, which may suggest cardiac ischemia, but his ECG has improved. Further assessment of chamber size and valve function is recommended. The patient's tachycardia and hypertension have resolved. Fluid resuscitation has improved his hypovolemia, oliguria, and renal function. Nutritional support is encouraged through oral intake. The patient's chronic hepatitis B is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac ischemia: Elevated CPK levels may indicate cardiac ischemia, which needs to be further evaluated and managed promptly.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's bacteremia is likely due to a urinary source. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antimicrobial therapy are necessary to prevent the progression of the infection.
3. Endocarditis or endovascular infection: Although the assessment suggests doubt regarding endocarditis or endovascular infection, ongoing monitoring and evaluation are required to rule out any complications.
4. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's asthma has improved, but close monitoring and optimization of medications are essential to prevent future exacerbations"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis and GNR bacteremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 178/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and other medications as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of sepsis and GNR bacteremia requires close monitoring and management. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The presence of high-grade GNR bacteremia suggests a possible urinary source. Monitoring for signs of UTI progression and ensuring appropriate antibiotic coverage is essential.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: The elevated CPK level raises suspicion for cardiac ischemia, potentially secondary to demand ischemia. Further evaluation with cardiac enzymes, ECG, and echocardiography is necessary to assess for myocardial injury or NSTEMI.
4. Asthma Exacerbation: The patient experienced an asthma exacerbation during the course of sepsis. Optimization of asthma medications should continue to prevent further exacerbations.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite holding antihypertensive medications. Monitoring blood"
