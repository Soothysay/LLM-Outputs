   81 year-old man with CAD s/p CABG, recent hospitalization for elective
   hip repair complicated by post-operative cardiogenic shock & PEA
   arrest, who presents from rehab with cardiogenic/septic shock.  Now,
   improving & off of pressors.
   # Shock:  Resolved.  Pt off of pressors since yesterday.  Suspect
   primary cause was sepsis due to UTI +/- PNA +/- cdiff.  WBC coming down
   & pt afebrile.  Also, evidence of cardiogenic component to shock w/ low
   SvO2.  However, echo w/o evidence of acute MI &  EF stable.   CE w/o

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and subsequently had a hip repair. He presented to the ICU with cardiogenic/septic shock but is now improving and off of pressors. The patient has multifocal pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions, as seen on a CT scan. His WBC count is elevated, indicating an infection. He also has anemia with a low hemoglobin level. The patient's B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is significantly elevated, suggesting volume overload and acute on chronic systolic heart failure. His weight has increased by approximately 20-30 pounds since his hip repair, and he has gross leg edema up to his flanks. The patient's creatinine levels are stable, indicating no significant kidney dysfunction. The central venous catheter tip is located in the superior vena cava (SVC). The patient's blood cultures and urine cultures are pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to primary cause of sepsis, which could be secondary to urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, or Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.
2. Volume overload and acute on chronic systolic heart failure, as indicated by gross edema, weight gain, pulmonary edema, and elevated BNP levels.
3. Anemia, with a low hemoglobin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and elective hip repair. He presented to the ICU with cardiogenic and septic shock but is now improving and off of pressors. The patient's main issues include resolved shock, volume overload with acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure, anemia, and chronic renal failure.

The patient's weight has increased by approximately 20-30 lbs since his right hip repair. The baseline weight is around 175 lbs, and he has been in the 200s since his recent hospitalization. His B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated at 35,000. Suspected volume overload since last hospitalization. The plan is to diuresse today with a goal of input/output (-) 1-2 L, monitor weights/input/output, and continue cardiac diet.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male admitted to the ICU with multifocal pneumonia, resulting in respiratory failure. He has been receiving antibiotics and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/46 to 122/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm with a central venous pressure of 19 mmHg. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a cardiac output of 5 L/min and a mixed venous oxygen saturation of 53%. The patient has received a total of 2,035 mL of fluids, with an output of 1,075 mL of urine. He is receiving supplemental oxygen and has an arterial blood gas showing pH 7.36, PaCO2 42 mmHg, PaO2 36 mmHg, and HCO3- 21 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals that peripheral pulses are not assessed, skin is not assessed, and neurologic status is not assessed. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 42.2 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 25.3%, decreased platelet count (Plt) at 193 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) at 1.8 mg/dL, elevated lactate at 1.1 mmol/L, and elevated troponin-T at 0.09 ng/mL. Imaging shows patchy consolidation in bilateral lungs consistent with multifocal pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions, and a central venous catheter tip in the superior vena cava. Microbiology results for blood and urine cultures are pending.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Respiratory failure due to worsening pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Sepsis or septic shock due to the presence of multifocal pneumonia and elevated WBC count.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to decreased urine output, elevated lactate, and elevated creatinine levels.
4. Thromboembolic events such as DVT or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and central venous catheter placement.
5. Infection-related complications such as VAP or catheter-related bloodstream infection.
6. Cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
7. Poor glycemic control due to stress and ICU stay.
8. Malnutrition due"

   # Shock:  Resolved.  Pt off of pressor.  Suspect primary cause was
   sepsis w/ some cardiogenic component based on low SvO2.  Sepsis source
   likely urinary + pulm
pt w/ e/o multifocal PNA on CT as well as + UA.
   Cdiff negative thus far.  Regarding cardiogenic component
echo w/o
   evidence of acute MI.  EF stable.
   - Con't ceftaz/linezolid/flagyl for broad coverage
   - F/u bld & urine cx
   - Appreciate ortho team input to let them know pt admitted & febrile
   (wound looks clean)
   .
   # <b>Hypotension</b>: Pt & family report baseline BP in 90s-100s.
   However, pt's BP into the 80s in ED.  Pt asx w/ this, mentating clearly
   & making some urine.  Suspect drop in BP may be related to sepsis.
   However, cardiogenic shock also possible.  Trop is elevated at 0.11
   (last level was from [**9-3**] & was ~6.0).  CK nml.  EKG w/ some mild
   changes in lateral precordial leads, though no evolution.   No clear
   trigger/cause for neurogenic shock or adrenal insufficiency.
   - Bolus 500cc & try weaning levophed
   - Repeat CE
   - Echo
   - hold bp meds
   .
   # <b>Volume Overload</b>: Pt grossly overloaded--e/o pl effusions, some
   pulm edema, gross LE edema.  Pt's wt reportedly up over last few wks
   per his report--baseline wt ~175; was low 200s prior to admission.
   - check albumin
   - check BNP
   - monitor weights/I&O
   - consider diuresis once BP stabilized
   .
   # <b>Anemia</b>: baseline hct varies, though predominantly in 30s.
   Last hct was mid-20s.  Currently 27.
   - monitor; transfuse if e/o end-organ damage or hct dropping
   precipitously

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and was hospitalized for elective hip repair. He presents with fever and hypotension, and has been diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) and multifocal pneumonia (PNA). The patient was in cardiogenic shock post-operatively and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), blood pressure ranging from 110/46 to 122/89 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is 53%. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 42.2 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated lactate levels. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and continues to be monitored for sepsis. 

Imaging reveals areas of patchy consolidation in bilateral lungs consistent with multifocal pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions. There is no evidence of abscess or colitis. 

The patient's plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, monitoring blood and urine cultures, and evaluating for potential complications such as shock, hypotension, volume overload, anemia, chronic renal failure,"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year-old man with CAD s/p CABG, recent hospitalization for elective
   hip repair complicated by post-operative cardiogenic shock & PEA
   arrest, who presents from rehab with cardiogenic/septic shock.  Now,
   improving off of pressors.
   # Shock:  Resolved.  Pt off of pressors since yesterday.  Suspect
   primary cause was sepsis due to UTI +/- PNA +/- cdiff.  WBC coming down
   & pt afebrile.  Also, evidence of shock having cardiogenic component w/
   low SvO2.  Echo w/o evidence of acute MI &  EF stable.   CE w/o e/o
   infarction
   - Con't ceftaz/linezolid/flagyl for broad coverage
   - F/u bld & urine cx
   - hold BP meds for now
   # <b>Volume Overload/Acute Systolic Heart Failure</b>: Pt grossly
   overloaded--e/o pl effusions, pulm edema, gross LE edema.   Weight is
   up approximately 30lb per since he had his R hip repair at the end of
   Pt's wt reportedly up over last few wks per his report--baseline wt
   ~175; was low 200s prior to admission.
   - check albumin

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and had a recent hospitalization for elective hip repair. He presented with cardiogenic/septic shock but is now improving off of pressors. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Volume Overload/Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient appears to be volume overloaded, as evidenced by the presence of pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and gross lower extremity edema. The patient's weight has also increased by approximately 30 lbs since his right hip repair. 

2. Anemia: The patient's baseline hematocrit (Hct) varies, predominantly in the 30s. His last Hct was in the mid-20s, and currently it is 27. Monitoring the patient's Hct levels and transfusing if there is evidence of end-organ damage or a rapid drop in Hct is recommended.

3. Chronic Renal Failure (CRF): The patient's renal function appears to be stable, as indicated by the monitoring of creatinine levels. Continued monitoring of creatinine levels is advised.

4. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive total input-output balance of 960 mL, indicating fluid overload. Monitoring the patient's fluid status and considering diuresis once blood pressure is stabilized may be necessary.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient presented with shock, and the medical team suspects a mixed picture with a likely septic component. The patient has fevers, profound leukocytosis, and positive tests for urine pneumonia and Clostridium difficile.
- The patient was able to wean off the pressors and now shows more of a cardiogenic component of shock. Blood pressure is stable, and the patient is volume overloaded, so Lasix will be given to promote diuresis.
- The patient has a history of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
- Antibiotics will be continued for at least 24 hours to address the potential septic source, which is likely to be urinary tract-related.
- The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), but their urine output has improved with the use of Lasix, and creatinine levels remain stable.
- The patient received a blood transfusion, which stabilized their anemia.
- The patient is receiving nutrition through a Doctor-ordered diet and is being monitored for glycemic control using sliding scale insulin (SSRI).
- The patient has multiple lines inserted, including a multi-lumen line and a 20-gauge line.
- Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Shock: mixed picture with likely septic component with fevers,
   profound leukocytosis - sources urine, PNA, c diff.
 though all
   cultire data is neg to date.  ScVo2 is 53%. Able to wean the pressors
   off and now left with more of a cardiogenic component. Since BP are OK
   and he is volume overloaded- woud push lasix
 goal 1-2L. Follow SCvo2
   and MAPs
   In terms of septic source
 likely urine but also hx of VRE and
   following cx. Continue Zosyn and Ceftaz for at least 48  hrs until cx
   negative.
   2. ARF: good urine output with lasix and Cr was stable and at baseline.
   Will need to watch with more lasix.
   3. Anemia : stable after transfusion

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of shock. The patient's condition is being closely monitored with various assessments and treatments.

The patient has received a transfusion of packed red blood cells (UPRBC) due to anemia and low mixed venous oxygen saturation. They have also been given Lasix to promote urine output but are still experiencing tachypnea and dyspnea. A contrast torso scan revealed multifocal pneumonia without abscess. The patient does not have any known drug allergies.

The patient has been on antibiotics, specifically daptomycin and ceftazidime, with the last doses administered on 09/21/2144 at 12:30 PM and 10:00 PM respectively. They are currently receiving infusions of furosemide (Lasix) and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), a heart rate of 81 bpm with a range of 62-91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/56 mmHg to 135/67 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute with a range of 20-37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

","The patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for shock. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. The patient's vital signs are currently stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/56 to 135/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula, and temperature of 35.8 degrees Celsius.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of multifocal pneumonia without abscess seen on a recent PO contrast torso imaging study. The patient has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells due to anemia and low mixed venous oxygen saturation. Lasix was administered to promote diuresis and good urine output. The patient has also received daptomycin and ceftazidime for antibiotic coverage.

The patient's laboratory values show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 42.2 thousand cells/microliter, an elevated hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, low albumin level, and elevated troponin T level indicating possible myocardial injury.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year-old man with CAD s/p CABG, recent hospitalization for elective
   hip repair complicated by post-operative cardiogenic shock & PEA
   arrest, who presents from rehab with cardiogenic/septic shock.  Now,
   improving & >24hr off of pressors.
   # Volume Overload/Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Pt grossly
   overloaded--e/o pl effusions, pulm edema, gross LE edema up to
   flanks.   Weight is up approximately 20-30lb per since he had his R hip
   repair at the end of [**Month (only) 591**].  Pt's wt reportedly up over last few wks per
   his report--baseline wt ~175; since recent hospitalization has been in
   200s.  BNP 35,000.  Suspect he has been overloaded since last
   hospitalization.  CXR w/ e/o pulm edema prior to discharge.
   - Diurese today w/ goal I/O (-) 1-2L
   - monitor weights/I&O
   # Shock:  Resolved.  Pt off of pressors since yesterday.  Suspect
   primary cause was sepsis due to UTI +/- PNA +/- cdiff.  WBC coming down
   & pt afebrile.  Also, evidence of cardiogenic component to shock w/ low
   SvO2.  However, echo w/o evidence of acute MI &  EF stable.   CE w/o
   e/o infarction
   - Con't ceftaz/linezolid/flagyl for broad coverage, since no + cx data
   - F/u bld & urine cx
   - hold BP meds for now as diuresing
   # Hematuria: was due to foley trauma.
   -          keep foley in while diuresing aggressively
   -          consider urology consult once foley removed (before
   discharge), if pt unable to void appropriately
   # Anemia: baseline hct varies, though predominantly in 30s.  Last hct
   was mid-20s.  Currently ~27.
   - monitor; transfuse if e/o end-organ damage or hct dropping
   precipitously
   # CRF: stable.  Con't to monitor crt & dose meds renally
   # s/p R hip replacement: appears to be healing well.  Staples removed
   yesterday.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease and previous cardiac surgery who presented with cardiogenic/septic shock. He has been in the ICU for over 24 hours, off of pressors, and is showing improvement. The patient has signs of volume overload, including pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and gross lower extremity edema. His weight has increased by approximately 20-30lbs since his right hip repair surgery. The patient's baseline weight is around 175lbs, and he has been in the 200s since his recent hospitalization. The B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated at 35,000, indicating potential chronic systolic heart failure. The patient is diuresed today with the goal of negative intake/output balance of 1-2 liters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload/Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's symptoms of volume overload, including pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and gross lower extremity edema, suggest a possible exacerbation of his chronic systolic heart failure. The elevated BNP level further supports this assessment. Continued monitoring and aggressive diuresis are necessary to manage this condition.

2. Shock: The patient previously experienced cardiogenic/septic shock, which has now resolved. However, there may still be a risk of recurrence due to his underlying cardiac condition and recent infection. Close monitoring of"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year-old man with CAD s/p CABG, recent hospitalization for elective
   hip repair complicated by post-operative cardiogenic shock & PEA
   arrest, who presents from rehab with septic/cardiogenic shock in
   setting of Ecoli bacteremia.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Pt grossly overloaded--e/o
   pl effusions, pulm edema, gross LE edema up to flanks, which was
   present prior to admission & volume resuscitation.  Weight is up
   approximately 20-30lb since he had his R hip repair at the end of [**Month (only) 591**]
   (his pre-op weight was 175lb and wt on admission to MICU 198lb).  BNP
   35,000.  Suspect he has been overloaded since last hospitalization.  EF
   stable at 45-50% w/ mild global LV hypokinesis.  No e/o acute MI.
   - Diurese today w/ goal I/O (-) 1-2L/day (would aim to diurese ~20lb,
   approaching dry weight)
   - monitor weights/I&O
   - Con't hold BB & lisinopril for now given hypotension on admission &
   aggressive nature of diuresis; add back as tolerated
   - Low Na diet
   .
   # Shock:  Resolved.  Pt off of pressors >48hr.  Suspect primary cause
   was sepsis due to Ecoli bacteremia.  WBC coming down & pt afebrile on
   abx.  Suspect Also, evidence of cardiogenic component to shock w/ low
   SvO2.  However, echo w/o evidence of acute MI &  EF stable.
   - Con't ceftazidime for Ecoli tx, until sensitivities back (call [**Hospital 4519**] Hospital at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4520**] for bld cx results).  Will d/c dapto &
   flagyl.
   - F/u bld & urine cx
   - hold BP meds for now as diuresing
   # Hematuria: Transient. Due to foley trauma prior to presentation.
   Foley changed at OSH ED.
   - keep foley in while diuresing aggressively
   - consider urology consult once foley removed before discharge, if pt
   unable to void appropriately. (Of note, pt had foley dc'd on day of
   discharge on recent hospital stay, and could not void normally once he
   got to rehab, so foley had to be replaced.)
   # Anemia: baseline hct varies, though predominantly in 30s.  Last hct
   was mid-20s.  Currently ~27.
   - monitor; transfuse if e/o end-organ damage or hct dropping
   precipitously
   # CRF: Baseline ~1.4-1.6.  Stable.  Con't to monitor crt & dose meds
   renally.
   # s/p R hip replacement: appears to be healing well.  Staples removed.
   - PT consult
   - Con't DVT ppx w/ coumadin for 4.5wk s/p surgery (end date [**2144-11-3**] per
   ortho; however, this is longer than 4.5wk--need to clarify)
   - appreciate Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4453**]/ortho team recs
   # Acccess: PIV; RIJ removed

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and elective hip repair. He presented to the hospital with septic/cardiogenic shock in the setting of E. coli bacteremia.

The patient's current medical conditions include acute on chronic systolic heart failure, with evidence of volume overload as indicated by pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and gross lower extremity edema. His B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated at 35,000, suggesting chronic fluid overload. The goal is to diurese the patient to achieve a dry weight by monitoring weights and intake/output (I/O).

The patient also experienced shock, which has since resolved. He was on pressors for more than 48 hours, and the primary cause is suspected to be sepsis due to E. coli bacteremia. The patient is currently afebrile on antibiotics, and his white blood cell count is coming down. There is also evidence of a cardiogenic component to the shock, as indicated by low systemic vascular oxygen (SvO2) saturation. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of acute myocardial infarction, and the ejection fraction (EF) remains stable at 45-50%.

The patient has been diagnosed with transient hematuria, which was likely caused by Foley catheter trauma. The Foley catheter should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who presented to the ICU with hypotension. The patient has been receiving treatment for shock, decompensated heart failure, presumed sepsis, acute renal failure, and anemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/74 to 92/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on a lasix drip, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications. Blood cultures were positive for E. coli, indicating a possible septic source. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal creatinine levels. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient initially presented with signs of cardiogenic shock, which is a potential complication of decompensated heart failure.
2. Septic shock: The patient's blood cultures were positive for E. coli, suggesting a possible septic source. This could lead to septic shock if not promptly treated.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate possible acute renal failure, which can be a complication of sepsis or cardiogenic shock.
4. Deep vein thrombosis: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with hypotension, initially presenting with a mixed picture of septic and cardiogenic shock. The patient has been hemodynamically stable but now shows signs of decompensated heart failure. Blood cultures revealed E. coli, indicating presumed sepsis. The patient's renal function is stable, but close monitoring is required. The patient has been transfused and is anticoagulated as per orthopedic surgeon's wishes. Other issues remain unchanged from previous notes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's current decompensated heart failure status needs close monitoring, as the condition can worsen and lead to further fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently stable, there is still a risk of sepsis due to the presence of E. coli in the blood cultures. Monitoring for any signs of infection or systemic inflammatory response is essential.
3. Acute kidney injury: While the patient's current renal function is stable, continued use of lasix and close monitoring of creatinine levels is necessary to prevent acute kidney injury.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy increases the risk of bleeding, particularly given the recent surgery. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters and vigilance for signs of bleeding are necessary."
