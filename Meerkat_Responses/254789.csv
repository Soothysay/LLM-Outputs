   witnessed seizure, and hypernatremia
   .
   Plan:
   # fevers/elevated WBC: CXR clear. Urine clear except for high glucose.
   Abd soft, nontender. Seizures raise suspicion for CNS infection,
   although no signs of meningismus on exam.
   - f/u bld, urine cultures
   - will need LP; empirically treat for meningitis with CTX 2gm daily,
   vanc 1gm q24 (renally adjusted dose), ampicillin 2gm Q6h to cover
   Listeria, and acyclovir 10mg/kg q12h empirically
   .
   # hyperglycemia: markedly elevated glucose in a patient with no known
   history of diabetes and active infection as evidenced by fever, WBC.
   Anion gap 18 (not correcting for glc) with bicarb 20, but no ketones in
   urine, so more c/w HHS than with DKA.
   - check plasma acetone
   - insulin gtt
   - Q1h fingersticks
   - add D5 to fluids once blood sugar less than 250
   .
   # hypernatremia: Na 158 on chem7, but after correcting for Glc 774, Na
   is 169. Has received 3L NS (hypotonic relative to pt), will recheck
   labs and likely change to 1/2NS for IVF for both free water repletion
   and volume expansion.
   .
   # acute renal failure: unknown baseline, but elevated at 2.1. Likely
   prerenal. Check urine lytes. Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   .
   # HTN: currently normotensive, dry, and infected, so will hold
   antihypertensives
   .
   # EKG changes: pt does have multiple cardiac risk factors, although
   nonspecific distribution of ST depressions more consistent with demand
   than plaque rupture physiology. Check cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # seizure do: has history of seizures and today had seizure in setting
   of fever and dilantin level of 3.8; not clear when last seizure was.
   With fevers and leukocytosis, will pursue LP as above. Reload with
   500mg dilantin IV and increase maintenance dose to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] from 25mg

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of CVA, HTN, PEG, who presents with hypernatremia, hyperglycemia/HHS, fevers with seizures, and acute renal failure. The patient has been unable to provide a history due to encephalopathy. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but they show sinus tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an ABG showing a respiratory acidosis. Physical examination reveals poor dentition, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and soft non-tender abdomen. Neurological examination shows no response to stimuli, absent peripheral pulses, and unassessed skin. Laboratory results indicate elevated sodium, potassium, glucose levels, and leukocyte count. The patient has been started on various medications including insulin, dilantin, heparin sodium, and ampicillin. The plan includes further evaluation of the patient's condition, treatment for suspected infections, management of hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms of fever, elevated white blood cell count, and witnessed seizure raise suspicion for central nervous system infection such as meningitis. The patient will need a lumbar puncture and empiric treatment for meningitis.
2. Hyperglycemia/Hypersolcemia (HHS): The patient's markedly elevated glucose level indicates hyperglycemia/HHS. Close monitoring of blood sugar levels and insulin therapy is required.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, indicating hypernatremia. Fluid management with careful correction is necessary to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests acute renal failure. Renal function should be monitored, and medications should be adjusted based on renal function.
5. Seizure Disorder: The patient's history of seizures and recent seizure activity necessitate ongoing management with antiepileptic drugs like dilantin.
6. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest an underlying infection. Cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly.
7. Cardiac Risk Factors: The patient's history of CVA, HTN, and EKG changes indicate potential cardiac risk factors. Cardiac enzymes should be checked, and cardiac support may be required.

Please note that the above summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and testing may be necessary to confirm these findings."

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of CVA, HTN, and PEG. He presents with hypernatremia, hyperglycemia/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), fevers with seizures, and acute renal failure. The patient's potassium levels remain low at 2.9 meq/L and need to be repleted with potassium through the PEG tube. Sodium and creatinine levels have improved with intravenous fluids. Due to encephalopathy, the patient is unable to provide a medical history. There are no known drug allergies. The patient has been receiving antibiotics (ceftriaxone and ampicillin), insulin, heparin sodium, and dilantin.

24-hour events include low potassium levels, which were addressed by adding potassium to the IV fluids. Sodium and creatinine levels have also improved with IV fluids. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 121/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on insulin, heparin, and phenytoin.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 16 mL and total output of 4,545 mL since 12 AM. The patient's urine output is 125 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an"

   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o R sided strokes, seizure disorder, dementia, now with new
   onset diabetes and hyperglycemia/HHS, fevers, elevated WBC, and
   witnessed seizure, and hypernatremia
   .
   Plan:
   # fevers/elevated WBC: CXR clear. Urine clear except for high glucose.
   Abd soft, nontender. Seizures raise suspicion for CNS infection,
   although no signs of meningismus on exam.
   - f/u bld, urine cultures
   - will need LP; empirically treat for meningitis with CTX 2gm daily,
   vanc 1gm q24 (renally adjusted dose), ampicillin 2gm Q6h to cover
   Listeria, and acyclovir 10mg/kg q12h empirically
   .
   # hyperglycemia: markedly elevated glucose in a patient with no known
   history of diabetes and active infection as evidenced by fever, WBC.
   Anion gap 18 (not correcting for glc) with bicarb 20, but no ketones in
   urine, so more c/w HHS than with DKA.
   - check plasma acetone
   - insulin gtt
   - Q1h fingersticks
   - add D5 to fluids once blood sugar less than 250
   .
   # hypernatremia: Na 158 on chem7, but after correcting for Glc 774, Na
   is 169. Has received 3L NS (hypotonic relative to pt), will recheck
   labs and likely change to 1/2NS for IVF for both free water repletion
   and volume expansion.
   .
   # acute renal failure: unknown baseline, but elevated at 2.1. Likely
   prerenal. Check urine lytes. Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   .
   # HTN: currently normotensive, dry, and infected, so will hold
   antihypertensives
   .
   # EKG changes: pt does have multiple cardiac risk factors, although
   nonspecific distribution of ST depressions more consistent with demand
   than plaque rupture physiology. Check cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # seizure do: has history of seizures and today had seizure in setting
   of fever and dilantin level of 3.8; not clear when last seizure was.
   With fevers and leukocytosis, will pursue LP as above. Reload with
   500mg dilantin IV and increase maintenance dose to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] from 25mg
   [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # FEN: has PEG, nutrition c/s for TF recommendations
   - replete K aggressively
   .
   # Access: PIV; for insulin, abx, will need at least a second PIV; may
   need PICC in am

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). He presents with hypernatremia, hyperglycemia/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), fevers with seizures, and acute renal failure. The patient's potassium levels are low, and he requires insulin for hyperglycemia. He also has elevated white blood cell count, indicating possible infection. The patient's sodium levels are high, and he requires fluid replacement. He is currently on various medications including heparin, dilantin, and phenytoin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are significantly elevated, which can lead to severe dehydration and neurological complications.
2. Hyperglycemia/HHS: The patient's high blood glucose levels put him at risk for further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or worsening of his current condition.
3. Fevers with seizures: The presence of fever and seizures raises suspicion for central nervous system (CNS) infection, potentially meningitis. The patient requires further investigation and treatment for this condition.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidney function is impaired, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and the accumulation of waste products in the body.
5. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing"

   73M with h/o R sided strokes, seizure disorder, dementia, now with new
   onset diabetes and hyperglycemia/HHS, fevers, elevated WBC, and
   witnessed seizure, and hypernatremia
   .
   Plan:
   # fevers/elevated WBC: CXR clear. Urine clear except for high glucose.
   Abd soft, nontender. Seizures raise suspicion for CNS infection,
   although no signs of meningismus on exam. No signs of RUQ
   pathology/cholecystitis on LFTs.
   - f/u bld, urine cultures
   - will need LP; empirically treat for meningitis with CTX 2gm daily,
   vanc 1gm q24 (renally adjusted dose), ampicillin 2gm Q6h to cover
   Listeria, and acyclovir 10mg/kg q12h empirically
   - check C. diff
   - repeat CXR.
   .
   # hyperglycemia: Likely HHS (no ketones in urine, so unlikely DKA).
   Stimulant likely infectious process. Total Free water deficit 8.7 L.
   Would like to decrease Na by 12 mEq over 24 hours (0.5 mEq/hr), so
   amount of free water needed to correct this is 3.2 L.
   - continue insulin gtt ([**Month (only) 453**] to 5 U/hr)
   - Q1h fingersticks
   - change fluids to 40 meq K  D5
 NS @ 250 ccs/hr
   - free H2O boluses at 150 q4H through PEG
   .
   # hypernatremia: Na 158 on chem7, but after correcting for Glc 774, Na
   is 169. Changed IVFs from NS in ED to 1/2NS for IVF for both free water
   repletion and volume expansion.  Likely chronic process.
   .
   # acute renal failure: unknown baseline, but elevated at 2.1. Likely
   prerenal. Check urine lytes. Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   Check renal U/S if does not resolve.
   .
   # HTN: currently normotensive, dry, and infected, so will hold
   antihypertensives
   .
   # EKG changes: pt does have multiple cardiac risk factors, although
   nonspecific distribution of ST depressions more consistent with demand
   than plaque rupture physiology. Check cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # seizure do: has history of seizures and today had seizure in setting
   of fever and dilantin level of 3.8; not clear when last seizure was.
   With fevers and leukocytosis, will pursue LP as above. Reloaded with
   500mg dilantin IV and increase maintenance dose to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] from 25mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Re-Check dilantin level in PM prior to PM dose.
   .
   # FEN: has PEG, nutrition c/s for TF recommendations
   - replete K aggressively
   .
   # Access: PIV; for insulin, abx, will need at least a second PIV; may
   need PICC in am

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of right-sided strokes, seizure disorder, dementia, new onset diabetes, hyperglycemia/HHS, fevers, elevated WBC, and witnessed seizure.
- The patient is currently unresponsive and has been admitted to the ICU.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99%), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 123/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.
- The patient's physical examination reveals surgical pupils, poor dentition, symmetric breath sounds with crackles, warm skin without rash or jaundice, and no cyanosis.
- Laboratory results show elevated sodium levels, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated blood glucose levels.
- The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, seizure without status epilepticus, electrolyte and fluid disorder, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), CVA (stroke), tachycardia, and fever of unknown origin.
- The plan includes further evaluation of the patient's condition, including cultures, imaging studies, and treatment for suspected infections such as meningitis and sepsis.
- The patient's hyperglycemia is likely due to HHS rather than DKA, and insulin therapy is being continued.
- The patient's hypernatremia is being corrected with free water administration"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of right-sided strokes, seizure disorder, dementia, and new-onset diabetes with hyperglycemia/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). He presented with fever, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), witnessed seizure, and hypernatremia. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, seizure disorder, electrolyte and fluid disorder, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), stroke, tachycardia, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). 

Plan:
1. Fever and elevated WBC: CXR clear. Urine clear except for high glucose. No signs of meningismus on exam. No signs of RUQ pathology/cholecystitis on LFTs. WBC trending down today. Follow up with blood and urine cultures. Continue empirical treatment for meningitis with ceftriaxone 2gm daily for 14 days. Check C. diff.
2. HHS: Likely HHS (no ketones in urine, so unlikely DKA). Stimulant likely infectious process. Hyperglycemia now resolved. Sodium coming down appropriately (goal is decr 12 mEq/24 hours). Discontinue insulin gtt, IVF. Continue TF and 250cc free water flushes Q6 hours. Initiate Lantus 5u plus HISS.
3. Acute renal failure: Creatinine from 1.8 on arrival to ICU to 0.7 now. Likely was pre-renal. Renally dose medications, avoid nephrotoxins.
4. HTN: Currently normotensive, dry, and infected, so will hold antihypertensives.
5. Seizure disorder: History of seizures and on admission had seizure in setting of fever and dilantin level of 3.8; not clear when last seizure was. Still unsure if meningitis was present but without LP cannot know this. Reloaded with 500mg dilantin IV x2 and am level today after second dose supratherapeutic at 28. Recheck dilantin level in am and start daily dose. Check EEG.
6. Constipation: Patient without bowel movement since admission and evidence of stool-filled colon on CXR. Ordered lactulose today for constipation.

   73M with h/o R sided strokes, seizure disorder, dementia, now with new
   onset diabetes and hyperglycemia/HHS, fevers, elevated WBC, and
   witnessed seizure, and hypernatremia
   .
   Plan:
   # fevers/elevated WBC: CXR clear. Urine clear except for high glucose.
   Abd soft, nontender. Seizures raise suspicion for CNS infection,
   although no signs of meningismus on exam. No signs of RUQ
   pathology/cholecystitis on LFTs.
   - f/u bld, urine cultures
   - will need LP; empirically treat for meningitis with CTX 2gm daily,
   vanc 1gm q24 (renally adjusted dose), ampicillin 2gm Q6h to cover
   Listeria, and acyclovir 10mg/kg q12h empirically
   - check C. diff
   - repeat CXR.
   .
   # hyperglycemia: Likely HHS (no ketones in urine, so unlikely DKA).
   Stimulant likely infectious process. Total Free water deficit 8.7 L.
   Would like to decrease Na by 12 mEq over 24 hours (0.5 mEq/hr), so
   amount of free water needed to correct this is 3.2 L.
   - continue insulin gtt ([**Month (only) 453**] to 5 U/hr)
   - Q1h fingersticks
   - change fluids to 40 meq K  D5
 NS @ 250 ccs/hr
   - free H2O boluses at 150 q4H through PEG
   .
   # hypernatremia: Na 158 on chem7, but after correcting for Glc 774, Na
   is 169. Changed IVFs from NS in ED to 1/2NS for IVF for both free water
   repletion and volume expansion.  Likely chronic process.
   .
   # acute renal failure: unknown baseline, but elevated at 2.1. Likely
   prerenal. Check urine lytes. Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   Check renal U/S if does not resolve.
   .
   # HTN: currently normotensive, dry, and infected, so will hold
   antihypertensives
   .
   # EKG changes: pt does have multiple cardiac risk factors, although
   nonspecific distribution of ST depressions more consistent with demand
   than plaque rupture physiology. Check cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # seizure do: has history of seizures and today had seizure in setting
   of fever and dilantin level of 3.8; not clear when last seizure was.
   With fevers and leukocytosis, will pursue LP as above. Reloaded with
   500mg dilantin IV and increase maintenance dose to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] from 25mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Re-Check dilantin level in PM prior to PM dose.
   .
   # FEN: has PEG, nutrition c/s for TF recommendations
   - replete K aggressively
   .
   # Access: PIV; for insulin, abx, will need at least a second PIV; may
   need PICC in am

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of right-sided strokes, seizure disorder, dementia, new onset diabetes, and hyperglycemia/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), fevers, elevated white blood cell count, and witnessed seizure. The patient also has hypernatremia and acute renal failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Central Nervous System (CNS) infection: The patient's seizure in the setting of fever raises suspicion for a CNS infection, although no signs of meningismus are observed. Empirically treating for meningitis with appropriate antibiotics and antivirals is recommended.

2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) or Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS): The patient has new onset diabetes and hyperglycemia/HHS. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and appropriate insulin therapy will be necessary to manage these conditions.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has elevated creatinine levels and evidence of renal dysfunction. Renal dose medications, avoidance of nephrotoxins, and further investigation into the cause of ARF are needed.

4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia. Careful fluid management with free water repletion and avoidance of further electrolyte imbalances is important.

5. Infection: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count"

   Assessment and Plan
   FEVERS & LEUKOCYTOSIS -- no obvious source on initial presentation.
   Concern for possible meningitis or encephalitis, although no meningeal
   signs on presentation, and altered mental status may be attributed to
   hypernatremia.
   Hypernatremia -- significant free water deficit remains.  Likely a
   subacute process in setting of HHS.  Monitor Na q6h.  Free H2O via PEG.
   Hyperglycemia -- Most c/w HHS, with significant volume depletion on
   admission. No gap acidosis.  Glucose improved.  Continue current
   regimen.  Insulin requirement may change when Free H2O is corrected,
   and D5W discontinued.
   ARF--pre-renal etiology, possibly with ATN component. Cr improving with
   hydration but still with poor urine outpt.
   SEIZURE IDSORDER -- witnessed seizuire by EMS.  Now controlled.  Follow
   Dilantin level.  Consider repeat EEG.
   CPK ELEVATION -- suspect related to seizures.  Doubt rhabdomyalasis.
   Monitor CPK.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- improving with iv hydration.  Monitor UO, BUN,
   creatinine.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of hypernatremia and seizure. The patient has a history of hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, and possible sepsis or encephalitis. The patient is non-communicative and unable to provide personal history.

24-hour events include the initiation of a PICC line, administration of Dilantin, and the use of various medications such as insulin, dextrose, heparin sodium, and ceftriaxone. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been on a nutrition regimen.

Review of systems is negative for any constitutional symptoms, cardiovascular symptoms, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, genitourinary symptoms, musculoskeletal symptoms, or neurologic symptoms.

Physical examination findings include normal vital signs, dense left hemiplegia, warm skin without rashes or jaundice, and clear respiratory sounds. Laboratory results show elevated sodium, glucose, and CK levels, along with decreased Hct and platelet count.

Assessment and plan include concerns for possible meningitis or encephalitis, hypernatremia with significant free water deficit, hyperglycemia consistent with HHS, acute renal failure with pre-renal etiology, seizure disorder, and CPK elevation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: If not properly managed, hypernatremia can lead to dehydration, seizures, and neurological complications.
2. Acute Renal Failure: If renal function continues to deteriorate, it may progress to end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation.
3. Seizure Disorder: Without appropriate management, seizures may recur, leading to further neurological damage and increased risk of mortality.
4. Infection: Given the potential underlying infection or sepsis, there is a risk of developing complications such as multi-organ failure, pneumonia, or bloodstream infections.
5. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance needs careful monitoring, as imbalances can lead to electrolyte disturbances, hypotension, or congestive heart failure.
6. Pressure Ulcers: Prolonged immobility can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection and delayed wound healing.
7. Ventricular Arrhythmias: Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia, can predispose the patient to ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest."

   Assessment and Plan
   SEPSIS -- fever and leukocytosis suggest infection, but no obvious
   source on initial presentation.  Concern for possible meningitis or
   encephalitis, although no meningeal signs on presentation, and altered
   mental status may be attributed to hypernatremia.
   Hypernatremia -- significant free water deficit remains.  Likely a
   subacute process in setting of HHS.  Monitor Na q6h.  Free H2O via PEG.
   Hyperglycemia -- Most c/w HHS, with significant volume depletion on
   admission. No gap acidosis.  Glucose improved.  Continue current
   regimen.  Insulin requirement may change when Free H2O is corrected,
   and D5W discontinued.
   ARF--pre-renal etiology, possibly with ATN component. Creatinine
   improving with hydration but still with poor urine output.
   SEIZURE IDSORDER -- witnessed seizuire by EMS.  Now controlled.  Follow
   Dilantin level.  Consider repeat EEG.
   CPK ELEVATION -- suspect related to seizures.  Doubt rhabdomyalasis.
   Monitor CPK to observe clearing.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- improving with iv hydration.  Monitor UO, BUN,
   creatinine.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions and complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest an infection, but no obvious source has been identified yet. This could progress to sepsis if the infection spreads and affects other organs.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels in their blood, indicating a significant free water deficit. This condition may worsen if the patient does not receive adequate hydration.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, consistent with hyperglycemia. This is commonly seen in patients with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) and should be closely monitored.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, possibly due to pre-renal causes or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of urine output, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine is necessary.

5. Seizure disorder: The patient experienced a witnessed seizure, which was controlled with medication. Dilantin levels should be followed, and a repeat EEG may be considered.

6. Rhabdomyolysis: Although less likely based on the information provided, the elevated CPK levels suggest muscle breakdown. Close monitoring of CPK levels is important to observe their clearing.

7. Ventilatory support: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of right-sided strokes, seizure disorder, and dementia. He was admitted with new-onset diabetes and hyperglycemia/hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS), fevers, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and witnessed seizure. The patient also had hypernatremia, acute renal failure, hypertension, EKG changes, and a seizure disorder.

Assessment and plan:
1. Fevers/elevated WBC: The patient was initially treated with antibiotics for suspected central nervous system infection, but the concern for meningitis is low. Antibiotic dosages were adjusted based on renal function. The patient's WBC count is now within normal range.
2. Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar Syndrome (HHS): The patient presented with markedly elevated glucose levels and active infection, suggesting HHS. He was off insulin drip and started on sliding scale insulin and long-acting insulin (Lantus).
3. Hypernatremia: The patient had a high sodium level that was corrected with free water boluses through the feeding tube. The sodium level is now trending down.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level has resolved, likely due to prerenal causes.
5. HTN: The patient was normotensive on admission but developed hypertension. Medications were restarted to manage blood pressure.

   Assesment: 73M with h/o R sided strokes, seizure disorder, dementia,
   now with new onset diabetes and hyperglycemia/HHS, fevers, elevated
   WBC, and witnessed seizure, and hypernatremia.
   .
   Plan:
   # Fevers/elevated WBC: CXR clear. Urine clear except for high glucose.
   Abd soft, nontender. Seizures raised suspicion for CNS infection,
   although no signs of meningismus on exam.  LP not done as family
   refused.  Initially was on meningitis dosing of abx (vanc 1gm q24
   (renally adjusted dose), ampicillin 2gm Q6h to cover Listeria, and
   acyclovir 10mg/kg q12h) which has since been cut back to ceftriaxone
   only as low concern for meningitis,  afebrile WBC down to 7.4.  C. diff
   negative x1, urine cx negative
   -  bld cultures pending
   - continue CTX for 2 weeks
   - can d/c droplet precautions as has been on treatment for 48 hours
   # Hyperglycemia: On admission markedly elevated glucose in a patient
   with no known history of diabetes and active infection as evidenced by
   fever, WBC. Anion gap 18 (not correcting for glc) with bicarb 20, but
   no ketones in urine, so more c/w HHS than with DKA.  Glucose this
   [**Last Name (un) 3698**] 203.  Off insulin gtt, started on sliding scale and 5 of lantus
   - qid fingersticks
   - add D5 to fluids now that sugars less than 250
   - check A1c
   # Hypernatremia: On admission Na 158 on chem7, but after correcting for
   Glc 774, Na is 169. Has received 3L NS (hypotonic relative to pt).  Na
   trending down slowly to 148 this morning with correction of half of
   goal in first 12 hours.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes check
   #  Acute renal failure: On admission elevated at 2.1, unknown baseline.
   Now resolved at 0.7, was likely prerenal.
   -trend
   # HTN: Was normotensive on admission and antihypertensives were held,
   now hypertensive to 160
   - restart anti-hypertensive medication today
 start one [**Doctor Last Name **] at time
   .
   # EKG changes: On admission has nonspecific distribution of ST
   depressions that was more consistent with demand than plaque rupture
   physiology. CK
s were elevated, likely [**2-22**] to renal failure, trops were
   flat.  CK nadir at 6700, now trending down to 5800.
   - continue to trend CK
s, expect continued decrease as ARF has resolved
   # Seizure Disorder: Has history of seizures and had seizure on day of
   admission in setting of fever and dilantin level of 3.8; not clear when
   last seizure was. LP not done as above as above. Reloaded with 500mg
   dilantin IV and increase maintenance dose to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] from 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
   Last dilantin level was supratherapeutic at 28 yesterday am, this

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of right-sided strokes, seizure disorder, dementia, new-onset diabetes, hyperglycemia/hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), fevers, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and witnessed seizure. The patient also has hypernatremia, acute renal failure, hypertension, EKG changes, seizure disorder, and is on feeding (PEG) with replete electrolytes as needed.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate (HR) of 98 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 164/79 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is on sinus rhythm (SR) and has normal breath sounds with bronchial breath sounds bilaterally.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of sodium (Na+), glucose, creatinine (Cr), and elevated white blood cell count (WBC). The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine have improved from 2.1 to 0.7, indicating resolution of acute renal failure. The patient's troponin-T levels are within normal range, and there are no signs of meningismus on physical examination.

The patient's plan includes continuing ceftria"

   # Fevers/leukocytosis--no obvious infectious source on initial
   presentation and cx
s have returned neg. Had no indwelling lines or
   catheters on admission.  O2 sats have remained stable throughout course
   with no infiltrate on chest imaging.  Given sz initially covered  for
   possible CNS infection
but have had low clinical suspicion for
   meningitis, family declined LP.
   Has been AF and WBC normalized.

   # ARF--pre-renal etiology, possibly with ATN component. Cr now
   normalized.  U/o adequate
   # sz d/o--witnessed sz by ems. Known sz d/o,  Dilantin reloaded and
   dose adjusted since admit.
   -          follow levels

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of multiple prior cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), hypertension, and seizure disorder. The patient presents with fevers, leukocytosis, severe hypernatremia, seizure, and hyperglycemia (HHS).

Key findings from the note include:
- The patient has been febrile with leukocytosis, but initial cultures have been negative. There are no obvious infectious sources.
- The patient has severe hypernatremia and hyperglycemia, which are consistent with HHS.
- The patient had a witnessed seizure and is on Dilation for seizure disorder.
- The patient has acute renal failure, likely pre-renal with a possible ATN component.
- The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder.
- The patient has a history of multiple CVAs and hypertension.
- The patient has tachycardia and fever of unknown origin.

Assessment and plan:
1. WHEEZING - No further action mentioned.
2. ALTERATION IN NUTRITION - No further action mentioned.
3. RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) - Pre-renal etiology, possibly with ATN component. Creatinine now normalized. Urine output adequate.
