","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a male who is over 90 years old and has been admitted to the ICU with chronic respiratory failure. He underwent a tracheostomy placement today at a rehab facility and is experiencing respiratory distress. The patient also has a right-sided pneumothorax (R PTX) that was confirmed by chest CT and CXR. A chest tube was placed to resolve the PTX.

The patient initially had difficulty with ventilation in the MICU, and a bronchoscopy showed posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the trach, which improved with increased PEEP. The patient is now on AC ventilation with increased PEEP to keep the trach open.

The patient has leukocytosis, which may be due to stress from recent PTX or inflammation post bronchoscopy. No fevers or other obvious sources of infection were found, so antibiotics have been held for now. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) will be trended, and a differential will be added. Blood and urine cultures will also be planned.

The patient has an inguinal hernia, which is noted due to a large scrotum. Foley catheterization and continuous bladder irrigation have been initiated.

The patient has diabetes mellitus (DM), and glipizide has been held. Renal function status (RISS) will be monitored.

The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine level of 2"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted to the ICU for tracheostomy placement. The patient had right-sided pneumothorax (R PTX) and difficulty with ventilation. A chest CT and CXR confirmed the resolution of PTX with the placement of a chest tube. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired (procedure-related, barotrauma): The patient developed respiratory distress after tracheostomy replacement at the rehab facility. Initially, it was difficult to ventilate the patient in the MICU. A bronchoscopy showed posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the tracheostomy, which improved with increased PEEP.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient had an elevated white blood cell count, but it has resolved. This could be due to stress from recent events or inflammation post-bronchoscopy. No antibiotics were required.
3. Inguinal hernia: The patient has a large scrotum on examination, indicating an inguinal hernia. Foley catheter and continuous bladder irrigation are planned.
4. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's glucose levels are high, and glipizide has been held. The patient is at risk for hyperglycemia (RISS).
5. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine level is elevated. Renal function should"

   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: [**Age over 90 **] yo M with chronic respiratory failure with
   trach/PEG admitted from rehab s/p tracheostomy placement today with R
   sided PTX and difficulty with ventilation.
   # R PTX: [**Month (only) 51**] be spontaneous vs. due to vigorous ventilation at rehab.
   Chest CT and CXR confirms resolution of PTX with placement of chest
   tube.
   - chest tube to suction overnight, change to waterseal after bronch by
   IP today.
   - f/u final Chest CT read.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: s/p tracheostomy replacement today at rehab.
   Initially difficult to ventilate in the MICU. Per discussion with rehab
   pulmonologist, concern for tracheobronchmalasia noted on bronch at
   [**Hospital1 **]. Bronchoscopy performed here showed posterior invagination of
   tracheal tissue blocking trach which improved with increased PEEP. ABG
   improved from acute on chronic respiratory acidosis to chronic
   respiratory acidosis with ventilation, only requiring increase in RR
   overnight. FiO2 weaned to 50%.
   - IP consult in AM, appreciate recs
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Resolved [**Month (only) 51**] have been in setting of stress from recent
   PTX or inflammation post bronchoscopy. No fevers or other obvious
   source of infection.  No abx required.
   - can plan change urinary catheter (changed every 3-4 weeks), but
   difficult to do [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **] physician due to inguinal hernia
   Will hold off on this for now
   .
   # Inguinal hernia: Noted large scrotum on exam.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted from rehab with right-sided pneumothorax and difficulty with ventilation. The patient has undergone a tracheostomy placement and is currently intubated. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors.

Firstly, the patient experienced respiratory distress after the tracheostomy replacement at the rehab facility. The patient had initial difficulty ventilating in the MICU, and a bronchoscopy showed posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the tracheostomy, which improved with increased PEEP. The patient's ABG improved from acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis to chronic respiratory acidosis with ventilation, only requiring an increase in RR overnight. FiO2 was weaned to 50%.

Secondly, the patient has leukocytosis, which resolved within [**Month (only) 51**]. This may be due to stress from recent pneumothorax or inflammation post-bronchoscopy. No antibiotics are required.

Thirdly, the patient has an inguinal hernia. Due to a large scrotum on examination, it is difficult to change the urinary catheter. Foley catheter with continuous bladder irrigation is planned.

Fourthly, the patient has diabetes mellitus (DM), and glipizide should be held. Additionally, the patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD), and renal dosing of medications should be avoided, while monitoring renal function.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury who has been admitted to the ICU due to a pneumothorax. The patient's vital signs show sinus bradycardia, stable blood pressure, and respiratory rate within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is at 100% and the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a Hct of 27.5%, leukocytosis with a WBC count of 7.4, and elevated levels of lactic acid and LDH. Imaging reveals a resolved pneumothorax on chest X-ray. The patient's urine cultures show no growth to date.

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient had a pneumothorax, which has been resolved on chest X-ray. However, there is a possibility of recurrence, and the plan is to monitor the patient closely and repeat chest X-ray if needed.
2. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of ventilator dependence due to an anoxic brain injury. There is a possibility of tracheomalacia, and the patient is being evaluated for this condition.
3. Chronic urinary retention/indwelling foley: The patient has chronic urinary retention with an indwelling foley catheter. Continuous bladder irrigation is being performed, and if necessary, a foley"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, admitted to the ICU for pneumothorax. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has had a tracheostomy tube placed. He has a history of chronic respiratory failure, chronic urinary retention with an indwelling Foley catheter, anemia, and leukocytosis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure of 110/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient remains poorly responsive and shows no signs of edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory condition may worsen due to the recent pneumothorax and tracheostomy.
2. Tracheostomy problem: There is a possibility of tracheomalacia or tracheostomy malposition, which can lead to airway obstruction or difficulty in ventilation.
3. Pneumothorax: Although the patient's pneumothorax appears resolved on the chest X-ray, there is still a risk of recurrence or development of tension pneumothorax.
4. Urinary tract infection: The patient has an indwelling Foley catheter, which increases the risk of urinary tract infections.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia, which can worsen if"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, who was admitted to the ICU from a rehabilitation center after undergoing tracheostomy placement. The patient had a right-sided pneumothorax (PTX) and difficulty with ventilation. A chest tube was placed, and the PTX resolved. 

The patient experienced respiratory distress following tracheostomy replacement at the rehab center. He was initially difficult to ventilate in the MICU, but an increase in PEEP improved his condition. An ABG showed an improvement from acute on chronic respiratory acidosis to chronic respiratory acidosis with ventilation. 

The patient also had leukocytosis, which resolved, and there were no signs of infection or fevers. The leukocytosis may have been due to stress from recent PTX or inflammation post-bronchoscopy. 

The patient has an inguinal hernia and a large scrotum on exam. A Foley catheter was placed, but it fell out, and a replacement was done. The patient has diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, hyponatremia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and anemia. These conditions are being monitored and managed accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumothorax (PTX): The patient initially had a right-sided PTX, which was resolved with the placement of a chest tube. However, there is a concern for recurrent PTX due to vigorous ventilation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted from a rehabilitation center after undergoing tracheostomy placement. The patient has several medical conditions and complications:

1. Right-sided pneumothorax (PTX): The patient initially had a right-sided PTX, which has since resolved with the placement of a chest tube. However, there is still some concern about the etiology of the PTX, whether it was spontaneous or due to vigorous ventilation at the rehabilitation center.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient experienced respiratory distress after tracheostomy replacement at the rehabilitation center. Initially, it was difficult to ventilate him, and a bronchoscopy showed posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the tracheostomy tube, which improved with increased PEEP. The patient's ABG improved from acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis to chronic respiratory acidosis with ventilation, requiring an increase in RR overnight. FiO2 was weaned to 50%.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient had leukocytosis, which has since resolved. It may have been caused by recent stress from the PTX or inflammation post-bronchoscopy. No antibiotics were required.

4. Inguinal hernia: The patient has a large scrotum, indicating an inguinal hernia. Foley catheterization and continuous bladder irrigation are planned.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted from a rehabilitation center after undergoing a tracheostomy placement. He presented with right-sided pneumothorax and difficulty with ventilation. The patient has a history of chronic dwelling catheter and leukocytosis, which has resolved but with an increased white blood cell count. There are also findings of an enlarged and edematous scrotum, large atelectasis in the left base, and worsening right lower lobe atelectasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient initially presented with right-sided pneumothorax, which has since improved but requires ongoing monitoring.
2. Tracheobronchomalacia: There is concern for tracheobronchomalacia, which was noted on bronchoscopy. This condition can cause airway collapse during ventilation, leading to respiratory distress.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and a urine culture indicating the presence of gram-negative rods, suggesting a possible UTI. This should be treated promptly to prevent complications.
4. Scrotal edema and enlargement: The patient's scrotum is enlarged and edematous, which may indicate a potential complication such as testicular torsion or epididymitis. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause.
5. Atelectasis: The patient has large atelectasis in the left"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted from a rehabilitation facility after undergoing tracheostomy placement. The patient has a history of right pneumothorax and difficulty with ventilation. Upon arrival in the ICU, the patient was initially difficult to ventilate and required bronchoscopy due to concern for tracheobronchomalacia. The bronchoscopy showed posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the tracheostomy tube, which improved with increased PEEP. The patient's ABG improved from acute on chronic respiratory acidosis to chronic respiratory acidosis with ventilation. The FiO2 was weaned to 50%. A stent was given, but it did not seem to have any effect on the patient's baseline.

The patient also has leukocytosis, which resolved and may be related to recent pneumothorax or inflammation post-bronchoscopy. The urine culture showed the presence of gram-negative rods (>100,000 organisms/mL). The patient was started on ciprofloxacin for 7 days.

The patient's physical examination revealed an enlarged and edematous scrotum, which may indicate an inguinal hernia. The neurologic examination showed that the patient only moves in response to painful stimuli.

The imaging results showed a small right pneumothorax that was not clearly visualized in the examination, but seen in a prior CT. The right lower lobe atelectasis"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of anoxic brain injury and chronic ventilator dependence. She was admitted with pneumothorax and has undergone bronchoscopy and tracheostomy placement. The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and chronic respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving supplemental oxygen, and has a chest tube in place for the pneumothorax. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains in critical condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumothorax recurrence or tension pneumothorax if the chest tube is clamped prematurely.
2. Tracheomalacia exacerbation due to ongoing ventilatory support.
3. UTI recurrence or progression if appropriate antibiotic treatment is not administered.
4. Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
5. Worsening of chronic respiratory failure leading to further deterioration of lung function.
6. Possible complications related to long-term use of a tracheostomy tube, such as tracheal stenosis or infection.
7. Potential complications from central nervous system (CNS) damage due to the anoxic brain injury, including increased intracranial pressure or seizures."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 90-year-old female with a history of anoxic brain injury and chronic ventilatory dependence. She was admitted with pneumothorax and underwent bronchoscopy by IP, which revealed tracheomalacia. A chest tube was placed, and the patient's Foley catheter was replaced. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with set Vt of 400 mL and PS of 15 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure of 81/28 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's mental status is poor, and she is unresponsive to commands. Review of systems is unchanged from admission. Labs and radiology results show stable kidney function, slightly elevated white blood cell count, normal electrolytes, and slightly elevated lactate levels. The patient's chest X-ray is stable, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. The plan is to clamp the chest tube and repeat CXR in 1 hour, then in the morning. If stable, the chest tube will be discontinued. The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by Klebsiella, for which ciprofloxacin will be given orally for 7 days. The patient's chronic respiratory failure will be managed with PEEP as"

   sided PTX and difficulty with ventilation.
# R PTX: [**Month (only) 51**] be spontaneous vs. due to vigorous ventilation at rehab vs. right p
neumothorax in the setting of recent bronchoscopy with tracheostomy change. Ches
t CT and CXR confirms resolution of PTX with placement of chest tube.
   - chest tube on [**Last Name (LF) 12314**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] clamp and repeat CXR after 1hr.  If
   stable, leaved clamped overnight, and if repeat CXR stable, will pull
   chest tube.
   - f/u IP recs
   # Respiratory distress: s/p tracheostomy replacement today at rehab.
   Initially difficult to ventilate in the MICU. Per discussion with rehab
   pulmonologist, concern for tracheobronchmalasia noted on bronch at
   [**Hospital1 **]. Bronchoscopy performed here showed posterior invagination of
   tracheal tissue blocking trach which improved with increased PEEP. ABG
   improved from acute on chronic respiratory acidosis to chronic
   respiratory acidosis with ventilation, only requiring increase in RR
   overnight. FiO2 weaned to 50%. Bronched and IP advanced trach but said

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-inch-old male with a chief complaint of pan-sensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae in the urine. The patient started on ciprofloxacin but had difficulty ventilating and was unresponsive. A bronchoscopy was performed, revealing tracheobronchomalacia (TRAM) occluding the end of the tracheostomy tube. The tracheostomy tube was pushed deeper, resulting in some improvement. A right subclavian central venous line (CVL) was placed. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/43-174/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are within normal limits. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and lactate levels. Imaging reveals no pneumothorax but shows right hemithorax lucency likely due to patient positioning and scapular overlay. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia (TRAM): The patient has chronic respiratory failure with tracheostomy and is now experiencing TRAM, which is hospital-acquired and procedure-related. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and consider stenting"

 TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA)
 [**Hospital **] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (PROCEDURE RELATED, BAROTRAUMA)
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: [**Age over 90 **] yo M with chronic respiratory failure with
   trach/PEG admitted from rehab s/p tracheostomy placement today with R
   sided PTX and difficulty with ventilation.
   # Respiratory distress: s/p tracheostomy replacement at rehab.
   Initially difficult to ventilate in the MICU. Per discussion with rehab
   pulmonologist, concern for tracheobronchmalasia noted on bronch at
   [**Hospital1 **]. Bronchoscopy performed here showed posterior invagination of
   tracheal tissue blocking trach which improved with increased PEEP. ABG
   improved from acute on chronic respiratory acidosis to chronic
   respiratory acidosis with ventilation, only requiring increase in RR
   overnight. FiO2 weaned to 50%. Bronched and IP advanced trach but said
   nothing to do w/ a stent given pt.s baseline. Now with continuing
   occlusion of tracheostomy due to severe TBM despite initial trach
   advancement. Trach now ~1cm from carina and meta-stable but not a good
   long term situation. IP to re-eval but little options moving forward.
   -- Increase PEEP to [**12-25**] to keep airway open
   -- Sedate with propofol to limit cough and active exhalation, can use
   paralytics if need be
   -- f/u IP recs.
# R PTX: [**Month (only) 51**] be spontaneous vs. due to vigorous ventilation at rehab vs. right p
neumothorax in the setting of recent bronchoscopy with tracheostomy change. Ches
t CT and CXR confirms resolution of PTX with placement of chest tube.
   -- Retry on clamp today and recheck CXR 4 hours post, if ok, consider
   removal of CT pending IP approval.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Resolved [**Month (only) 51**] have been in setting of stress from recent
   PTX or inflammation post bronchoscopy.  However, UCx w/ >100,000 GNR,
   but in the setting of a chronic dwelling catheter.
   -- initate 7d of cipro.
   - urology replaced urinary catheter.
   .
   # Inguinal hernia: Noted large scrotum on exam.
   - foley, continuous bladder irrigation
   # DM: hold glipizide. RISS, add Lantus today for better control. .
   # CKD: Cre baseline 2.0.
   - continue to monitor renal fx, renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Hyponatremia: Likely chronic. continue to monitor.
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levoxyl
   # Hypertension: continue amlodipine

   advanced the trach to 1 cm above carina and increased PEEP with
   improvement.

   Plan:
   1) IP to see this morning. Does not appear to be many great medical
   options for tracheomalacia, however will discuss after IP assessment
   and examination.
   2) Chest tube clamped again - will re-evaluate with repeat CXR

","The patient has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pan-sensitive Klebsiella in urine, and they were started on ciprofloxacin. The patient also had a clamped chest tube and a repeat chest X-ray without recurrence. If the chest X-ray is good, it is planned to pull the tube and then discharge the patient back to rehab. However, the patient then had difficulty ventilating, and a bronchoscopy performed by Dr. [Last Name] showed that the tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) was occluding the end of the tracheostomy tube. The tracheostomy tube was pushed even deeper with some improvement. A right subclavian central venous line (CVL) was placed.

The patient's 24-hour events include a bronchoscopy at [time] AM due to inability to ventilate and difficulty bagging. The bronchoscopy revealed TBM occluding the end of the tracheostomy tube. The patient's medical history includes allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), and the last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin on [date] at [time]. The patient is currently on propofol infusion at 30 mcg/kg/min and has other ICU medications including heparin sodium (prophylaxis) started on [date] at [time].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure who was admitted from rehab after tracheostomy placement. The patient had difficulty with ventilation initially and was found to have tracheobronchomalacia on bronchoscopy. The tracheostomy tube was advanced, but there was ongoing occlusion of the tracheostomy due to severe tracheal bronchial malfunction (TBM). The patient's ABG improved with increased PEEP, and FiO2 was weaned to 50%. A right-sided pneumothorax (PTX) was also identified, which resolved with the placement of a chest tube. The patient's leukocytosis resolved, but a urinary catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI) with Klebsiella pneumoniae was identified, and the patient was started on ciprofloxacin. An inguinal hernia was noted, and the patient has several other medical conditions including diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyponatremia, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM): The patient's TBM is causing ongoing occlusion of the tracheostomy, which can lead to difficulty with ventilation and increased risk of respiratory failure.
2. Pneumothorax (PTX): The patient had a right-sided PTX that required chest"

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted to the hospital after undergoing tracheostomy placement at a rehabilitation center. He presented with right-sided pneumothorax and difficulty with ventilation. The patient had a history of tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) which was confirmed by a bronchoscopy performed at the hospital. The bronchoscopy showed posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the tracheostomy, which improved with increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values showed improvement from acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis to chronic respiratory acidosis with ventilation. His fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was weaned to 50%. However, the patient continues to experience occlusion of the tracheostomy due to severe TBM, despite initial tracheostomy advancement. The tracheostomy is currently about 1 cm from the carina and is considered metastable but not a good long-term solution. 

The plan is to increase PEEP to 12-25 to keep the airway open, sedate the patient with propofol to limit cough and active exhalation, and use paralytics if necessary. The patient will be followed up with interventional pulmonology recommendations.

Regarding other medical complications, the patient has leukocytosis that resolved after recent pneumothorax or inflammation post-bronchoscopy."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 51-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted to the hospital for tracheostomy placement.
- He has a history of tracheobronchomalacia and underwent a tracheostomy procedure at a rehabilitation facility.
- The patient presented with right-sided pneumothorax and difficulty with ventilation after the tracheostomy replacement.
- Bronchoscopy revealed posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the tracheostomy tube, which improved with increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
- The patient's tracheostomy tube is now about 1 cm from the carina and is in a metastable but not optimal long-term position.
- Right-sided pneumothorax has improved, and the chest X-ray is stable since the chest tube (CT) was clamped yesterday.
- There is uncertainty regarding whether the patient's respiratory distress is spontaneous, due to vigorous ventilation at the rehabilitation facility, or related to the right pneumothorax.
- The plan is to continue PEEP at 14, keep sedatives off if possible, follow up with interventional pulmonology recommendations, pull the CT today, and repeat the chest X-ray.
- Other issues include a urinary tract infection caused by Klebsiella, an inguinal hernia, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, hyponatremia, hypothyroidism, and hypertension.
- The patient is receiving tube feeds through NovaSource Renal (Full) at 120 mL/hour and has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line.
- Prophylaxis measures include deep vein thrombosis prevention with boots and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilation-associated pneumonia prevention with head-of-bed elevation and mouth care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia exacerbation: The patient's pre-existing condition may worsen due to the tracheostomy placement or positioning issues.
2. Pneumothorax recurrence: The right-sided pneumothorax has improved but could potentially reoccur, especially if the chest tube is pulled prematurely or if there is another underlying cause.
3. Ventilatory distress: The patient's difficulty with ventilation may persist or worsen if the tracheostomy tube is not properly positioned or if there are ongoing issues with airway obstruction.
4. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by Klebsiella, which requires appropriate antibiotic treatment to prevent further complications.
5. Inguinal hernia: The large scrotum and noted inguinal hernia may require surgical intervention to prevent incarceration or strangulation.
6. Chronic kidney disease progression: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, indicating possible chronic kidney disease. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications based on renal function are necessary.
7. Diabetes control: The patient's diabetes mellitus needs careful management"

   [**Age over 90 **] yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach/PEG admitted from
   rehab s/p tracheostomy placement today with R sided PTX and difficulty
   with ventilation.
   # Respiratory distress: s/p tracheostomy replacement at rehab.
   Initially difficult to ventilate in the MICU. Per discussion with rehab
   pulmonologist, concern for tracheobronchmalasia noted on bronch at
   [**Hospital1 **]. Bronchoscopy performed here showed posterior invagination of
   tracheal tissue blocking trach which improved with increased PEEP. ABG
   improved from acute on chronic respiratory acidosis to chronic
   respiratory acidosis with ventilation, only requiring increase in RR
   overnight. FiO2 weaned to 50%. Bronched and IP advanced trach but said
   nothing to do w/ a stent given pt.s baseline. Now with continuing
   occlusion of tracheostomy due to severe TBM despite initial trach
   advancement. Trach now ~1cm from carina and meta-stable but not a good
   long term situation. IP to re-eval but little options moving forward.
   -- Increase PEEP to [**12-25**] to keep airway open
   -- Sedate with propofol to limit cough and active exhalation, can use
   paralytics if need be
   -- f/u IP recs.
# R PTX: [**Month (only) 51**] be spontaneous vs. due to vigorous ventilation at rehab vs. right p
neumothorax in the setting of recent bronchoscopy with tracheostomy change. Ches
t CT and CXR confirms resolution of PTX with placement of chest tube.
   -- Retry on clamp today and recheck CXR 4 hours post, if ok, consider

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted from a rehabilitation facility after undergoing a tracheostomy placement. He presented with right-sided pneumothorax and difficulty with ventilation. The patient has a history of tracheobronchomalacia, which was confirmed during a bronchoscopy at another hospital. The bronchoscopy showed posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the tracheostomy, which improved with increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) improved from acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis to chronic respiratory acidosis with ventilation, requiring an increase in respiratory rate overnight. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was weaned to 50%. However, the patient continues to experience occlusion of the tracheostomy due to severe tracheobronchomalacia, despite initial tracheostomy advancement. The tracheostomy is now approximately 1 cm from the carina and is metastable but not a good long-term situation. The intensivist plans to re-evaluate the patient but has limited options moving forward.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 56 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 157/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (inspiratory), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 90-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU with pneumothorax. The patient has a history of anoxic brain injury in 2186, resulting in vent dependence. The patient's allergies include sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), with an anaphylactic reaction. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, lansoprazole, amlodipine, chlorhexidine, MVI, levothyroxine, ASA, pantoprazole, ISS, and Lantus 10 daily.

24-hour events include being seen by the ICU resident, with a repeat bronch deferred due to no options for intervention for tuberculosis (TBM). The chest tube was clamped yesterday, with a repeat chest X-ray showing stability. The patient also experienced another episode of apnea, which improved with advancing the tracheostomy further in.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/61 mmHg to 175/70 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a Vt set at 400 mL, RR set at 14, PEEP at 15 cmH2O, FiO2"

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury resulting in ventilator dependence. He was admitted with pneumothorax and has since experienced multiple complications. The patient's current condition includes pleural effusion, tracheomalacia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and chronic respiratory failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumothorax recurrence: The patient's chest tube was clamped and a repeat CXR showed stability. However, there is still a risk of recurrent pneumothorax.
2. Tracheostomy tube obstruction or displacement: The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place, which needs to be monitored for any signs of obstruction or displacement.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to his prolonged ventilator use.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin to prevent DVT, but there is still a risk of developing blood clots.
5. Wound infection: The patient has undergone multiple procedures, increasing the risk of wound infections.
6. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the ventilator can lead to pressure ulcers.
7. Nosocomial infections: The patient's prolonged hospital stay increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various complications related to his current medical"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury resulting in ventilator dependence. The patient was admitted with pneumothorax and has since experienced several medical events.

The patient has been evaluated by the ICU resident, and the attending physician agrees with their assessment and plan. The patient has undergone chest tube clamping and a repeat chest X-ray, which showed stability. The chest tube may be discontinued if the patient remains stable.

The patient also has tracheomalacia, which was evaluated by the ICU physician and does not require intervention. 

Additionally, the patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Gram-negative rods, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is sensitive to ciprofloxacin. The patient's Foley catheter has been exchanged, and he will be given ciprofloxacin orally for seven days.

The patient suffers from chronic respiratory failure due to anoxic brain injury and requires PEEP as needed for tracheomalacia. 

Other notable findings include elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood glucose levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and further episodes of apnea or difficulty exhaling.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust PEEP accordingly. Regular chest X-rays should be performed to"

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/61 to 175/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, and fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels. The creatinine, potassium, and magnesium levels are within normal range. 

Plan and Assessment:

1. Pneumothorax: The chest tube will be clamped, and a chest X-ray will be repeated in 1 hour and then in the morning. If the patient's condition remains stable, the chest tube will be discontinued.

2. Tracheomalacia: No intervention is needed as evaluated by the intensivist.

3. UTI: The Foley catheter will be exchanged, and the patient will receive ciprofloxacin"

","The patient is an 90-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury resulting in ventilator dependence, admitted with pneumothorax. He is currently in the ICU and has experienced several medical complications. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/61 mmHg to 175/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The blood glucose level is within normal range. The micro culture results indicate the presence of pan-sensitive klebsiella. The CXR shows no significant changes and there is a minimal left-sided pleural effusion that cannot be excluded.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
1. Pneumothorax: The chest tube has been clamped since yesterday AM, and CXR yesterday and today are stable. The decision will be made to discontinue the chest tube today.
2. Tracheomalacia: No intervention is planned, and the tracheostomy tube will be kept as deep in as possible.
3. UTI: The patient has a high colony count of GNR with klebsiella pan-sensitive. Foley catheter exchange has been done, and the patient will receive cipro"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted to the ICU after a tracheostomy placement due to difficulty with ventilation. The patient had a right-sided pneumothorax (collapsed lung) and was treated with chest tube insertion. The chest tube was removed yesterday, and the patient's condition has been stable since then.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support through a tracheostomy tube with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 100% with supplemental oxygen.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 59 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 153/65 mmHg to 107/42 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal ranges.

Imaging shows a right basal chest tube removal with no pneumothorax identified, tracheostomy in place, persistent bibasilar atelectasis (collapsed lung tissue), and a small left-sided effusion (fluid accumulation). The cardiac silhouette appears unchanged.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has a history of pneumothorax and underwent chest tube placement.
- The chest tube was removed after a stable chest X-ray with the clamp in place for 24 hours.
- The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress since the tracheostomy replacement at rehab, with bronchoscopy showing posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the trach, which improved with increased PEEP.
- The right-sided pneumothorax has improved, and the chest X-ray is stable since the chest tube removal yesterday.
- There are growing gram-positive rods in the sputum, indicating a possible infection.
- The patient has a tracheobronchomalacia, which is a condition where the trachea and bronchi are too weak to stay open without assistance.
- The patient also has other medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, inguinal hernia, chronic kidney disease, and hypothyroidism.
- The patient is currently on multiple medications and treatments, including antibiotics for the UTI, insulin for glycemic control, heparin for DVT prophylaxis, and medications for hypertension and hypothyroidism.
- The patient's vital signs and lab results are within normal limits, except for elevated lactate levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury resulting in vent dependence, admitted with pneumothorax. The patient's chest tube has been removed, and the pneumothorax appears to be stable based on recent chest X-rays. 

The patient also has tracheomalacia, which will be monitored without intervention at this time. The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by a Gram-negative rod (GNR) with Klebsiella sensitivity, and appropriate measures have been taken, including Foley catheter exchange and administration of ciprofloxacin orally for seven days.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing chronic respiratory failure due to the previous anoxic brain injury. High PEEP will continue to be used for tracheomalacia, and a follow-up sputum culture will be conducted.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and lines (including a multi-lumen line inserted on [**2188-1-3**] at 07:00 AM) will be managed accordingly. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) will also be provided."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 95-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury and subsequent ventilator dependence. He was admitted with a pneumothorax and is currently in the ICU. The patient has had a chest tube inserted, which has been clamped since yesterday morning. Chest X-rays from yesterday and today show stability, indicating that the pneumothorax is not worsening. It is planned to remove the chest tube today.

The patient also has tracheomalacia, which has been evaluated by the intensivist and no intervention is required. The tracheostomy tube will be kept deep in the trachea as much as possible.

Additionally, the patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with over 100,000 colony-forming units of gram-negative rods, including Klebsiella pneumoniae. The Foley catheter has been replaced, and the patient is prescribed ciprofloxacin orally for seven days.

The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to his anoxic brain injury. He will continue to receive high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to support his breathing and prevent tracheomalacia. A follow-up sputum culture will be done.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and various prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury and resultant ventilator dependence. He was admitted with a pneumothorax, which has since resolved and the chest tube was removed. The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His current condition is stable, with vital signs within normal range. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels. Chest X-ray shows no evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax. The patient has been diagnosed with tracheomalacia and urinary tract infection caused by a Gram-negative rod (possibly Proteus mirabilis). He is being treated with ciprofloxacin for the UTI and will have his sensitivity to Proteus tested. The patient's chronic respiratory failure is attributed to his previous anoxic brain injury. The plan is to continue high PEEP for tracheomalacia and follow up on the Proteus sensitivity results. The patient is currently on nutrition through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), glycemic control with lantus and insulin sliding scale, and receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code and his disposition is to remain in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male who has been admitted to the ICU with chronic respiratory failure and pneumothorax. He has a history of anoxic brain injury resulting in ventilator dependence. The patient's chest tube was removed yesterday, and his CXR is stable. He remains afebrile and has had no changes to his ventilator settings. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, and he is receiving various medications including antibiotics, heparin, and insulin. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and blood glucose levels. The sputum culture reveals the presence of gram-positive rods, and the respiratory culture shows an overgrowth of Proteus mirabilis. The CXR indicates minimal changes since the previous radiograph, with no evidence of pneumothorax or newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Although there are no newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia on the CXR, the patient's elevated white blood cell count and overgrowth of gram-negative rods in the respiratory culture may indicate a risk for developing pneumonia. Close monitoring and further investigation are necessary.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged ventilator dependence, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient is already receiving appropriate measures to prevent VAP, such as chlorhexidine, head-of-bed elevation, and mouth care.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted to the ICU from rehab for tracheostomy placement. He has a history of right-sided pneumothorax and difficulty with ventilation. The tracheostomy was replaced at the rehab facility, but there was posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the tracheostomy, which improved with increased PEEP. The tracheostomy is now approximately 1 cm from the carina and is considered meta-stable but not a good long-term solution. The patient's right-sided pneumothorax has improved, and the chest X-ray is stable since the CT scan removed yesterday. 

The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is within normal range, but his platelet count (Plt) is slightly low. His creatinine (Cr) level is elevated at 2.2, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating. The patient has several comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypothyroidism, and hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen due to the tracheostomy being too close to the carina, leading to potential airway obstruction.
2. Pneumothorax: There is a risk of recurrent right-sided pneumothorax, especially if proper precautions are"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted from a rehabilitation center after undergoing tracheostomy placement. He had right-sided pneumothorax and difficulty with ventilation. The patient's tracheostomy was replaced, and he now has a meta-stable condition. His right-sided pneumothorax improved, and his chest X-ray is stable since the removal of the chest tube yesterday.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 159/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator. His physical examination reveals diminished right radial pulse, diminished left radial pulse, trace right lower extremity edema, and trace left lower extremity edema. Neurologically, he is unresponsive and not attentive.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and creatinine levels. The patient has been growing Proteus in his sputum but is not showing any other signs of pneumonia, so antibiotics have been held off. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism, and hypertension.

Plan:

1. Continue PEEP at 14.
2. Keep sedatives off if possible.
3. Follow up with interventional pulmonology recommendations.

   [**Age over 90 **] yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach/PEG admitted from
   rehab s/p tracheostomy placement today with R sided PTX and difficulty
   with ventilation.
   # Respiratory distress: s/p tracheostomy replacement at rehab. Bronch
   showed posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking trach which
   improved with increased PEEP. IP advanced trach  but did not offer
   stent based on other comorbidities.. Trach now ~1cm from carina and
   meta-stable but not a good long term situation. Right sided PTX
   improved and CXR stable since CT removed yesterday. [**Month (only) 51**] be spontaneous
   vs. due to vigorous ventilation at rehab vs. right pneumothorax in the
   setting of recent bronchoscopy with tracheostomy change.
   -- Continue PEEP at 14
   -- Keep sedatives off if possible
   -- f/u IP recs.
   -Will hold antibiotics for GPRs, likely colonizers, no other clinical
   signs of pneumonia.
   # UTI: Growing sensitive Klebsiella. On Cipro day [**5-17**].
   # Inguinal hernia: Noted large scrotum on exam.
   - foley, continuous bladder irrigation
   # DM: hold glipizide. RISS, Uptitrate Lantus to 15 from 12 for better
   control now that tube feeds are back on.
   # CKD: Cr baseline 2.0.
   - continue to monitor renal fx, renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted from a rehabilitation facility after undergoing tracheostomy placement.
- The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress since the tracheostomy replacement at the rehab facility. Bronchoscopic examination revealed posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the tracheostomy, which improved with increased PEEP. However, the tracheostomy is now only 1 cm from the carina and considered metastable but not a good long-term situation.
- The patient had a right-sided pneumothorax that has improved, and a chest X-ray showed stability since the CT scan removed yesterday. It is unclear whether the pneumothorax is spontaneous or caused by vigorous ventilation at the rehab facility or a recent bronchoscopy with tracheostomy change.
- The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, which was identified on day 5.
- An inguinal hernia was noted during the examination.
- The patient has diabetes mellitus (DM) and is currently taking glipizide. However, it is recommended to hold the medication and increase the dose of Lantus insulin to achieve better glycemic control now that tube feeds are resumed.
- The patient also has chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine level of 2"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with tracheobronchomalacia, hospital-acquired barotrauma, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is receiving ventilatory support through a tracheostomy tube and high PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) support.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Tracheobronchomalacia: This condition involves weak walls of the trachea and bronchi, which can lead to airway collapse during breathing. Complications may include recurrent respiratory infections, difficulty breathing, and the need for long-term ventilatory support.

2. Hospital-acquired barotrauma: Barotrauma is damage caused to the lungs by increased pressure within the airways. In this case, it was acquired during hospitalization. Complications may include pneumothorax (collapsed lung), pneumomediastinum (air in the chest cavity), and pulmonary edema.

3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient is being treated with ciprofloxacin for the UTI. If left untreated or if the infection becomes resistant to the antibiotic, complications can include kidney infection (pyelonephritis), sepsis (systemic infection), and the spread of the infection to other parts of the body.

It is important to monitor the patient closely and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury and chronic respiratory failure who is currently on ventilator support in the ICU. He was admitted with spontaneous right-sided pneumothorax and had a chest tube placement and removal. The patient also has severe tracheobronchomalacia with granulation tissue causing intermittent occlusion of tracheostomy. The patient's family has not paid for his hospital stay, and a case manager is being sent to evaluate the patient today.

24-hour events include the patient's family repositioning him with lower tidal volumes, leading to an increase in PEEP from 14 to 15. There are no new findings on review of systems.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 119/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator. The patient has sinus bradycardia.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 923 mL and output of 1825 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 902 mL. Respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set Vt of 400 mL, set RR of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, PIP of 36 cmH"

","The patient's chief complaint is pneumothorax. The patient underwent a tracheostomy, which should help reduce movement. The family requested to discontinue Lantus, a medication for diabetes management. The patient experienced hyperglycemia due to a feeding tube error, but the sugars improved after turning off the tube feed.

There were financial concerns regarding transferring the patient to another hospital. The family reported the current hospital to the Department of Public Health due to disagreements over the patient's care, including the planned transfer and limited family presence.

The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and has experienced anaphylaxis in response to antibiotics. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium as a prophylactic measure against deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/68 to 185/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, set with a tidal volume of 400 mL and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The PEEP is at 15 cmH2O, FiO2 is 40%, and plateau pressure is 27 cmH2O.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who has been admitted to the ICU for tracheostomy placement and subsequent respiratory distress. The patient has a history of tracheobronchomalacia, which is a condition characterized by weak or floppy walls of the airways in the trachea and bronchi. The tracheostomy was placed at a rehab facility, and upon transfer to the hospital, it was found that there was posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the tracheostomy. This was improved with increased PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) and the tracheostomy was advanced by about 1 cm from the carina (the point where the trachea divides into the bronchi). The patient's right-sided pneumothorax has improved and the chest X-ray is stable since the chest tube was removed.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/68 to 107/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an RSBI (rapid shallow breathing index) deferred due to PEEP >10. The patient's arterial blood gas values are not provided in the note.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the respiratory/chest area, trace edema in the lower extremities, and normal heart sounds. Neurological examination is not assessed due to the patient's unresponsiveness.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, low total CO2, high blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic respiratory failure, tracheobronchomalacia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, inguinal hernia, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. The patient is currently being treated for urinary tract infection with ciprofloxacin, and his medications include levoxyl for hypothyroidism, amlodipine for hypertension, and lantus for diabetes management.

The patient's current ICU care includes nutrition through tube feeding, glycemic control, multi-lumen lines for central venous access, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's disposition is awaiting placement, likely indicating a decision regarding long-term care or transfer to another facility.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include further respiratory distress due to tracheobronchomalacia, recurrent pneumothor"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted from a rehabilitation facility after undergoing tracheostomy placement. The patient has a history of tracheobronchomalacia, which is a condition where the tracheal tissue collapses easily. The patient also has other comorbidities such as inguinal hernia, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and hypothyroidism.

24-hour events:
- The patient had a new tracheostomy tube placed that should move less.
- The family requested to discontinue Lantus insulin.
- The patient experienced hyperglycemia due to a tubing feeding error, which improved after the feeding was turned off.
- The patient was initially offered a transfer to another hospital but refused due to financial concerns.
- The patient's family reported the current hospital to the Department of Public Health, expressing concerns about the early transfer, limited family presence, and not respecting their wishes to take the patient home.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient's pre-existing condition may lead to airway collapse and difficulty with ventilation.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a right-sided pneumothorax, which can cause respiratory distress and compromised oxygenation.
3. Infection: The presence of a Klebsiella infection indicates a potential risk of further infections, particularly in a hospital-acquired setting.
4. Diabetes management:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury and chronic respiratory failure on ventilator at Hospital1. He was admitted with spontaneous right-sided pneumothorax, which required chest tube placement and subsequent removal. The patient has severe tracheobronchomalacia with granulation tissue causing intermittent occlusion of tracheostomy. He is currently experiencing issues with tracheostomy slipping in and out and may transition to a non-adjustable extra long trach.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient's condition of tracheobronchomalacia can lead to airway collapse and obstruction, potentially causing breathing difficulties or respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia. The patient's chronic respiratory failure and tracheostomy increase the likelihood of VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can predispose the patient to developing blood clots in the deep veins, which could potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if not managed appropriately.
4. Nosocomial infection: The patient's prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures, such as tracheostomy and chest tube placement, increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, including urinary tract infections (UTIs).
5. Barotrauma: The patient's history of pneumothorax and mechanical ventilation puts him"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted to the ICU after undergoing tracheostomy placement at a rehabilitation facility. The patient had right-sided pneumothorax and difficulty with ventilation, which improved after chest tube placement and removal. The patient's tracheostomy tube was replaced due to posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the trach, and a longer tracheostomy tube was placed. The patient's right-sided pneumothorax has improved, and the chest X-ray is stable since the chest tube was removed. The cause of the pneumothorax is uncertain, but it could be due to vigorous ventilation at the rehab facility or a spontaneous event. The patient's family has been reported to DPH for hospital complaints and has been dictating care decisions, including PEEP settings and long-acting insulin administration. An ethics consult has been requested. The patient also has a urinary tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, an inguinal hernia, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and hypothyroidism. The patient's mental status is altered but not delirium. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress due to tracheobronchomalacia (tracheomalacia, bronchomalacia).
2. Potential for recurrent right-sided pneumothorax or development of left-sided pneumothorax.
3. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, who was admitted to the ICU for tracheostomy placement. He had a right-sided pneumothorax and difficulty with ventilation, which required chest tube placement and removal. The patient is currently awaiting a long-term acute care (LTAC) bed.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 156/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Physical examination reveals crackles in the chest and trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to altered mental status. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactic acid levels. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several ongoing issues that need attention. Firstly, he has altered mental status, which is not due to delirium."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted to the ICU for tracheostomy placement. The patient had difficulty with ventilation and was found to have a right-sided pneumothorax. The tracheostomy tube was changed to a 12 cm length, which should reduce movement and improve stability. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 156/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 93 mg/dL to 292 mg/dL. The patient has an altered mental status but is not experiencing delirium. The patient has multiple comorbidities including hernia, tracheobronchomalacia, and chronic kidney disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of Parkinson's disease, anoxic brain injury, and chronic respiratory failure. He is currently on a ventilator in the ICU. The patient has had several medical issues, including spontaneous right-sided pneumothorax, severe tracheobronchomalacia with granulation tissue causing intermittent occlusion of tracheostomy, and a positional cuff leak when not lying on his right side. He requires insulin due to high blood glucose levels. The patient has allergies to sulfa medications and experienced anaphylaxis in the past. His current medications include lansoprazole, heparin sodium, amlodipine, ASA, levothyroxine, lasoprazole, and heparin injections. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 156/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's respiratory support consists of a tracheostomy tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set Vt of 400 mL, set RR of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and SpO2 of 100%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, anoxic brain injury, and chronic respiratory failure. He was admitted with spontaneous right-sided pneumothorax and severe tracheobronchomalacia causing intermittent occlusion of tracheostomy. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing positional cuff leak when not lying on his right side. He requires regular insulin due to high blood glucose levels. The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to sulfa medications. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 156/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the recent development of a testicular mass with bowel sounds auscultated over it. The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs anteriorly, no peripheral edema, and contractures in place. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's neurological assessment indicates unresponsiveness with no meaningful response to pain or loud voice. The patient's current plan includes trying CPAP 15, maintaining tracheostomy, and considering an ethics consult due to the patient's deteriorating condition and limited chances of meaningful neurological recovery. The patient is also at risk for developing ventil"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted from rehab after tracheostomy placement. He had a right-sided pneumothorax, which improved and the chest tube was removed. The patient's tracheostomy was replaced due to tracheobronchomalacia, but a stent was not placed. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 161/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on pressure support and has been tolerating it well. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective coping: The patient may experience difficulty adjusting to the changes in his healthcare environment and coping with the stress of being in the ICU.
2. Altered mental status: The patient may have altered mental status, but it is not delirium. This could be due to various factors such as sedatives, age-related changes, or underlying medical conditions.
3. Hernia, inguinal/femoral: The patient has a large scrotum on exam, indicating the presence of an inguinal hernia. This condition needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
4. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has tracheobronchomalacia, which can lead to airway collapse and obstruction. This can cause respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual who experienced a pneumothorax. They were put on pressure support in the morning and tolerated it throughout the day. The patient has allergies to sulfa antibiotics and has had anaphylaxis in the past. They received infusions of lansoprazole and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate between 65-66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/39-161/69 mmHg, respiratory rate between 19-22 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilator mode with set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 25 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O. The patient's ABG shows pH of 7.31, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 31 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 4.5 mEq/L. 

The patient's physical examination revealed that peripheral vascular pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments were not performed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 371 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) at 9.3 g/dL, elevated potassium (K+) at 31 mEq/L, and decreased sodium (Na+) at 138 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range. Radiology images are attached.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular culture of secretions should be done to prevent and detect early if VAP occurs.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as early ambulation and heparin infusion should be continued to prevent DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient is receiving lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, to reduce the risk of stress ulcers. Regular monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding is essential.
4. Barotrauma: The high peak inspiratory pressure may increase the risk of barotrauma. Close monitoring of chest radiographs and respiratory parameters is necessary to detect any signs of barotrauma.
5. Inguinal hernia: The patient has a history of an inguinal hernia. Regular assessment of the groin area for signs of hernia recurrence or complications is required."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who has been admitted to the ICU for tracheostomy placement. He has a history of right-sided pneumothorax, tracheobronchomalacia, and inguinal hernia. The patient's current condition includes ineffective coping, altered mental status (not delirium), and hospital-acquired conditions such as tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient may experience respiratory distress due to tracheobronchomalacia, which can lead to airway obstruction and difficulty with ventilation.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a history of right-sided pneumothorax, which can recur if proper precautions are not taken during tracheostomy placement or manipulation.
3. Inguinal Hernia: The presence of a large scrotum indicates an inguinal hernia, which may require surgical intervention to prevent complications like incarceration or strangulation.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels indicate hypernatremia, which can lead to dehydration, neurological dysfunction, and other complications if not managed properly.
5. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a growing sensitive Klebsiella infection, indicating a potential UTI. If left untreated, it can progress to a systemic infection.

The patient's chief complaint is chronic ventilation in the hospital with little evidence of change in alertness. The patient is unable to provide a history due to encephalopathy.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/45 mmHg to 189/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with the following settings: CPAP/PSV mode, tidal volume (Vt) of 310 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is overweight/obese, has diminished peripheral pulses, and shows signs of muscle wasting. Neurologically, the patient responds to noxious stimuli, is not oriented, shows decreased tone, and has no spontaneous movement. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, creatinine, glucose, and lactate, while showing decreased levels of hemoglobin, platelets, and potassium. The patient also has a history of altered mental status, tracheobronchomalacia, inguinal hernia, and chronic respiratory failure.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with chronic ventilator dependence in the hospital. There has been little evidence of change in alertness. The patient has been experiencing copious secretions, which require hourly suctioning but improves post aspiration of thick secretions. The patient is unable to provide history due to encephalopathy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures should be taken to prevent this, such as elevating the head of bed, performing daily wake-up calls, and monitoring respiratory secretions.
2. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has tracheobronchomalacia, which may require high PEEP levels to maintain adequate ventilation. This condition can lead to airway collapse and compromise breathing.
3. Inguinal hernia: The patient has an inguinal hernia, which does not appear to be incarcerated. However, monitoring for signs of incarceration or strangulation is important.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to prolonged immobility, the patient is at risk for developing DVT. Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin is recommended.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged ICU stay. Proton pump inhibitors should be continued for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
6. Glycemic control: Close monitoring of blood glucose"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who has undergone tracheostomy placement and chest tube placement for right-sided pneumothorax. The patient's current condition includes hypernatremia, difficulty with ventilation, and a pending transfer to a long-term acute care (LTAC) bed. The patient's medical history includes inguinal hernia, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypothyroidism, and hypertension.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure range of 179/75 mmHg to 112/45 mmHg, heart rate between 55-84 bpm, respiratory rate between 14-26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 100%, and temperature within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and glucose levels. The creatinine level is slightly elevated at 2.4 mg/dL, while other electrolytes such as sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), and magnesium (Mg++) are within normal range.

The patient's respiratory support includes tracheostomy tube placement, pressure support ventilation mode, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 15 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and spontaneous tidal volume (Vt) between 155-399 mL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is not mentioned in the note.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, symmetric chest expansion, trace lower extremity edema, and soft abdomen. Neurological examination shows no attentive response, no follow-up commands, and no assessed movement or tone.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient experienced respiratory distress post tracheostomy replacement at rehab due to posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the trach. Increased PEEP improved the condition, and the trach was changed to a 12 cm model yesterday.
2. Right-sided pneumothorax: The patient's right-sided pneumothorax has improved, and the chest X-ray is stable since the chest tube removal.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated at 150 mEq/L. Increase oral glucose-free water flushes from 50 cc to >150 cc every 6 hours and recheck sodium levels.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a growing sensitive Klebsiella infection. A 7-day course of ciprofloxacin has been completed.
5. Inguinal hernia: A large scrotum was noted on examination. Foley catheter and continuous bladder irrigation have been initiated.
6. Diabetes mellitus: Hold gl"

","The patient in the ICU is presenting with several medical conditions and complications. These include:

1. Pneumothorax: The patient's chief complaint is pneumothorax, which is an accumulation of air or gas in the space between the lung and the chest wall. This can cause the lung to collapse partially or completely.

2. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has been diagnosed with tracheobronchomalacia, which is a condition characterized by weakness or collapse of the walls of the trachea and bronchi. This can lead to breathing difficulties and recurrent infections.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high levels of sodium in their blood, known as hypernatremia. This can occur due to dehydration or an imbalance in water and electrolyte levels.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, indicated by an increase in creatinine levels. ARF can be caused by various factors such as low blood flow to the kidneys, infection, or exposure to toxins.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is showing signs of altered mental status, which may be secondary to anoxic brain injury. Anoxia refers to a lack of oxygen supply to the brain, leading to neurological complications.

6. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient has diabetes mellitus, for which they are receiving insulin therapy (Lantus and sliding scale). It is important to maintain proper glycemic control in"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, who was admitted from rehab after tracheostomy placement. He has a history of right-sided pneumothorax and difficulty with ventilation. The patient underwent chest tube placement and removal and is currently awaiting a transfer to a long-term acute care (LTAC) bed. He presented with respiratory distress following tracheostomy replacement at rehab due to posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the trach. The tracheostomy was changed to a 12 cm model yesterday. His right-sided pneumothorax improved and the chest X-ray has been stable since the chest tube was removed. The cause of the pneumothorax is uncertain and could be spontaneous, due to vigorous ventilation at rehab, or related to recent bronchoscopy with tracheostomy change.

The family is reporting the hospital to the Department of Public Health (DPH) and has been touching the patient, causing worsening respiratory status. They are also dictating care decisions, including PEEP settings and long-acting insulins. An ethics consult has been requested, and a family meeting is planned for next week when holiday coverage ends.

The patient has hypernatremia, which is being treated with increased oral free water flushes. His condition shows mild improvement, and the flushes will be increased to 250cc. A large scrotum was noted on examination, and a Foley catheter has been placed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who has been admitted to the ICU from a rehabilitation facility. He underwent a tracheostomy placement and had a right-sided pneumothorax, which was treated with chest tube placement and subsequent removal. The patient is currently awaiting a transfer to a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced respiratory distress after tracheostomy replacement at the rehabilitation facility. There was posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the tracheostomy, which improved with increased PEEP. The tracheostomy was changed to a 12 cm model yesterday, which should move around less than the previous model.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level was checked and found to be 148. Free water flushes have been increased from 150cc to 200cc every 4 hours (totaling 1200cc per day).

3. Family Dynamics: The family is reportedly touching the patient, causing worsening respiratory status and dictating care, particularly regarding PEEP and long-acting insulins. An ethics consult has been requested, and a plan for a family meeting next week has been made.

4. Inguinal Hernia: A large scrotum was noted on examination, indicating a possible inguinal hernia. Foley catheter and continuous bladder irrigation have been ordered.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill elderly male with a history of anoxic brain injury and tracheobronchomalacia who developed a pneumothorax. He is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. His vital signs are stable, but he has respiratory failure attributed to tracheobronchomalacia and recent decompensation due to pneumothorax. The patient also has hypernatremia, constipation, and altered mental status due to anoxic brain injury. He is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum, will be necessary.
2. Barotrauma: The patient's history of tracheobronchomalacia and recent pneumothorax indicate a predisposition to barotrauma. Monitoring for any signs of recurrent pneumothorax or other forms of barotrauma while on mechanical ventilation is important.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic heparin is being administered, but regular monitoring for symptoms of DVT, such as leg swelling or"

","Summary:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]M with an anoxic brain injury, tracheostomy, and peg tube who experienced a resolved pneumothorax. The patient's current condition shows no acute distress, with stable vital signs and normal oxygen saturation. They have a history of hypernatremia, constipation, anoxic brain injury, inguinal hernia, and tracheobronchomalacia. The patient is minimally responsive and stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient has been diagnosed with hypernatremia, which is a high concentration of sodium in the blood. This condition can lead to various complications such as dehydration, seizures, and neurological problems. It requires close monitoring and management with fluid replacement therapy.

2. Constipation: The patient has been experiencing constipation. If left untreated, it can lead to complications like fecal impaction, distension, and discomfort. The patient's bowel regimen should be continued to prevent constipation and promote regular bowel movements.

3. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient has an anoxic brain injury, which means there has been a lack of oxygen to the brain. This can result in long-term neurological deficits and disabilities. The patient's level of responsiveness indicates the severity of the injury. Ongoing neurological monitoring and rehabilitation will be important for the patient's recovery.

4. Inguinal Hernia: The patient has an inguinal hernia,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who was admitted from rehab after undergoing a tracheostomy placement. He has a history of right-sided pneumothorax and difficulty with ventilation. The patient had a chest tube placement and removal and is currently waiting for a LTAC bed. He is experiencing respiratory distress due to tracheal tissue blocking the tracheostomy, which improved with increased PEEP. The tracheostomy was changed to a 12 cm model. His right-sided pneumothorax improved and his chest X-ray is stable since the chest tube removal. The cause of his spontaneous breathing is still unclear, possibly due to vigorous ventilation at rehab or right pneumothorax.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is a major concern. It can be attributed to the tracheal tissue blocking the tracheostomy. The use of increased PEEP has helped improve the situation, but the patient needs close monitoring for any signs of worsening respiratory status.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient's right-sided pneumothorax has improved, but there is a possibility of recurrence. Continuous monitoring of his respiratory status and chest X-ray is necessary to detect any new or worsening pneumothorax.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient had an episode of hypernatremia, which has since resolved. It is important to continue with free water flush at 200 cc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, who underwent tracheostomy placement and is currently in the ICU. He has a history of right-sided pneumothorax and difficulty with ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/43-161/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. His weight has decreased from 100 kg to 87.8 kg since admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,460 mL and output of 1,200 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,260 mL. The patient is receiving various medications including Lansoprazole, Heparin Sodium, and other ICU medications. His lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's family dynamics are causing concern, with the family touching the patient and dictating care decisions. The patient also has hypernatremia, an inguinal hernia, diabetes managed with insulin, chronic kidney disease, and requires careful monitoring of renal function.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory distress due to tracheostomy placement and potential blockage.
2. Pneumothorax recurrence.
3. Infection due to prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.
4. Poor glycemic control.
5. Renal dysfunction"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, who was admitted to the ICU from rehab after undergoing a tracheostomy placement. The patient had right-sided pneumothorax and difficulty with ventilation, which improved following chest tube placement and removal. The patient's tracheostomy tube was replaced due to posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the trach. The patient's current condition is stable, with ongoing respiratory support on CPAP/PSV mode, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and spontaneous ventilation. The patient is also on various medications including lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy would be essential.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin are being implemented.
3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility can lead to pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and appropriate skin care are necessary to prevent this.
4. Inguinal hernia: The patient has a noted large scrotum, which may be indicative of an ing"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure who has undergone tracheostomy placement and is currently in the ICU. The patient has had multiple medical complications including right-sided pneumothorax, difficulty with ventilation, and hypernatremia. The patient's family dynamics have been a concern, as they have been reported to DPH and are causing worsening respiratory status by touching the patient and dictating care.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's history of chronic respiratory failure and recent tracheostomy placement increase the risk of respiratory distress. The posterior invagination of tracheal tissue blocking the tracheostomy tube and the need for chest tube placement suggest a high risk of recurrent respiratory issues.

2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a history of right-sided pneumothorax, which was initially treated with chest tube placement and later removed. There is uncertainty regarding whether the pneumothorax was spontaneous, due to vigorous ventilation at rehab, or caused by a bronchoscopy with tracheostomy change. The risk of recurrent pneumothorax should be closely monitored.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient had an episode of hypernatremia, which has since resolved. However, close monitoring of electrolyte balance is essential to prevent further imbalances.

4. Inguinal hernia: The patient has a large scrot"
