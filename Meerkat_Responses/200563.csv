","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He was unable to undergo hemodialysis (HD) due to a clotted graft and was found to have hyperglycemia. The patient has been noncompliant with his medications. In the emergency room, his vitals were stable with a blood glucose level of 580 mg/dL. He was started on intravenous insulin and antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam). The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and an allergy to Tapazole. He is currently experiencing fatigue, nausea, and has a possible right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 101-108 beats per minute, blood pressure of 124/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery and is receiving regular insulin at a rate of 13 units per hour. The patient's laboratory results show a glucose level of 259-636 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.6-4.6 mEq/L, sodium level of 130-135 mEq/L, chloride level of 98-106 mEq/L,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He was found to have hyperglycemia and a possible right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's vitals are stable, and he has been started on IV insulin and antibiotics. He has a history of diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and methimazole allergy. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue and nausea. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and his electrolytes are imbalanced. He has an elevated troponin level and subtle EKG changes. The patient's assessment includes DKA, pneumonia, and ESRD. The plan includes treating the DKA with insulin, pneumonia with antibiotics, and monitoring the EKG changes. The patient's failed AV fistula needs to be discussed with surgery, and he should undergo hemodialysis tomorrow. The steroid dose will be adjusted daily. The patient is critically ill and requires ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe hypoglycemia: Insulin therapy for DKA management may lead to hypoglycemia if not carefully monitored.
2. Infection: The patient has pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing further infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay.
3. Cardiac complications: Elevated troponin levels indicate possible cardiac involvement,"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome,
   ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia. Gap initially 23.
   - Insulin gtt per protocol with q1h fsbs, then transition back to
   lantus with ISS
   - NPO for now
   - NS @ 100c/h + K (conservative given potential for fluid overload in
   this HD pt awaiting access) -> D5NS when FSG <200
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] c/s in AM
   - Holding po steroids for now given aspiration risk with altered mental
   status. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 276**] PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] by Rheum and unclear whether this has
   benefited his glycemic control. Could give low dose IV steroids
   (methylpred 20mg) if concern for BP but otherwise ok to hold overnight
   - Low dose insulin gtt for now with D5W
   .
   # Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on exam.
   - Cont Vanc, zosyn, cipro for double coverage
 plan for short course
   unless clear signs of infection
   - F/U sputum cx, blood cx
   .
   # Elevated trop: Likely demand in the setting of DKA in this pt with
   ESRD as CK elevated; pt does have TWI which is consistent with past EKG
   changes associated with demand.
   - Trend CE, tele, repeat EKG in AM
   - Restart aspirin if cleared by surgery
   .
   # Nonworking AVF: presumed rethrombosed
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Will take to OR in AM if medically stable
   .
   # ESRD: On HD, missed session today.  No acute indication for HD - mild
   hyperkalemia in setting of DKA is likely not reflective of true level.
   Satting well currently.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal aware, will need to obtain access as above prior to HD
   .
   # HTN: Controlled currently.
   - Restart home BP meds (see below)
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   .
   # Medication rec: Holding on home po meds for now which pt takes in AM
   given concern for aspiration with poor mental status.
   - metoprolol 50mg tid, doxazosin 4mg qhs, diltiazem 180mg SR [**Hospital1 **],
   minoxidil 2.5mg [**Hospital1 **], levothyroxine 75mcg, rosuvastatin 20mg,
   allopurinol 100mg, nephrocaps, metoclopramide 10mg qid prn n/v,
   simethicone 80mg qid prn bloating, prednisone 15mg daily (confirm
   dose), compazine 5mg q6h prn, tramadol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] prn, bisacodyl prn,
   senna prn, colace prn
   - can switch IV ppi back to omeprazole 20mg daily
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full - discussed at length with HCP. Pt has been DNR/DNI in
   the past but with recent discussions, uncertain of current feelings as
   he has been grateful for resuscitative efforts after the fact.  Ok to
   intubate for reversible situation (e.g. PNA and fluid overload).
   Pressors ok.  Less certain about CPR/defibrillation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
- The patient's blood glucose level is currently at 53 mg/dL, indicating hypoglycemia.
- The patient has a fistula that is clogged, requiring hemodialysis (HD) access.
- The patient is on multiple medications including insulin, antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Piperacillin), and other ICU medications.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/82 to 142/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature within normal range.
- Physical examination reveals coarse bilateral breath sounds, regular heart rhythm without murmurs or abnormal findings, and no signs of distress.
- Lab results show elevated creatinine levels, low potassium levels, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal glucose levels.
- The patient's medical history includes noncompliance with insulin, hyperglycemia potentially precipitated by pneumonia, and previous hospitalizations.
- The plan includes administering insulin per protocol, conservatively managing fluid and electrolytes, obtaining access for hemodialysis, and holding steroids due to aspiration"

   ESRD as CK elevated; pt does have TWI which is consistent with past EKG
   changes associated with demand.
   - Trend CE, tele, repeat EKG in AM
   - Given low suspicion and possible surgical procedure, will hold ASA

   # Nonworking AVF: presumed rethrombosed
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Will take to OR in AM if medically stable
   .
   # ESRD: On HD, missed session today.  No acute indication for HD - mild
   hyperkalemia in setting of DKA which is likely not reflective of true
   level. Satting well currently.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal aware, will need to obtain access in AM as above prior to HD
   .
   # HTN: Controlled currently. Holding usual po BP meds for now due to
   mental status. Could consider IV hydral for SBP >180.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue

","The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF) presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 136/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals coarse bilateral bronchial sounds, regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, and no jugular venous distention (JVD) or liver auscultation abnormalities. 

Laboratory results show a blood glucose level of 53 mg/dL, low potassium at 3.6 mEq/L, elevated magnesium at 29 mEq/L, elevated chloride at 149 mEq/L, and elevated troponin-T levels. Other lab values include a creatinine level of 7.4 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 26 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 71 mg/dL. 

The patient has been started on insulin per protocol and is receiving IV fluids. Antibiotics have been initiated for suspected pneumonia. An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.73, PaCO2 of 19 mmHg, PaO2 of 142 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3) level of 29 mEq/L. 

The patient's medical history includes a non-functioning arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and hypothyroidism. The patient's code status is currently uncertain, with a previous do-not-resuscitate (DNR)/do-not-intubate (DNI) status but recent discussions suggesting a full code status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening of the patient's ESRD, potential for fluid overload due to the conservative approach with IV fluids, ongoing management of DKA, monitoring for signs of infection or sepsis given the presence of pneumonia and elevated inflammatory markers, and close monitoring of electrolyte imbalances."

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He has a nonfunctioning graft due to presumed rethrombosis and is scheduled for a fistula thrombectomy. The patient also has mild hyperkalemia, which is likely not reflective of his true potassium level due to DKA. He is currently on insulin gtt with fasting serum glucose (FS) in the 100s and is holding aspirin prior to surgery. He is also on beta-blockers, statins, and prednisone.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 134/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and troponin-T levels, but these have been flat over multiple sets of enzymes, indicating no rise in CK-MB. His blood glucose levels are high, ranging from 259 to 636 mg/dL. His potassium levels are mildly elevated at 5.3 mEq/L. Other lab values, including creatinine, hemoglobin, and platelet count, are within normal ranges"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He has a nonworking graft that is presumed to be rethrombosed and requires a fistula thrombectomy. The patient also has ESRD, pneumonia, elevated troponin levels, hypertension, immunosuppression, hypothyroidism, and limited capacity for self-care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fistula thrombectomy - potential complications include bleeding, infection, or failure to restore blood flow.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - potential complications include cerebral edema, diabetic coma, and kidney injury.
3. Pneumonia - potential complications include worsening infection, sepsis, and respiratory failure.
4. Elevated troponin levels - potential complications include myocardial infarction or cardiac dysfunction.
5. Hypertension - potential complications include stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.
6. Immunosuppression - potential complications include increased risk of infections.
7. Hypothyroidism - potential complications include fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance.
8. Limited capacity for self-care - potential complications include increased risk of medical errors and poor adherence to treatment plans.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted to the ICU due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and is currently being treated for pneumonia.

Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Nonworking arteriovenous fistula (AVF): The patient has a nonworking AVF, which is likely due to rethrombosis. This complication may affect the patient's access for hemodialysis.
2. ESRD: The patient has ESRD, and there is no acute indication for hemodialysis at the moment. However, the patient's mild hyperkalemia in the setting of DKA may not be reflective of his true potassium level. Close monitoring of electrolytes is necessary.
3. DKA: The patient is noncompliant with insulin therapy, leading to hyperglycemia. DKA can lead to severe complications such as cerebral edema, cardiac arrhythmias, and multi-organ dysfunction. Insulin therapy will be continued, and the patient's glycemic control needs to be closely monitored.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered to cover hospital-acquired and community-acquired pathogens. Close follow-up with sputum cultures and blood cultures is necessary to guide antibiotic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of limited insight into his disease process, refusing medications, and threatening to leave against medical advice (AMA). He has a planned fistula thrombectomy scheduled for tomorrow and is currently on D5 with insulin gtt with fasting serum glucose in the 100s. The patient is holding aspirin prior to the operation and has been started on beta blockers, statins, and prednisone at home dose.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombosis: The patient's planned fistula thrombectomy indicates a pre-existing vascular issue. There is a potential risk of further thrombosis or complications during the procedure.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient is on D5 with insulin gtt, which suggests ongoing management of hyperglycemia. However, there is a risk of hypoglycemia if insulin dosage is not adjusted appropriately.
3. Medication Non-Compliance: The patient's history of refusing medications and threatening to leave AMA raises concerns about compliance with prescribed medications after discharge.
4. Infection: The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, suggesting the presence of an ongoing infection or risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic stewardship should be maintained.
5. Cardiovascular Events: The patient is on beta blockers and statins, indicating underlying cardiovascular disease. There is a potential risk of cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome,
   ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA
   .
   # Nonworking graft: presumed rethrombosed.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Plan for OR today for fistula thrombectomy
   .
   # ESRD:  Per renal team, no acute indication for HD (mild hyperkalemia
   seen in setting of DKA is likely not reflective of true level).
   Currently without access but does not need temp line.  Last HD prior to
   admission. Satting well currently.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal aware, will need to obtain access as above
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Plan for HD after thrombectomy
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed.  FS over last 12 hours range 69-157.
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 276**] (appreciate recs)
   - Insulin SS as written with 10 u Lantus QAm and 6 untis QPM
   .
   # Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile.
   - On Vanco/Zosyn; plan for short course unless sx of worsening infxn
   (should define in POE)
   - F/U vanco trough from this morning (vanco will be dosed QHD
 will
   confirm order)
   - F/U sputum cx, blood cx (NGTD)
   .
   # Elevated trop: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of enzymes;
   no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is due to
   ESRD.
   - Trend CE, tele
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # HTN: Controlled currently.
   - Restarted home BP meds (will hold today because going for HD)
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production. Will attempt to confirm with PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this morning to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian.
   - Consider psych eval this morning
   .
   .
   # FEN: 75 cc/hr D5W until after surgery, replete electrolytes (K only
   if low), regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full - discussed at length with HCP. Pt has been DNR/DNI in
   the past but with recent discussions, uncertain of current feelings as
   he has been grateful for resuscitative efforts after the fact.  Ok to
   intubate for reversible situation (e.g. PNA and fluid overload).
   Pressors ok.  Less certain about CPR/defibrillation.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 will re-evaluate
   post-op

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

The patient has been noncompliant with insulin therapy, leading to hyperglycemia. There is also a concern for pneumonia or other infection, which may have contributed to the DKA. The patient's blood sugar levels have been ranging from 636 mg/dL to 259 mg/dL over the past 24 hours, indicating uncontrolled diabetes.

The patient has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.8, hematocrit (Hct) of 34.7, platelet count (Plt) of 372, creatinine (Cr) of 7.3, and troponin-T levels of 0.31. The patient's blood gases show a TCO2 of 26, glucose levels of 636 mg/dL, and lactic acid levels of 1.4 mmol/L. Other lab results include an INR of 1.0, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T levels of 68/5/0.31, Ca++ of 8.6 mg/dL, Mg++ of 2.4 mg/dL, and PO4 of 3.3 mg/dL.

The patient is currently being treated with insulin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 134/81 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has multiple medical conditions, including ESRD, PVD, CHF, DKA, and possible pneumonia. There is a plan for a fistula thrombectomy today, and the patient will require hemodialysis (HD) post-procedure. The patient's electrolytes need to be trended, and access for HD will be obtained.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include worsening infection, fluid overload, further electrolyte imbalances, and complications related to the fistula thrombectomy surgery. Close monitoring and management of the patient's blood sugar levels, electrolytes, and renal function will be crucial during his ICU stay."

   -pt continues on dextrose drip and insulin gtt
   -pt hypotensive to SBP 75 after receiving minoxidil.  Received 250ml NS
   bolus. Now refusing blood pressures.
   -Pt progressively refusing more care; first no blood pressures, then no
   finger sticks (insulin gtt off, last check 132), now removed monitor
   leads.
   PSYCH RECS (INITIAL):
-For now, pursue with procedures to which pt and HCP agree
-If he continues to refuse treatment, should consult legal
towards modifying guardianship to include substituted judgment.
Though he lacks capacity, we cannot take him to surgery without
having a judge declare him incompetent.  Continued discussion of
alternative options around his care, such that if he agrees to a
recommended treatment to which his HCP also agrees, would do it.
-Both pt's sister and father state that, were he thinking
clearly, he would want to have HD and would also agree to the
surgery to revise the graft; this has been witnessed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 391**]

PSYCH RECS (FOLLOW-UP):
1) speak with his [**Last Name (LF) 1612**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] to confirm their support of surgery/treatment as
he is agreeing to care
2) in general, given his cognitive dysfunction, it would be best to have a guard
[**Doctor First Name **] appointment for medical decision making (not just admitted to a nursing faci

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome,
   ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA
   .
   # Nonworking graft: Presumed rethrombosed. Went to OR on [**3-4**] for graft
   thrombectomy and revision, was cleared from OR to use graft for HD.
   However, prior to HD graft went down. Awaiting repeat procedure in OR
   today. Will need temp line placement if not able to secure working
   graft. Renal team aware
 no acute need for HD given electrolytes from
   yesterday PM so have held off overnight.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Plan for OR today for graft repair, ? temp line placement
   .
   # ESRD:  Per renal team, no acute indication for HD (mild hyperkalemia
   seen in setting of DKA is likely not reflective of true level).
   Currently without access.  Last HD prior to admission.
   - Trend lytes if patient will agree to labs
   - Renal aware, will need to obtain access as above
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Plan for HD after thrombectomy via functioning graft or temporary HD
   line
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed to AG = 10 as of yesterday in the OR mid-afternoon (refused AM
   labs). Last 5 FS all in 100s range; pt refused further FS overnight.
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 276**] (appreciate recs)
   - Currently off insulin gtt, no sliding scale active at this time
   - will try to start his home dose insulin regimen when patient is able
   to eat
   - trend electrolytes if possible
   .
   # Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile.
   - On Vanco/Zosyn; plan for short course unless sx of worsening infxn
   (should define in POE); will consider discontinuing antibiotics and
   following up with a CXR as outpatient for any interval change.
   - F/U vanco level from yesterday afternoon elevated to 152, likely
   artifact. Will attempt re-check today if patient will agree to labs
   - F/U sputum cx, blood cx (NGTD)
   - discuss today
s CXR with radiology re: RLL opacity
   .
   # Elevated trop: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of enzymes;
   no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is due to
   ESRD.
   - Trend CE, tele
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient actually hypotensive overnight at last check,
   refused further checks after midnight.
   - Trend BP if pt will allow
   - Hold home BP meds for now
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production.
   - Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this morning to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian. Psych recs as above. Currently, pt cannot
   leave AMA. Will continue to work with family. Patient may need
   guardian.
   - F/U legal recs
   - F/U further psych recs
   .

   # FEN: 75 cc/hr D5W until after surgery, replete electrolytes (K only
   if low), regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full - discussed at length with HCP. Pt has been DNR/DNI in
   the past but with recent discussions, uncertain of current feelings as
   he has been grateful for resuscitative efforts after the fact.  Ok to
   intubate for reversible situation (e.g. PNA and fluid overload).
   Pressors ok.  Less certain about CPR/defibrillation.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 will re-evaluate

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He underwent graft thrombectomy and revision but the graft went down. The patient is currently in the ICU and awaiting another procedure for graft repair or temporary line placement. He has ESRD and requires hemodialysis (HD) but currently lacks access. The patient also has pneumonia and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. His troponin levels are elevated, but it is likely due to ESRD. The patient is hypotensive and refusing further blood pressure checks. He has been declared to lack capacity to make medical decisions and a limited guardian has been appointed. The patient's code status is full code, but there is uncertainty about CPR/defibrillation. The patient's current medications include insulin, prednisone, levothyroxine, sevelamer, and heparin. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 0/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Graft failure: The patient's graft went down after the initial surgery, which may indicate a potential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of thrombectomy, graft revision surgery, and hypotension. The patient has been refusing care, including blood pressures and finger sticks. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 0/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has undergone several interventions, including the administration of antibiotics and blood products. Lab results show elevated levels of creatinine and glucose, as well as abnormal white blood cell count and platelet count. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing hypotension and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite fluid resuscitation, indicating potential inadequate perfusion and increased risk of organ damage.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and administration of antibiotics suggest a possible infection, which could be related to the recent surgery or another source.
3. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which can be caused by various factors such as low blood flow, medication toxicity, or underlying kidney disease.
4. Hyperglycemia: The elevated glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control, which can increase the risk of infections and delay wound healing.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The decreased platelet count may increase"

   -Pt progressively refusing more care; first no blood pressures, then no

   PSYCH RECS (INITIAL):
-For now, pursue with procedures to which pt and HCP agree
-If he continues to refuse treatment, should consult legal
towards modifying guardianship to include substituted judgment.
Though he lacks capacity, we cannot take him to surgery without
having a judge declare him incompetent.  Continued discussion of
alternative options around his care, such that if he agrees to a
recommended treatment to which his HCP also agrees, would do it.
-Both pt's sister and father state that, were he thinking
clearly, he would want to have HD and would also agree to the
surgery to revise the graft; this has been witnessed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 391**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11073**] and by the primary team
-[**Month (only) 60**] use low dose quetiapine 12.5-25mg for agitation
-Pt cannot leave AMA
PSYCH RECS (FOLLOW-UP):
1) speak with his [**Last Name (LF) 1612**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] to confirm their support of surgery/treatment as
he is agreeing to care
2) in general, given his cognitive dysfunction, it would be best to have a guard
[**Doctor First Name **] appointment for medical decision making (not just admitted to a nursing faci
lity) given his processing difficulties and repeated problems with poor self car
3) he does not appear immediately at risk for suicide or harm to others and his
statements are more reflective of his frustration and mild confusion than true i
ntent to end his life

","The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and tachycardia. The patient underwent a thrombectomy on [**2128-3-4**] and is scheduled for graft revision surgery on [**2128-3-5**]. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a blood pressure of 51/0 mmHg and a heart rate of 104 bpm. The patient is also experiencing agitation and has refused blood pressures and finger sticks. The patient's glucose levels are elevated, ranging from 259 to 636 mg/dL. 

The patient has a history of allergies to Tapazole (Oral) with a rash. The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Piperacillin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). 

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelets (Plt). The creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal range. Troponin-T levels are within normal range, but CK and CKMB levels are elevated. Glucose levels are significantly elevated. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2071 mL and output of 275 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1796 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support but is not on oxygen. The patient's AB"

   -plan for graft revision as an add on case for OR on [**2128-3-5**]
   -NPO after midnight, coags in AM, repeat vancomycin level
   -pt continues on dextrose drip and insulin gtt
   -pt hypotensive to SBP 75 after receiving minoxidil.  Received 250ml NS
   bolus. Now refusing blood pressures.
   -Pt progressively refusing more care; first no blood pressures, then no
   finger sticks (insulin gtt off, last check 132), now removed monitor
   leads.
   PSYCH RECS (INITIAL):
-For now, pursue with procedures to which pt and HCP agree
-If he continues to refuse treatment, should consult legal
towards modifying guardianship to include substituted judgment.
Though he lacks capacity, we cannot take him to surgery without
having a judge declare him incompetent.  Continued discussion of
alternative options around his care, such that if he agrees to a
recommended treatment to which his HCP also agrees, would do it.
-Both pt's sister and father state that, were he thinking
clearly, he would want to have HD and would also agree to the
surgery to revise the graft; this has been witnessed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 391**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11073**] and by the primary team
-[**Month (only) 60**] use low dose quetiapine 12.5-25mg for agitation
-Pt cannot leave AMA
PSYCH RECS (FOLLOW-UP):
1) speak with his [**Last Name (LF) 1612**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] to confirm their support of surgery/treatment as
he is agreeing to care
2) in general, given his cognitive dysfunction, it would be best to have a guard
[**Doctor First Name **] appointment for medical decision making (not just admitted to a nursing faci
lity) given his processing difficulties and repeated problems with poor self car
3) he does not appear immediately at risk for suicide or harm to others and his
statements are more reflective of his frustration and mild confusion than true i
ntent to end his life

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome,
   ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA
   .
   # Nonworking graft: Presumed rethrombosed. Went to OR on [**3-4**] for graft
   thrombectomy and revision, was cleared from OR to use graft for HD.
   However, prior to HD graft went down. Awaiting repeat procedure in OR
   today. Will need temp line placement if not able to secure working
   graft. Renal team aware
 no acute need for HD given electrolytes from
   yesterday PM so have held off overnight.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Plan for OR today for graft repair, ? temp line placement
   .
   # ESRD:  Per renal team, no acute indication for HD (mild hyperkalemia
   seen in setting of DKA is likely not reflective of true level).
   Currently without access.  Last HD prior to admission.
   - Trend lytes if patient will agree to labs
   - Renal aware, will need to obtain access as above
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Plan for HD after thrombectomy
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed to AG = 10 as of yesterday in the OR mid-afternoon (refused AM
   labs). Last 5 FS all in 100s range; pt refused further FS overnight.
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 276**] (appreciate recs)
   - Currently off insulin gtt, no sliding scale active at this time
   .
   # Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile.
   - On Vanco/Zosyn; plan for short course unless sx of worsening infxn
   (should define in POE)
   - F/U vanco level from yesterday afternoon elevated to 152, likely
   artifact. Will attempt re-check today if patient will agree to labs
   - F/U sputum cx, blood cx (NGTD)
   - F/U CXR if patient will allow
   .
   # Elevated trop: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of enzymes;
   no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is due to
   ESRD.
   - Trend CE, tele
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient actually hypotensive overnight at last check,
   refused further checks after midnight.
   - Trend BP if pt will allow
   - Hold home BP meds for now
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production.
   - Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this morning to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian. Psych recs as above. Currently, pt cannot
   leave AMA. Will continue to work with family. Patient may need
   guardian.
   - F/U legal recs
   - F/U further psych recs
   .
   .
   # FEN: 75 cc/hr D5W until after surgery, replete electrolytes (K only
   if low), regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full - discussed at length with HCP. Pt has been DNR/DNI in
   the past but with recent discussions, uncertain of current feelings as
   he has been grateful for resuscitative efforts after the fact.  Ok to
   intubate for reversible situation (e.g. PNA and fluid overload).
   Pressors ok.  Less certain about CPR/defibrillation.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 will re-evaluate

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient underwent graft thrombectomy and revision in the operating room (OR) on [**2128-3-4**], but the graft went down, and a repeat procedure is planned for today. The patient's current condition includes nonworking graft, ESRD, DKA, pneumonia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Graft thrombosis: The patient's graft went down after the initial thrombectomy and revision surgery, indicating a potential complication of graft thrombosis. A repeat procedure is planned to address this issue.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to his immunocompromised state from ESRD, diabetes, and recent hospitalizations. Pneumonia coverage has been initiated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has mild hyperkalemia, which may require close monitoring and treatment.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's history of CHF and recent fluid administration could predispose him to fluid overload, potentially leading to pulmonary edema or heart failure exacerbation.
5. Hypotension: The patient has been"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute respiratory distress. The patient has a history of allergies to Tapazole (Oral) and rash. They have received multiple courses of antibiotics including Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Piperacillin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is currently on infusions of other ICU medications and has ongoing fluid resuscitation with IV fluids.

Vital signs show a temperature within normal range, slightly elevated heart rate, stable blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and good oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals stable vital signs with a slight decrease in blood pressure. The patient has received a total of 2,071 mL of IV fluids with an output of 275 mL, resulting in a fluid balance of 1,796 mL.

Blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal troponin-T levels. Other lab results indicate elevated PT and PTT, normal INR, increased CK and CKMB levels, normal lactic acid levels, normal calcium and magnesium levels, and slightly low phosphate levels.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with good oxygenation. Physical examination shows no specific abnormalities, but there is a mention of an image that could not be loaded.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and a non-functioning arteriovenous graft (AVG) for hemodialysis (HD). The patient underwent surgery for graft thrombectomy and revision, but the graft failed again. He was successfully treated with another revision and HD using the graft.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced a brief episode of hypotension overnight, which responded well to a fluid bolus. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure is necessary, especially after HD.

2. ESRD: The patient has ESRD and relies on the AVG for HD. The graft functioned appropriately for HD yesterday but may still be at risk of rethrombosis. Close monitoring of graft function and adherence to renal recommendations are important.

3. DKA: The patient is noncompliant with insulin therapy, leading to hyperglycemia. There may be a risk of recurrent DKA. Monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjustment of insulin therapy are crucial.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has risk factors for pneumonia, including recent hospitalizations and HD. Broad coverage for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) is recommended, and further evaluation of chest X-ray findings is needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 with insulin autoantibody syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF) presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and a non-functioning hemodialysis (HD) graft. The patient underwent surgery for graft thrombectomy and revision, and the graft functioned appropriately for HD yesterday. However, it went down again, and another procedure was performed successfully. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Non-working graft: The patient's HD graft is not functioning properly, which can lead to the accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances.
2. DKA: The patient has a history of DKA, a serious complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketone production, and metabolic acidosis. This condition needs to be managed carefully with insulin therapy and fluid replacement.
3. ESRD: The patient has ESRD, requiring regular HD sessions to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances and remove waste products from the body.

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of DKA and renal failure. The patient underwent a fistula revision and thrombectomy in the OR. The patient also received dialysis yesterday. The patient experienced transient hypotension, which was presumed to be related to anti-HTN medication. This has since resolved.

The patient has allergies to Tapazole (Oral) (Methimazole), resulting in a rash. The last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) at 05:00 PM.

The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis. Other medications include ICU medications and other medications, but specific names are not mentioned.

The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, are unchanged from admission except for the noted above and below.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 106 bpm (91-116 bpm), blood pressure of 145/75 mmHg (90-145/75 mmHg), respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (14-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's current weight is 62.7 kg, which is the same as his admission weight. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 677 mL, with 240 mL taken orally, 437 mL given intravenously, and a total output of 1175 mL. Urine output is 175 mL. 

The patient is not on respiratory support, but has an ABG result of 29. Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not performed, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment not assessed.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin at 9.6 g/dL, white blood cell count at 178 K/uL, sodium at 64 mg/dL, potassium at 4.7 mg/dL, chloride at 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate at 16 mg/dL, BUN at 29.1%, creatinine at 7.4, blood glucose at 636 mg/dL, and urine ketones at 7.5 K/uL. Other lab values include WBC at 11.8, Hct at 34.7, platelet count at 372, TropT at 0.31, TCO2 at 26, and lactic acid at 1.4 mmol/L. Electrolyte levels and other lab values are within normal range.

The patient is diagnosed with renal failure, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), noncompliance, and potential pneumonia. The patient's IV access is difficult, and the current PIV line is in the foot, with plans to attempt PIV access in the arm.

The patient's plan includes continued ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is unknown, and the disposition is planned for transfer to the floor."

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome,
   ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA and non-working HD graft.
   .
   # Nonworking graft: Presumed rethrombosed  after OR on [**3-4**] for graft
   thrombectomy and revision, was cleared from OR to use graft for HD.
   Underwent repeat procedure in OR [**3-5**]. Graft functioned appropriately
   for HD yesterday.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient with brief episode of hypotension on [**2128-3-4**]
   but responded well to fluid bolus, currently normotensive
   - Follow blood pressure post HD
   - Continue home dose of metoprolol 50 TID with strict holding
   parameters
   - Continue to hold home minoxidil, dilt, doxazosyn
   .
   # ESRD:  Graft used successfully for HD [**3-4**] PM post-revision.
   - Trend lytes if patient will agree to labs
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   - F/U renal recs
   -
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed with normoglycemia. Currently on home lantus and sliding scale.
   Episode of ASX hypoglycemia this AM.
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 276**] (appreciate recs)
   - Continue sliding scale per most recent [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs as well as home
   dose long acting insulin; consider reducing home dose of glargine due
   to recent hypoglycemia by d/c evening dose.
   - Will discuss best home SS with [**Last Name (un) 276**] team as patient has been
   non-compliant in past and no revisions to scale in some time
   .
   # ? Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile. Still no read on CXR from yesterday, today
   continued opacity in RLL. Abx stopped yesterday given afebrile, normal
   white count.
   - F/U final reads of CXR [**3-5**] and [**3-6**]
   - Consider resume Abx if febrile
   .
   # Elevated troponin: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of
   enzymes; no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is
   due to ESRD.
   - Trend CE, telemetry
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production.
   - Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this admission to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian. Psych recs as above. Currently, pt cannot
   leave AMA. Will continue to work with family. Patient needs guardian.

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented to the hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and a non-functioning hemodialysis graft. The patient underwent two surgeries for graft thrombectomy and revision, but the graft still did not function properly. He was eventually cleared to undergo hemodialysis using the graft.

2. Blood pressure: The patient experienced a brief episode of hypotension but responded well to a fluid bolus and is currently normotensive. It is recommended to continue monitoring blood pressure post-hemodialysis and restart metoprolol at home.
3. ESRD: The patient successfully used the graft for hemodialysis yesterday after the revision. It is advised to trend electrolytes if the patient agrees to labs, administer Epo in hemodialysis, and continue sevelamer. Hold calcitriol and PO iron until further renal recommendations.

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome,
   ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA and non-working HD graft.
   .
   # Nonworking graft: Presumed rethrombosed. Went to OR on [**3-4**] for graft
   thrombectomy and revision, was cleared from OR to use graft for HD.
   However, prior to HD graft went down. Underwent repeat procedure in OR
   [**3-5**]. Graft functioned appropriately for HD yesterday.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient with brief episode of hypotension on [**2128-3-4**]
   but responded well to fluid bolus, currently normotensive
   - Follow blood pressure post HD
   - Continue home dose of metoprolol 50 TID
   - Continue to hold home minoxidil, dilt, doxazosyn
   .
   # ESRD:  Graft used successfully for HD yesterday PM post-revision.
   - Trend lytes if patient will agree to labs
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   - F/U renal recs
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed to AG = 10 as of yesterday in the OR mid-afternoon (refused AM
   labs).  Last two FS low although had not eaten much, requesting
   breakfast this AM
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 276**] (appreciate recs)
   - Continue sliding scale per most recent [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs
   - Will discuss best home SS with [**Last Name (un) 276**] team as patient has been
   non-compliant in past and no revisions to scale in some time
   - Trend electrolytes if possible (AG = 11 today)
   .
   # Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile. Still no read on CXR from yesterday, today
   continued opacity in RLL. Abx stopped yesterday given afebrile, normal
   white count.
   - F/U final reads of CXR [**3-5**] and [**3-6**]
   - Consider resume Abx if febrile
   .
   # Elevated troponin: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of
   enzymes; no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is
   due to ESRD.
   - Trend CE, telemetry
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production.
   - Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this admission to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian. Psych recs as above. Currently, pt cannot
   leave AMA. Will continue to work with family. Patient needs guardian.
   - F/U legal recs
   - F/U further psych recs
   .
   # FEN: 50 cc/hr D5W, replete electrolytes (K only if low), regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals (1 in foot currently)
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full - discussed at length with HCP. Pt has been DNR/DNI in
   the past but with recent discussions, uncertain of current feelings as
   he has been grateful for resuscitative efforts after the fact.  Ok to
   intubate for reversible situation (e.g. PNA and fluid overload).
   Pressors ok.  Less certain about CPR/defibrillation.
   # Disposition:  observe in the peridialysis period, if hemodynamically
   stable then call out to floor

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and a non-working hemodialysis (HD) graft. The patient underwent surgery for graft thrombectomy and revision, but the graft went down again. He eventually had a successful HD using the revised graft.

The patient experienced an episode of hypotension, which was treated with a fluid bolus. His blood pressure is currently within normal limits. He is being monitored closely for any changes in blood pressure post-HD. The patient's ESRD is managed with the use of a graft for HD. His electrolytes will be trended, and he will receive Epo in HD, Zemplar in HD, continue with sevelamer, hold calcitriol and PO iron, and follow up with renal recommendations.

The patient has a history of DKA and noncompliance with insulin. His blood glucose levels are elevated, but the gap has closed from 23 to 10 as of yesterday. He will continue with sliding scale insulin per recent recommendations, and his electrolytes will be trended as well.

The patient has pneumonia, and broad coverage for healthcare-associated community-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) is being given due to recent hospitalizations and HD. The patient's breath"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of heart disease, who was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) without using ultrafiltration (UF) due to low blood pressure. The patient's blood pressure improved after restarting metoprolol at a dose of 25 mg and titrating it up. The patient also had sutures removed from his foot, and due to a lack of IV access above the belt, he remained in the unit. The patient's fingerstick glucose level was measured at 46 and he agreed to drink cranberry juice. The patient is allergic to Tapazole (Oral) and has a rash as a reaction. The patient received piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for antibiotics until [**2128-3-4**] at 05:00 PM. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and renal failure. The patient has a history of diabetes and is currently on insulin therapy. He also has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is undergoing maintenance dialysis via a fistula.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 116/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is alert and oriented, with good interaction.

The patient has been experiencing intermittent refusal of lab draws and finger sticks, which is a concern for noncompliance and potential complications in managing his medical conditions. The patient's renal function tests show elevated creatinine levels, indicating ongoing renal impairment.

The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 53 to 636 mg/dL. This suggests poor glycemic control, which is a common complication in patients with DKA. The patient's white blood cell count has been relatively stable, indicating no significant infection at this time.

The patient's physical examination reveals bronchial breath sounds bilaterally, tachycardia, and soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. There are no other significant findings mentioned in the physical exam.
