","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF), presenting with acute on chronic systolic failure and evidence of right-sided heart failure. The patient is currently admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. The patient experienced an episode of tachyarrhythmia, which may have been secondary to milrinone. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the high 90s to 100 range. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, including a chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, troponin T, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Imaging reveals moderate interstitial pulmonary edema, but pneumonia is not entirely excluded. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and potential hypervolemic hypernatremia secondary to CHF. The patient is on multiple medications including Lasix, milrinone, furosemide, aspirin, zocor, and synthroid. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows retrocardiac opacity and right middle lobe opacity, which could indicate pneumonia. Given the patient's symptoms of a dry cough and residence in a nursing home, there is a potential source for infection. Therefore,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. The patient has a history of acute on chronic systolic failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%. Despite receiving milrinone and phenylephrine, the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAPs) remain in the 60s. The patient is still anasarca and has improved urine output after rounds.

The patient has a coronary artery disease with a chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's echocardiogram (ECHO) is negative at OSH, and they are on aspirin and Zocor. The patient's rhythm is unclear, alternating between sinus rhythm and junctional rhythm. The patient has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and is on metoprolol.

The patient's left lower lobe (LLL) collapse is improving, as shown by the recent chest X-ray (CXR) that reveals airless LLL and right basilar consolidation. The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, which raises concern for pneumonia. Sputum cultures are pending, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and c"

   .
   # PUMP: EF 15%.  Decompensated heart failure, acute on chronic systolic
   failure.  MAPs in the 60s despite milrinone and phenylephrine.  Still
   anasarcic.  Urine output picked up after rounds 100 cc/hr.
   - Lasix gtt at 80cc/hr
   - No metolazone for now as patient is diuresing well on lasix gtt
   - Continue milrinone + phenylephrine
   - f/u repeat echo
   - hold carvedilol for now; on metoprolol for HR control
   - restart ACE when able
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - hold on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressures
   .
   # RHYTHM: Unclear if sinus vs. junctional rhythm given poor baseline.
   Has had Afib/RVR, with drop in BP. Now in sinus vs. junctional rhythm.
   Has ICD.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - on metoprolol
   - digoxin level
   .
   # LLL collapse: Most recent CXR [**2144-4-12**] shows LLL airless and improving
   right basilar consolidation.  Afebrile, although WBC count increasing.
   Likely component of CHF, but concern is for pneumonia as well.
   - sputum cultures
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - CIS
   - continue vanc/cipro
   - change Zosyn to cefepime
   - check vanc trough in a.m.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Per old CCU team, patient
s mental status has
   been altered but stable for past week or so.
   - non-contrast head CT
   .
   # Fixed dilated right pupil: Unclear significance as patient is
   otherwise alert, interactive, able to move all 4 extremities. 3^rd
   nerve seems unwise intact as extraocular movements are normal.
   - non-contrast head CT
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue synthroid
   .
   # Cardiac Risk Factors: LDL 69.
   .
   # Hypervolemic Hyponatremia: likely secondary to CHF.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, including a chronic total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery, and is on aspirin and Zocor. She also has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and is being monitored on telemetry.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 86 bpm with frequent ectopy, blood pressure ranging from 97/60 mmHg to 71/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a face tent. The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the left with absent breath sounds at the left base, edema in all four extremities, and warm skin.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 149 K/uL, low hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, elevated troponin-T level of 121 mg/dL, and an increased creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. Other notable lab values include a low potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L, high magnesium level of 29.6 mg/dL, and an elevated lactate level of"

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who has been admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She has an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, indicating severe systolic dysfunction. The patient also has evidence of right-sided heart failure. Her current medications include furosemide (Lasix), milrinone, phenylephrine, metoprolol, and vancomycin/ciprofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP).

The patient's recent events include an episode of tachyarrhythmia, which may have been secondary to milrinone administration. She is currently on low-dose milrinone and has had her Swan-Ganz catheter temporarily removed.

The patient's coronary artery disease is characterized by a chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Her cardiac enzymes (CE's) were negative at outside hospital (OSH). She is currently taking aspirin and zocor, but her beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor have been temporarily held due to unstable blood pressures.

The patient's rhythm has been unclear, with episodes of sinus rhythm and junctional rhythm. She experienced a self-terminating tachyarrhythmia reaching 150 beats per minute, but with stable blood pressures. Milrinone was subsequently stopped.

Possible pneumonia is suggested by retrocardiac and right middle lobe"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF), admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She has a history of acute on chronic systolic failure with evidence of right-sided failure. The patient experienced an episode of tachyarrhythmia, which may have been secondary to milrinone. She is currently on low-dose milrinone and lasix.

Possible medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to worsening heart failure.
2. Respiratory complications such as pneumonia, especially with the presence of crackles in the lungs.
3. Arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, which the patient has already experienced.
4. Hypotension due to fluid overload and poor cardiac output.
5. Renal dysfunction, as indicated by the high BUN and creatinine levels.
6. Hepatic dysfunction, as indicated by the elevated liver enzymes.
7. Thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), due to immobilization and hypervolemic state.
8. Infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines.
9. Malnutrition, considering the patient's poor dentition and need for fluid restriction.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, cardiac function, renal and liver function, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, now intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure/airway
   protection.
   .
   # PUMP: Acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure.
   Echo [**2144-4-13**] shows mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal third of the ventricle
   with an aneurysmal apex. The right ventricular cavity is markedly
   dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.  The patient is
   currently on milrinone, phenylephrine, and vasopressin with MAPs around
   80 and urine output since midnight.
   - Lasix gtt + metolozone
   - Continue milrinone + phenylephrine
   - Stop vasopressin
   - holding ACE and beta blocker for now
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - hold on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Unclear if sinus vs. junctional rhythm given poor baseline.
   Has ICD. Has had frequent ventricular ectopy. Had Afib/RVR on night of
   [**2144-4-12**], but rhythm has been more stable since then.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - K, Mg repletion
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated [**2144-4-13**] for worsening
   hypercarbia/mental status.  CXR [**2144-4-12**] showed LLL airless and
   improving right basilar consolidation.  CXR [**2144-4-13**] shows lucency at
   left heart border (not felt to be pneumothorax per radiology).
   Afebrile, with mild leukocytosis (improved today).  Etiology of
   respiratory failure likely CHF, with possible component of pneumonia.
   Sputum frothy but also purulent in appearance. Sputum gram stain
   polymicrobial.  Urine culture contaminated.
   - continue mechanical ventilation with CMV, vital volume 500, RR 14,
   FiO2 40%, PEEP 5
   - not candidate for ventilator weaning in setting of hemodynamic
   instability
   - f/u sputum and blood cultures
   - repeat urine culture
   - continue vanc/cipro/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u vanc level
   - continue diuresis as above
   .
   # Fixed dilated pupils: Noted on [**2144-4-13**]. So far, have not been able to
   pursue head imaging secondary to hemodynamic instability.
   - non-contrast head CT when stable enough for exam
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue Synthroid
   .
   # Cardiac Risk Factors: LDL 69.
   .
   # Hypervolemic Hyponatremia: likely secondary to CHF.
   - fluid restrict to 1200 mL

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She is currently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure/airway protection. The patient has acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure, as shown by an echo that reveals mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal third of the ventricle with an aneurysmal apex. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has an improving right basilar consolidation on CXR, suggesting possible pneumonia. The sputum frothy and purulent appearance, along with polymicrobial gram stain, supports this possibility.
2. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient has had frequent ventricular ectopy and a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She also has an ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) in place.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's urine output has been low, and there is concern for hypovolemia due to diuresis and fluid restriction.
4. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of low blood pressure requiring vasopressor support.
5. Hypercarbia: The patient initially required intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

   # Respiratory failure: Intubated [**2144-4-13**] for worsening
   hypercarbia/mental status.  CXR [**2144-4-12**] showed LLL airless and
   improving right basilar consolidation.  CXR [**2144-4-13**] shows lucency at
   left heart border (not felt to be pneumothorax per radiology).
   Afebrile, with mild leukocytosis (improved today).  Etiology of
   respiratory failure likely CHF, with possible component of pneumonia.
   Sputum frothy but also purulent in appearance. Sputum gram stain
   polymicrobial.  Urine culture contaminated.

   # Fixed dilated pupils: Noted on [**2144-4-13**]. Previously, pupils have been
   documented as equal and reactive. So far, have not been able to pursue
   head imaging secondary to hemodynamic instability.

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV CHF, admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis and now intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure/airway protection. The patient has acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure, as indicated by an echo showing mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal third of the ventricle with an aneurysmal apex, and a markedly dilated right ventricular cavity with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The patient is currently on milrinone, phenylephrine, and vasopressin with MAPs around 80 and urine output since midnight.

The patient also has a coronary artery disease with a chronic total occlusion of the proximal LAD and negative coronary angiography. She is on aspirin and zocor, and beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are being held due to the need for vasopressor support.

There are concerns about the patient's rhythm, as she has an unclear sinus versus junctional rhythm with frequent ventricular ectopy. She has had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response previously but has been more stable since then. The patient has an ICD implantation.

The patient was intubated on [**2144-4-13**] for worsening hypercarbia/mental status. Chest X-rays show improving right basilar consolidation and lucency"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection. The patient has acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure, with a likely component of distributive shock. Her ejection fraction is reduced, and she has an aneurysmal apex with near akinesis of the distal third of the ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The patient is currently on milrinone, phenylephrine, and vasopressin with MAPs around 80 and urine output since midnight. She also has coronary artery disease with a chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) and a negative coronary angiography at OSH. The patient's rhythm is unclear due to poor baseline, but she has had frequent ventricular ectopy and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib/RVR) previously. She has an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient has respiratory failure likely due to CHF, with a possible component of pneumonia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CMV, vital volume 500, RR 14, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5. She is not a candidate for ventilator weaning in the setting of hemodynamic instability. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure, along with the use of vasopressin and other inotropic medications, indicates a high risk for cardiogenic shock.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and purulent sputum suggest a possible component of pneumonia. 
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulability state due to heart failure increase the risk of DVT.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical condition and use of corticosteroids increase the risk of developing stress ulcers.
6. Hypervolemic hyponatremia: The patient's fluid overload due to CHF can lead to dilutional hyponatremia.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which can be exacerbated by severe illness.
8. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular ectopy and atrial fibrillation increases the risk of further arrhythmias.
9. Renal dysfunction: The patient's reduced urine output and elevated creatinine indicate a potential risk for renal dysfunction.
10. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 11131**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Respiratory failure necessitating intubation yesterday.  Hypotension in
   the setting vasopressor support with marginal urine output despite IV
   diuretics.  Plan on PA catheter placement to help elucidate
   contribution of cardiogenic and vasodilatory shock.  Will investigate
   altered mental status and anisocoria with a CT Scan looking for
   intracranial bleed.
   Critical care time 40 minutes for vasopressor management, ventilatory
   management and management of shock.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection. The etiology of respiratory failure is likely CHF, with possible component of pneumonia. The patient will continue mechanical ventilation with CMV, vital volume 500, RR 14, FiO2 40%, and PEEP 5.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure, with likely component of distributive shock. The patient is currently on milrinone, phenylephrine, and vasopressin with MAPs around 80 and urine output since midnight. A PA catheter may be considered to help elucidate the contribution of cardiogenic and vasodilatory shock.

3. Fixed Dilated Pupils: The patient's pupils have been documented as fixed and dilated. This could be due to several causes, including neurologic issues or medication side effects. A non-contrast head CT should be performed when the patient is stable enough to leave the CCU for further evaluation.

4. Hypervolemic Hyponatremia: The patient has hypervolemic hyponatremia likely secondary to CHF. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels is necessary, and appropriate treatment should be considered based on the sodium levels.

5. Elevated Lactate: The patient has elevated"

   protection.
   # Sepsis: Swan-Ganz catheter showing hemodynamics c/w with sepsis.
   Additionally, pt with GPCs growing in blood cx, sensitivities pending.
   CXR with ?PNA. Sputum GS showing GPCs in pairs and clusters as well as
   GPRs, culture pending. Pt currently on vanc, cefepime, cipro, flagyl.
   - f/u repeat CXR this morning
   - continue current abx regimen
   - f/u repeat urine cx
   - f/u stool for c.diff
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated [**2144-4-13**] for worsening
   hypercarbia/mental status.  Respiratory failure likely multifactorial,
   with some component of heart failure/fluid overload as well as some
   pneumonia component.  Sputum GS polymicrobial, culture pending.  ABG
   this AM slightly alkalotic, now s/p decrease in FiO2 and RR.
   - repeat ABG with new vent settings
   - continue abx as above
   - f/u sputum and blood cultures
   - diuretics d/c
ed as pt is putting out good urine on her own at this
   point
   # PUMP: Acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure,
   with likely component of distributive/septic shock.  Echo [**2144-4-13**] shows
   mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   near akinesis of the distal third of the ventricle with an aneurysmal
   apex. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate
   global free wall hypokinesis.  The patient is currently diuresing well
   on her own.  She is on phenylephrine and vasopressin for BP support.
   - Lasix gtt + metolozone d/c
ed as pt diuresing well
   - Continue phenylephrine + vasopressin, attempting to wean down
   vasopressin when possible
   - holding ACE and beta blocker in setting of shock
   - start heparin gtt
   - obtain records of prior echo from [**Hospital3 735**]
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - hold on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Unclear if sinus vs. junctional rhythm given poor baseline.
   Has ICD. Has had frequent ventricular ectopy. Had Afib/RVR on night of
   [**2144-4-12**], but rhythm has been more stable since then.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - K, Mg repletion
   .
   # Fixed dilated pupils: Noted on [**2144-4-13**]. Previously, pupils have been
   documented as equal and reactive. So far, have not been able to pursue
   head imaging secondary to hemodynamic instability.
   - non-contrast head CT when stable enough to leave CCU for CT
   .
   # Hypervolemic hyponatremia: likely secondary to CHF.
   .
   # Elevated lactate: Likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
   - continue hemodynamic support with pressors
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid
   .
   # Cardiac Risk Factors: LDL 69.  HbA1c 6.6.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection. The patient has sepsis with GPCs growing in her blood culture, and her chest X-ray shows possible pneumonia. She is currently on vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. The patient also has respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of heart failure, fluid overload, and pneumonia. Her ABG shows slight alkalosis and she is on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 and RR adjusted. The patient has acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure with distributive/septic shock. An echocardiogram shows mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and a markedly dilated right ventricular cavity. She is being supported with phenylephrine and vasopressin for blood pressure support. Other medical issues include coronary artery disease with a chronic total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery, rhythm disturbances, fixed dilated pupils, hypervolemic hyponatremia, elevated lactate, hypothyroidism, and cardiac risk factors. The patient's condition requires ongoing ICU care with various interventions such as nutrition, glycemic control, line placements, prophylactic measures, and medication"

   # PUMP: Acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure,
   with likely component of distributive shock.  Echo [**2144-4-13**] shows mild to
   moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near
   akinesis of the distal third of the ventricle with an aneurysmal apex.
   The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global
   free wall hypokinesis.  The patient is currently on milrinone,
   phenylephrine, and vasopressin with MAPs around 80 and urine output
   since midnight.
   - Lasix gtt + metolozone
   - Continue milrinone + phenylephrine + vasopressin
   - Consider PA catheter

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis, who is now intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection. The patient has acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure, with likely component of distributive shock. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The patient is on milrinone, phenylephrine, and vasopressin with MAPs around 80 and urine output since midnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypotension and Shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension and requires vasopressor support (phenylephrine and vasopressin) to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP). This suggests ongoing shock, which could be due to sepsis or cardiogenic causes.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of hypotension and shock, which can lead to decreased renal perfusion and subsequent AKI.
4. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and purulent sputum, indicating a possible infection. The sputum gram stain shows polymicrobial growth,"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, now intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure/airway
   protection.
   .
   # PUMP: Acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure,
   with likely component of distributive shock.  Echo [**2144-4-13**] shows mild to
   moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near
   akinesis of the distal third of the ventricle with an aneurysmal apex.
   The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global
   free wall hypokinesis.  The patient is currently on milrinone,
   phenylephrine, and vasopressin with MAPs around 80 and urine output
   since midnight.
   - Lasix gtt + metolozone
   - Continue milrinone + phenylephrine + vasopressin
   - Consider PA catheter
   - holding ACE and beta blocker in setting of shock
   - start heparin gtt
   - obtain records of prior echo from [**Hospital3 735**]
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - hold on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Unclear if sinus vs. junctional rhythm given poor baseline.
   Has ICD. Has had frequent ventricular ectopy. Had Afib/RVR on night of
   [**2144-4-12**], but rhythm has been more stable since then.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - K, Mg repletion
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated [**2144-4-13**] for worsening
   hypercarbia/mental status.  CXR [**2144-4-14**] shows well-positioned ET tube,
   lucency at left heart border (not felt to be pneumothorax), and .
   Afebrile, with mild leukocytosis (improved today).  Etiology of
   respiratory failure likely CHF, with possible component of pneumonia.
   Sputum frothy but also purulent in appearance. Sputum gram stain
   polymicrobial.  Urine culture contaminated.
   - continue mechanical ventilation with CMV, vital volume 500, RR 14,
   FiO2 40%, PEEP 5
   - not candidate for ventilator weaning in setting of hemodynamic
   instability
   - f/u sputum and blood cultures
   - repeat urine culture
   - continue vanc/cipro/cefepime/flagyl
   - continue diuresis as above
   .
   # Fixed dilated pupils: Noted on [**2144-4-13**]. Previously, pupils have been
   documented as equal and reactive. So far, have not been able to pursue
   head imaging secondary to hemodynamic instability.
   - non-contrast head CT when stable enough to leave CCU for CT
   .
   # Hypervolemic hyponatremia: likely secondary to CHF.
   .
   # Elevated lactate: Likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
   - continue hemodynamic support with pressors
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid
   .
   # Cardiac Risk Factors: LDL 69.  HbA1c 6.6.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: CCU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection. There is also a possibility of pneumonia as indicated by purulent sputum and polymicrobial gram stain.

2. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis and signs of infection with a contaminated urine culture. There is also a history of central line infection, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure, with likely distributive shock. The patient is on multiple inotropes (milrinone, phenylephrine, and vasopressin) to maintain blood pressure and urine output.

4. Hypervolemic hyponatremia: This is likely secondary to CHF, which can cause dilutional hyponatremia due to fluid overload.

5. Elevated lactate: This may be secondary to hypoperfusion due to cardiogenic shock and inadequate tissue perfusion.

6. Fixed dilated pupils: The patient has fixed dilated pupils, which can be a sign of central nervous system dysfunction or neurologic compromise. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.

7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which is being treated with Synthroid.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU for sepsis and pneumonia. The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure and impaired skin integrity. Upon admission, the patient was mechanically ventilated and placed on vasopressors. Central venous pressure (CVP) was initially high due to fluid overload, which led to the decision of placing a pulmonary artery catheter (PA catheter). The PA catheter showed low pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and high systemic vascular resistance (SVR), indicating mostly left-sided heart failure and sepsis. The patient also has impaired health maintenance, including guaiac positive diarrhea and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.7 K/uL, hyponatremia with sodium levels at 27 mEq/L, elevated potassium levels at 2.9 mEq/L, and hypoglycemia with glucose levels at 45 mg/dL. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.

   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, now intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure/airway
   protection.
   # Pressor Requirement: Likely multifactorial with some cardiogenic and
   distributive components. Swan-Ganz catheter showing hemodynamics c/w
   with sepsis; however, this could be related to pt being on milrinone at
   the time. Additionally, pt with GPCs growing in blood cx, sensitivities
   pending (? Contaminant). CXR with ?PNA. Sputum GS showing GPCs in pairs
   and clusters as well as GPRs, culture pending. Pt currently on vanc,
   cefepime, cipro, flagyl.
   - f/u repeat CXR this morning
   - continue current abx regimen
   - f/u repeat urine cx
   - f/u stool for c.diff
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated [**2144-4-13**] for worsening
   hypercarbia/mental status.  Respiratory failure likely multifactorial,
   with some component of heart failure/fluid overload as well as some
   pneumonia component.  Sputum GS polymicrobial, culture pending.  ABG
   this AM slightly alkalotic, now s/p decrease in FiO2 and RR.
   - repeat ABG with new vent settings
   - continue abx as above
   - f/u sputum and blood cultures
   - diuretics d/c
ed as pt is putting out good urine on her own at this
   point
   # PUMP: Acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure,
   with likely component of distributive/septic shock.  Echo [**2144-4-13**] shows
   mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   near akinesis of the distal third of the ventricle with an aneurysmal
   apex. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate
   global free wall hypokinesis.  The patient is currently diuresing well
   on her own.  She is on phenylephrine and vasopressin for BP support.
   - Lasix d/c
ed as pt diuresing well
   - Continue phenylephrine + vasopressin for now
   - holding ACE and beta blocker in setting of shock
   - on heparin gtt for apical aneurysm
   - obtain records of prior echo from [**Hospital3 735**]
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - hold on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Unclear if sinus vs. junctional rhythm given poor baseline.
   Has ICD. Has had frequent ventricular ectopy. Had Afib/RVR on night of
   [**2144-4-12**], but rhythm has been more stable since then.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - K, Mg repletion
   .
   # Fixed dilated pupils: Noted on [**2144-4-13**]. Previously, pupils have been
   documented as equal and reactive. Pupillary exam improving. Head CT
   with no bleed on prelim read.
   - f/u final head CT read
   - perform neuro exam when sedation is worn off
   .
   # Hypervolemic hyponatremia: likely secondary to CHF.
   .
   # Elevated lactate: Likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
   - continue hemodynamic support with pressors
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid
   .
   # Cardiac Risk Factors: LDL 69.  HbA1c 6.6.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She is currently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis, and she is on multiple antibiotics. Her condition is complicated by acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure, with likely components of distributive/septic shock. She has an acute coronary syndrome with a chronic total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery. The patient also has a history of hypothyroidism, hypervolemic hyponatremia, elevated lactate levels, and fixed dilated pupils.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection. She may continue to experience respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially progress to septic shock if not managed promptly and effectively.

3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure may lead to cardiogenic shock, characterized by poor tissue perfusion and hypotension.

4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's acute coronary syndrome with a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF), admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection. The patient has sepsis with hemodynamics consistent with sepsis, and she has GPCs growing in blood cultures, sensitivities pending. A chest X-ray shows possible pneumonia. She is currently on vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. The patient also has respiratory failure, likely multifactorial, with components of heart failure, fluid overload, and pneumonia. Her sputum Gram stain shows polymicrobial growth, and cultures are pending. She is slightly alkalotic on the latest arterial blood gas (ABG), and her FiO2 and RR have been decreased. 

The patient has acute-on-chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure with likely distributive shock. An echocardiogram shows mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal third of the ventricle with an aneurysmal apex. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. She is currently on milrinone, phenylephrine, and vasopressin with mean arterial pressures around 80 and urine output since midnight.

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She is currently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis, and is being treated with various antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, blood pressure ranging from 90/58 mmHg to 139/107 mmHg, heart rate between 82-98 bpm, respiratory rate of 10-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her pupils are reactive to light and she does not respond to commands or withdraw from pain.

The patient has significant pitting edema in all four extremities and decreased breath sounds at the bases. Her neurologic examination shows that she does not respond to commands or withdraw from pain. The results of her lab tests indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and low albumin levels.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal range, but she has elevated troponin T levels. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.50, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 363 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 39 mmH"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of chronic systolic heart failure, impaired health maintenance, impaired skin integrity, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient presented to the hospital with sepsis without organ dysfunction, which was later complicated by pneumonia. 

The patient's current condition shows that he is still receiving mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), blood pressure ranging from 99/60 mmHg to 113/78 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) are 58/34 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) is 4.9 L/min, and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is between 56-61%. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.7 K/uL, elevated glucose levels ranging from 154-239 mg/dL, and slightly elevated creatinine levels at 1.3-1.4 mg/dL. Other lab values, including electrolytes, liver function tests, and kidney function tests, are within normal limits.

The patient has received multiple antibiotic treatments, including ciprofloxacin,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of chronic stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF), who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis and developed sepsis. She has been intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection. The patient's condition is complicated by pneumonia, likely hospital-acquired, and impaired skin integrity. She also has impaired health maintenance, chronic systolic CHF, and renal failure. The patient's recent progress includes an elevated lactate level, fixed dilated pupils, and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis has already led to the need for mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. If not managed appropriately, it could progress to septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of pneumonia, possibly hospital-acquired, increases the risk of worsening respiratory status and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or lung abscess.
3. CHF exacerbation: The patient's underlying chronic CHF may further deteriorate due to fluid overload, infection, or other factors, leading to pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, and cardiovascular instability.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased susceptibility to infections.
5. Impaired skin integrity"

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of chronic stage IV heart failure who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis and developed sepsis. She is currently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection. The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, chronic heart failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. She also has a coronary artery disease with a chronic total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has symptoms of pneumonia, including cough, fever, and abnormal chest X-ray findings. This can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Chronic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic stage IV heart failure, which can cause fluid overload and respiratory distress. It may require ongoing management with diuretics and other medications.
3. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis with suspected Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Sepsis can progress to septic shock and organ dysfunction if not adequately managed with antibiotics and supportive care.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if the underlying causes are not"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis, now intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure/airway protection. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (hospital-acquired, non-ventilator-associated), impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, and chronic systolic heart failure. The patient's current condition indicates ongoing respiratory failure, requiring intubation due to a high Respiratory Support Index (RSBI). The patient also has hypokalemia, renal failure, and an abnormal mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a common complication in mechanically ventilated patients.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility, advanced age, and underlying heart failure increase the risk of blood clots forming in the deep veins of the legs, which can potentially travel to the lungs causing a PE.
3. Wound infection: Impaired skin integrity increases the risk of wound infections, especially if the patient has been catheterized or has pressure ulcers.
4. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may worsen due to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV CHF, who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. She is currently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure/airway protection.

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has pneumonia, which is hospital-acquired and non-ventilator-associated. She also has impaired skin integrity and impaired health maintenance.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture shows heavy growth of Staphylococcus aureus, which is resistant to multiple antibiotics.
3. Heart failure (CHF), systolic, chronic: The patient has decompensated Stage IV CHF and requires inotropic-assisted diuresis.
4. Impaired mental status: The patient is unable to follow commands or respond appropriately due to sedation and possible sepsis.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient requires intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection.
6. Renal failure: The patient has elevated serum creatinine levels and requires dialysis.
7. Hypotension: The patient requires vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. The patient developed sepsis and is now intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure/airway protection. She has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, and impaired health maintenance. The patient's current condition includes sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (hospital-acquired), impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, and chronic systolic CHF.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which is an infection in one or both lungs. In this case, it is hospital-acquired, meaning it was acquired during the patient's stay in the hospital.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores.
4. Impaired Health Maintenance: The patient's impaired health maintenance puts her at risk for poor nutrition, dehydration, and inadequate medication adherence.
5. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, which means her heart is not pumping blood efficiently. This can lead to fluid accumulation in"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted

   respiratory failure/airway protection.
   # Pressor Requirement: Likely multifactorial with some cardiogenic and
   distributive components. Swan-Ganz catheter showing hemodynamics c/w
   with sepsis; however, this could be related to pt being on milrinone at
   the time. Additionally, pt with GPCs growing in blood cx, sensitivities
   showing oxacillin resistance, less likely to be contaminant. CXR with
   evidence Lung collapse, pulmonary edema and HTN. Sputum GS showing GPCs
   in pairs and clusters as well as GPRs, culture pending. Pt currently on
   vanc, renally dosed,  cefepime,flagyl for concern for aspiration
   - continue current abx regimen. [**Month (only) 51**] alter as cx data evolves.
   -Consult ID given presumed staph bacteremia
   -continue surveillance blood cx till 3 neg, culture if spikes or
   leukocytosis
    Final urine cx neg
   - f/u stool for c.diff
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated [**2144-4-13**] for worsening
   hypercarbia/mental status.  Respiratory failure likely multifactorial,
   with some component of heart failure/fluid overload as well as some
   pneumonia component.  Sputum GS polymicrobial, culture pending.  ABG
   this AM indicates metabolic alkalosis, mild resp acidosis, likely [**3-17**]
   hypokalemia. FI02 of 40%, peep 5 currently with Tv: 0.5 and RR.
   Continues to require intubation given RISBI of 168. Barriers to
   extubation  primarily mental status. Off sedation x24 hours, only able
   to withdraw from stimuli. [**Month (only) 51**] take time for sedation to wear off given

   # PUMP: Acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure,
   with likely component of distributive/septic shock.  Echo [**2144-4-13**] shows
   mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   near akinesis of the distal third of the ventricle with an aneurysmal
   apex. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate
   global free wall hypokinesis.  The patient is currently diuresing well
   on her own.  She is on phenylephrine and vasopressin for BP support but
   this regimen was devised to address CHF and sepsis, no longer
   overwhelmingly septic, CHF predominant issue
   - Wean neo, restart milrinone if no improvement with wean, d/c
   vasopressin.
   - holding ACE and beta blocker in setting of shock
   -continue swan for now, consider d/c in near futre given bacteremia
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - hold on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Unclear if sinus vs. junctional rhythm given poor baseline.
   Has ICD. Has had frequent ventricular ectopy. Had Afib/RVR on night of
   [**2144-4-12**], but rhythm has been more stable since then.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - K, Mg repletion
   .
   # Fixed dilated pupils: Noted on [**2144-4-13**]. Previously, pupils have been
   documented as equal and reactive. Pupillary exam improving. Head CT
   with no bleed on prelim read.
   - f/u final head CT read
   - perform neuro exam serially
   .
   # Hypervolemic hyponatremia: likely secondary to CHF.
   .
   # Elevated lactate: Likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
   - continue hemodynamic support with pressors

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of chronic stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for diuresis and inotropic support. She developed sepsis and required intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection. The patient has been on multiple pressors including phenylephrine and vasopressin, and her blood cultures grew Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) that are resistant to oxacillin. The sputum Gram stain showed GPCs in pairs and clusters, suggesting Staphylococcus aureus infection. The patient's condition is complicated by pneumonia, possibly hospital-acquired, and impaired skin integrity. She also has impaired health maintenance and chronic systolic CHF.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis with positive blood cultures for GPCs, indicating a bacterial infection. This can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which may be hospital-acquired. Pneumonia can cause respiratory distress and further compromise the patient's respiratory function.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic CHF, and her heart failure may worsen due to sepsis and pneumonia. This can lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. Renal failure can complicate the management of sepsis and other medical conditions.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hyponatremia. These imbalances can affect cardiac function and overall health.
7. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Being intubated for an extended period increases the risk of VAP. Close monitoring and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent and treat this condition.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, and chronic systolic heart failure. 

The patient's arterial line stopped at 05:00 PM on 04/16/2144 and restarted at 05:30 PM on the same day. The patient became hypotensive with blood pressures in the 60s/40s after adding back milrinone. Titrated up phenylephrine to 5 and discontinued milrinone with improvement in blood pressure. Added norepinephrine with the goal of weaning phenylephrine and getting the patient off vasopressin; stopped vasopressin.

The patient required extensive K repletion, placed right radial A-line and discontinued left radial A-line, sent catheter tip for culture. Phosphate levels were very low, repleted with IV KPhos. C. diff negative.

Allergies: No known drug allergies.

Infusions: Furosemide (Lasix) - 2.5 mg/hour, Phenylephrine - 5 mcg/Kg/min.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. She is currently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure/airway protection. The patient has a mixed picture of cardiogenic and vasodilatory shock. She continues to have evidence of CHF with peripheral edema, crackles on lung exam. She is tolerating renal function with creatinine stable at 1.0. The patient is also diagnosed with sepsis, pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, chronic systolic CHF, and acute on chronic right and left-sided systolic heart failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to worsening CHF.
2. Vasodilatory shock due to sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia and CHF-related fluid overload.
4. Metabolic alkalosis due to diuresis-induced hypokalemia.
5. Hypervolemic hyponatremia secondary to CHF.
6. Impaired mental status due to sedation, possibly exacerbated by hydrocephalus.
7. Hypothyroidism.
8. Elevated lactate levels due to hypoperfusion.
9. Impaired glycemic control.
10. Potential bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy.
11. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (D"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. She is currently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure/airway protection.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed:

1. CHF: The patient continues to show evidence of CHF with peripheral edema and crackles on lung examination. She is receiving ionotrope-assisted diuresis for decompensated CHF. The plan is to continue lasix drip with lasix boluses as needed to achieve negative 1L/day urine output. Renal function is tolerating with creatinine stable at 1.0. Pressor support will be continued as needed to maintain goal blood pressure, and vasopressin will be weaned off when able.

2. Sepsis: Although the patient has a low-grade fever, there is no white blood cell count, and swan numbers prior to discontinuation argue against ongoing sepsis. No vegetation was evidenced on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to suggest endocarditis. MRSA cultured from sputum, which is sensitive to vancomycin. Sparse growth Proteus mirabilis from sputum is sensitive to cefepime. The plan is to continue vancomycin and c"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly.

2. Pneumonia: The patient also has pneumonia, which is an infection in the lungs. This can worsen the patient's respiratory status and may require additional interventions such as bronchodilators, antibiotics, or even mechanical ventilation.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores. Proper skin care and repositioning are necessary to prevent further complications.

4. Heart failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, which may require ongoing management with diuretics, inotropic agents, and other cardiac supportive measures.

5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. They are at risk for various arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia (VT) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). Close monitoring and appropriate antiarrhythmic medications may be required.

6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is essential to prevent further deterioration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. She is intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure/airway protection. The patient has several medical conditions, including pneumonia (hospital-acquired), impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, chronic systolic CHF, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and coronary artery disease with a chronic total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased oxygen requirements, and potential septicemia.
2. Sepsis: Despite previous improvement, the patient continues to have low-grade fever, indicating ongoing infection. This could progress to septic shock if not promptly addressed.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and delayed wound healing.
4. Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient's chronic systolic CHF may lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and worsening renal function if not adequately managed.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's coronary artery disease with chronic total occlusion of the proximal LAD increases the risk of myocardial ischemia and potential myocardial infarction.
6. Renal Dysfunction: The"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of chronic systolic heart failure, impaired health maintenance, and impaired skin integrity. The patient was admitted to the ICU with sepsis without organ dysfunction and pneumonia, which was hospital-acquired. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 76/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on several medications including heparin sodium, vasopressin, phenylephrine, midazolam (versed), and fentanyl.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and elevated glucose levels. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's recent imaging studies include a chest X-ray taken on 04/17/2144 at 01:46 AM, which showed bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. Additional imaging studies were performed but not specified in the note.

The patient's physical examination is incomplete, with assessments not performed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and extremity pulses.

The patient's current assessment includes sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (hospital-acquired), impaired skin integrity, chronic systolic heart failure, and impaired health maintenance.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF), who presented to the hospital for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. The patient is currently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection.

The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications, including pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, and chronic systolic heart failure. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, specifically a chronic total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), with evidence of renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, and respiratory failure. The patient's electrolytes are also imbalanced, with hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's sepsis appears to be caused by MRSA, and the cultures indicate sensitivity to vancomycin. The patient is currently on a regimen of vancomycin and cefepime, with plans to discontinue flagyl.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, with components of heart failure, fluid overload, and pneumonia. Despite daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs), the patient has not been successful in weaning off mechanical ventilation due to respiratory instability.

In terms of cardiac support, the patient is on inotropic therapy and diuretics to manage her decompensated CH"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis and superimposed sepsis. She is currently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection. The patient has mixed cardiogenic and vasodilatory shock, evidence of CHF with peripheral edema and crackles on lung exam, and renal function that is tolerating with a stable creatinine level of 1.0. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued evidence of CHF with peripheral edema and crackles on lung exam.
2. Sepsis with low-grade fever and no white count, swan numbers prior to DC with mild vasodilation.
3. Respiratory failure due to worsening hypercarbia/mental status, likely multifactorial with components of heart failure/fluid overload and pneumonia.
4. Pneumonia with MRSA cultured from sputum, sensitive to vancomycin, and sparse growth of Proteus mirabilis from sputum sensitive to cefepime.
5. Coronary artery disease with chronic total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD).
6. Cardiac arrhythmias including sinus tachycardia, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm without p-waves (junctional), and ventricular tachycardia overnight.
7. Metabolic alkalosis due to diuresis/h"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis and superimposed sepsis. She is currently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, CHF, sepsis, coronary artery disease, rhythm disturbances, mental status changes, hypervolemic hyponatremia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypothyroidism. She is receiving various medications and treatments in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated due to worsening hypercarbia and mental status. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if ventilator weaning is unsuccessful.
2. CHF: Despite diuretic therapy, the patient still appears to have fluid present, indicating ongoing fluid overload. This can lead to worsening heart failure symptoms and pulmonary edema.
3. Sepsis: The patient continues to have low-grade fever, which suggests ongoing infection. If not appropriately managed, sepsis can progress to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a chronic total occlusion in the proximal left anterior descending artery. There is a risk of further ischemic events or myocardial infarction.
5. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has experienced sinus tachycard"

   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis with superimposed sepsis, now s/p intubation, with persistent
   pressor requirement and new Hct drop in the setting of GI bleeding.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated [**2144-4-13**] for worsening
   hypercarbia/mental status.  CHF and PNA both likely contributing.
   Extubation has been delayed by sedation and hemodynamic instability.
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - continue to attempt to wean pt off ventilator
   # CHF: Diuresing well. Still total body fluid overloaded.
   - continue lasix gtt  for diuresis, goal -1L each day
   - Continue pressor support as needed
   - Frequent (q6h) lyte checks as pts potassium has been frequently low
   during diuresis
   - continue digoxin
   .
   # Fever: Now spiking fevers to 102.7.  No vegetation evidenced on TEE
   to suggest endocarditis. MRSA cultured from sputum, blood-vanc
   sensitive. Last positive blood culture [**4-12**]. Lines have all been
   resited, although patient has pacemaker. Sparse growth proteus
   mirabilis from sputum sensitive to cefepime.
   Dental consulted given poor dentition.
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u culture data
   .
   # Anemia: Likely related to acute blood loss in setting of guaiac
   positive (and now grossly melanotic) stools. Hemolysis labs negative.
   - GI consult
   - maintain active T+S
   - transfuse to Hct goal >30
   - guaiac all stools
   - check Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding tube feeds
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT.
   -continue amiodarone
   -continue telemetry
   -electrolyte repletion.
   # MS: Mental status improving; able to follow commands.  Non contrast
   CT head showing extensive paranasal sinus disease, ? NP hydrocephalus,
   small radiolucent focus in Left frontal bone.
   - continue to monitor mental status
   - f/u ? NP hydrocephalus and focal lesion as o/p

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. She is currently intubated and requires pressor support. The patient has experienced a recent drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) due to gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to worsening hypercarbia and mental status. CHF and pneumonia (PNA) are both likely contributing factors. Extubation has been delayed by sedation and hemodynamic instability.

2. CHF: The patient is being diuresed well, but still has total body fluid overload. Lasix gtt is being continued for diuresis, aiming for a daily goal of -1L each day. Pressor support is needed as well. Frequent electrolyte checks are necessary due to low potassium levels during diuresis. Digoxin is also being continued.

3. Fever: The patient is experiencing high-grade fevers, with the highest recorded at 102.7. No vegetation was observed on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to suggest endocarditis. MRSA was cultured from sputum, but blood cultures show sensitivity to vancomycin. Sparse growth of Proteus mirabilis from sputum is sensitive to cefepime. Dental"

- The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis and superimposed sepsis.
- The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by worsening hypercarbia and altered mental status, likely contributed by CHF and pneumonia.
- The patient has been experiencing persistent pressor requirement, new hemoglobin drop, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
- There is evidence of metabolic alkalosis, hypothyroidism, and potential hydrocephalus.
- The patient's fever has been spiking, with no vegetation on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to suggest endocarditis.
- MRSA was cultured from sputum, and the patient's blood culture showed sparse growth of Proteus mirabilis sensitive to cefepime.
- The patient has a pacemaker and dental issues.
- The patient's anemia is likely related to acute blood loss with guaiac-positive stools.
- Coronary artery disease is present, with a chronic total occlusion (CTO) in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD).
- The patient has rhythm disturbances, including sinus tachycardia, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm without p-waves, and nonsustained vent"

   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis with superimposed sepsis, now s/p intubation, with persistent
   pressor requirement and new Hct drop in the setting of GI bleeding.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated [**2144-4-13**] for worsening
   hypercarbia/mental status.  CHF and PNA both likely contributing.
   Extubation has been delayed by sedation and hemodynamic instability.
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - continue to attempt to wean pt off ventilator
   - continue diuresis as below
   .
   # CHF: Diuresing well. Still total body fluid overloaded.
   - continue lasix gtt  for diuresis, goal -1L each day
   - Continue pressor support as needed
   - Frequent (q6h) lyte checks as pts potassium has been frequently low
   during diuresis
   - d/c digoxin
   .
   # Fever: Now spiking fevers to 102.7.  No vegetation evidenced on TEE
   to suggest endocarditis. MRSA cultured from sputum, blood-vanc
   sensitive. Last positive blood culture [**4-12**]. Lines have all been
   re-sited, although patient has ICD. Sparse growth proteus mirabilis
   from sputum sensitive to cefepime. Dental consulted given poor
   dentition.
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u culture data
   - consider CT abd/pelvis if we fail to identify a source for the fevers
   .
   # GI bleeding/acute blood loss anemia: Patient with steady Hct drop and
   guaiac positive stools.  Hemolysis labs negative.
   - GI consult
   - maintain active T+S
   - change PPI to IV
   - transfuse to Hct goal >25
   - guaiac all stools
   - check Hct Q6H
   - holding tube feeds
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT.
   -continue amiodarone
   -continue telemetry
   -electrolyte repletion.
   .
   # MS: Mental status improving; able to follow commands.  Non contrast
   CT head showing extensive paranasal sinus disease, ? NP hydrocephalus,
   small radiolucent focus in Left frontal bone.
   - continue to monitor mental status
   - f/u ? NP hydrocephalus and focal lesion as o/p

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. She has been intubated due to worsening hypercarbia and mental status, likely caused by CHF and pneumonia (PNA). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with persistent pressor requirement and has experienced a new drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) in the setting of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The primary concern is extubation, which has been delayed by sedation and hemodynamic instability. Weaning off the ventilator will be attempted while continuing vanc/cefepime/flagyl for infection.

2. CHF: The patient is being diuresed well, but still has total body fluid overload. Continuous lasix gtt will be given for diuresis with a goal of -1 liter each day. Pressor support will continue as needed, and frequent electrolyte checks will be performed due to frequent low potassium levels during diuresis. Digoxin has been discontinued.

3. Fever: The patient is experiencing spiking fevers, with a current temperature of 102.7. No vegetation was observed on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to suggest endocard"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, and has persistent pressor requirement and a new hemoglobin drop indicating gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to worsening hypercarbia and mental status. CHF and pneumonia are both contributing factors. Extubation may be delayed due to sedation and hemodynamic instability.
2. CHF: The patient is being diuresed well but is still total body fluid overloaded. Continued lasix gtt for diuresis, goal -1L each day. Pressor support may be required as needed. Frequent (q6h) electrolyte checks are necessary due to frequent low potassium levels during diuresis.
3. Fever: The patient is spiking fevers to 102.7. No vegetation evidenced on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to suggest endocarditis. MRSA cultured from sputum, blood-vanc sensitive. Sparse growth Proteus mirabilis from sputum sensitive to cefepime. Dental consult given poor dentition. Continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl. Appreciate ID recs. Follow up culture"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by worsening hypercarbia/mental status, underlying CHF, and pneumonia. The patient has a fever, likely due to a dental abscess or sinus disease, and has experienced a GI bleed with ongoing hemolysis. She also has a band-like lesion in the area of the gastroesophageal junction, which could be a mass or varix. The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and there are concerns about possible NP hydrocephalus and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the underlying causes are not addressed.
2. Sepsis: The patient has persistent fevers and signs of infection, indicating that sepsis may still be present despite antibiotic therapy.
3. GI Bleeding: The patient has experienced a GI bleed with ongoing hemolysis. There is a risk of continued bleeding and the need for ongoing monitoring and transfusion support.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis with superimposed sepsis, now s/p intubation, with persistent
   pressor requirement and falling Hct drop in the setting of GI bleeding.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated [**2144-4-13**] for worsening
   hypercarbia/mental status, with CHF and pneumonia and underlying cause.
   Extubation has been delayed by sedation and hemodynamic instability.
   Currently mental status is waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] (patient was alert prior
   to rounds but was less responsive on rounds without receiving any
   sedation in between).
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - spontaneous breathing trial
   - continue diuresis as below
   .
   # CHF: Diuresing well. Still total body fluid overloaded.
   - continue lasix gtt for diuresis, goal -1L each day
   - Continue pressor support as needed
   - Frequent (q6h) lyte checks as pts potassium has been frequently low
   during diuresis
   .
   # Fever: Still febrile last night. Could be related to dental abscess
   given patient
s poor dentition. No vegetation evidenced on TEE to
   suggest endocarditis. MRSA cultured from sputum, blood-vanc sensitive.
   Last positive blood culture [**4-12**]. Lines have all been re-sited,
   although patient has ICD. Sparse growth proteus mirabilis from sputum
   sensitive to cefepime.
   - OMFS consult
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u culture data
   - consider CT abd/pelvis if we fail to identify a source for the fevers
   .
   # GI bleeding: Patient with continued Hct drop and melena. Hemolysis
   labs negative. Underwent EGD on [**2144-4-20**], which showed [**Doctor Last Name 112**]
   esophagus, band-like lesion in area of [**Doctor Last Name 112**]
s, and gastritis. None
   of these findings were thought to be the source of the bleeding.
   - f/u GI recs
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue PPI
   - transfuse to Hct goal >30
   - guaiac all stools
   - check Hct post-transfusion and Q6H
   - holding tube feeds
   .
   # Gastritis/band-like esophageal lesion: Identified on EGD [**2144-4-20**]. Not
   thought to be source of patient
s bleeding. Appearance of lesion near
   GE junction consistent with mass, but varix could not be excluded, so
   no biopsy was done.
   - continue PPI
   - EUS with biopsy when appropriate
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT.
   -continue
   amiodarone
   -continue telemetry
   -electrolyte repletion
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status initially improved this a.m.,
   but continues to wax and wane with patient off sedation.  Non contrast
   CT head showing extensive paranasal sinus disease, ? NP hydrocephalus,
   small radiolucent focus in Left frontal bone.
   - continue to monitor mental status
   - f/u ? NP hydrocephalus and focal lesion as o/p
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: [**3-17**] diuresis/hypokalemia
   - continue to monitor respiratory status, ABGs
   .
   # Hypocalcemia: Likely related to critical illness with possible
   contribution from citrate in blood transfusion and IV phosphate
   infusions.
   - check ionized Ca [**Hospital1 7**] and replete PRN
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. The patient required intubation due to respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation since [**2144-4-13**]. She also has persistent pressor requirement and a falling hemoglobin concentration (Hct) drop in the setting of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and she is still dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function and the possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. CHF: Despite diuresis, the patient remains total body fluid overloaded. This indicates ongoing fluid retention, and there is a risk of worsening heart failure symptoms and further complications.

3. Fever: The patient continues to have fevers, which could be related to a dental abscess or a secondary infection. The presence of fever suggests an ongoing infectious process that needs to be identified and treated.

4. GI Bleeding: The patient has experienced a significant drop in Hct and melena, indicating ongoing GI bleeding. The source of bleeding has not yet been identified, and there is a risk of continued blood loss and potential need for transfusion.

   # CHF: Diuresing well. Still total body fluid overloaded.
   - continue lasix gtt for diuresis, goal -1L each day
   - Continue pressor support as needed
   - Frequent (q6h) lyte checks as pts potassium has been frequently low
   during diuresis
   .
   # Fever: Now spiking fevers to 102.7.  No vegetation evidenced on TEE
   to suggest endocarditis. MRSA cultured from sputum, blood-vanc
   sensitive. Last positive blood culture [**4-12**]. Lines have all been
   re-sited, although patient has ICD. Sparse growth proteus mirabilis
   from sputum sensitive to cefepime. Dental consulted given poor
   dentition.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. Fever: The patient had a fever with a temperature of 102.3°F on [**2144-4-20**] at 08:00 AM. The fever persisted and reached 102.7°F. No vegetation was found on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to suggest endocarditis.

2. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure): The patient was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. Despite diuresis, the patient remained total body fluid overloaded.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated on [**2144-4-13**] due to worsening hypercarbia/mental status, with CHF and pneumonia. Extubation has been delayed by sedation and hemodynamic instability.

4. GI Bleeding: The patient experienced a Hct drop and melena, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. Hemolysis labs were negative. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a band-like lesion in the area of the gastroesophageal junction and gastritis. None of these findings were thought to be the source of bleeding.

5. Coronaries: The patient has a chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). Coronary angiography (CE's) was negative at"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing persistent pressor requirement and a falling hemoglobin (Hct) level in the setting of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. She also has a history of fever, band-like esophageal lesion, gastritis, and altered mental status. The patient's medical team is considering a CT torso to look for occult infection if her condition does not improve, as well as an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy for further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of continued respiratory failure. The medical team needs to monitor her closely and assess the effectiveness of the current ventilation strategy.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, and it is important to continue aggressive management with appropriate antibiotics to prevent further deterioration.
3. GI Bleeding: The ongoing Hct drop and melena indicate ongoing GI bleeding. The source of the bleeding needs to be identified and managed promptly to prevent significant blood loss and potential shock.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which can be attributed to diuretic use"

   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis with superimposed sepsis, now s/p intubation, with persistent
   pressor requirement and falling Hct drop in the setting of GI bleeding.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Extubated [**2144-4-22**], now satting well on 3L NC
   with no signs of respiratory distress. Will likely benefit from further
   diuresis.
   - continue diuresis as below
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Diuresing well.
   Still total body fluid overloaded.
   - continue lasix gtt for diuresis, goal -1L each day
   - Continue pressor support as needed (currently on phenylephrine at 2
   cc/hr)
   - Frequent (q6h) lyte checks as pts potassium has been frequently low
   during diuresis
   .
   # Fever: Afebrile x 24 hours. Fevers could be related to poor
   dentition.  Sinus disease also possible cause given head CT findings.
   No vegetation evidenced on TEE to suggest endocarditis. MRSA cultured
   from sputum, blood-vanc sensitive. Last positive blood culture [**4-12**].
   Lines have all been re-sited, although patient has ICD. Sparse growth
   proteus mirabilis from sputum sensitive to cefepime.
   - OMFS consulted; will see patient tomorrow
   - Panorex when stable
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u culture data
   - consider CT abd/pelvis if we fail to identify a source for the fevers
   .
   # GI bleeding: Patient with continued melena but Hct relatively stable
   overnight. Hemolysis labs negative. Underwent EGD on [**2144-4-20**], which
   showed [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 112**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3625**], band-like lesion in area of [**Doctor Last Name 112**]
s, and
   gastritis. None of these findings were thought to be the source of the
   bleeding.
   - f/u GI recs
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue PPI IV BID
   - transfuse to Hct goal >30 (will defer transfusion at this time for
   Hct 29.5)
   - guaiac all stools
   - check Hct Q8H
   - will defer bleeding study for now in light of stable Hct and recent
   extubation
   .
   # Gastritis/band-like esophageal lesion: Identified on EGD [**2144-4-20**]. Not
   thought to be source of patient
s bleeding. Appearance of lesion near
   GE junction consistent with mass, but varix could not be excluded, so
   no biopsy was done.
   - continue PPI
   - EUS with biopsy when appropriate
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT.
   -continue Amiodarone at current dose (currently day 5). After day 7,
   decrease Amiodarone to 200 mg TID x 3 weeks

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV CHF, was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. The patient underwent intubation and remained pressor-dependent with a falling hemoglobin (Hct) level due to GI bleeding. The patient was extubated and is currently sitting well on 3L NC with no signs of respiratory distress. The patient continues to benefit from further diuresis and is diuresing well, although still total body fluid overloaded. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially intubated and required invasive ventilation. She has now been extubated and is doing well on nasal cannula with no signs of respiratory distress.
2. Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient continues to have fluid overload despite diuresis.
3. Fever: The patient's fever could be related to poor dentition or sinus disease. No vegetation was evidenced on TEE to suggest endocarditis.
4. GI Bleeding: The patient has melena but stable Hct overnight. Hemolysis labs negative. An EGD showed a band-like lesion in the area of gastritis but not the source of bleeding.
5. Gastritis/Band-like Esophageal Lesion: A band-like lesion was identified on EGD but not thought to be the source of bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. She is currently intubated and has persistent pressor requirement. Her hemoglobin (Hct) level is dropping, and she is experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient's respiratory status has improved since extubation, but she still requires oxygen supplementation. She also has a history of fever, which could be related to poor dentition and sinus disease. A CT scan of the head showed extensive paranasal sinus disease and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but she may still require further diuresis and weaning off oxygen as tolerated.
2. Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: The patient is diuresing well but is still total body fluid overloaded. Close monitoring of fluid balance and pressor support may be necessary.
3. GI bleeding: The patient continues to have melena, but her Hct level is relatively stable overnight. Hemolysis labs are negative, and an EGD showed a band-like lesion in the area of the stomach, along with gastritis. No source of bleeding has been identified yet.
4. Fever: The patient's fever could be related to poor dentition and sinus disease."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis with superimposed sepsis, now s/p intubation, with persistent
   pressor requirement and falling Hct drop in the setting of GI bleeding.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Extubated [**2144-4-22**], now satting well on 3L NC
   with no signs of respiratory distress. Will likely benefit from further
   diuresis.
   - continue diuresis as below
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Diuresing well.
   Still total body fluid overloaded.
   - continue lasix gtt for diuresis, goal -1L each day
   - Continue pressor support as needed (currently on phenylephrine at 2
   cc/hr)
   - Frequent (q6h) lyte checks as pts potassium has been frequently low
   during diuresis
   .
   # Fever: Afebrile x 24 hours. Fevers could be related to poor
   dentition.  Sinus disease also possible cause given head CT findings.
   No vegetation evidenced on TEE to suggest endocarditis. MRSA cultured
   from sputum, blood-vanc sensitive. Last positive blood culture [**4-12**].
   Lines have all been re-sited, although patient has ICD. Sparse growth
   proteus mirabilis from sputum sensitive to cefepime.
   - OMFS consulted; will see patient tomorrow
   - Panorex when stable
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u culture data
   - consider CT abd/pelvis if we fail to identify a source for the fevers
   .
   # GI bleeding: Patient with continued melena but Hct relatively stable
   overnight. Hemolysis labs negative. Underwent EGD on [**2144-4-20**], which
   showed [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 112**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3625**], band-like lesion in area of [**Doctor Last Name 112**]
s, and
   gastritis. None of these findings were thought to be the source of the
   bleeding.
   - f/u GI recs
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue PPI IV BID
   - transfuse to Hct goal >30 (will defer transfusion at this time for
   Hct 29.5)
   - guaiac all stools
   - check Hct Q8H
   - will defer bleeding study for now in light of stable Hct and recent
   extubation
   .
   # Gastritis/band-like esophageal lesion: Identified on EGD [**2144-4-20**]. Not
   thought to be source of patient
s bleeding. Appearance of lesion near
   GE junction consistent with mass, but varix could not be excluded, so
   no biopsy was done.
   - continue PPI
   - EUS with biopsy when appropriate
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT.
   -continue Amiodarone at current dose (currently day 5). After day 7,
   decrease Amiodarone to 200 mg TID x 3 weeks
   -continue telemetry
   -electrolyte repletion
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status improved.  Non-contrast CT head
   showing extensive paranasal sinus disease, ? NP hydrocephalus, small
   radiolucent focus in left frontal bone.
   - continue to monitor mental status
   - f/u ? NP hydrocephalus and focal lesion as o/p
   - consider neuro consult/EEG if mental status fails to improve
   .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: [**3-17**] diuresis/hypokalemia
   - continue to monitor respiratory status, ABGs
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid
   - recheck TSH in setting of amiodarone therapy

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. The patient was intubated but has now been extubated and is oxygenating well on 3 liters nasal cannula. She has a history of GI bleeding, fever, gastritis with a band-like esophageal lesion, coronary artery disease, rhythm disturbances, altered mental status, metabolic alkalosis, and hypothyroidism. The patient is currently receiving diuretics for fluid overload, antibiotics for infection, and pressor support as needed. Further management includes weaning off oxygen, continuing diuretics, monitoring for respiratory distress, and frequent electrolyte checks.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience respiratory distress due to fluid overload and ongoing pressor requirement. Close monitoring of respiratory status and ABGs is necessary.
2. Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Continued diuresis and fluid management are essential to prevent worsening of heart failure symptoms.
3. GI Bleeding: The patient has a history of melena but stable Hct. Close monitoring of stool guaiac, Hct, and continued use of PPI may help prevent further bleeding.
4. Fever: Poor dentition and sinus disease are possible causes of fever. OMFS consultation and panorex are planned. Continued surveillance and potential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch tall and 79.5 kg individual admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing various medical complications, including an arterial line stoppage, multiple infections, and a history of falls. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 91/61 mmHg to 116/73 mmHg. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 100% and a PEEP of 8 cmH2O. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Arterial line stoppage: This can lead to a loss of vascular access for measuring blood pressure and obtaining blood samples. It may require replacement of the arterial line or alternative methods for monitoring and obtaining blood samples.

2. Infections: The patient has been receiving antibiotics, specifically vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. These medications indicate the presence of infections. However, the specific site or type of infection is not mentioned in the progress note.

3. History of falls: The patient has a history of falls, which increases the risk of further falls and associated injuries in the ICU setting.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV CHF, admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. The patient is currently extubated and sitting well on 3L NC with no signs of respiratory distress. Lasix gtt was stopped yesterday, and the patient had a negative fluid balance of 1.5 L.

The patient has a history of fever, but is currently afebrile for 48 hours. There is suspicion of poor dentition and sinus disease as potential causes. No vegetation was evidenced on TEE to suggest endocarditis. MRSA was cultured from sputum, but it is sensitive to vancomycin. Sparse growth of Proteus mirabilis from sputum is sensitive to cefepime.

The patient also has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 151, possibly related to overdiuresis. Further diuresis is being held, and electrolytes will be rechecked this afternoon.

Additionally, the patient has ongoing melena, and hemolysis labs are negative. An EGD on [**2144-4-20**] showed a band-like lesion in the area of [**Doctor Last Name 112**] and gastritis, but these findings were not thought to be the source of bleeding. The patient is not stable enough to undergo an EUS this afternoon, so the procedure will be pursued when"

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. She is currently intubated and requires persistent pressor support. The patient also has a history of acute on chronic systolic CHF, fever, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, gastritis/band-like esophageal lesion, coronary artery disease with chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD), rhythm disturbances including sinus rhythm with occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm without p-waves and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), altered mental status, metabolic alkalosis, and hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, septic shock, respiratory failure, further GI bleeding, development of renal insufficiency or failure due to hypotension and decreased renal perfusion, electrolyte imbalances, and potential complications related to prolonged intubation such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, phenylephrine, pantoprazole, and Synthroid. The patient is also on a regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
- Heart rate: 86 bpm (with range of 86-100 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 91/61 mmHg (with range of 69-123/55-73 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (with range of 16-25 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula

The patient's laboratory results show:
- Sodium: 151 mEq/L (with trend of increasing)
- Potassium: 3.8 mEq/L (with frequent low levels during diuresis)
- Hematocrit (Hct): 29.5% (trending down)
- White blood cell count (WBC): 9.2 K/uL (with fluctuations)
- Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
- Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 59 mg/dL
- Glucose: 119 mg/dL

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. The patient underwent intubation and is currently extubated, but still requires pressor support. The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, fever, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. The patient's sodium levels have been trending up, indicating hypernatremia. The patient has a history of CHF, coronary artery disease, altered mental status, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and neurological complications such as seizures.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient previously required intubation and pressor support, indicating potential respiratory distress or failure. This can be caused by lung infection, fluid accumulation in the lungs, or compromised respiratory muscles.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is experiencing melena, which is the passage of black, tarry stools due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This can be caused by various factors including peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, or esophageal varices.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has shown signs of confusion and disorientation. This can be attributed to several factors including sepsis, hypoxia, electrolyte imbalances, or"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-inch, 79.5 kg male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleed, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, and chronic systolic heart failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/65 to 107/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient has been receiving various medications including phenylephrine, pantoprazole, and heparin. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's fluid balance is positive with a total intake of 1,004 mL and output of 665 mL.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, which can be a common complication in critically ill patients.
2. Organ dysfunction: Although the patient is currently without organ dysfunction, sepsis can lead to organ failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility in the ICU setting. Prophylaxis"

   # Altered mental status: Mental status persistently altered.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed extensive paranasal sinus disease, ?
   NP hydrocephalus, small radiolucent focus in left frontal bone.
   - continue to monitor mental status
   - f/u ? NP hydrocephalus and focal lesion as o/p
   - consult neuro if mental status fails to improve with correction of
   hypernatremia
   # Respiratory Failure: Extubated [**2144-4-22**], now satting well on room air
   to 2L/NC with no signs of respiratory distress.
   - holding diuresis; continue to monitor I/O

   # Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Did not diurese
   yesterday. Holding diuresis in setting of hypernatremia. Still
   requiring pressors.
   - holding diuresis; continue to monitor I/O balance
   - Continue to wean pressors
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lyte check
   .
   # Fever: Now afebrile x 72 hours. Recent fevers could be related to
   poor dentition.  Sinus disease also possible cause given head CT
   findings. No vegetation evidenced on TEE to suggest endocarditis. MRSA
   cultured from sputum, blood-vanc sensitive. Last positive blood culture
   [**4-12**]. Lines have all been re-sited, although patient has ICD. Sparse
   growth proteus mirabilis from sputum sensitive to cefepime.
   - plan for oral surgery as below
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl; 15-day course as above
   - appreciate add
l ID recs
   - f/u culture data
   - consider CT abd/pelvis if we fail to identify a source for the fevers
   .
   # Poor dentition: OMFS following. Will have teeth extracted on Sunday.
   - Panorex if able.
   - Plan to tooth extraction on Sunday
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Pt with sodium that has been trending up, now 151.
   Likely related to diuresis.  Free water deficit ~3 L. Will replete over
   24 hours.
   - D5W at 100 cc/hr
   - holding on further diuresis as above
   - recheck lytes this PM

   # GI bleeding: Melena has stopped. Hct has been stable x 2 days but now
   trending down this a.m. Hemolysis labs negative. Underwent EGD on
   [**2144-4-20**], which showed [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 112**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3625**], band-like lesion in area of
   [**Doctor Last Name 112**]
s, and gastritis. None of these findings were thought to be the
   source of the bleeding.
   - will pursue EUS when pt is more stable
   - f/u GI recs
   - holding on bleeding scan at this point, as it does not seem that it
   would be very high-yield
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue PPI
   - recheck Hct this PM
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   # Gastritis/band-like esophageal lesion: Identified on EGD [**2144-4-20**]. Not
   thought to be source of patient
s bleeding. Appearance of lesion near
   GE junction consistent with mass, but varix could not be excluded, so
   no biopsy was done.
   - continue PPI
   - holding on EUS until pt is more stable, as above
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT.
   -decrease amiodarone to 200 mg TID. Continue this for 3
   weeks

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. The patient underwent intubation but is now extubated and sitting well on 3 liters of nasal cannula with no signs of respiratory distress. She has a history of poor dentition, acute on chronic systolic CHF, fever, and GI bleeding. The patient's sodium levels are high, indicating hypernatremia, and she has been experiencing melena, indicating possible GI bleeding. A band-like lesion in the area of the stomach was seen during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), but it was not thought to be the source of the bleeding. The patient has also shown signs of gastritis and an altered mental status, which has improved slightly. She has a coronary artery disease with a chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient's rhythm is sinus with occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythms without p-waves and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). She is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and cardiac support medications. The patient's current plan includes holding diuresis, continuing vanc/cefepime/flagyl, weaning off pressors, and pursuing further evaluations such as an upper gastrointestinal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis and developed superimposed sepsis. She has been intubated and is currently requiring pressors. The patient's mental status is persistently altered, and a non-contrast CT scan of the head showed extensive paranasal sinus disease and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. She is currently extubated and oxygenating well on room air with no signs of respiratory distress.

The patient has a history of acute on chronic systolic CHF and did not diurese yesterday due to hypernatremia. She is still requiring pressors. There is a possibility of poor dentition causing her fevers, as well as sinus disease. MRSA was cultured from sputum, but it is sensitive to vancomycin. The patient has an upcoming oral surgery planned for Sunday.

The patient's sodium level is elevated at 151, likely related to diuresis. A free water deficit of approximately 3 liters is expected, and repletion will be done over the next 24 hours. Diuretics are being held as well.

The patient experienced GI bleeding, but melena has stopped. Her hematocrit (Hct) has been stable for two days, but now it is trending down. Hemolysis labs are negative. An upper gastrointestinal"

","Based on the information provided in the physician resident progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. The patient has undergone intubation and transfusion for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient has an altered mental status, which has shown improvement today. A non-contrast CT scan of the head on [2144-04-14] showed extensive paranasal sinus disease, questionably nasal passage (NP) hydrocephalus, and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. The patient should continue to be monitored for mental status changes, and further evaluation by a neurologist may be necessary if the mental status does not continue to improve.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously extubated but required reintubation due to respiratory failure. The patient is now extubated and setting well on room air with no signs of respiratory distress. However, it is important to continue monitoring the patient's respiratory status and wean oxygen as tolerated.

3. Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: The patient still requires pressors and diuretics for heart failure management. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust treatment accordingly.

4. Hypotension/pressor requirement:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including chronic systolic heart failure, who was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, suspected sepsis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent tooth extractions and was on NPO status. He received vancomycin and cefepime antibiotics but had a vancomycin trough level checked and held the dose due to elevated levels. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has decreased breath sounds at the left base and pitting edema in all extremities. His lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 236 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 23.6%, thrombocytopenia with a Plt of 195, elevated creatinine at 1.2, and hypoglycemia with a glucose level of 59. The patient has multiple ongoing medical complications, including pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, and chronic systolic heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has decreased breath sounds at the left base, which could indicate a possible pneumonia. The presence of fever and leukocytosis further supports this diagnosis.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be exacerbated by the recent tooth extractions and the use of anticoagulant medications.

3. Sepsis: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis and developed sepsis. She underwent intubation and transfusion for gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient required persistent pressor support, and her mental status has improved since admission. She has extensive paranasal sinus disease with possible nasal polyps and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has pitting edema in all four extremities. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, elevated creatinine, and altered liver function tests. She has multiple comorbidities including pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, and coronary artery disease with a chronic total occlusion in the proximal left anterior descending artery. The patient's current medications include phenylephrine, antibiotics, diuretics, and other ICU medications. She is NPO after midnight for dental extractions and will have teeth extracted on Sunday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved since admission but requires continued monitoring. Non-contrast CT head showed extensive paranasal sinus disease, possibly nasal polyps, and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. Further evaluation for neurologic issues should be pursued if the mental status does not continue"

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV CHF, admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. She has undergone intubation and transfusion for GI bleeding, with persistent pressor requirement.
- The patient's mental status has improved, but extensive paranasal sinus disease and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone were noted on a non-contrast CT head. Monitoring of mental status is recommended, with consideration for neuro consultation if there is no continued improvement.
- The patient has required pressors throughout her admission due to low EF, decompensated heart failure, infection, and GI bleeding. She has been diuresed and is now afebrile with stable Hct.
- The patient was extubated on [**2144-4-22**] and is now oxygenating well on room air with a nasal cannula, although she is still tachypneic.
- The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with continued diuresis and antibiotics.
- The patient has acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure and is still requiring pressors. Diuretics are being held.
- Poor dentition is present, and oral maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) is following up with tooth extraction on Sunday.
- The patient experienced GI bleeding, for which she received a transfusion of 1 unit PRBC yesterday."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF), who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. The patient underwent intubation and transfusion for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and now requires persistent pressor support. She has altered mental status, which has shown improvement, but there is a concern for possible hydrocephalus and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. The patient has also had respiratory failure, requiring extubation and oxygen supplementation. She has chronic systolic CHF, poor dentition, GI bleeding, gastritis, and a band-like esophageal lesion. There is also a coronary artery blockage, rhythm disturbances, hypothyroidism, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is improving but there are concerns about possible hydrocephalus and a focal lesion. Monitoring mental status and discussing with family is recommended. Further evaluation by a neurologist may be necessary if there is no continued improvement.
2. Hypotension/pressor requirement: The patient requires persistent pressors throughout this admission. Contributing factors include low ejection fraction (EF), decompensated heart failure, infection, and GI bleeding. Treating heart failure with diuretics and managing GI bleeding are ongoing. Antibiotics should be continued, and culture data should be"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. She has undergone intubation and transfusion for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient requires persistent pressor support.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Altered mental status: Mental status has improved today. A non-contrast CT scan of the head showed extensive paranasal sinus disease, possibly nasal pose (NP) hydrocephalus, and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. Continue to monitor mental status and discuss with family. Follow up on NP hydrocephalus and focal lesion as an outpatient. Consult neurology if mental status does not continue to improve.

2. Hypotension/pressor requirement: The patient has required pressors throughout this admission. Contributing factors include low ejection fraction (EF), decompensated heart failure, infection, and GI bleeding. The patient has received diuresis and is now afebrile. Hematocrit trended down, and the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday, with an appropriate rise in hematocrit. Hold further pressor adjustments until after oral surgery. Once the patient undergoes oral surgery, try to wean pressors. Continue antibiotics and follow up on culture data.

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. The patient underwent intubation and transfusion for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and is still requiring pressors.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved today. A non-contrast CT head on 04/23/2144 showed extensive paranasal sinus disease, possibly NP hydrocephalus, and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. Mental status should continue to be monitored, and the patient should be discussed with family. Follow-up for NP hydrocephalus and focal lesion should be planned as an outpatient. Consult neurology if mental status does not continue to improve.
2. Hypotension/pressor requirement: The patient has required pressors throughout this admission. Contributing factors include low ejection fraction (EF), decompensated heart failure, infection, and GI bleeding. Treatment for heart failure should continue with continued diuresis and GI bleeding should be treated as below. Continue antibiotics and follow up on culture data.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was extubated on 04/22/2144 and is now sitting well on room air to 2L/NC, with clear lungs, grunting, and tachypnea. Diuretics"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-inch tall, 76.9 kg male who was admitted with an initial weight of 91.3 kg. The patient has been in the ICU since [**2144-4-23**] and has received various treatments and interventions. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/74 to 109/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show low albumin levels at 1.9 g/dL, low calcium levels corrected to 9.2, and low potassium levels at 3.1 mEq/L. The patient's blood counts indicate a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL and a hematocrit of 26.8%. The patient's platelet count is within normal range at 254 K/uL. The patient's creatinine levels are within normal range, but the liver enzymes are slightly elevated. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating throughout the day.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,553 mL, including 803 mL of IV fluids and 750 mL of blood products. The total output is 901 mL, with 150 mL of urine output. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.4.

Physical examination findings include unassessed peripheral vascular pulses, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment incomplete. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's albumin level is low at 1.9 g/dL, which may indicate malnutrition or poor nutritional intake. Hypoalbuminemia can lead to fluid accumulation and edema.
2. Hypocalcemia: The patient's corrected calcium level is low at 9.2 mg/dL. Hypocalcemia can cause muscle cramps, tetany, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium level is low at 3.1 mEq/L. Hypokalemia can result in muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory depression.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 10.2 g/dL, indicating anemia. Anemia can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly below normal at 254 K/uL. Thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding and bruising.
6. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are slightly elevated, which may indicate hepatic dysfunction. Hepatic dysfunction can affect metabolism and detoxification processes in the body.
7. Glycemic control issues: The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating throughout the day. Inadequate glycemic control can lead to hyperglycemia or hypoglyc"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV CHF who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. She has undergone intubation and transfusion for GI bleeding. The patient's mental status has improved, but she still requires pressors. She has extensive paranasal sinus disease with a question of NP hydrocephalus and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. Her respiratory failure has resolved, and she is now on room air. She has acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure and poor dentition. She experienced GI bleeding, which was not identified as the source of bleeding. She has gastritis and a band-like esophageal lesion. She has a coronary artery disease with a CTO of the proximal LAD. She also has rhythm disturbances, including sinus rhythm with occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm without p-waves and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Additionally, she has hypothyroidism with an elevated TSH level but normal free T4 level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued need for pressors: The patient still requires pressors, indicating ongoing hypotension. This may suggest persistent low cardiac output or ongoing sepsis.
2. Volume overload: Despite diuretic therapy, the patient is still volume overloaded on examination. This could lead to pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure symptoms.

   persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of pt
   teeth as they seemed to be a source of infection.
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dental
   hygiene. After she developed recurrent fevers, it was felt that her
   teeth could possibly be a source of infection. She was taking to the OR
   by OMFS yesterday, where she had 24 teeth removed. She returned to the
   CCU intubated and on pressors/sedation.
   - f/u micro data for surgical specimens
   - discuss proper antimicrobial therapy with ID
   - routine post-operative mouth care

   decompensated heart failure, infection, and GI bleeding. Now s/p
   diruesis as well as transfusion of a total of 7 units of blood.
   However, she remains pressor dependent.
   - should resume trying to wean pressors today; consider switching to a
   different pressor and then trying to wean that pressor

   comfortably on NC. Pt is now s/p reintubation for her OMFS procedure
   yesterday. Failed RSBI this morning.

s recent
   dental extractions, as above
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Holding diuresis.
   Pt does not seem fluid-overloaded from a cardiac-standpoint at this
   time. Peripheral edema likely related to hypoalbuminemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all teeth due to poor dental hygiene.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient previously experienced respiratory failure and required reintubation after undergoing a dental extraction procedure. There is a potential risk of continued respiratory failure or complications related to mechanical ventilation.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA/Proteus bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia. There is a potential risk of ongoing sepsis or worsening infection due to the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream.

3. GI Bleeding: The patient has had a GI bleed, which may continue to be a concern. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the source of the bleeding and prevent future episodes.

4. Hypotension/Pressors: The patient has required pressors throughout her admission due to various factors such as low ejection fraction (EF), decompensated heart failure, infection, and GI bleeding. There is a potential risk of persistent hypotension and dependency on pressors.

5. Dental Infection: The patient had extensive dental infections that required extraction of all teeth."

2. Sepsis: The patient has been treated for MRSA/Proteus bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be discussed with the Infectious Disease (ID) team, especially considering her recent dental extractions.
3. GI Bleeding: The patient has experienced GI bleeding, which required transfusion of blood products. Further evaluation with an EGD showed gastritis and a band-like lesion, but no clear source of bleeding. A bleeding scan may be considered when the patient is more stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of pt
   teeth as they seemed to be a source of infection.
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dental
   hygiene. After she developed recurrent fevers, it was felt that her
   teeth could possibly be a source of infection. She was taking to the OR
   by OMFS yesterday, where she had 24 teeth removed. She returned to the
   CCU intubated and on pressors/sedation.
   - f/u micro data for surgical specimens
   - discuss proper antimicrobial therapy with ID
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - attempt to wean sedation, while giving pt morphine for pain control
   - attempt to wean ventilation today
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status has been improving recently.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed extensive paranasal sinus disease,
   ?NP hydrocephalus, small radiolucent focus in left frontal bone.
   - continue to monitor mental status, discuss  with family
   - f/[**Name Initial (MD) **] possible NP hydrocephalus and focal lesion as o/p
   - consult neuro if mental status does not continue to improve
   .
   # Hypotension/pressor requirement: The patient has required pressors
   throughout this admission. Contributing factors have included low EF,
   decompensated heart failure, infection, and GI bleeding. Now s/p
   diruesis as well as transfusion of a total of 7 units of blood.
   However, she remains pressor dependent. Sedation on propofol also
   likely a contributor to patient
s pressor requirement.
   - should resume trying to wean pressors today; consider switching to a
   different pressor and then trying to wean that pressor
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Was extubated [**2144-4-22**] and had been breathing
   comfortably on NC. Pt is now s/p reintubation for her OMFS procedure
   yesterday. Failed RSBI this morning.
   - attempting to wean sedation as above
   - attempt to wean ventilator when pt is more awake with better pain
   control
   # MRSA/Proteus Bacteremia; MRSA Pneumonia: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which would have completed yesterday.
   - need to discuss current abx course with ID
   - need to discuss further abx therapy in the setting of pt
s recent
   dental extractions, as above
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Holding diuresis.
   Pt does not seem fluid-overloaded from a cardiac-standpoint at this
   time
 no crackles on exam, concentrated urine. Peripheral edema likely
   related to hypoalbuminemia.
   - holding diuresis; continue to monitor I/O balance
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lyte check
   .
   # Edema: Likely related to hypoalbuminemia in addition to HF.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - holding on further diuresis at this point
   # GI bleeding: Pt has had slow downtrend of hct and has required some
   units of blood. Hemolysis labs negative. Underwent EGD on [**2144-4-20**], which
   showed [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 112**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3625**], band-like lesion in area of [**Doctor Last Name 112**]
s, and
   gastritis. None of these findings were thought to be the source of the
   bleeding. GI recommending bleeding scan.
   - will pursue EUS when pt is more stable
   - f/u GI recs
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue PPI
   - continue to trend hematocrits
   - guaiac all stools
   - bleeding scan not likely to reveal anything
 will d/w GI
   .
   # Gastritis/band-like esophageal lesion: Identified on EGD [**2144-4-20**]. Not
   thought to be source of patient
s bleeding. Appearance of lesion near
   GE junction consistent with mass, but varix could not be excluded, so
   no biopsy was done.
   - continue PPI
   - holding on EUS until pt is more stable, as above
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for 3
   weeks
   -continue
   telemetry
   - electrolyte repletion PRN, [**Hospital1 7**] lyte checks
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV CHF, admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of the patient's teeth as they seemed to be a source of infection.

The patient presented with poor dental hygiene and developed recurrent fevers, leading to the extraction of 24 teeth. She returned to the CCU intubated and on pressors/sedation.

The patient's current medical conditions include altered mental status, hypotension/pressor requirement, respiratory failure, MRSA/Proteus bacteremia, MRSA pneumonia, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure, edema, GI bleeding, gastritis/band-like esophageal lesion, and coronary artery disease with a chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including phenylephrine, propofol, pantoprazole, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, amiodarone, Synthroid, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and abnormal electrolyte levels.

1. Dental extraction: The patient had 24 teeth removed due to poor dental hygiene and recurrent fevers. Further follow-up on micro data for surgical specimens is needed.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has been improving recently, but she still shows signs of extensive paranasal sinus disease and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. Consultation with a neurologist is recommended if the mental status does not continue to improve.
3. Hypotension/pressor requirement: The patient remains pressor-dependent despite diuresis and transfusion of a total of 7 units of blood. Pressor weaning should be attempted today, considering switching to a different pressor and then trying to wean that pressor.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient was extubated on April 22nd but required reintubation for her oral-maxillofacial surgery procedure yesterday. She failed the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) this morning. Weaning sedation and ventilator weaning should be attempted when the patient is more awake with better pain control."

   - OSH records arrived re: previous cardiac history; [**Doctor First Name 11273**] has them
   - ~1645: pt became more dyspneic and agitated; tried restarting lasix
   gtt; got ABG but values were skewed because O2 was set too low at the
   time; CXR did not show any significant fluid overload
   - ~1815: pt continue with dyspnea and agitation; gave lasix bolus
   - ~1900: continued symptoms, also tachycardic and CVP up 10 ~16-18; EKG
   with no significant changes: ?afib with intermittent v-pacing; spoke
   with night nurse from last night and ended up increasing lasix bolus
   and giving 500 mg IV diuril (worked last night)
   - EP came to interrogate PM but pt was SOB, so will come back tomorrow

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of pt
   teeth as they seemed to be a source of infection.
   # Hypotension/pressor requirement: The patient has required pressors
   throughout this admission. The reason for her persistent pressor
   requirement is not all that clear. Contributing factors have included
   low EF, decompensated heart failure, infection, and GI bleeding.
   Sedation was  also likely a contributor. At this point, she does not
   appear septic. She is no longer on sedation. Last night, she was tried
   off pressors but this only lasted for 1 hour. She was switched to
   levophed (from neosynephrine) overnight.  Possibly some of pt
s pressor
   requirement was [**3-17**] pt having developed dependence on neo.
   - try to wean levophed today; may have easier time weaning now after
   switching to a different pressor
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dental
   hygiene. After she developed recurrent fevers, it was felt that her
   teeth could possibly be a source of infection. She was taking to the OR
   by OMFS, where she had 24 teeth removed. She returned to the CCU
   intubated and on pressors/sedation. Now, s/p sedation. Gram stain of
   surgical specimen showing budding yeasts (normal oral flora per ID).
   - f/u micro data for surgical specimens
   - f/u ID recs
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status has been improving recently.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed extensive paranasal sinus disease,
   ?NP hydrocephalus, small radiolucent focus in left frontal bone. Pt now
   with PRN morphine for mouth pain; may be contributing to pt
s AMS.
   - continue to monitor mental status, discuss  with family
   - f/[**Name Initial (MD) **] possible NP hydrocephalus and focal lesion as o/p
   - consult neuro if mental status does not continue to improve
   - pain control as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Was extubated [**2144-4-22**] and had been breathing
   comfortably on NC. Pt is now s/p reintubation for her OMFS procedure
   and extubation yesterday.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which ended yesterday. Recommending 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia.
   - continue vanc x 21 day course (ending [**5-4**])
   - appreciated add
l ID recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Holding diuresis.
   Pt does not seem fluid-overloaded from a cardiac-standpoint at this
   time
 no crackles on exam, concentrated urine. Peripheral edema likely

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis but developed hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all teeth due to suspected infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/pressor requirement: The patient has required pressors throughout her admission, and the reason for her persistent pressor requirement is not clear. Factors contributing to this may include low ejection fraction (EF), decompensated heart failure, infection, GI bleeding, and sedation. The patient is currently on levophed, and attempts will be made to wean it off today.
2. Dental extraction: The patient had 24 teeth removed, and a gram stain of the surgical specimen showed budding yeasts (normal oral flora). Further follow-up with microbiology data and dental recommendations is necessary.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has been improving recently, but she still exhibits signs of confusion. A non-contrast CT scan of the head showed extensive paranasal sinus disease and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. It is recommended to follow up with a neurologist if her mental status does not continue to improve.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously extubated but"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of pt
   teeth as they seemed to be a source of infection.
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dental
   hygiene. After she developed recurrent fevers, it was felt that her
   teeth could possibly be a source of infection. She was taking to the OR
   by OMFS yesterday, where she had 24 teeth removed. She returned to the
   CCU intubated and on pressors/sedation.
   - f/u micro data for surgical specimens
   - discuss proper antimicrobial therapy with ID
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - attempt to wean sedation, while giving pt morphine for pain control
   - attempt to wean ventilation today
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status has been improving recently.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed extensive paranasal sinus disease,
   ?NP hydrocephalus, small radiolucent focus in left frontal bone.
   - continue to monitor mental status, discuss  with family
   - f/[**Name Initial (MD) **] possible NP hydrocephalus and focal lesion as o/p

   # Hypotension/pressor requirement: The patient has required pressors
   throughout this admission. Contributing factors have included low EF,
   decompensated heart failure, infection, and GI bleeding. Now s/p
   diruesis as well as transfusion of a total of 7 units of blood.
   However, she remains pressor dependent. Sedation on propofol also
   likely a contributor to patient
s pressor requirement.
   - should resume trying to wean pressors today; consider switching to a
   different pressor and then trying to wean that pressor
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Was extubated [**2144-4-22**] and had been breathing
   comfortably on NC. Pt is now s/p reintubation for her OMFS procedure
   yesterday. Failed RSBI this morning.
   - attempting to wean sedation as above
   - attempt to wean ventilator when pt is more awake with better pain
   control
   # MRSA/Proteus Bacteremia; MRSA Pneumonia: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which would have completed yesterday.
   - need to discuss current abx course with ID
   - need to discuss further abx therapy in the setting of pt

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of pt
   teeth as they seemed to be a source of infection.
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dental
   hygiene. After she developed recurrent fevers, it was felt that her
   teeth could possibly be a source of infection. She was taking to the OR
   by OMFS yesterday, where she had 24 teeth removed. She returned to the
   CCU intubated and on pressors/sedation.
   - f/u micro data for surgical specimens
   - discuss proper antimicrobial therapy with ID
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - attempt to wean sedation, while giving pt morphine for pain control
   - attempt to wean ventilation today
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status has been improving recently.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed extensive paranasal sinus disease,
   ?NP hydrocephalus, small radiolucent focus in left frontal bone.
   - continue to monitor mental status, discuss  with family
   - f/[**Name Initial (MD) **] possible NP hydrocephalus and focal lesion as o/p
   - consult neuro if mental status does not continue to improve
   .
   # Hypotension/pressor requirement: The patient has required pressors
   throughout this admission. Contributing factors have included low EF,
   decompensated heart failure, infection, and GI bleeding. Now s/p
   diruesis as well as transfusion of a total of 7 units of blood.
   However, she remains pressor dependent. Sedation on propofol also
   likely a contributor to patient
s pressor requirement.
   - should resume trying to wean pressors today; consider switching to a
   different pressor and then trying to wean that pressor
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Was extubated [**2144-4-22**] and had been breathing
   comfortably on NC. Pt is now s/p reintubation for her OMFS procedure
   yesterday. Failed RSBI this morning.
   - attempting to wean sedation as above
   - attempt to wean ventilator when pt is more awake with better pain
   control
   # MRSA/Proteus Bacteremia; MRSA Pneumonia: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which would have completed yesterday.
   - need to discuss current abx course with ID
   - need to discuss further abx therapy in the setting of pt
s recent
   dental extractions, as above
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Holding diuresis.
   Pt does not seem fluid-overloaded from a cardiac-standpoint at this
   time
 no crackles on exam, concentrated urine. Peripheral edema likely
   related to hypoalbuminemia.
   - holding diuresis; continue to monitor I/O balance
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lyte check
   .
   # Edema: Likely related to hypoalbuminemia in addition to HF.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - holding on further diuresis at this point
   # GI bleeding: Pt has had slow downtrend of hct and has required some
   units of blood. Hemolysis labs negative. Underwent EGD on [**2144-4-20**], which
   showed [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 112**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3625**], band-like lesion in area of [**Doctor Last Name 112**]
s, and
   gastritis. None of these findings were thought to be the source of the
   bleeding. GI recommending bleeding scan.
   - will pursue EUS when pt is more stable
   - f/u GI recs
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue PPI
   - continue to trend hematocrits
   - guaiac all stools
   - bleeding scan not likely to reveal anything
 will d/w GI
   .
   # Gastritis/band-like esophageal lesion: Identified on EGD [**2144-4-20**]. Not
   thought to be source of patient
s bleeding. Appearance of lesion near
   GE junction consistent with mass, but varix could not be excluded, so
   no biopsy was done.
   - continue PPI
   - holding on EUS until pt is more stable, as above
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for 3
   weeks
   -continue
   telemetry
   - electrolyte repletion PRN, [**Hospital1 7**] lyte checks
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She developed hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and recent dental extraction.

The patient presented with poor dental hygiene, and after developing recurrent fevers, it was believed that her teeth could be a source of infection. She underwent extraction of all her teeth as they seemed to be a source of infection. However, she returned to the critical care unit (CCU) intubated and on pressors/sedation.

The patient has been on multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl for MRSA bacteremia and Proteus bacteremia/MRSA pneumonia. The ID recommended continuing vancomycin for a 21-day course until May 4th for MRSA bacteremia, while cefepime/Flagyl can be stopped on April 27th for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). There is no concern about the gram stain showing budding yeast, which is considered normal oral flora.

The patient remains pressor-dependent despite receiving diuretics and transfusion of a total of 7 units of blood. She also has altered mental status, which has been improving recently, but further evaluation is needed to determine if it is related to nasal passage ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, who was admitted to the ICU with sepsis and pneumonia. He required intubation and invasive ventilation. The patient has a previous diagnosis of MRSA bacteremia and was on vancomycin. He was extubated and started on morphine for pain management. The patient experienced hypoxemia post-intubation with a blood gas of 7.52/30/60. He received a total of 500 cc of normal saline over 2 hours for low urine output and ordered a 250 cc bolus for hypotension in the 60s/40s. Levophed was started for mean arterial pressure in the low 50s. Two boluses of 250 cc NS were given for low urine output. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/70 to 87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal range. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased lactate levels. The patient's mental status is altered but not delirium. He has impaired balance, endurance, transfers, ventilation, and skin integrity. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and chronic systolic heart failure. The patient is currently on multiple medications including regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient's impaired ventilation and previous intubation may increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of chronic systolic heart failure and sepsis may lead to worsening heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient's sepsis and history of MRSA bacteremia indicate an increased risk of infection. He may be susceptible to new infections, including hospital-acquired infections.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and impaired gastrointestinal function may increase the risk of further bleeding or gastrointestinal issues.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and impaired balance and transfers may indicate a risk of falls or pressure ulcers.
6. Renal complications: The patient's low urine output and increased lactate levels may suggest renal impairment or acute kidney injury.
7. Skin complications: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers or infections.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and a comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate assessments and treatment planning."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of pt
   teeth as they seemed to be a source of infection.
   # Hypotension/pressor requirement: Now off pressors, although urine
   output is low. Previously, the patient was pressor-dependent throughout
   her admission. The reason for the patient
s persistent pressor
   requirement is not clear. Contributing factors have included low EF
   (although recent TTE suggests normal EF), decompensated heart failure,
   infection, low albumin, and GI bleeding. Sedation was also likely a
   contributor. At this point, the patient does not appear septic. She is
   no longer on sedation.
   - encourage nutrition
   - continue to maintain patient off pressors
   - No fluid boluses for now. Could consider giving colloid if urine
   output does not pick up
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dental
   hygiene. After she developed recurrent fevers, it was felt that her
   teeth could possibly be a source of infection. She was taking to the OR
   by OMFS, where she had 24 teeth removed. She returned to the CCU
   intubated and on pressors/sedation. Now, s/p extubation. Culture of
   surgical specimen showing enterococcus and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - continue to follow micro data/path for surgical specimens
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status has been improving recently.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed extensive paranasal sinus disease,
   ?NP hydrocephalus, small radiolucent focus in left frontal bone. Pt now
   with PRN morphine for mouth pain; may be contributing to pt
s AMS.
   - continue to monitor mental status, discuss with family
   - f/[**Name Initial (MD) **] possible NP hydrocephalus as o/p
   - consult neuro if mental status does not continue to improve
   - pain control as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Was extubated [**2144-4-22**] and had been breathing
   comfortably on NC. Pt is now s/p reintubation for her OMFS procedure
   and extubation yesterday.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which ended yesterday. Recommending 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia.
   - continue vanc x 21 day course (ending [**5-4**])
   - appreciated add
l ID recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Holding diuresis.
   Pt does not have fluid on lungs. Peripheral edema likely exacerbated by
   hypoalbuminemia.
   - holding diuresis; continue to monitor I/O balance
   .
   # Edema: Likely related to hypoalbuminemia in addition to HF.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - holding on further diuresis at this point
   - restarting tube feeds
   # GI bleeding: Pt has had slow downtrend of hct and has required some
   units of blood. Hemolysis labs negative. Underwent EGD on [**2144-4-20**], which
   showed [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 112**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3625**], band-like lesion in area of [**Doctor Last Name 112**]
s, and
   gastritis. None of these findings were thought to be the source of the
   bleeding. GI recommending bleeding scan.  Most recently, received 1
   unit PRBC on [**4-29**]. Hct stable this a.m.
   - will pursue EUS when pt is more stable
   - f/u GI recs
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue PPI
   - continue to trend hematocrits
   - guaiac all stools
   - bleeding scan not likely to reveal anything
 will d/w GI
   .
   # Gastritis/band-like esophageal lesion: Identified on EGD [**2144-4-20**]. Not
   thought to be source of patient
s bleeding. Appearance of lesion near
   GE junction consistent with mass, but varix could not be excluded, so
   no biopsy was done.
   - continue PPI
   - holding on EUS until pt is more stable, as above
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for 3
   weeks
   - continue
   telemetry
   - electrolyte repletion PRN, [**Hospital1 7**] electrolyte checks

","Based on the provided physician progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of her teeth due to suspected infection.

The patient is currently off pressors, but with low urine output. She previously required pressors throughout her admission due to various contributing factors such as low ejection fraction (EF), decompensated heart failure, infection, low albumin, and GI bleeding. The patient is no longer on sedation.

The patient underwent dental extraction after presenting with poor dental hygiene and recurrent fevers. Dental specimens showed enterococcus and [Female First Name]. The patient also has altered mental status (AMS) that has been improving recently. A non-contrast CT head on [2144-4-14] showed extensive paranasal sinus disease and possible NP hydrocephalus.

The patient was reintubated for an oral-maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) procedure and then extubated the following day. She has MRSA bacteremia and MRSA/Proteus in her sputum. She was treated with vancomycin as well as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended a 15"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of pt
   teeth as they seemed to be a source of infection.
   # Hypotension/pressor requirement: The patient has required pressors
   throughout this admission. The reason for her persistent pressor
   requirement is not all that clear. Contributing factors have included
   low EF, decompensated heart failure, infection, and GI bleeding.
   Sedation was  also likely a contributor. At this point, she does not
   appear septic. She is no longer on sedation. Last night, she was tried
   off pressors but this only lasted for 1 hour. She was switched to
   levophed (from neosynephrine) overnight.  Possibly some of pt
s pressor
   requirement was [**3-17**] pt having developed dependence on neo.
   - try to wean levophed today; may have easier time weaning now after
   switching to a different pressor
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dental
   hygiene. After she developed recurrent fevers, it was felt that her
   teeth could possibly be a source of infection. She was taking to the OR
   by OMFS, where she had 24 teeth removed. She returned to the CCU
   intubated and on pressors/sedation. Now, s/p sedation. Gram stain of
   surgical specimen showing budding yeasts (normal oral flora per ID).
   - f/u micro data for surgical specimens
   - f/u ID recs
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status has been improving recently.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed extensive paranasal sinus disease,
   ?NP hydrocephalus, small radiolucent focus in left frontal bone. Pt now
   with PRN morphine for mouth pain; may be contributing to pt
s AMS.
   - continue to monitor mental status, discuss  with family
   - f/[**Name Initial (MD) **] possible NP hydrocephalus and focal lesion as o/p
   - consult neuro if mental status does not continue to improve
   - pain control as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Was extubated [**2144-4-22**] and had been breathing
   comfortably on NC. Pt is now s/p reintubation for her OMFS procedure
   and extubation yesterday.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which ended yesterday. Recommending 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia.
   - continue vanc x 21 day course (ending [**5-4**])
   - appreciated add

   # Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Holding diuresis.
   Pt does not seem fluid-overloaded from a cardiac-standpoint at this
   time
 no crackles on exam, concentrated urine. Peripheral edema likely
   related to hypoalbuminemia.
   - holding diuresis; continue to monitor I/O balance
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lyte check

   # Edema: Likely related to hypoalbuminemia in addition to HF.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - holding on further diuresis at this point

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis and has had an ICU course complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure, sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and recent dental extraction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/pressor requirement: The patient has required pressors throughout this admission, possibly due to low ejection fraction (EF), decompensated heart failure, infection, and GI bleeding. She was recently switched to levophed from neosynephrine, and efforts will be made to wean off levophed today.
2. S/p dental extraction: The patient presented with poor dental hygiene, and after developing recurrent fevers, her teeth were suspected as a source of infection. She underwent extraction of 24 teeth, but gram stain of surgical specimen showed budding yeasts (normal oral flora), indicating no infection.
3. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient's mental status has been improving recently, but non-contrast CT head showed extensive paranasal sinus disease, possible nasal polyposis hydrocephalus, and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. PRN morphine for mouth pain may contribute to AMS.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient was extubated on [2144-4-22"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of pt
   teeth as they seemed to be a source of infection.
   # Hypotension/Low urine output: Now off pressors, although urine output
   is low. Responded poorly to albumin infusion. Previously, the patient
   was pressor-dependent throughout her admission. The reason for the
   patient
s persistent pressor requirement is not clear. Contributing
   factors have included low EF (although recent TTE suggests normal EF),
   decompensated heart failure, infection, low albumin, sedation, and GI
   bleeding.
   - encourage nutrition
   - evaluate GI bleeding as below
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dental
   hygiene. After she developed recurrent fevers, it was felt that her
   teeth could possibly be a source of infection. She was taking to the OR
   by OMFS, where she had 24 teeth removed. She returned to the CCU
   intubated and on pressors/sedation. Now, s/p extubation. Culture of
   surgical specimen showing enterococcus and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - continue to follow micro data/path for surgical specimens
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status has been persistently altered
   throughout patient
s admission. Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed
   extensive paranasal sinus disease, ?NP hydrocephalus, small radiolucent
   focus in left frontal bone. Pt now with PRN morphine for mouth pain;
   may be contributing to pt
s AMS.
   - continue to monitor mental status, discuss with family
   - consult neuro
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Was intubated [**Date range (1) 14057**] and [**Date range (3) 14058**].
   Now breathing comfortably on RA/nasal cannula.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which ended yesterday. Recommending 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia.
   - continue vanc x 21 day course (ending [**5-4**])
   - appreciated add
l ID recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Holding diuresis.
   Pt does not have fluid on lungs. Peripheral edema likely exacerbated by
   hypoalbuminemia.
   - holding diuresis; continue to monitor I/O balance
   .
   # Edema: Likely related to hypoalbuminemia in addition to HF.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - holding on further diuresis at this point
   - restarting tube feeds
   # GI bleeding: Pt has had slow downtrend of hct and has required some
   units of blood. Hemolysis labs negative. Underwent EGD on [**2144-4-20**], which
   showed [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 112**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3625**], band-like lesion in area of [**Doctor Last Name 112**]
s, and
   gastritis. None of these findings were thought to be the source of the
   bleeding. GI recommending bleeding scan.  Hct continues to trend down.
   - bleeding scan per GI recs
   - f/u GI recs
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue PPI
   - continue to trend hematocrits
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   # Gastritis/band-like esophageal lesion: Identified on EGD [**2144-4-20**]. Not
   thought to be source of patient
s bleeding. Appearance of lesion near
   GE junction consistent with mass, but varix could not be excluded, so
   no biopsy was done.
   - continue PPI
   - holding on EUS for now
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for 3
   weeks
   - continue
   telemetry
   - electrolyte repletion PRN, [**Hospital1 7**] electrolyte checks
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.
   - continue Synthroid

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of pt
   teeth as they seemed to be a source of infection.
   # Hypotension/pressor requirement: Now off pressors, although urine
   output is low. Previously, the patient was pressor-dependent throughout
   her admission. The reason for the patient
s persistent pressor
   requirement is not clear. Contributing factors have included low EF
   (although recent TTE suggests normal EF), decompensated heart failure,
   infection, low albumin, and GI bleeding. Sedation was also likely a
   contributor. At this point, the patient does not appear septic. She is
   no longer on sedation.
   - encourage nutrition
   - continue to maintain patient off pressors
   - No fluid boluses for now. Could consider giving colloid if urine
   output does not pick up
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dental
   hygiene. After she developed recurrent fevers, it was felt that her
   teeth could possibly be a source of infection. She was taking to the OR
   by OMFS, where she had 24 teeth removed. She returned to the CCU
   intubated and on pressors/sedation. Now, s/p extubation. Culture of
   surgical specimen showing enterococcus and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - continue to follow micro data/path for surgical specimens
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status has been improving recently.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed extensive paranasal sinus disease,
   ?NP hydrocephalus, small radiolucent focus in left frontal bone. Pt now
   with PRN morphine for mouth pain; may be contributing to pt
s AMS.
   - continue to monitor mental status, discuss with family
   - f/[**Name Initial (MD) **] possible NP hydrocephalus as o/p
   - consult neuro if mental status does not continue to improve
   - pain control as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Was extubated [**2144-4-22**] and had been breathing
   comfortably on NC. Pt is now s/p reintubation for her OMFS procedure
   and extubation yesterday.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which ended yesterday. Recommending 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia.
   - continue vanc x 21 day course (ending [**5-4**])
   - appreciated add
l ID recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Holding diuresis.
   Pt does not have fluid on lungs. Peripheral edema likely exacerbated by
   hypoalbuminemia.
   - holding diuresis; continue to monitor I/O balance
   .
   # Edema: Likely related to hypoalbuminemia in addition to HF.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - holding on further diuresis at this point
   - restarting tube feeds
   # GI bleeding: Pt has had slow downtrend of hct and has required some
   units of blood. Hemolysis labs negative. Underwent EGD on [**2144-4-20**], which
   showed [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 112**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3625**], band-like lesion in area of [**Doctor Last Name 112**]
s, and
   gastritis. None of these findings were thought to be the source of the
   bleeding. GI recommending bleeding scan.  Most recently, received 1
   unit PRBC on [**4-29**]. Hct stable this a.m.
   - will pursue EUS when pt is more stable
   - f/u GI recs
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue PPI
   - continue to trend hematocrits
   - guaiac all stools
   - bleeding scan not likely to reveal anything
 will d/w GI
   .
   # Gastritis/band-like esophageal lesion: Identified on EGD [**2144-4-20**]. Not
   thought to be source of patient
s bleeding. Appearance of lesion near
   GE junction consistent with mass, but varix could not be excluded, so
   no biopsy was done.
   - continue PPI
   - holding on EUS until pt is more stable, as above
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for 3
   weeks
   - continue
   telemetry
   - electrolyte repletion PRN, [**Hospital1 7**] electrolyte checks

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a complex medical history, including decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF), hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, persistent pressor requirement, recent extraction of all teeth, and altered mental status. The patient has multiple potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note.

1. Hypotension/pressor requirement: The patient's persistent hypotension and need for pressors indicate potential cardiac dysfunction, possibly related to her decompensated CHF. Other contributing factors such as low ejection fraction (EF), infection, low albumin, and GI bleeding may also play a role. Monitoring the patient's blood pressure and ensuring adequate perfusion is crucial.

2. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently not appearing septic, her recent history of sepsis and ongoing infections could potentially lead to another septic episode. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and infection control measures is necessary.

3. GI bleeding: The patient has experienced a slow downtrend in hemoglobin concentration and required blood transfusions. Continued monitoring of hematocrit levels, trending of laboratory results, and adherence to GI recommendations for further evaluation, such as an EUS, are essential.

4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has been improving but remains a concern. Possible causes include medication effects (e.g"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She has had an ICU course complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and recent dental extraction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has persistently altered mental status throughout her admission. A non-contrast CT head showed extensive paranasal sinus disease, possible NP hydrocephalus, and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. Neurology recommended a large-volume LP (lumbar puncture) for further evaluation.

2. GI Bleeding: The patient has had persistent melena with a downward trend in hematocrit (Hct). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on [2144-4-20] showed a band-like lesion in the area of [Doctor Last Name 112] and gastritis. None of these findings were thought to be the source of bleeding. A bleeding scan on [2144-5-1] suggested a proximal small bowel source.

3. Tachypnea: The patient was tachypneic in the morning of [2144-5-2] but was oxygenating well on a shovel mask. She was intubated on [Date range"

   # Altered mental status: Mental status has been persistently altered
   throughout patient
s admission. Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed
   extensive paranasal sinus disease, ?NP hydrocephalus, small radiolucent
   focus in left frontal bone. Consulted neuro on [**5-1**], who recommended
   large volume (20-30 cc) LP.

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF).
- She was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis and has had an ICU course complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all teeth due to poor dentition.
- The patient has an altered mental status, which has persisted throughout her admission. A non-contrast CT head showed extensive paranasal sinus disease and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. A large-volume lumbar puncture was recommended.
- The patient had persistent melena, with a downward trend in hemoglobin concentration. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a band-like lesion in the area of the gastroesophageal junction and gastritis, but these findings were not thought to be the source of bleeding. A bleeding scan suggested a proximal small bowel source.
- The patient is tachypneic and required intubation. She has been diagnosed with hypernatremia due to inability to take oral fluids and inadequate access to free water.
- The patient underwent extraction of 24 teeth and culture of surgical specimens showed Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and MRSA.
- The patient has been treated with vancom"

   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of pt
   teeth as they seemed to be a source of infection.
   # Hypotension/Low urine output: Now off pressors, although urine output
   is low. Responded poorly to albumin infusion. Previously, the patient
   was pressor-dependent throughout her admission. The reason for the
   patient
s persistent pressor requirement is not clear. Contributing
   factors have included low EF (although recent TTE suggests normal EF),
   decompensated heart failure, infection, low albumin, sedation, and GI
   bleeding.
   - encourage nutrition
   - evaluate GI bleeding as below
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dental
   hygiene. After she developed recurrent fevers, it was felt that her
   teeth could possibly be a source of infection. She was taking to the OR
   by OMFS, where she had 24 teeth removed. She returned to the CCU
   intubated and on pressors/sedation. Now, s/p extubation. Culture of
   surgical specimen showing enterococcus and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - continue to follow micro data/path for surgical specimens
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status has been persistently altered
   throughout patient
s admission. Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed
   extensive paranasal sinus disease, ?NP hydrocephalus, small radiolucent
   focus in left frontal bone. Pt now with PRN morphine for mouth pain;
   may be contributing to pt
s AMS.
   - continue to monitor mental status, discuss with family
   - consult neuro
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Was intubated [**Date range (1) 14057**] and [**Date range (3) 14058**].
   Now breathing comfortably on RA/nasal cannula.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which ended yesterday. Recommending 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia.
   - continue vanc x 21 day course (ending [**5-4**])
   - appreciated add
l ID recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Holding diuresis.
   Pt does not have fluid on lungs. Peripheral edema likely exacerbated by
   hypoalbuminemia.
   - holding diuresis; continue to monitor I/O balance
   .
   # Edema: Likely related to hypoalbuminemia in addition to HF.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - holding on further diuresis at this point
   - restarting tube feeds
   # GI bleeding: Pt has had slow downtrend of hct and has required some
   units of blood. Hemolysis labs negative. Underwent EGD on [**2144-4-20**], which
   showed [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 112**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3625**], band-like lesion in area of [**Doctor Last Name 112**]
s, and
   gastritis. None of these findings were thought to be the source of the
   bleeding. GI recommending bleeding scan.  Hct continues to trend down.
   - bleeding scan per GI recs
   - f/u GI recs
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue PPI
   - continue to trend hematocrits

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of her teeth as they seemed to be a source of infection.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypotension/low urine output, altered mental status (AMS), respiratory failure, MRSA bacteremia, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure, edema, GI bleeding, gastritis/band-like esophageal lesion, coronary artery disease with chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD), rhythm disturbances, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's recent interventions include dental extraction due to poor dental hygiene, which showed enterococcus and [Female First Name] growth; intubation for respiratory failure; administration of antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia and other infections; and various treatments for heart failure, GI bleeding, and other conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions and interventions include worsening heart failure, further respiratory failure, recurrent or persistent infections such as MRSA bacteremia, bleeding complications due to GI bleeding, and complications related to the band-like esophageal lesion.

","Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a complex medical history including decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF), hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all teeth due to suspected infection.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient has persistently altered mental status throughout her admission. Non-contrast CT head showed extensive paranasal sinus disease, possible normal pressure (NP) hydrocephalus, and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. A large volume lumbar puncture (LP) has been recommended by the neurologist to further evaluate her condition.

2. GI bleeding: The patient has had persistent melena, with a downward trend in hematocrit (Hct) levels. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed a band-like lesion in the area of the stomach, gastritis, but no source of bleeding was identified. A bleeding scan suggested a proximal small bowel source. Further evaluation by the gastroenterology (GI) and surgery teams is recommended.

3. Dental extraction: The patient underwent extraction of 24 teeth due to poor dentition. Cultures of the surgical specimen showed vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and meth"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of pt
   teeth as they seemed to be a source of infection.
   # Hypotension/Low urine output: Now off pressors, although urine output
   is low. Responded poorly to albumin infusion. Previously, the patient
   was pressor-dependent throughout her admission. The reason for the
   patient
s persistent pressor requirement is not clear. Contributing
   factors have included low EF (although recent TTE suggests normal EF),
   decompensated heart failure, infection, low albumin, sedation, and GI
   bleeding.
   - encourage nutrition
   - evaluate GI bleeding as below
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dental
   hygiene. After she developed recurrent fevers, it was felt that her
   teeth could possibly be a source of infection. She was taking to the OR
   by OMFS, where she had 24 teeth removed. She returned to the CCU
   intubated and on pressors/sedation. Now, s/p extubation. Culture of
   surgical specimen showing enterococcus and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - continue to follow micro data/path for surgical specimens
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status has been persistently altered
   throughout patient
s admission. Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed
   extensive paranasal sinus disease, ?NP hydrocephalus, small radiolucent
   focus in left frontal bone. Pt now with PRN morphine for mouth pain;
   may be contributing to pt
s AMS.
   - continue to monitor mental status, discuss with family
   - consult neuro
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Was intubated [**Date range (1) 14057**] and [**Date range (3) 14058**].
   Now breathing comfortably on RA/nasal cannula.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which ended yesterday. Recommending 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia.
   - continue vanc x 21 day course (ending [**5-4**])
   - appreciated add
l ID recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Holding diuresis.
   Pt does not have fluid on lungs. Peripheral edema likely exacerbated by
   hypoalbuminemia.
   - holding diuresis; continue to monitor I/O balance
   .
   # Edema: Likely related to hypoalbuminemia in addition to HF.
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - holding on further diuresis at this point
   - restarting tube feeds
   # GI bleeding: Pt has had slow downtrend of hct and has required some
   units of blood. Hemolysis labs negative. Underwent EGD on [**2144-4-20**], which
   showed [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 112**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3625**], band-like lesion in area of [**Doctor Last Name 112**]
s, and
   gastritis. None of these findings were thought to be the source of the
   bleeding. GI recommending bleeding scan.  Hct continues to trend down.
   - bleeding scan per GI recs
   - f/u GI recs
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue PPI
   - continue to trend hematocrits
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   # Gastritis/band-like esophageal lesion: Identified on EGD [**2144-4-20**]. Not
   thought to be source of patient
s bleeding. Appearance of lesion near
   GE junction consistent with mass, but varix could not be excluded, so
   no biopsy was done.
   - continue PPI
   - holding on EUS for now
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for 3
   weeks
   - continue
   telemetry
   - electrolyte repletion PRN, [**Hospital1 7**] electrolyte checks
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.
   - continue Synthroid

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis and developed hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient also had superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all teeth due to poor dental hygiene.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension/low urine output, altered mental status, respiratory failure, MRSA bacteremia, acute on chronic systolic CHF, edema, GI bleeding, gastritis/band-like esophageal lesion, coronary artery disease with chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery, rhythm disturbances, and hypothyroidism.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension/Low urine output: The patient is off pressors, but urine output is still low. Previously, the patient was pressor-dependent throughout her admission. Contributing factors include low ejection fraction (EF), decompensated heart failure, infection, low albumin, sedation, and GI bleeding. Encourage nutrition and evaluate GI bleeding as below.

2. S/p Dental Extraction: The patient had poor dental hygiene, leading to recurrent fevers, and subsequently underwent extraction of 24 teeth. She returned to the critical care unit (CCU) intubated and on pressors/sedation. Culture of surgical specimen showed enterococcus and [**Female First Name (un)**]. Continue to follow microbiological data and pathology for surgical specimens.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been persistently altered throughout her admission. Non-contrast CT head showed extensive paranasal sinus disease, possibly nasopharyngeal (NP) hydrocephalus, and small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. Consult neurology for further evaluation.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and is now breathing comfortably on room air/nasal cannula. Continue to monitor respiratory status.

5. MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: The patient was treated with vancomycin (VAN) as well as cefepime/flagyl. Infectious Disease recommended a 15-day course of cefepime/flagyl, which ended yesterday. Recommending a 21-day course of VAN for MRSA bacteremia. Continue VAN x 21-day course (ending [**5-4**]).

6. Acute on chronic systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Holding diuresis. The patient does not have fluid on lungs. Peripheral edema is likely exacerbated by hypoalbuminemia. Continue to monitor I/O balance.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient is currently in the ICU due to various health issues, including impaired nutrition, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hospital-acquired pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, and chronic systolic heart failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/59 mmHg to 134/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight has decreased from 91.3 kg at admission to 80.1 kg currently.

The patient has received several treatments and interventions, including IV fluids, Lasix drip for negative fluid balance, furosemide infusion, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated potassium level of 5.25 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen level of 31 mg/dL, and slightly low albumin level of 1.9 g/dL. Other lab values show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, total carbon dioxide, and electrolyte levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, impaired nutrition, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (hospital-acquired), impaired skin integrity, and impaired health maintenance.

The patient's current condition shows tachypnea, right bundle branch block (RRB), and pitting edema in the lower extremities. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 94 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 104/59 mmHg to 134/84 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery.

The patient has received various treatments and interventions, including furosemide (Lasix) infusion, pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient also has multiple lines inserted, including a multi-lumen line and an arterial line.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. These include:

1. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's chronic heart failure may worsen due to fluid overload or inadequate cardiac output"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis and has had an ICU course complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all teeth due to poor dentition.

The patient has altered mental status, which has persisted throughout her admission. A non-contrast CT head on 04/14 showed extensive paranasal sinus disease, possibly nasopharyngeal (NP) hydrocephalus, and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. Neurology recommended a large-volume lumbar puncture (LP) for further evaluation.

The patient has also had persistent melena, with a downward trend in hematocrit (Hct). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on 04/20 showed a band-like lesion in the area of the stomach, as well as gastritis. None of these findings were thought to be the source of the bleeding. A bleeding scan on 05/01 suggested a proximal small bowel source.

Other issues include tachypnea, fluid overload, hypernatremia, and recent dental extraction. The patient presented with poor dentition and underwent extraction of 24 teeth on 04/27. Cultures"

   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of pt
   teeth as they seemed to be a source of infection.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status has been persistently altered
   throughout patient
s admission. Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed
   extensive paranasal sinus disease, ?NP hydrocephalus, small radiolucent
   focus in left frontal bone. Consulted neuro on [**5-1**], who recommended
   large volume (20-30 cc) LP.
   - large-volume LP; CCU team unsuccessful yesterday, neuro to
   attempt

   # GI bleeding: Pt has had persistent melena, with downward trend in
   Hct. Underwent EGD on [**2144-4-20**], which showed [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) 112**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3625**],
   band-like lesion in area of [**Doctor Last Name 112**]

   findings were thought to be the source of the bleeding. Bleeding scan
   [**2144-5-1**] suggested proximal small bowel source. CTA did not reveal
   obvious source of bleeding.

   - decreased heparin SC to [**Hospital1 7**] ([**3-17**] increased Hct)
   - giving 1 mg Vit K [**3-17**] increased INR
   .
   # Fluid overload: Likely multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia in
   addition to heart failure. Seems that most of the patient
s fluid is in
   the peripheral tissues secondary to low oncotic pressure.
   - Lasix gtt, goal 1-2 L neg
   - continue to monitor fluid status

   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dentition. She
   underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**2144-4-27**]. Culture of surgical
   specimen showing VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **].

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female admitted to the ICU for inotropic-assisted diuresis due to decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure. The patient's course in the ICU has been complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, extraction of all teeth as a potential source of infection, and altered mental status.

The patient underwent an endoscopy that showed a band-like lesion in the area of the stomach but did not identify the source of bleeding. A bleeding scan suggested a proximal small bowel source, and a CT angiography did not reveal an obvious source. The patient's fluid status is concerning for fluid overload, likely multifactorial in origin including hypoalbuminemia and heart failure. The patient has hypernatremia due to inability to take oral fluids and inadequate access to free water.

The patient also presented with poor dentition and underwent extraction of 24 teeth, with culture of the surgical specimen showing vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and [Female First Name]. The patient has been treated with vancomycin and cefepime/flagyl for MRSA bacteremia and MRSA/Proteus in sputum. The patient's coronary arteries are diseased with a chronic total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery. The patient has experienced episodes of sinus tachycard"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who has been admitted to the ICU for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She has had a complicated course with hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of her teeth due to poor dentition.

The patient has persistent altered mental status (AMS), which is likely multifactorial in origin. She underwent a non-contrast CT head that showed extensive paranasal sinus disease and a possible nasal passage (NP) hydrocephalus, with a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. The neurologist recommended a large-volume lumbar puncture (LP) to further evaluate and manage this condition.

The patient also has a history of persistent melena, with a downward trend in hemoglobin concentration (Hct). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on [date] showed a band-like lesion in the area of the gastroesophageal junction, along with gastritis. However, none of these findings were thought to be the source of the bleeding. A bleeding scan on [date] suggested a proximal small bowel source, and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) did not reveal an obvious source of bleeding.

The patient is likely experiencing fluid overload, possibly due"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and recent extraction of all of pt
   teeth as they seemed to be a source of infection.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status has been persistently altered
   throughout patient
s admission. Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed
   extensive paranasal sinus disease, ?NP hydrocephalus, small radiolucent
   focus in left frontal bone. Consulted neuro on [**5-1**], who recommended
   large volume (20-30 cc) LP.
   - large-volume LP; CCU team unsuccessful yesterday, neuro to
   attempt
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # GI bleeding: Pt has had persistent melena, with downward trend in
   Hct. Underwent EGD on [**2144-4-20**], which showed [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) 112**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3625**],
   band-like lesion in area of [**Doctor Last Name 112**]
s, and gastritis. None of these
   findings were thought to be the source of the bleeding. Bleeding scan
   [**2144-5-1**] suggested proximal small bowel source. CTA did not reveal
   obvious source of bleeding.
   - f/u GI and surgery recs
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue PPI
   - trend Hct
   - guaiac stools
   - pt to get colonoscopy with push enteroscopy today to look for source
   of bleeding
   .
   # Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload likely
   multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia in addition to heart
   failure. Seems that most of the patient
s fluid is in the peripheral
   tissues secondary to low oncotic pressure.
   - hold diuresis for now in setting of low blood pressure; restart Lasix
   gtt, with goal 1 L negative if pressure improves
   - repeat echo to reassess systolic funciton
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Due to inability to take PO and inadequate access to
   free water.
   - calculate free water deficit and replete IV
   .
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dentition. She
   underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**2144-4-27**]. Culture of surgical
   specimen showing VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - continue to follow micro data/path for surgical specimens
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)

   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which is complete. Recommending 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia.
   - continue vanc x 21 day course (ending [**5-4**])

   # Gastritis/band-like esophageal lesion: Identified on EGD [**2144-4-20**]. Not
   thought to be source of patient
s bleeding. Appearance highly
   suggestive of neoplasm.
   - EUS with biopsy pending family discussion
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT. Pt did have VT/?VF last weekend and
   was shocked out of it by her ICD.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for total 3

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Esophageal cancer: The presence of a mass in the lower third of the esophagus with friable and bleeding characteristics raises concerns for esophageal cancer. Further evaluation and biopsy are needed to confirm this diagnosis.

2. Heart failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, as indicated by the worsening ejection fraction (EF) and mitral regurgitation/tricuspid regurgitation (MR/TR) on the echocardiogram. Optimization of the medical regimen for CHF is ongoing.

3. Impaired nutrition and aerobic capacity/endurance: The patient's altered nutrition balance and impaired aerobic capacity/endurance suggest malnutrition and decreased physical fitness levels. Nutritional support and rehabilitation measures may be necessary.

4. Impaired transfers and ventilation: The patient's impaired transfers indicate difficulty in moving around independently, while impaired ventilation suggests respiratory function compromise. Physical therapy and respiratory support may be required.

5. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which is not delirium. This could be due to various factors such as medication side effects, electrolyte imbalances, or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring and assessment are necessary.

6. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has had a gastrointestinal bleed, which may be related to the esophageal mass. Continued monitoring and management of the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient underwent an endoscopy which revealed a mass in the lower third of the esophagus, showing malignant appearance with friable and bleeding characteristics. The scope traversed the lesion, and normal mucosa was observed in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum. The patient also had a lumbar puncture performed, revealing minimally elevated protein levels. Repeat echo demonstrated ejection fraction of 20-25% and worsening mitral regurgitation/tricuspid regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The presence of a friable and bleeding esophageal mass indicates a risk of ongoing or recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Sepsis: With impaired immune function and multiple comorbidities, the patient is at risk for developing sepsis, especially if there is an associated infection.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's impaired ventilation and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia.
4. Heart Failure Exacerbation: The worsening mitral regurgitation/tricuspid regurgitation on repeat echo suggests a possible exacerbation of the patient's underlying chronic heart failure.
5. Impaired Nutrition: The patient's altered mental status and impaired transfers may lead to inadequate nutrition and hydration support.
6. Impaired Health Maintenance: The patient's multiple medical"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, and evidence of GI malignancy found during push enteroscopy.

The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, impaired nutrition, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hospital-acquired pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, and chronic systolic heart failure.

The plan includes continuing to trend critical checks, transfusing for falling blood volume, performing an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for biopsy once acute bleeding stops, and discussing goals of care with the family given the new diagnosis of GI malignancy. The patient's fluid overload and congestive heart failure will be addressed by continuing lasix GTT and diuresis with a goal of negative 1-2 liters per day. Her altered mental status will be managed by consulting neurology and following up on their recommendations.

The patient also has hypernatremia due to inadequate access to free water, which will be continued to be trended. She underwent dental extraction due to poor dentition and had cultures showing vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MR"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. During her ICU course, she developed hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, and persistent pressor requirement. A push enteroscopy revealed a likely malignancy in the lower third of the esophagus. She also has evidence of impaired nutrition, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, altered mental status (not delirium), pneumonia (hospital-acquired), impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, chronic systolic heart failure, and a possible nasal-phantom (NPH) syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Nutrition: The patient's impaired nutrition can lead to further weight loss, muscle wasting, and compromised immune function, increasing the risk of infections and delayed wound healing.
2. Impaired Aerobic Capacity/Endurance: Due to her chronic heart failure and limited mobility, the patient may experience reduced exercise tolerance, fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased quality of life.
3. Impaired Transfers: Limited strength and muscle weakness can make it difficult for the patient to transfer from bed to chair, walk, or perform activities of daily living, increasing the risk of falls and immobility-related complications.
4. Impaired Ventilation: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and the discovery of a likely malignancy on push enteroscopy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals mild rhonchi in the respiratory system, pitting edema in all four extremities, and bilateral bronchial breath sounds with decreased air entry in the left lung base. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 272 K/uL, leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils, elevated lactate level, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 81 and 148 mg/dL.

The patient has several medical complications, including impaired nutrition, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, altered mental status (not delirium), gastrointestinal bleed"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She has had an ICU course complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and a likely malignancy found on push enteroscopy.

The patient has multiple medical complications including impaired knowledge, impaired muscle performance, alteration in nutrition, impaired balance, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, altered mental status (not delirium), gastrointestinal bleed, hospital-acquired pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, chronic systolic heart failure, and a possible malignancy in the esophagus.

The patient's current plan includes continuing PPI, daily critical checks, transfusing for falling blood volume, guaiac all stools, holding anticoagulants if possible, and following up with GI recommendations. For fluid overload/congestive heart failure, the patient will continue to address nutrition, replace NGT, and diurese with Lasix GTT, aiming for negative 1-2L/day with BP monitoring. 

Regarding the altered mental status, the patient has had persistently altered mental status throughout her admission. A non-contrast CT head showed extensive paranasal sinus disease, possible NPH, elevated protein otherwise un"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of chronic heart failure and is currently on several medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole.

On the 24-hour flow sheet, the patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/65 mmHg to 114/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.3°C.

The patient has received a total of 604 mL of IV fluids and has lost 741 mL of fluid through other means. Blood product transfusion of 1,345 mL has been administered, and the patient has produced 1,345 mL of urine.

Physical examination findings include normal peripheral pulses and skin, but neurologic assessment could not be performed due to the patient's altered mental status.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 314 K/uL and elevated lactate levels at 30.6%. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, creatinine, and electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) reveals a pH of 7.23. The platelet count is also low at 72 K/uL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF), who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She has an ICU course complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, and the discovery of a likely malignancy on push enteroscopy. The patient's current condition includes impaired knowledge, impaired muscle performance, altered mental status (not delirium), gastrointestinal bleed, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (hospital-acquired), impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, chronic systolic heart failure, and possible normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload/congestive heart failure: The patient's fluid overload may be multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. It is important to continue addressing nutrition and replacing the nasogastric tube. Diuresis with Lasix GTT should be continued, aiming for negative 1-2 liters per day with blood pressure monitoring.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has been persistently altered throughout her admission. Non-contrast CT head showed extensive paranasal sinus disease and a small radiolucent focus in the left frontal bone. Neurology consultation was done, and a lumbar puncture performed, showing normal pressure. Possible"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis.
- The patient has been in the ICU and has had several complications including hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, and evidence of GI malignancy.
- The patient is currently stable, but has impaired muscle performance, impaired nutrition, impaired balance, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, altered mental status, and impaired skin integrity.
- The patient's heart failure is likely multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia in addition to her underlying heart condition.
- The patient's mental status has been persistently altered throughout her admission, with possible normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and elevated protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
- The patient has had occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm without p-waves (junctional) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT).
- The patient also has hypernatremia, which is being managed with careful fluid balance and electrolyte repletion.
- The patient underwent dental extraction and had cultures showing vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
- The patient had MRSA bacteremia and infection in her"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement now found to have likely malignancy on
   push enteroscopy.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status dramatically improved today.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed possible normal pressure
   hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel that this was the case.
   Consulted neurology on [**5-1**].  LP performed. CSF protein minimally
   elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology negative. EEG
   consistent with encephalopathy. No seizure activity. Most likely
   etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged
   intubation.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - monitor on EEG
   - minimize sedating meds
   .
   # Esophageal mass: Biopsied [**2144-5-6**]. Results pending. Likely cancerous.
   - f/u biopsy results
   .
   # GI bleeding: Patient has had guaiac positive stool since admission.
   Has been transfused a total of 9 units so far, last on [**5-1**].  Bleeding
   scan suggested source in proximal small bowel, although push
   enteroscopy was negative to 90 cm from incisors.
   -follow Hct
   -maintain active T+S
   -holding anticoagulation for now except prophylactic heparin
   -f/u GI recs
   -continue PPI
   .
   # Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload likely
   multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition
   to heart failure.
   -address nutrition as below
   -Lasix gtt, goal negative 2 liters today
   -[**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   .
   # Malnutrition: Has been difficult to feed patient given mental status.
   She had a post-pyloric Dobhoff tube placed yesterday, but she pulled
   this out 2 hours after it was placed. As mental status is markedly
   improved today, she may be able to obtain some nutrition by mouth.
   -assess nutritional intake as mental status improves. If inadequate,
   consider need to PEG.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Related to poor PO intake.
   - D5W at 150 cc/hr for 24 hours
   - Check lytes TID
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT. Pt did have VT/?VF last weekend and
   was shocked out of it by her ICD.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for total 3
   weeks
   - continue telemetry
   - contact her [**Name2 (NI) 265**] cardiologist ([**Name (NI) 1219**] [**Name (NI) 10213**]) to get more details
   re: her defibrillator and systolic function
   .
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dentition. She
   underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**2144-4-27**]. Culture of surgical
   specimen showing VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which is complete. Recommending 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia.
   -  vanc x 21 day course (ended [**5-4**])
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.
   - continue Synthroid

She also has hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, and a likely malignancy on push enteroscopy.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement now found to have likely malignancy on
   push enteroscopy.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status dramatically improved today.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed possible normal pressure
   hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel that this was the case.
   Consulted neurology on [**5-1**].  LP performed. CSF protein minimally
   elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology negative. EEG
   consistent with encephalopathy. No seizure activity. Most likely
   etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged
   intubation.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - monitor on EEG
   - minimize sedating meds
   .
   # Esophageal mass: Biopsied [**2144-5-6**]. Results pending. Likely cancerous.
   - f/u biopsy results
   .
   # GI bleeding: Patient has had guaiac positive stool since admission.
   Has been transfused a total of 9 units so far, last on [**5-1**].  Bleeding
   scan suggested source in proximal small bowel, although push
   enteroscopy was negative to 90 cm from incisors.
   -follow Hct
   -maintain active T+S
   -holding anticoagulation for now except prophylactic heparin
   -f/u GI recs
   -continue PPI
   .
   # Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload likely
   multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition
   to heart failure.
   -address nutrition as below
   -Lasix gtt, goal negative 2 liters today
   -[**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   .
   # Malnutrition: Has been difficult to feed patient given mental status.
   She had a post-pyloric Dobhoff tube placed yesterday, but she pulled
   this out 2 hours after it was placed. As mental status is markedly
   improved today, she may be able to obtain some nutrition by mouth.
   -assess nutritional intake as mental status improves. If inadequate,
   consider need to PEG.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Related to poor PO intake.
   - D5W at 150 cc/hr for 24 hours
   - Check lytes TID
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT. Pt did have VT/?VF last weekend and
   was shocked out of it by her ICD.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for total 3
   weeks
   - continue telemetry
   - contact her [**Name2 (NI) 265**] cardiologist ([**Name (NI) 1219**] [**Name (NI) 10213**]) to get more details
   re: her defibrillator and systolic function
   .
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dentition. She
   underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**2144-4-27**]. Culture of surgical
   specimen showing VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which is complete. Recommending 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia.
   -  vanc x 21 day course (ended [**5-4**])
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.
   - continue Synthroid

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a complex medical history, including decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF), hypercarbic respiratory failure, sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and likely malignancy. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved significantly. A non-contrast CT scan of the head showed possible normal pressure hydrocephalus, but neurology did not confirm this diagnosis. A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed, revealing minimally elevated CSF protein, negative cultures and cytology, and an EEG consistent with encephalopathy. The most likely etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged intubation.

2. Esophageal mass: A biopsy of the esophageal mass was taken on 05/06/20XX. Results are pending, but it is suspected to be cancerous.

3. GI bleeding: The patient has had guaiac positive stool since admission and has received a total of 9 units of blood transfusion so far. A bleeding scan suggested the source in the proximal small bowel, although a push enteroscopy was negative to 90 cm from incisors.

4. Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload is likely multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition to heart failure.

5. Malnutrition: It has been difficult"

","Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a complicated medical history. She has been admitted to the ICU for inotropic-assisted diuresis due to decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's condition has been further complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, and the discovery of likely malignancy on push enteroscopy.

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/68 mmHg to 132/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Her weight has decreased from 91.3 kg at admission to 77.5 kg currently. Fluid balance indicates an overall deficit of 468 mL since 04:46 AM.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 314 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.4 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 31.9%, platelet count (Plt) of 255 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 26 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.9 mg/dL, and sodium (Na+) of 141 mEq/L. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, abnormal electrolyte levels, and elevated lactic acid levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals general alertness with orientation to person, place, and time. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Respiratory examination demonstrates ronchorous breath sounds. Abdominal examination reveals shifting dullness with positive bowel sounds. Extremities show pitting edema in all four extremities.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including fluid overload/congestive heart failure, altered mental status, rhythm disturbances, hypernatremia, post-dental extraction infection, MRSA bacteremia, and coronary artery disease. The patient is currently being treated with various medications, including amiodarone for rhythm control, antibiotics for infection, diuretics for fluid overload, and synthroid for hypothyroidism.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and the potential for complications, it is important to closely monitor her vital signs, fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and laboratory results. The patient requires continued critical care management in the ICU, with a focus on optimizing her heart failure treatment, addressing her altered mental status, managing her rhythm disturbances, and treating any ongoing infections."

   Disposition: CCU
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, presenting with altered mental status, impaired nutrition, and multiple comorbidities. She has been admitted to the ICU for inotropic-assisted diuresis but has experienced complications including hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a likely malignancy on push enteroscopy. The patient's mental status has improved with repletion of free water, but she still has poor oral intake. A family meeting is planned to discuss goals of care, therapeutic options, and prognosis in light of her multiple comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, which may worsen due to fluid overload, poor nutrition, and ongoing management challenges in the ICU.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has had guaiac positive stool since admission and has been transfused multiple units of blood. Adenocarcinoma has been confirmed as the likely source of bleeding.
3. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished with hypoalbuminemia contributing to fluid retention and impaired wound healing. Enteral nutrition may be required, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is planned.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient is likely experiencing fluid overload due to hypoalbuminemia, poor nutrition, and heart failure."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Esophageal mass: The patient has been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, at least intramucosal, arising in a background of intestinal metaplasia, consistent with Barrett's esophagus.

2. Mental status: The patient's mental status has improved with repletion of free water and improvement in hypernatremia. However, they still have poor oral intake.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had guaiac-positive stool since admission and has been transfused a total of 9 units. The bleeding scan suggested a source in the proximal small bowel, although the push enteroscopy was negative.

4. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished with hypoalbuminemia contributing to 3rd spacing. It has been difficult to feed the patient due to mental status issues.

5. Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: The patient likely has fluid overload, which is multifactorial and related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition to heart failure.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated due to poor oral intake.

7. Rhythm disturbances: The patient has had sinus rhythm with occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm without p-waves (junctional), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and ventricular"

   Consulted neurology on [**5-1**].  LP performed. CSF protein minimally
   elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology negative. EEG
   consistent with encephalopathy. No seizure activity. Most likely

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a complex medical history and current presentation in the ICU. The note details various assessments and plans for the patient's condition. Here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

1. Esophageal Mass: The patient has an esophageal mass, which was biopsied on 05/06/2144. The biopsy results indicate adenocarcinoma, at least intramucosal, and arising in a background of intestinal metaplasia, consistent with Barrett's esophagus.

2. Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved over time. Initially, there were concerns about delirium, but further evaluation suggested a toxic/metabolic etiology due to illness and prolonged intubation. The non-contrast CT head showed possible normal pressure hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel this was the case. An EEG was consistent with encephalopathy, and CSF protein was minimally elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology were negative.

3. GI Bleeding: The patient has had guaiac positive stool since admission and has received a total of 9 units of blood transfusion. A bleeding scan suggested a source in the proximal small bowel, but a push enteroscopy was negative. The confirmed adenocarcinoma is likely the source of bleeding.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient has a history of esophageal mass with a biopsy revealing adenocarcinoma consistent with Barrett's esophagus. The patient is in the ICU with impaired mental status, likely due to hypernatremia, which has improved with repletion of free water. The patient's poor oral intake has led to the consideration of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. Other medications include trazodone for sleep and speech/swallow recommendations. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in heart rate and blood pressure. Fluid balance shows an overall negative balance. The patient has received IV fluids and blood products, with a significant output of urine and stool. Lab results indicate elevated potassium levels and a slightly low hemoglobin level. The patient has a history of chronic heart failure and impaired muscle performance. The patient's current medical complications include impaired knowledge, muscle performance, nutrition balance, aerobic capacity/endurance, transfers, ventilation, altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleed, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (hospital-acquired), impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, and chronic systolic heart failure."

   # Altered mental status: Mental status dramatically improved today.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed possible normal pressure
   hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel that this was the case.
   Consulted neurology on [**5-1**].  LP performed. CSF protein minimally
   elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology negative. EEG
   consistent with encephalopathy. No seizure activity. Most likely
   etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged
   intubation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical complications. The note outlines several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Esophageal mass with confirmed adenocarcinoma: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma arising from Barrett's esophagus. This condition can lead to further complications related to the esophageal mass.

2. Impaired mental status: The patient has shown improvement in mental status but still exhibits poor oral intake. This can increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia and other respiratory infections.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has been experiencing guaiac-positive stool since admission and has received a total of 9 units of blood transfusion. This indicates ongoing GI bleeding, which can result in anemia, hypotension, and potential sepsis.

4. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has been treated for MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia, suggesting a systemic infection. If not properly managed, this can progress to sepsis with organ dysfunction.

5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may have impaired skin integrity due to prolonged bed rest, poor nutrition, and pressure ulcers.

6. Heart failure (CHF), systolic, chronic: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, which can lead to fluid overload and pulmonary congestion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including chronic stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF), sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (hospital-acquired), impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, and possible malignancy. 

The patient's current conditions include altered mental status (likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy), impaired muscle performance, impaired nutrition balance, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, gastrointestinal bleed (likely from adenocarcinoma in the esophagus), and chronic systolic heart failure. 

The patient has a history of dental extraction, MRSA bacteremia, MRSA/Proteus in sputum, coronary artery disease with a chronic total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's treatment plan involves addressing various aspects such as nutrition, heart failure management, antibiotic therapy for MRSA bacteremia, and management of CHF. The patient is currently on multiple medications including amiodarone, PPI, Lasix, and Synthroid.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, further gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, pneumonia, and complications related to impaired nutrition and muscle performance."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of adenocarcinoma who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing fluid overload, with a total fluid intake of 1,623 mL and total fluid output of 1,973 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's blood pressure remains low, with readings ranging from 54 to 74 mmHg. The patient's heart rate is within normal limits, but the respiratory rate is slightly elevated. The patient's oxygen saturation is consistently above 99%. The patient's temperature is slightly below normal.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The blood glucose levels are mostly within normal range, except for one reading of 182 mg/dL. Other lab values, including electrolytes and kidney function, are within normal limits. The patient's liver enzymes are slightly elevated.

The patient's diagnosis includes impaired knowledge, impaired muscle performance, impaired nutrition balance, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleed, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hospital-acquired pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, chronic systolic heart failure, and potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's current condition and diagnoses, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, sepsis with organ dysfunction"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement now found to have likely malignancy on
   push enteroscopy.
   .
   # Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload likely
   multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition
   to heart failure.  On lasix gtt and putting out good amount of urine
   this morning (already -1.4L for this morning).
   - continue lasix gtt, as BP tolerates, with goal -2L at least for the
   day
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - further discuss nutrition options with patient/family
   .
   # Esophageal Adenocarcinoma / GI Bleeding: Patient has had guaiac
   positive stool since admission. Has been transfused a total of 9 units
   so far, last on [**5-1**]. Esophageal mass, biopsied [**2144-5-6**], showing
   adenoCA. After family meeting yesterday, pt made DNR/DNI. Family with
   questions about diagnosis and prognosis.
   - follow Hct
   - maintain active T+S
   - holding anticoagulation for now except prophylactic heparin
   - discussed case with Heme/Onc; they will speak with patient
s family
   about her diagnosis
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status continues to improve.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed possible normal pressure
   hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel that this was the case.
   Consulted neurology on [**5-1**].  LP performed. CSF protein minimally
   elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology negative. EEG
   consistent with encephalopathy. No seizure activity. Most likely
   etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged
   intubation.
   - monitor mental status
   - f/u any neuro recs
   - minimize sedating meds
   .
   # Malnutrition: Malnourished with some improvement with Alb from 1.9 to
   2.2 with hypoalbuminemia contributing to 3^rd spacing. Has been
   difficult to feed patient given mental status, has pulled out multiple
   NGT, now MS improving. So far, trial of taking PO did not result in
   sufficient intake. Now, given pt
s diagnosis and DNR/DNI status, PEG
   placement has been put on hold.
   - need further goals of care discussions with family.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Related to poor PO intake. Normal sodium level today.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT. Pt did have VT/?VF last weekend and
   was shocked out of it by her ICD.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for total 3
   weeks
   - continue telemetry
   - contact her [**Name2 (NI) 265**] cardiologist ([**Name (NI) 1219**] [**Name (NI) 10213**]) to get more details
   re: her defibrillator and systolic function
   .
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dentition. She
   underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**2144-4-27**]. Culture of surgical
   specimen showing VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which is complete. Recommended 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia, which is also complete.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.
   - continue Synthroid

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She has been in the ICU and her course has been complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, and the recent diagnosis of likely esophageal adenocarcinoma on push enteroscopy. The patient has made decisions regarding her care, including DNR/DNI status and no plan for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: The patient is experiencing fluid overload likely multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition to heart failure. Continuing diuretics and monitoring fluid balance is important.

2. Esophageal Adenocarcinoma/GI bleeding: The patient has had guaiac positive stool since admission, indicating ongoing GI bleeding. Further management of the esophageal mass and its associated bleeding will be necessary.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating but is improving. Monitoring mental status, minimizing sedating medications, and addressing any neurologic recommendations are important.

4. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished, contributing to hypoalbuminemia. Continuing efforts to improve nutrition, potentially through enteral feeding, should be"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She has an ICU course complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding requiring transfusion, and persistent pressor requirement. A possible malignancy was found on push enteroscopy. 

The patient's mental status has improved today, but she has had altered mental status with a dramatic improvement. Neurology consulted and performed a lumbar puncture (LP), which showed minimal elevation in CSF protein but otherwise unremarkable results. EEG was consistent with encephalopathy, and no seizure activity was observed. The likely etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged intubation.

An esophageal mass was biopsied and confirmed as adenocarcinoma, arising in a background of intestinal metaplasia consistent with Barrett's esophagus. The patient has had guaiac positive stool since admission, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. She has received a total of 9 units of transfusion so far. A bleeding scan suggested a source in the proximal small bowel, although push enteroscopy was negative to 90 cm from incisors. 

The patient is malnourished with hypoalbuminemia contributing to 3rd spacing. She has pulled out multiple nasogastric tubes (NGT) and has had difficulty feeding due to mental status changes. There were trials of tube feeding and oral intake, but it was insufficient. The plan for bedside percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) by GI today will be converted to oral medications post-PEG.

Fluid overload likely multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition to heart failure. The patient is on lasix GTT at 17, stable, with only negative 355 cc per day in the setting of intravenous fluids (IVF) to correct hypernatremia. Discuss starting IV lasix boluses or PO in order to transfer the patient out of the ICU for rehabilitation.

Other medical complications include hypernatremia related to poor oral intake, rhythm disturbances such as sinus tachycardia, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and ventricular fibrillation (VF)/ventricular tachycardia (VT) last weekend, for which she was shocked out of it by her implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She has a history of coronary artery disease with a chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD), and her coronary evaluation is negative at outside hospital (OSH). She also has hypothyroidism with an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level but normal free T4 levels.

The patient has a history of poor dent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who has been admitted to the ICU for inotropic-assisted diuresis. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, and the discovery of likely esophageal adenocarcinoma on push enteroscopy.

The patient is currently experiencing fluid overload likely multifactorial in origin, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition to heart failure. She is being treated with lasix and has been putting out a good amount of urine this morning. The goal is to remove at least 2 liters of fluid today.

The patient has also had guaiac positive stool since admission, indicating GI bleeding. She has received a total of 9 units of transfusion so far. Esophageal mass biopsy showed adenocarcinoma, and after a family meeting yesterday, the patient made the decision to be DNR/DNI.

The patient's mental status has improved today, but she remains altered. Non-contrast CT head showed possible normal pressure hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel that this was the case.

   # Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload likely
   multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition
   to heart failure.  On lasix gtt and putting out good amount of urine
   this morning (already -1.4L for this morning).
   - continue lasix gtt, as BP tolerates, with goal -2L at least for the

   # Esophageal Adenocarcinoma / GI Bleeding: Patient has had guaiac
   positive stool since admission. Has been transfused a total of 9 units
   so far, last on [**5-1**]. Esophageal mass, biopsied [**2144-5-6**], showing
   adenoCA. After family meeting yesterday, pt made DNR/DNI. Family with

   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed possible normal pressure
   hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel that this was the case.
   Consulted neurology on [**5-1**].  LP performed. CSF protein minimally
   elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology negative. EEG
   consistent with encephalopathy. No seizure activity. Most likely
   etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged
   intubation.

   # Malnutrition: Malnourished with some improvement with Alb from 1.9 to
   2.2 with hypoalbuminemia contributing to 3^rd spacing. Has been
   difficult to feed patient given mental status, has pulled out multiple
   NGT, now MS improving. So far, trial of taking PO did not result in
   sufficient intake. Now, given pt
s diagnosis and DNR/DNI status, PEG
   placement has been put on hold.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a complex medical history and current presentation in the ICU. She has been admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis due to decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's ICU course has been complicated by several factors:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation: The patient developed respiratory failure, necessitating endotracheal intubation to support her breathing.

2. Superimposed sepsis: The patient had a positive guaiac stool test indicating gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, which led to sepsis and required blood transfusions.

3. Persistent pressor requirement: The patient needed vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure, indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability.

4. Newly-diagnosed esophageal adenocarcinoma: A biopsy of an esophageal mass revealed adenocarcinoma (T1 stage). The patient has chosen do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI) status.

5. Fluid overload and CHF: The patient is experiencing fluid overload likely due to poor nutrition and underlying heart failure. Diuretics are being used to manage this condition.

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and newly-diagnosed esophageal
   adenocarcinoma.
   .
   # Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload likely
   multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition
   to heart failure. Diuresing well.
   - continue lasix gtt, as BP tolerates, with goal -2L at least for the
   day
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - further discuss nutrition options with patient/family
   .
   # Esophageal Adenocarcinoma / GI Bleeding: Patient has had guaiac
   positive stool since admission. Has been transfused a total of 9 units
   so far, last on [**5-1**]. Esophageal mass, biopsied [**2144-5-6**], showing
   adenoCA, T1. After family meeting, pt made DNR/DNI. Family with
   questions about diagnosis and prognosis.
   - f/u GI and heme/onc recs
   - follow Hct
   - maintain active T+S
   - holding anticoagulation for now except prophylactic heparin
   - discussed case with Heme/Onc; they will speak with patient
s family
   about her diagnosis
   - Contact hem/onc and GI and then contact family regarding management
   (ie whether EGD mucosal resection would be beneficial)
   - Palliative care consult
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status continues to improve.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed possible normal pressure
   hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel that this was the case.
   Consulted neurology on [**5-1**].  LP performed. CSF protein minimally
   elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology negative. EEG
   consistent with encephalopathy. No seizure activity. Most likely
   etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged
   intubation.
   - monitor mental status
   - f/u any neuro recs
   - minimize sedating meds
   .
   # Dysarthria: Likely related to prolonged intubation and recent dental
   extractions.
   .
   # Malnutrition: Malnourished with some improvement with Alb from 1.9 to
   2.2 with hypoalbuminemia contributing to 3^rd spacing. Has been
   difficult to feed patient given mental status, has pulled out multiple
   NGT, now MS improving. So far, trial of taking PO did not result in
   sufficient intake. Now, given pt
s diagnosis and DNR/DNI status, PEG
   placement has been put on hold.
   -need further goals of care discussions with family
   -palliative care consult (appreciate input)
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT. Pt did have VT/?VF one week ago and
   was shocked out of it by her ICD.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for total 3 weeks (day 1 =
   [**2144-4-24**])
   - continue telemetry
   - Replete lytes
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, low grade. Unclear etiology, consider
   hypovolemia vs CHF.
   -          Monitor
   -          Consider restarting BB
   .
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dentition. She
   underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**2144-4-27**]. Culture of surgical
   specimen showing VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which is complete. Recommended 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia, which is also complete.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.
   -          continue Synthroid

   liquids); monitor PO intake for adequacy

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and newly-diagnosed esophageal
   adenocarcinoma.
   .
   # Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload likely
   multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition
   to heart failure.  Diuresing well.
   - continue lasix gtt, as BP tolerates, with goal -2L at least for the
   day
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - further discuss nutrition options with patient/family
   .
   # Esophageal Adenocarcinoma / GI Bleeding: Patient has had guaiac
   positive stool since admission. Has been transfused a total of 9 units
   so far, last on [**5-1**]. Esophageal mass, biopsied [**2144-5-6**], showing
   adenoCA, T1. After family meeting, pt made DNR/DNI. Family with
   questions about diagnosis and prognosis.
   - f/u GI and heme/onc recs
   - follow Hct
   - maintain active T+S
   - holding anticoagulation for now except prophylactic heparin
   - discussed case with Heme/Onc; they will speak with patient
s family
   about her diagnosis
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status continues to improve.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed possible normal pressure
   hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel that this was the case.
   Consulted neurology on [**5-1**].  LP performed. CSF protein minimally
   elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology negative. EEG
   consistent with encephalopathy. No seizure activity. Most likely
   etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged
   intubation.
   - monitor mental status
   - f/u any neuro recs
   - minimize sedating meds
   .
   # Dysarthria: Likely related to prolonged intubation and recent dental
   extractions.
   .
   # Malnutrition: Malnourished with some improvement with Alb from 1.9 to
   2.2 with hypoalbuminemia contributing to 3^rd spacing. Has been
   difficult to feed patient given mental status, has pulled out multiple
   NGT, now MS improving. So far, trial of taking PO did not result in
   sufficient intake. Now, given pt
s diagnosis and DNR/DNI status, PEG
   placement has been put on hold.
   - need further goals of care discussions with family
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT. Pt did have VT/?VF one week ago and
   was shocked out of it by her ICD.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for total 3 weeks (day 1 =
   [**2144-4-24**])
   - continue telemetry
   .
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dentition. She
   underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**2144-4-27**]. Culture of surgical
   specimen showing VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which is complete. Recommended 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia, which is also complete.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.
   - continue Synthroid

   Nutrition: dysphagia diet (pureed solids with nectar pre-thickened
   liquids); monitor PO intake for adequacy

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of chronic stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF), who was admitted to the ICU for inotropic-assisted diuresis. During her ICU course, she experienced hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and a newly diagnosed esophageal adenocarcinoma. 

The patient's current condition includes fluid overload/congestive heart failure, esophageal adenocarcinoma/GI bleeding, altered mental status, dysarthria, malnutrition, cardiac rhythm abnormalities, post-dental extraction, MRSA bacteremia, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload/congestive heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic stage IV CHF, which can lead to fluid overload and congestive heart failure. This can result in symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs and ankles.
2. Esophageal adenocarcinoma/GI bleeding: The patient has been diagnosed with esophageal adenocarcinoma, which may cause GI bleeding. This can lead to symptoms like black or bloody stools, abdominal pain, and dizziness.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has shown improvement in mental status but still exhibits altered mental functioning. This can manifest as confusion, disorientation, and difficulty in communication.

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and newly-diagnosed esophageal
   adenocarcinoma.
   .
   # Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload likely
   multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition
   to heart failure. Diuresing well.
   - continue lasix gtt, as BP tolerates, with goal -2L at least for the
   day
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - further discuss nutrition options with patient/family
   .
   # Esophageal Adenocarcinoma / GI Bleeding: Patient has had guaiac
   positive stool since admission. Has been transfused a total of 9 units
   so far, last on [**5-1**]. Esophageal mass, biopsied [**2144-5-6**], showing
   adenoCA, T1. After family meeting, pt made DNR/DNI. Family with
   questions about diagnosis and prognosis.
   - f/u GI and heme/onc recs
   - follow Hct
   - maintain active T+S
   - holding anticoagulation for now except prophylactic heparin
   - discussed case with Heme/Onc; they will speak with patient
s family
   about her diagnosis
   - Contact hem/onc and GI and then contact family regarding management
   (ie whether EGD mucosal resection would be beneficial)
   - Palliative care consult
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status continues to improve.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed possible normal pressure
   hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel that this was the case.
   Consulted neurology on [**5-1**].  LP performed. CSF protein minimally
   elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology negative. EEG
   consistent with encephalopathy. No seizure activity. Most likely
   etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged
   intubation.
   - monitor mental status
   - f/u any neuro recs
   - minimize sedating meds
   .
   # Dysarthria: Likely related to prolonged intubation and recent dental
   extractions.
   .
   # Malnutrition: Malnourished with some improvement with Alb from 1.9 to
   2.2 with hypoalbuminemia contributing to 3^rd spacing. Has been
   difficult to feed patient given mental status, has pulled out multiple
   NGT, now MS improving. So far, trial of taking PO did not result in
   sufficient intake. Now, given pt
s diagnosis and DNR/DNI status, PEG
   placement has been put on hold.
   -need further goals of care discussions with family
   -palliative care consult (appreciate input)
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT. Pt did have VT/?VF one week ago and
   was shocked out of it by her ICD.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for total 3 weeks (day 1 =
   [**2144-4-24**])
   - continue telemetry
   - Replete lytes
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, low grade. Unclear etiology, consider
   hypovolemia vs CHF.
   -          Monitor
   -          Consider restarting BB
   .
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dentition. She
   underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**2144-4-27**]. Culture of surgical
   specimen showing VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which is complete. Recommended 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia, which is also complete.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.
   -          continue Synthroid
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: dysphagia diet (pureed solids with nectar pre-thickened
   liquids); monitor PO intake for adequacy

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 9411**].
   I would add the following remarks:

   Orientation continues to improve.
   Diuresis progressing with furosemide infusion with good urine output
   Medical Decision Making
   Diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma as source of bleed.  It appears
   that her options for resection are limited due to her cardiovascular
   disease.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She has an ICU course complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and a newly diagnosed esophageal adenocarcinoma. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including impaired mental status, dysarthria, malnutrition, rhythm disturbances, tachycardia, poor dentition, MRSA bacteremia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload/congestive heart failure: The patient is at risk for fluid overload due to hypoalbuminemia and poor nutrition, in addition to her existing heart failure. Diuretics are being used to manage this condition.

2. Esophageal adenocarcinoma/GI bleeding: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma, which is causing GI bleeding. Further management options, including potential palliative care, need to be discussed with the patient and family.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is improving but was previously altered. It is important to monitor her mental status and minimize sedating medications.

4. Dysarthria: The patient is experiencing dysarthria likely related to prolonged intubation and recent dental"

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated Stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She has had an ICU course complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and a newly-diagnosed esophageal adenocarcinoma. The patient's mental status has improved, but she still has impaired muscle performance, altered nutrition, impaired balance, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's heart failure is being managed with diuretics, and further discussions regarding nutrition options are needed. The patient has a diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma with GI bleeding, and her family is seeking information about the diagnosis and prognosis. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to toxic/metabolic causes in the setting of illness and prolonged intubation. She also has dysarthria likely related to prolonged intubation and recent dental extractions. Malnutrition is present, and the patient has hypoalbuminemia contributing to fluid retention.

   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and newly-diagnosed esophageal
   adenocarcinoma.
   .
   # Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload likely
   multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition
   to heart failure.  Diuresing well.
   - continue lasix gtt, as BP tolerates, with goal -2L at least for the
   day
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - further discuss nutrition options with patient/family
   .
   # Esophageal Adenocarcinoma / GI Bleeding: Patient has had guaiac
   positive stool since admission. Has been transfused a total of 9 units
   so far, last on [**5-1**]. Esophageal mass, biopsied [**2144-5-6**], showing
   adenoCA, T1. After family meeting, pt made DNR/DNI. Family with
   questions about diagnosis and prognosis.
   - f/u GI and heme/onc recs
   - follow Hct
   - maintain active T+S
   - holding anticoagulation for now except prophylactic heparin
   - discussed case with Heme/Onc; they will speak with patient
s family
   about her diagnosis
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status continues to improve.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed possible normal pressure
   hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel that this was the case.
   Consulted neurology on [**5-1**].  LP performed. CSF protein minimally
   elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology negative. EEG
   consistent with encephalopathy. No seizure activity. Most likely
   etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged
   intubation.
   - monitor mental status
   - f/u any neuro recs
   - minimize sedating meds
   .
   # Dysarthria: Likely related to prolonged intubation and recent dental
   extractions.
   .
   # Malnutrition: Malnourished with some improvement with Alb from 1.9 to
   2.2 with hypoalbuminemia contributing to 3^rd spacing. Has been
   difficult to feed patient given mental status, has pulled out multiple
   NGT, now MS improving. So far, trial of taking PO did not result in
   sufficient intake. Now, given pt
s diagnosis and DNR/DNI status, PEG
   placement has been put on hold.
   - need further goals of care discussions with family
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT. Pt did have VT/?VF one week ago and
   was shocked out of it by her ICD.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for total 3 weeks (day 1 =
   [**2144-4-24**])
   - continue telemetry
   - Replete lytes
   # Tachycardia: Unclear etiology, consider hypovolemia vs CHF.
   - Consider betablockade
   .
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dentition. She
   underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**2144-4-27**]. Culture of surgical
   specimen showing VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which is complete. Recommended 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia, which is also complete.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.
   -          continue Synthroid
   -          Recheck TSH

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF), admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She has had an ICU course complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and newly-diagnosed esophageal adenocarcinoma. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including impaired knowledge, muscle performance, nutrition, balance, aerobic capacity/endurance, transfers, ventilation, altered mental status (not delirium), gastrointestinal bleed (other), sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (hospital-acquired), impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, chronic systolic CHF, fluid overload, esophageal adenocarcinoma/GI bleed, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid Overload/Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's fluid overload is likely multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition to heart failure. Diuresis has been effective so far.
2. Esophageal Adenocarcinoma/GI Bleeding: The patient has been experiencing guaiac positive stool since admission and has received a total of 9 units of transfusion so far. The esophageal mass biopsy showed adenoCA, T1. The patient has made decisions regarding DNR/DNI"

The patient's ICU course includes hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and newly-diagnosed esophageal adenocarcinoma. The patient has also had dental extractions, bacteremia, and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: The patient has hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition, contributing to fluid overload. Diuretics are being used to manage this condition.
2. Esophageal Adenocarcinoma / GI Bleeding: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma. She has been experiencing guaiac positive stool since admission and has received multiple blood transfusions. Further discussions regarding management options are needed.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is improving but initially showed signs of encephalopathy. It is likely due to toxic/metabolic causes in the setting of illness and prolonged intubation.
4. Dysarthria: The patient has dysarthria, likely related to prolonged intubation and recent dental extractions.
5. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished, with hypoalbuminemia contributing to fluid retention. It has been challenging to feed the patient due to her altered"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and newly-diagnosed esophageal
   adenocarcinoma.
   .
   # Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload likely
   multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition
   to heart failure. Diuresing well.
   - continue lasix gtt, as BP tolerates, with goal -2L at least for the
   day
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - further discuss nutrition options with patient/family
   .
   # Esophageal Adenocarcinoma / GI Bleeding: Patient has had guaiac
   positive stool since admission. Has been transfused a total of 9 units
   so far, last on [**5-1**]. Esophageal mass, biopsied [**2144-5-6**], showing
   adenoCA, T1. After family meeting, pt made DNR/DNI. Family with
   questions about diagnosis and prognosis.
   - f/u GI and heme/onc recs
   - follow Hct
   - maintain active T+S
   - holding anticoagulation for now except prophylactic heparin
   - discussed case with Heme/Onc; they will speak with patient
s family
   about her diagnosis
   - Contact hem/onc and GI and then contact family regarding management
   (ie whether EGD mucosal resection would be beneficial)
   - Palliative care consult
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status continues to improve.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed possible normal pressure
   hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel that this was the case.
   Consulted neurology on [**5-1**].  LP performed. CSF protein minimally
   elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology negative. EEG
   consistent with encephalopathy. No seizure activity. Most likely
   etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged
   intubation.
   - monitor mental status
   - f/u any neuro recs
   - minimize sedating meds
   .
   # Dysarthria: Likely related to prolonged intubation and recent dental
   extractions.
   .
   # Malnutrition: Malnourished with some improvement with Alb from 1.9 to
   2.2 with hypoalbuminemia contributing to 3^rd spacing. Has been
   difficult to feed patient given mental status, has pulled out multiple
   NGT, now MS improving. So far, trial of taking PO did not result in
   sufficient intake. Now, given pt
s diagnosis and DNR/DNI status, PEG
   placement has been put on hold.
   -need further goals of care discussions with family
   -palliative care consult (appreciate input)
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT. Pt did have VT/?VF one week ago and
   was shocked out of it by her ICD.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for total 3 weeks (day 1 =
   [**2144-4-24**])
   - continue telemetry
   - Replete lytes
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, low grade. Unclear etiology, consider
   hypovolemia vs CHF.
   -          Monitor
   -          Consider restarting BB
   .
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dentition. She
   underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**2144-4-27**]. Culture of surgical
   specimen showing VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which is complete. Recommended 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia, which is also complete.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.
   -          continue Synthroid

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a complex medical history including decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF), hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and newly-diagnosed esophageal adenocarcinoma.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: The patient has fluid overload likely multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition to heart failure. Diuresis is being administered, but the patient remains dependent on pressors.

2. Esophageal Adenocarcinoma/GI Bleeding: The patient has had guaiac positive stool since admission and has received a total of 9 units of transfusion so far. Esophageal mass biopsy showed adenoCA, T1. The patient has made a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status. There are ongoing discussions regarding the diagnosis and prognosis with the patient's family, as well as further management options such as endoscopic mucosal resection.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status continues to improve, but she is still dysarthric and has difficulty moving all extremities. The likely etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and"

Chief Complaint: Dyspnea

- The patient's PICC line was started on 05/11/2144 at 09:06 PM and confirmed to be central in the superior vena cava.
- A consultation was held with hem/onc and GI regarding the feasibility of esophageal mucosal resection, but it was determined that this procedure would not likely improve the patient's outcome due to cardiovascular disease being the limiting factor.
- GI suggested seeking the opinion of ERCP for the possibility of doing a procedure.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.

24-hour events include discussions with hem/onc and GI regarding potential procedures and the decision not to proceed with esophageal mucosal resection.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and newly-diagnosed esophageal
   adenocarcinoma.
   .
   # Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload likely
   multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition
   to heart failure. Diuresing well.
   - continue lasix gtt, as BP tolerates, with goal -1-1.5 L at least for
   the day
   - pt will be transferred to a LTAC that will allow lasix gtt so no need
   to change to bolus
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   .
# Esophageal Adenocarcinoma / GI Bleeding: Patient has had guaiac positive stool
 since admission. Has been transfused a total of 9 units so far, last on [**5-1**]. E
sophageal mass, biopsied [**2144-5-6**], showing adenoCA, T1. After family meeting, pt
made DNR/DNI. Hem/onc consulted for options to treat and stated that given 50% s
urvival benefit with treatment at five years and patient
s poor prognosis from c
ardiac standpoint, any procedure would pose higher risk than benefit.  ERCP was
consulted for possibility of endoscopic ablation, but her adenocarcinoma is too
extensive for endoscopic resection which could pose a 10% risk of complications
that would require surgical repair, which is not an option in her.
   - talk with family about lack of chemotherapeutic and endoscopic
   options for adenocarcinoma and possible need for PEG tube in the future
   for palliation
   - follow Hct,  maintain active T+S
   - holding anticoagulation for now except prophylactic heparin
   - discussed case with Heme/Onc; they will speak with patient
s family
   about her diagnosis
   - f/u Palliative care recs
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status continues to improve.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed possible normal pressure
   hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel that this was the case.
   Consulted neurology on [**5-1**].  LP performed. CSF protein minimally
   elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology negative. EEG
   consistent with encephalopathy. No seizure activity. Most likely
   etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged
   intubation.
   - monitor mental status
   - f/u any neuro recs
   - minimize sedating meds
   .
   # Dysarthria: Likely related to prolonged intubation and recent dental
   extractions.
   .
   # Malnutrition: Malnourished with some improvement with Alb from 1.9 to
   2.2 with hypoalbuminemia contributing to 3^rd spacing. Has been
   difficult to feed patient given mental status, has pulled out multiple
   NGT, now MS improving. So far, trial of taking PO did not result in
   sufficient intake. This will likely continue to worsen over time with
   known esophageal adenocarcinoma.
   -need further goals of care discussions with family including PEG tube
   placement at some point
   -f/u palliative care  (appreciate input)
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT. Pt did have VT/?VF one week ago and
   was shocked out of it by her ICD.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for total 3 weeks (2 more
   days)
   - continue telemetry
   - Replete lytes
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, low grade. Unclear etiology, consider
   hypovolemia vs CHF.
   -          Monitor
   -          Consider restarting BB
   .
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dentition. She
   underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**2144-4-27**]. Culture of surgical
   specimen showing VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which is complete. Recommended 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia, which is also complete.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - restart metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - consider restarting  ACEi (holding for now)
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.
   -          continue Synthroid

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She has had an ICU course complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and a newly diagnosed esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload/congestive heart failure: The patient is likely experiencing fluid overload due to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition to her heart failure. This can lead to worsening respiratory distress and further complications.

2. Esophageal adenocarcinoma/GI bleeding: The patient has guaiac positive stool since admission and has received a total of 9 units of transfusion so far. The biopsy of the esophageal mass showed adenocarcinoma, T1. Given the patient's poor prognosis from a cardiac standpoint, any procedure poses a higher risk than benefit. ERCP was consulted for the possibility of endoscopic ablation, but her adenocarcinoma is too extensive for endoscopic resection.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status continues to improve, but she may still be experiencing altered mental status due to prolonged intubation, recent dental extractions, and underlying conditions.

4. Dysarthria: The patient likely has dysarthria related to prolonged intubation and recent dental extractions.

5. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished with hypoalbuminemia contributing to fluid retention. It is difficult to feed the patient given her mental status, and she has pulled out multiple NGTs. Further goals of care discussions with the family, including PEG tube placement, are needed.

6. Rhythm disturbances: The patient has occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm without p-waves (junctional), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and sinus tachycardia. The etiology is unclear, but hypovolemia versus CHF may be contributing factors.

7. Tachycardia: The patient has low-grade sinus tachycardia, which could be due to hypovolemia or CHF. Monitoring and possibly restarting beta-blockers may be necessary.

8. Dental extraction complications: The patient underwent extraction of 24 teeth and culture of the surgical specimen showed VRE and [Female First Name (un)]. Routine post-operative mouth care is recommended.

9. MRSA bacteremia/Proteus in sputum: The patient was treated with vancomycin and cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended a 15-day course of cefepime/flagyl, which is complete. A 21-day course of vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia is also complete.

10. Coronaries: The patient has a chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the proximal left anterior descending"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of dyspnea. The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease and is currently on infusions of furosemide (Lasix) and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for gastrointestinal bleeding noted below.

24-hour events include the placement of a new PICC line, which was confirmed to be central in the superior vena cava (SVC). There was also a discussion regarding the feasibility of an esophageal mucosal resection, but it was determined that it would not likely improve the patient's outcome due to her cardiovascular disease. It was suggested that ERCP would be the team to perform the procedure and a consultation was placed for feasibility.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
- Heart rate: 99 bpm (86-105 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 92/62 mmHg (69-124/36-88 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute (15-25 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 96%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,129 mL and output of 2,220 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,091 mL. The patient is receiving 600 mL of oral intake"

   ECG:
   EEG
   ROUTINE SAMPLING: Showed a diffusely slow and disorganized background
   consisting mostly of mixed theta frequencies. Occasionally, the patient
   reached a low alpha frequency of around 8 Hz but was poorly sustained.
   There were no areas of prominent focal slowing and there were no
   epileptiform features noted.
   SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were no entries in these files.
   SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were seven entries in these files.
   These contained chewing artifact and movement artifact but no
   epileptiform features were noted.
   PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no entries in these files.
   SLEEP: The patient was frequently in and out of stage I and stage II
   sleep and no additional findings were noted.
   CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with occasional wide
   complex ectopic beats.
   IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. Routine
   sampling showed a diffusely slow and disorganized background consisting
   mostly of mixed theta frequencies. Although the patient did
   occasionally reach a frequency of 8 Hz, this was rather poorly
   sustained. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing and there
   were no epileptiform features noted. Overall, this background is
   suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy. Amongst the most
   common causes of encephalopathy are medications, metabolic
   derangements,
   anoxia, and infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and newly-diagnosed esophageal
   adenocarcinoma.
   .
   # Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload likely
   multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition
   to heart failure. Diuresing well.
   - continue lasix gtt, as BP tolerates, with goal -1-1.5 L at least for
   the day
   - pt will be transferred to a LTAC that will allow lasix gtt so no need
   to change to bolus
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   .
# Esophageal Adenocarcinoma / GI Bleeding: Patient has had guaiac positive stool
 since admission. Has been transfused a total of 9 units so far, last on [**5-1**]. E
sophageal mass, biopsied [**2144-5-6**], showing adenoCA, T1. After family meeting, pt
made DNR/DNI. Hem/onc consulted for options to treat and stated that given 50% s
urvival benefit with treatment at five years and patient
s poor prognosis from c
ardiac standpoint, any procedure would pose higher risk than benefit.  ERCP was
consulted for possibility of endoscopic ablation, but her adenocarcinoma is too
extensive for endoscopic resection which could pose a 10% risk of complications
that would require surgical repair, which is not an option in her.
   - talk with family about lack of chemotherapeutic and endoscopic
   options for adenocarcinoma and possible need for PEG tube in the future
   for palliation
   - follow Hct,  maintain active T+S
   - holding anticoagulation for now except prophylactic heparin
   - discussed case with Heme/Onc; they will speak with patient
s family
   about her diagnosis
   - f/u Palliative care recs
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status continues to improve.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed possible normal pressure
   hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel that this was the case.
   Consulted neurology on [**5-1**].  LP performed. CSF protein minimally
   elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology negative. EEG
   consistent with encephalopathy. No seizure activity. Most likely
   etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged
   intubation.
   - monitor mental status
   - f/u any neuro recs
   - minimize sedating meds
   .
   # Dysarthria: Likely related to prolonged intubation and recent dental
   extractions.
   .
   # Malnutrition: Malnourished with some improvement with Alb from 1.9 to
   2.2 with hypoalbuminemia contributing to 3^rd spacing. Has been
   difficult to feed patient given mental status, has pulled out multiple
   NGT, now MS improving. So far, trial of taking PO did not result in
   sufficient intake. This will likely continue to worsen over time with
   known esophageal adenocarcinoma.
   -continue ensure
   - need further goals of care discussions with family including PEG tube
   placement at some point
   -f/u palliative care  (appreciate input)
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT. Pt did have VT/?VF one week ago and
   was shocked out of it by her ICD.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 7**] for 2 weeks (starting [**2144-5-13**]), then
   200 mg Q day
   - continue telemetry
   - Replete lytes
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, low grade. Unclear etiology, consider
   hypovolemia vs CHF.
   -          Monitor
   -          Restarted  BB
   .
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dentition. She
   underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**2144-4-27**]. Culture of surgical
   specimen showing VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which is complete. Recommended 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia, which is also complete.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - restart metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - consider restarting  ACEi (holding for now)
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.
   -          continue Synthroid

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure who presented with dyspnea and weight gain. He has been admitted to the ICU for inotropic-assisted diuresis. His ICU course has been complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and a newly diagnosed esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Potential medical complications:
1. Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: The patient is likely experiencing fluid overload due to hypoalbuminemia and poor nutrition in addition to his heart failure. Diuretics are being used to manage this condition.
2. Esophageal Adenocarcinoma/GI Bleeding: The patient has been experiencing guaiac-positive stools since admission, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. He has received multiple blood transfusions. A biopsy of the esophageal mass confirmed adenocarcinoma, and endoscopic ablation is not possible due to the extent of the disease. Chemotherapy and endoscopic options are also not viable, making palliative care recommendations necessary.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status continues to improve. A non-contrast CT head showed possible normal pressure hydrocephalus, but neurology does not believe this is the case.

   ECG:
   EEG
   ROUTINE SAMPLING: Showed a diffusely slow and disorganized background
   consisting mostly of mixed theta frequencies. Occasionally, the patient
   reached a low alpha frequency of around 8 Hz but was poorly sustained.
   There were no areas of prominent focal slowing and there were no
   epileptiform features noted.
   SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were no entries in these files.
   SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were seven entries in these files.
   These contained chewing artifact and movement artifact but no
   epileptiform features were noted.
   PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no entries in these files.
   SLEEP: The patient was frequently in and out of stage I and stage II
   sleep and no additional findings were noted.
   CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with occasional wide
   complex ectopic beats.
   IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. Routine
   sampling showed a diffusely slow and disorganized background consisting
   mostly of mixed theta frequencies. Although the patient did
   occasionally reach a frequency of 8 Hz, this was rather poorly
   sustained. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing and there
   were no epileptiform features noted. Overall, this background is
   suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy. Amongst the most
   common causes of encephalopathy are medications, metabolic
   derangements,
   anoxia, and infection.
   INTERPRETED BY: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 1358**] L.
   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and newly-diagnosed esophageal
   adenocarcinoma.
   .
   # Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload likely
   multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition
   to heart failure. Diuresing well.
   - continue lasix gtt, as BP tolerates, with goal -1-1.5 L at least for
   the day
   - pt will be transferred to a LTAC that will allow lasix gtt so no need
   to change to bolus
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   .
# Esophageal Adenocarcinoma / GI Bleeding: Patient has had guaiac positive stool
 since admission. Has been transfused a total of 9 units so far, last on [**5-1**]. E
sophageal mass, biopsied [**2144-5-6**], showing adenoCA, T1. After family meeting, pt
made DNR/DNI. Hem/onc consulted for options to treat and stated that given 50% s
urvival benefit with treatment at five years and patient
s poor prognosis from c
ardiac standpoint, any procedure would pose higher risk than benefit.  ERCP was
consulted for possibility of endoscopic ablation, but her adenocarcinoma is too
extensive for endoscopic resection which could pose a 10% risk of complications
that would require surgical repair, which is not an option in her.
   - talk with family about lack of chemotherapeutic and endoscopic
   options for adenocarcinoma and possible need for PEG tube in the future
   for palliation
   - follow Hct,  maintain active T+S
   - holding anticoagulation for now except prophylactic heparin
   - discussed case with Heme/Onc; they will speak with patient
s family
   about her diagnosis
   - f/u Palliative care recs
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status continues to improve.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed possible normal pressure
   hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel that this was the case.
   Consulted neurology on [**5-1**].  LP performed. CSF protein minimally
   elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology negative. EEG
   consistent with encephalopathy. No seizure activity. Most likely
   etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged
   intubation.
   - monitor mental status
   - f/u any neuro recs
   - minimize sedating meds
   .
   # Dysarthria: Likely related to prolonged intubation and recent dental
   extractions.
   .
   # Malnutrition: Malnourished with some improvement with Alb from 1.9 to
   2.2 with hypoalbuminemia contributing to 3^rd spacing. Has been
   difficult to feed patient given mental status, has pulled out multiple
   NGT, now MS improving. So far, trial of taking PO did not result in
   sufficient intake. This will likely continue to worsen over time with
   known esophageal adenocarcinoma.
   -continue ensure
   - need further goals of care discussions with family including PEG tube
   placement at some point
   -f/u palliative care  (appreciate input)
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT. Pt did have VT/?VF one week ago and
   was shocked out of it by her ICD.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 7**] for 2 weeks (starting [**2144-5-13**]), then
   200 mg Q day
   - continue telemetry
   - Replete lytes
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, low grade. Unclear etiology, consider
   hypovolemia vs CHF.
   -          Monitor
   -          Restarted  BB
   .
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dentition. She
   underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**2144-4-27**]. Culture of surgical
   specimen showing VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which is complete. Recommended 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia, which is also complete.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - restart metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - consider restarting  ACEi (holding for now)
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.
   -          continue Synthroid
   -          .
   # Anemia: consider Q week Hct at LTAC

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with dyspnea and non-productive cough. The patient had a weight gain of 15lbs prior to admission. Outpatient physicians attempted to increase diuretics but were unable to mitigate the weight gain successfully. The patient was transferred to the hospital for inotropic-assisted diuresis. On admission, the patient had hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, superimposed sepsis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, and a newly-diagnosed esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: The patient has fluid overload likely multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition to heart failure. Diuretics are being used to manage this condition.
2. Esophageal Adenocarcinoma/GI Bleeding: The patient has had guaiac positive stool since admission and has received a total of 9 units of transfusion. A biopsy of the esophageal mass showed adenoCA, T1. The patient has made a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) decision. Hematology/Oncology consulted for treatment options but stated that given the patient's poor prognosis from a cardiac standpoint, any procedure would pose higher risk than benefit. Endoscopic"

   HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  63 y/o M w/ h/o CHF now transferred for
   decompensated heart failure and inotropic assisted diuresis.  By report
   from OSH patient had 15lb weight gain prior to admission with increased
   dyspnea and non-productive cough.  Outpatient physicians attempted to
   increase her diuretics but were unable to do successfully mitigate her
   weight gain.  As such she presented to OSH on [**2144-4-7**].
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2065-5-11**]
   - ERCP stated endoscopic resection not possible due to extent of
   disease, further more there is a 10% risk of major complications that
   would necessitate surgery (which she is not a candidate for)

   ECG:
   EEG
   ROUTINE SAMPLING: Showed a diffusely slow and disorganized background
   consisting mostly of mixed theta frequencies. Occasionally, the patient
   reached a low alpha frequency of around 8 Hz but was poorly sustained.
   There were no areas of prominent focal slowing and there were no
   epileptiform features noted.
   SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were no entries in these files.
   SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were seven entries in these files.
   These contained chewing artifact and movement artifact but no
   epileptiform features were noted.
   PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no entries in these files.
   SLEEP: The patient was frequently in and out of stage I and stage II
   sleep and no additional findings were noted.
   CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with occasional wide
   complex ectopic beats.
   IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. Routine
   sampling showed a diffusely slow and disorganized background consisting
   mostly of mixed theta frequencies. Although the patient did
   occasionally reach a frequency of 8 Hz, this was rather poorly
   sustained. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing and there
   were no epileptiform features noted. Overall, this background is
   suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy. Amongst the most
   common causes of encephalopathy are medications, metabolic
   derangements,
   anoxia, and infection.
   INTERPRETED BY: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 1358**] L.
   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and newly-diagnosed esophageal
   adenocarcinoma.
   .
   # Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload likely
   multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition
   to heart failure. Diuresing well.
   - continue lasix gtt, as BP tolerates, with goal -1-1.5 L at least for
   the day
   - pt will be transferred to a LTAC that will allow lasix gtt so no need
   to change to bolus
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   .
# Esophageal Adenocarcinoma / GI Bleeding: Patient has had guaiac positive stool
 since admission. Has been transfused a total of 9 units so far, last on [**5-1**]. E
sophageal mass, biopsied [**2144-5-6**], showing adenoCA, T1. After family meeting, pt
made DNR/DNI. Hem/onc consulted for options to treat and stated that given 50% s
urvival benefit with treatment at five years and patient
s poor prognosis from c
ardiac standpoint, any procedure would pose higher risk than benefit.  ERCP was
consulted for possibility of endoscopic ablation, but her adenocarcinoma is too
extensive for endoscopic resection which could pose a 10% risk of complications
that would require surgical repair, which is not an option in her.
   - talk with family about lack of chemotherapeutic and endoscopic
   options for adenocarcinoma and possible need for PEG tube in the future
   for palliation
   - follow Hct,  maintain active T+S
   - holding anticoagulation for now except prophylactic heparin
   - discussed case with Heme/Onc; they will speak with patient
s family
   about her diagnosis
   - f/u Palliative care recs
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status continues to improve.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed possible normal pressure
   hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel that this was the case.
   Consulted neurology on [**5-1**].  LP performed. CSF protein minimally
   elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology negative. EEG
   consistent with encephalopathy. No seizure activity. Most likely
   etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged
   intubation.
   - monitor mental status
   - f/u any neuro recs
   - minimize sedating meds
   .
   # Dysarthria: Likely related to prolonged intubation and recent dental
   extractions.
   .
   # Malnutrition: Malnourished with some improvement with Alb from 1.9 to
   2.2 with hypoalbuminemia contributing to 3^rd spacing. Has been
   difficult to feed patient given mental status, has pulled out multiple
   NGT, now MS improving. So far, trial of taking PO did not result in
   sufficient intake. This will likely continue to worsen over time with
   known esophageal adenocarcinoma.
   -need further goals of care discussions with family including PEG tube
   placement at some point
   -f/u palliative care  (appreciate input)
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT. Pt did have VT/?VF one week ago and
   was shocked out of it by her ICD.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for total 3 weeks (2 more
   days)
   - continue telemetry
   - Replete lytes
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, low grade. Unclear etiology, consider
   hypovolemia vs CHF.
   -          Monitor
   -          Consider restarting BB
   .
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dentition. She
   underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**2144-4-27**]. Culture of surgical
   specimen showing VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which is complete. Recommended 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia, which is also complete.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - restart metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - consider restarting  ACEi (holding for now)
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.
   -          continue Synthroid

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure who was admitted to the ICU for decompensated heart failure and inotropic-assisted diuresis. She presented with dyspnea, a 15-pound weight gain, and non-productive cough. Outpatient physicians attempted to increase her diuretics but were unable to control her weight gain. The patient is now being transferred to a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility.

During her ICU stay, the patient developed several medical complications. She required intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure, had a superimposed sepsis, underwent transfusion for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, required persistent pressor support, and was diagnosed with esophageal adenocarcinoma. The patient has also had a possible normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), altered mental status (AMS) likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, dysarthria related to prolonged intubation and dental extractions, malnutrition, rhythm disturbances including sinus tachycardia and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and a history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) treated with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

The patient's current medications include amiodarone for rhythm control, diuretics for fluid overload, and Synthroid for hypothyroidism. She has been treated with vancomycin and cefepime"

   HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  63 y/o M w/ h/o CHF now transferred for
   decompensated heart failure and inotropic assisted diuresis.  By report
   from OSH patient had 15lb weight gain prior to admission with increased
   dyspnea and non-productive cough.  Outpatient physicians attempted to
   increase her diuretics but were unable to do successfully mitigate her
   weight gain.  As such she presented to OSH on [**2144-4-7**].

   [**2065-5-11**]
   - ERCP stated endoscopic resection not possible due to extent of
   disease, further more there is a 10% risk of major complications that
   would necessitate surgery (which she is not a candidate for)

   occasionally reach a frequency of 8 Hz, this was rather poorly
   sustained. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing and there
   were no epileptiform features noted. Overall, this background is
   suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy. Amongst the most
   common causes of encephalopathy are medications, metabolic
   derangements,
   anoxia, and infection.

   ECG:
   EEG
   ROUTINE SAMPLING: Showed a diffusely slow and disorganized background
   consisting mostly of mixed theta frequencies. Occasionally, the patient
   reached a low alpha frequency of around 8 Hz but was poorly sustained.
   There were no areas of prominent focal slowing and there were no
   epileptiform features noted.
   SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were no entries in these files.
   SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were seven entries in these files.
   These contained chewing artifact and movement artifact but no
   epileptiform features were noted.
   PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no entries in these files.
   SLEEP: The patient was frequently in and out of stage I and stage II
   sleep and no additional findings were noted.
   CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with occasional wide
   complex ectopic beats.
   IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. Routine
   sampling showed a diffusely slow and disorganized background consisting
   mostly of mixed theta frequencies. Although the patient did
   occasionally reach a frequency of 8 Hz, this was rather poorly
   sustained. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing and there
   were no epileptiform features noted. Overall, this background is
   suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy. Amongst the most
   common causes of encephalopathy are medications, metabolic
   derangements,
   anoxia, and infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement, and newly-diagnosed esophageal
   adenocarcinoma.
   .
   # Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload likely
   multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia/poor nutrition in addition
   to heart failure. Diuresing well.
   - continue lasix gtt, as BP tolerates, with goal -1-1.5 L at least for
   the day
   - pt will be transferred to a LTAC that will allow lasix gtt so no need
   to change to bolus
   - follow [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   .
# Esophageal Adenocarcinoma / GI Bleeding: Patient has had guaiac positive stool
 since admission. Has been transfused a total of 9 units so far, last on [**5-1**]. E
sophageal mass, biopsied [**2144-5-6**], showing adenoCA, T1. After family meeting, pt
made DNR/DNI. Hem/onc consulted for options to treat and stated that given 50% s
urvival benefit with treatment at five years and patient
s poor prognosis from c
ardiac standpoint, any procedure would pose higher risk than benefit.  ERCP was
consulted for possibility of endoscopic ablation, but her adenocarcinoma is too
extensive for endoscopic resection which could pose a 10% risk of complications
that would require surgical repair, which is not an option in her.
   - talk with family about lack of chemotherapeutic and endoscopic
   options for adenocarcinoma and possible need for PEG tube in the future
   for palliation
   - follow Hct,  maintain active T+S
   - holding anticoagulation for now except prophylactic heparin
   - discussed case with Heme/Onc; they will speak with patient
s family
   about her diagnosis
   - f/u Palliative care recs
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status continues to improve.
   Non-contrast CT head [**2144-4-14**] showed possible normal pressure
   hydrocephalus, although neurology did not feel that this was the case.
   Consulted neurology on [**5-1**].  LP performed. CSF protein minimally
   elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Culture and cytology negative. EEG
   consistent with encephalopathy. No seizure activity. Most likely
   etiology is toxic/metabolic in the setting of illness and prolonged
   intubation.
   - monitor mental status
   - f/u any neuro recs
   - minimize sedating meds
   .
   # Dysarthria: Likely related to prolonged intubation and recent dental
   extractions.
   .
   # Malnutrition: Malnourished with some improvement with Alb from 1.9 to
   2.2 with hypoalbuminemia contributing to 3^rd spacing. Has been
   difficult to feed patient given mental status, has pulled out multiple
   NGT, now MS improving. So far, trial of taking PO did not result in
   sufficient intake. This will likely continue to worsen over time with
   known esophageal adenocarcinoma.
   -continue ensure
   - need further goals of care discussions with family including PEG tube
   placement at some point
   -f/u palliative care  (appreciate input)
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT. Pt did have VT/?VF one week ago and
   was shocked out of it by her ICD.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 7**] for 2 weeks (starting [**2144-5-13**]), then
   200 mg Q day
   - continue telemetry
   - Replete lytes
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach, low grade. Unclear etiology, consider
   hypovolemia vs CHF.
   -          Monitor
   -          Restarted  BB
   .
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dentition. She
   underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**2144-4-27**]. Culture of surgical
   specimen showing VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which is complete. Recommended 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia, which is also complete.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - restart metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - consider restarting  ACEi (holding for now)
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.
   -          continue Synthroid
   -          .
   # Anemia: consider Q week Hct at LTAC

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note  [**2144-5-13**] 3PM
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7271**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Symptomatically, dyspnea improved and feeling stronger.
   Medical Decision Making
   To rehabilitation center tomorrow for recovery.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 1914**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7145**], MD
   on:[**2144-5-15**] 16:12 ------
","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis. She presented with dyspnea, non-productive cough, and a 15-pound weight gain. Outpatient physicians attempted to increase her diuretics but were unsuccessful in mitigating her weight gain. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient's medical history includes decompensated stage IV CHF, esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastrointestinal bleeding requiring transfusion, persistent pressor requirement, hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, and superimposed sepsis. She also has altered mental status, dysarthria, malnutrition, rhythm disturbances, tachycardia, and poor dentition with a dental extraction.

The patient has been treated with various medications including diuretics, inotropes, antibiotics, and antiarrhythmics. She has received blood transfusions and has undergone an endoscopic evaluation of her esophageal mass, which showed adenocarcinoma. The patient has also had cultures obtained from her tissue and cerebrospinal fluid, which were negative for infection.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 94/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on room air, and a sinus tachycardia rhythm. Her fluid balance shows a negative balance of 959 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in her white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and nutritional status. Imaging studies have revealed a possible normal pressure hydrocephalus on a non-contrast CT scan of the head.

The patient's medical complications include fluid overload/congestive heart failure, esophageal adenocarcinoma/GI bleeding, altered mental status, dysarthria, malnutrition, rhythm disturbances, tachycardia, and poor dentition. The patient has completed courses of antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia and a combination of cefepime and flagyl for MRSA/Proteus in the sputum.

The patient's care plan includes continuing diuretics for fluid overload, providing nutritional support, minimizing sedating medications, considering a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement for palliation, and discussing end-of-life care options with the family.

The patient's prognosis is poor due to her multiple comorbidities and the advanced stage of her esophageal adenocarcinoma. Further discussion regarding code status, rehabilitation, and disposition will be conducted with the family."
