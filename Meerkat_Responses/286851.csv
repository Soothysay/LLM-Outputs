","The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient required invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. A urine culture was obtained and the results are pending.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was administered at [**2132-3-4**] 03:15 AM. Lorazepam (Ativan) was given at [**2132-3-4**] 02:28 AM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of pneumonia. The vital signs are as follows: temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate is 90 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure is 131/57 mmHg, respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 93%. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a peak inspiratory pressure of 12 cmH2O, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.31, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 78 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 90 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 37 mEq/L, base excess of -8, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's ventilation rate is 7.2 L/min, and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 225.

The patient's peripheral vascular examination is not assessed, skin examination is not assessed, and neurologic examination is also not assessed. The patient is unresponsive and does not move or have normal muscle tone.

The lab results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 26.8 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 216 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.0 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 236 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 139 mEq/L, potassium (K+) level of 4.1 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) level of 106 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) level of 8.6 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) level of 1.9 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) level of 3.0 mg/dL. The PT/PTT/INR levels are elevated, and the differential shows an increased percentage of neutrophils.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 y/o woman w/Diabetes, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
   coronary artery disease, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Assuming baseline ventilatory
   fialure likely resulting from dynamic hyperinflation with increased
   zone I lung due to bipap non-compliance, differential to be considered
   on this admission is non-compliance with Bipap. Other causes such as
   acute increase in dead-space (pulmomary embolism, more common
   w/oxygenation problems), [**Name2 (NI) 7821**] from medication effects, and
   increased CO2 production from underlying infection are also possible.
   She was having trouble with oxygenation as well, and appears to run in
   the high 80s/low 90s at home. She was in the low 80s on arrival to the
   ED. Her CXR is with evidence of increased vascular congestion,
   especailly on the right.
   - BiPap
   - would give lasix 40mg IV BID fro 1-2 days and follow lytes, renal
   function.
   - conplete course of levofloxacin for community acquired pneumonia
   # Altered Mental Status: appears that respiratory insult was primary
   event, but can not rule out other disorder as primary cause. Infection
   such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection, toxic ingestion,
   medication over/under use.
   -hold sedating medications
   -U/A, Urine Cx, Blood culture
   -complete pneumonia Rx as above.
   # Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: will treat with
   last IV at increased her home dose pending improvement in clinical
   status.
   - lasix 40IV [**Hospital1 **].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease. She was admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The note outlines several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This condition is assumed to be a baseline ventilatory failure resulting from dynamic hyperinflation with increased zone I lung due to non-compliance with BiPAP. Other causes such as acute increase in dead-space (pulmonary embolism), medication effects, or increased CO2 production from underlying infection are also possible.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient appears to have an altered mental status, which could be due to a respiratory insult. However, other disorders like infection, toxic ingestion, or medication over/underuse should also be considered. Holding sedating medications, conducting urine analysis and culture, blood culture, and treating any underlying infections are recommended.

3. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's increased vascular congestion on the chest X-ray suggests acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure. Treatment includes increasing her home dose of Lasix IV and monitoring for improvement in clinical status.

4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease. She is to continue with ASA, statin, and short-acting metoprolol. DM, HTN, hypothy"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 y/o woman w/Diabetes, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
   coronary artery disease, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypercarbia: Patient
s hypercarbia is currently at her baseline and
   her PCO2 of 62 is consistent with her previous best values obtained
   here.  Unfortunately, she is intermittently quite sedated after
   receiving multiple psychiatric meds last night.
   -Low index to repeat ABG
s if mental status changes
   -BiPAP PRN for hypercarbia
   #Hypoxemia: The patient desaturated to the 80
s multiple times
   yesterday and this did not appear to consistently improve with NPPV (in
   fact seemed to worsen).   Unclear what the etiology of this could be
   though concern for pulmonary hypertension vs shunt.
   -Obtain echocardiogram with bubble study to look for shunt
   -Continue to treat potential pneumonia w/ five day course of
   levofloxacin (completed today)
   #Metabolic alkalosis: The patient appears to have a chronic metabolic
   alkalosis as compensation for her metabolic acidosis.  This is worsened
   today.  Primary concern is for a contraction alkalosis potentially
   worsened by volume contraction and relative [**Name (NI) 7867**] state
   due to steroids.
   -Check urine Cl
   -If urine Cl low we will presume this is primarily contraction
   alkalosis and use acetazolamide to bridge until volume status improved
   in order to augment respiratory drive and not push further
   hypoventilation.
   #Delirium/AMS: Probably multifactorial with schizophrenia on multiple
   medications, hypoxemia, steroids, and ICU status.   Given the patient
   repeated attempts to climb out of bed yesterday was sedated due to
   concerns for safety and agitation augmenting respiratory distress.   So
   far no localizing sources of infection except possibly lung (urine
   clear, no indication of other source)
   -Minimize further sedation, wean steroids to 10 mg prednisone PO daily
   -Attempt to redirect and use restraints PRN
   -Fix discrepancies between home and in house med regimens (aripiprazole
   to QHS, increase sertraline, etc
   -Hold off [**Female First Name (un) 1290**]/psych evaluation until respiratory issues improved
   # Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: Patient is
   nearly 4L negative over hospitalization and quick diuresis probably
   contributing to acid-base disturbance.  Now back on home diuretic
   dose.
   -aim for net equal fluid balance
   # Coronary Artery Disease:   cont ASA, statin, metoprolol short acting
   #Schizophrenia: Continue home med regimen
   DM: Hold oral hypoglycemics. QID FS and ISS.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and schizophrenia. She was admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Hypercarbia: The patient's elevated levels of carbon dioxide (PCO2) are consistent with her baseline values. However, she is intermittently sedated after receiving multiple psychiatric medications last night.
   -Recommend repeating ABG if mental status changes.
   -Continue BiPAP as needed for hypercarbia.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient desaturated to the 80s multiple times yesterday and did not consistently improve with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). There is concern for pulmonary hypertension or shunt.
   -Obtain echocardiogram with bubble study to look for shunt.
   -Continue treating potential pneumonia with a five-day course of levofloxacin (completed today).

3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient appears to have a chronic metabolic alkalosis as compensation for her metabolic acidosis. This condition is worsened today.
   -Check urine Cl.
   -If urine Cl is low, presume this is primarily contraction alkalosis and use acetazolamide to bridge until volume status improves.

4. Delirium/AMS: The patient likely has multifactorial delirium/acute mental status changes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with chronic and acute respiratory failure, diagnosed with COPD and schizophrenia. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation support due to recurrent and significant hypoxemia, which has not fully resolved with BIPAP alone. The patient also has pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), and chronic respiratory failure. She is being evaluated for possible pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and extrapulmonary shunt as sources of persistent hypoxemia. The patient is in a state of metabolic alkalosis, and efforts are being made to stabilize HCO3- levels and minimize sedating medications. Decreasing steroid dosing is also planned. An echo has been ordered to assess for right heart failure and concerns about PAH are significant. The patient's schizophrenia medications, including Zoloft, will be continued. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. She has multiple IV lines in place for medication administration and prophylaxis. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate), and her disposition is in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   73 y/o woman w/Diabetes, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
   coronary artery disease, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypercarbia: Patient
s hypercarbia is currently at her baseline and
   her PCO2 of 62 is consistent with her previous best values obtained
   here.  Unfortunately, she is intermittently quite sedated after
   receiving multiple psychiatric meds last night.
   -Low index to repeat ABG
s if mental status changes
   -BiPAP PRN for hypercarbia
   #Hypoxemia: The patient desaturated to the 80
s multiple times
   yesterday and this did not appear to consistently improve with NPPV (in
   fact seemed to worsen).   Unclear what the etiology of this could be
   though concern for pulmonary hypertension vs shunt.
   -Obtain echocardiogram with bubble study to look for shunt
   -Continue to treat potential pneumonia w/ five day course of
   levofloxacin (completed today)
   #Metabolic alkalosis: The patient appears to have a chronic metabolic
   alkalosis as compensation for her metabolic acidosis.  This is worsened
   today.  Primary concern is for a contraction alkalosis potentially
   worsened by volume contraction and relative [**Name (NI) 7867**] state
   due to steroids.
   -Check urine Cl
   -If urine Cl low we will presume this is primarily contraction
   alkalosis and use acetazolamide to bridge until volume status improved
   in order to augment respiratory drive and not push further
   hypoventilation.
   #Delirium/AMS: Probably multifactorial with schizophrenia on multiple
   medications, hypoxemia, steroids, and ICU status.   Given the patient
   repeated attempts to climb out of bed yesterday was sedated due to
   concerns for safety and agitation augmenting respiratory distress.   So
   far no localizing sources of infection except possibly lung (urine
   clear, no indication of other source)
   -Minimize further sedation, wean steroids to 10 mg prednisone PO daily
   -Attempt to redirect and use restraints PRN
   -Fix discrepancies between home and in house med regimens (aripiprazole
   to QHS, increase sertraline, etc
   -Hold off [**Female First Name (un) 1290**]/psych evaluation until respiratory issues improved
   # Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: Patient is
   nearly 4L negative over hospitalization and quick diuresis probably
   contributing to acid-base disturbance.  Now back on home diuretic
   dose.
   -aim for net equal fluid balance
   # Coronary Artery Disease:   cont ASA, statin, metoprolol short acting
   #Schizophrenia: Continue home med regimen
   DM: Hold oral hypoglycemics. QID FS and ISS.

   ventricular function is mildly hypokinetic, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well

   artery systolic hypertension.
   A bubble study was performed but the suboptimal technical quality means
   that the presence or absence of a PFO/ASD could not be determined.
   Assessment and Plan
   73 y/o woman w/Diabetes, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
   coronary artery disease, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypercarbia:  From previous admissions and ABG
s it appears likely
   that the patient is a chronic retainer of CO2 as the lowest CO2
s we
   have recorded on her are in the low 60
s.  Still she has had worsening
   hypercarbia in house that improved with BiPAP.  More recent CO2
s have
   been slightly higher but given metabolic alkalosis her respiratory
   drive is somewhat depressed.  Her mental status is improved with less
   sedation/agitation overnight and more meaningful attempts at
   communication (despite language barrier) today.
   -Acetazolamide 125 mg PO Q6hrs
   -Continue BiPAP PRN
   -Repeat ABG
   #Hypoxemia: Patient with less desaturations yesterday and overnight and
   currently stable on decreased supplemental O2.
   -Patient completed a 5 day course of levofloxacin yesterday for ? COPD
   exacerbation
   -Day 3 of planned five day course of steroids for ? COPD
   -Echo yesterday did not have bubble study as was not possible secondary
   to patient
s body habitus
   #Metabolic alkalosis: Unclear etiology.  Patient probably has some
   metabolic alkalosis at baseline secondary to chronic COPD but  this is
   currently worsened.  Possible etiologies of this worsening would
   include contraction alkalosis thought urine Cl would not seem to
   support this and no [**Last Name (un) **] or signs she is dehydrated.  Possibly this
   could be due to high dose steroids (since discontinued) and relative
   hyper-mineralocorticoid state.
   -Acetazolamide 125 mg [**Hospital1 **] * 2 doses
   #Delirium/AMS: Probably multifactorial with schizophrenia on multiple
   medications, hypoxemia, steroids, and ICU status.  Her agitation was
   much diminished last night and she is less sedated/agitated.  Difficult
   to fully assess mental status due to language barrier but her attempts
   at communication seem more meaningful todayl.  y
   -Attempt to redirect and use restraints PRN
   -Continuing rather complicated home psychopharma regimen, attempting to
   avoid other sedating meds
   -Had pyuria but contaminated urine specimen, awaiting culture (no
   current abx)
    # Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: Patient is
   continuing to diurese on home furosemide dose but no signs of
   dehydration yet and appears euvolemic.
   -Continue furosemide at home dose, aim for net equal fluid balance
   # Coronary Artery Disease:   cont ASA, statin, metoprolol short acting
   #Schizophrenia: Continue home med regimen
   #DM: Hold oral hypoglycemics. QID FS and ISS.
   #Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine
   #FEN/Hypernatremia: Presumably due to relative free water deficit due
   to salt retention/mineralocoricoid excess.  Replace with 2 L D5W.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease. She was admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic CO2 retention but has had worsening hypercarbia recently. She has been using BiPAP, which has improved her condition. However, her recent CO2 levels have been slightly higher due to metabolic alkalosis, which depresses her respiratory drive. The patient's mental status has improved with reduced sedation and agitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbia: The patient's chronic CO2 retention has worsened recently, indicating potential respiratory failure.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen levels have been stable on decreased supplemental oxygen, but there is a risk of worsening hypoxemia.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, possibly secondary to chronic COPD or high-dose steroids.
4. Delirium/AMS: The patient may be experiencing delirium or acute mental status changes due to multiple factors such as schizophrenia, hypoxemia, steroids, and ICU status.
5. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient is continuing to diurese on her home furosemide dose, indicating possible fluid overload.
6. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has coronary artery disease, which can lead to cardiac complications if not managed properly.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 y/o woman w/Diabetes, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
   coronary artery disease, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypercarbia:
   #Hypoxemia: The patient desaturated to the 80
s multiple times
   yesterday and this did not appear to consistently improve with NPPV (in
   fact seemed to worsen).   Unclear what the etiology of this could be
   though concern for pulmonary hypertension vs shunt.
   -Obtain echocardiogram with bubble study to look for shunt
   -Continue to treat potential pneumonia w/ five day course of
   levofloxacin (completed today)
   #Metabolic alkalosis: The patient appears to have a chronic metabolic
   alkalosis as compensation for her metabolic acidosis.  This is worsened
   today.  Primary concern is for a contraction alkalosis potentially
   worsened by volume contraction and relative [**Name (NI) 7867**] state
   due to steroids.
   -Check urine Cl
   -If urine Cl low we will presume this is primarily contraction
   alkalosis and use acetazolamide to bridge until volume status improved
   in order to augment respiratory drive and not push further
   hypoventilation.
   #Delirium/AMS: Probably multifactorial with schizophrenia on multiple
   medications, hypoxemia, steroids, and ICU status.   Given the patient
   repeated attempts to climb out of bed yesterday was sedated due to
   concerns for safety and agitation augmenting respiratory distress.   So
   far no localizing sources of infection except possibly lung (urine
   clear, no indication of other source)
   -Minimize further sedation, wean steroids to 10 mg prednisone PO daily
   -Attempt to redirect and use restraints PRN
   -Fix discrepancies between home and in house med regimens (aripiprazole
   to QHS, increase sertraline, etc
   -Hold off [**Female First Name (un) 1290**]/psych evaluation until respiratory issues improved
   # Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: Patient is
   nearly 4L negative over hospitalization and quick diuresis probably
   contributing to acid-base disturbance.  Now back on home diuretic
   dose.
   -aim for net equal fluid balance
   # Coronary Artery Disease:   cont ASA, statin, metoprolol short acting
   #Schizophrenia: Continue home med regimen
   DM: Hold oral hypoglycemics. QID FS and ISS.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease. She was admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient experienced multiple episodes of desaturation to the 80s and did not consistently improve with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). This suggests the possibility of pulmonary hypertension or a shunt. An echocardiogram with bubble study has been ordered to look for a shunt.

The patient is also being treated for potential pneumonia with a five-day course of levofloxacin. Metabolic alkalosis is mentioned as a chronic condition that may be worsened by volume contraction and relative hypernatremia due to steroids. Checking urine Cl levels is recommended to confirm the presence of contraction alkalosis and use acetazolamide to bridge until volume status improves.

The patient is sedated due to concerns for safety and agitation, which may be contributing to respiratory distress. Minimizing further sedation and weaning steroids are advised. 

The patient has had significant negative fluid balance over hospitalization, likely contributing to an acid-base disturbance. Aim for net equal fluid balance is recommended.

Other medical conditions mentioned include coronary artery disease, schizophrenia, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and no known drug allergies. 

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is ICU pending improvement."

   73 yo female with hypercarbic respiratory failure now with some
   improved agitation O/N and only able to tolerate BIPAP intermittently.
   She has maintained adequate oxygenation only with supplemental
   oxygen--she has shown some capacity for diuresis as evidenced by fluid
   balance negative x 2 liters yesterday.  This would argue for continued
   need of BIPAP and in the setting of control of both reactive airways
   disease (which may have been triggered by pulmonary edema or frank
   reactive airways disease) and continued ventilatory support she has
   shown a capacity to maintain improved oxygenation and mental status.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation intermittently throughout the night and is currently on BiPAP with supplemental oxygen. The patient's ABG results indicate hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and a SpO2 of 87%. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates an overall negative fluid balance. 

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. However, the patient has an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level and creatinine level. Imaging reveals no change in the chest X-ray. 

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of pneumonia, chronic respiratory failure, and metabolic alkalosis. The patient will continue on BiPAP, maintain a negative fluid balance, minimize oxygen use, receive prednisone and diamox, and have insulin for glycemic control. 

ICU care includes continuing the patient's oral diet, monitoring lines, providing prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status and is expected to be transferred to the floor from the ICU."
