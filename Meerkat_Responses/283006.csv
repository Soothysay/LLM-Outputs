   Assessment and Plan
   47yo gentleman with h/o HIV, ESRD s/p kidney transplant, and SVC
   syndrome s/p stent on ASA and plavix with upper GI bleed transferred to
   the ICU in the setting of ongoing melena and 10 point Hct drop.
   # GI Bleed:
   Patient has had stable blood pressures with sinus tachycardia from
   110-130 (baseline HR is 90-100).  He has been asymptomatic apart from
   dizziness.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a renal transplant on 05/21/2156. The patient has had multiple complications post-transplantation, including acute rejection episodes on 05/28 and 06/17, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) on 06/17, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and grade 4 internal hemorrhoids with a recent bout of bloody bowel movement (BRBPR). The patient also has superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, which required stenting and angioplasty, and left upper extremity (LUE) swelling due to stenosis of the left brachio-cephalic vein (BCV) that was subsequently treated with stenting and angioplasty as well. The patient had a right upper extremity (RUE) PICC line placed during renal transplant surgery but was removed on 06/22 with evidence of a non-occlusive thrombus in the right axillary/subclavian vein (SCLV).

The patient presents with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), manifesting as melena and requiring blood product transfusions. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 158/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100"

The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to HIV/HTN, and subsequent cadaveric renal transplant. He has had multiple episodes of acute rejection and collapsing glomerulopathy with nephrotic syndrome. The patient also has superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and a history of right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient presented to the ICU with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, characterized by melena and a drop in hemoglobin (Hct) from 16 to 24.3. He received two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is currently being monitored closely. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.4°F, blood pressure ranging from 158/78 mmHg to 222/100 mmHg, heart rate between 106 and 123 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 2 liters of nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals pallor, diaphoresis, and depressed mental status. The patient has faint crackles at the bases bilaterally with superimposed transmitted upper airway sounds anteriorly. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and shows positive bowel sounds. Extremities show no cyanosis or edema, but there is a palpable thrill at the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, ESRD (end-stage renal disease), and multiple comorbidities. He presented to the ICU with ongoing melena, resulting in a significant drop in hemoglobin levels and the need for transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The patient is also experiencing sinus tachycardia, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath at rest. His respiratory status has been unstable, with decreased oxygen saturation and interstitial edema on chest X-ray. He has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) and recent right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's blood cultures were obtained, and he is currently being monitored closely. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient's melena suggests ongoing upper GI bleeding. This can lead to further drops in hemoglobin levels and may require additional blood transfusions. The risk of re-bleeding is high, and endoscopic intervention may be necessary.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, decreased oxygen saturation, and interstitial edema raise concerns for pulmonary edema. This can be secondary to volume overload due to IV fluids given during the blood transfusion or an infectious process. Immediate respiratory support and further evaluation are warranted.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, ESRD (end-stage renal disease), and multiple comorbidities. He underwent a cadaveric kidney transplant but experienced acute rejection and collapsing glomerulopathy with nephrotic syndrome. The patient also has SVC syndrome and a history of right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).

Upon admission to the ICU, the patient presented with ongoing melena (black, tarry stools) indicating an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and has had a total of 4 units transfused. His hematocrit (HCT) level is currently at 28.0%.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate ranging from 100-110 beats per minute. He has diaphoresis, a fever of 100.4°F, and is experiencing shortness of breath at rest with a non-productive cough. His blood pressure is elevated in the 150s-180s range, possibly due to hypovolemia from the GI bleed.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning with decreased oxygen saturation on room air, currently in the high 80s to low 90s. He has been placed on 2 liters nasal cannula (NC"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. He presented to the ICU with recurrent melena and hematemesis. The patient has allergies to Bactrim and aspirin, and is currently receiving pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, and other ICU medications. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 174/79 to 222/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support and has bibasilar rales on chest examination. He also has a thrill over the left upper extremity (LUE) fistula. Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 237 K/uL, and elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient's current medications include antiretrovirals for HIV, immunosuppressants for renal transplant, antidepressants, and prophylactic medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleeding: The patient's presentation with recurrent melena and hematemesis suggests ongoing GI bleeding. Continued monitoring and management of the bleeding site is crucial to prevent further"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and acute rejection of a kidney transplant. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient has experienced several complications since his admission, including vomiting, ongoing melena, hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI Bleed: The patient presented with melena and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration, indicating an active upper GI bleed. This is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.
2. Hypotension: The patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) has been elevated, which could be secondary to anxiety during the emesis episode. However, close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to maintain stable blood pressure levels.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, with a heart rate ranging from 100-135 beats per minute (bpm). This may be related to the ongoing GI bleed, hypotension, or anxiety. Continuous monitoring and interventions are required to control the heart rate.
4. Respiratory Distress: The patient is stable on 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen (NC), but there are faint crackles on the right side. The etiology of the respiratory distress is suspected to be pulmonary edema secondary to intravascular"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, specifically a duodenal ulcer with active bleeding and erosive esophagitis. The patient had episodes of hematemesis and melena, as well as sinus tachycardia ranging from 100-120 beats per minute. His hematocrit (HCT) dropped from 30% to 20%. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed in the morning stabilized the active bleeding. He is currently receiving packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: Despite the successful stabilization of the bleeding ulcer, there is still a risk of re-bleeding due to the presence of other risk factors such as active inflammation and underlying conditions.
2. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to HIV and transplant medications makes him susceptible to infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or worsening respiratory status, is essential.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, possibly secondary to anxiety during the emesis episode. However, if this persists or worsens, it may indicate hypotension and require intervention.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of kidney transplant, who presented to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding. The initial endoscopy showed duodenal ulcer without active bleeding but erosive esophagitis. The patient experienced an episode of projectile vomiting at night, which was dark brown in color. The vomiting episode was accompanied by tachycardia (heart rate between 130-140's) and elevated blood pressure (170's), as well as a positive guaiac test indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been started on D5W, Protonix IV, and Zofran. He is currently NPO and will undergo repeat EGD. The patient's allergies include hives from Bactrim and unknown reaction to aspirin. The patient is receiving midazolam, fentanyl, and hydralazine infusions, as well as other ICU medications. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue. Physical examination reveals the patient to be pale and diaphoretic, depressed, with no speech, and no abnormal findings on HEENT, neck, cardiac, lung, abdomen, extremities, or neurologic examination. Lab results show elevated WBC count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, low potassium, and other abnormalities. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

","The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and acute rejection of a renal transplant. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, transferred to the ICU, and is currently experiencing ongoing melena and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct). The patient has received 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and has an estimated Hct of 30. 

He has also had an episode of projectile vomiting of dark brown material, which was likely another GI bleed. The patient's heart rate has been elevated, ranging from 116 to 130 beats per minute, and his blood pressure has been high, reaching up to 170/71 mmHg. The patient is currently receiving IV pantoprazole and is NPO (nothing by mouth) until further evaluation with an endoscopy.

The patient's respiratory status is stable on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen (NC) with a saturation of 100%. There are faint crackles on the right base, which could be due to pulmonary edema secondary to intravascular volume replacement or an infectious process. The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) will be checked in the morning to assess for any changes.

The patient's hypertension is likely secondary to anxiety during the emesis episode, and his blood pressure remains elevated. All anti-hypertensive medications will be held during the acute bleed, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and acute rejection post kidney transplant. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient initially presented with hematemesis and melena, indicating an upper GI bleed. He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that showed a bleeding ulcer, which was injected and cauterized to achieve hemostasis. The patient is receiving proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and is being monitored closely for any signs of rebleeding.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 30% to 20%, leading to hypotension. He was transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to maintain his Hct above 25%. The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medication adjustments, indicating ongoing hypotension.

3. Respiratory status: The patient has stable oxygenation on 2 liters of nasal cannula (NC), but there are faint crackles on the right base. The etiology of these crackles is likely pulmonary edema secondary to intravascular volume resuscitation (IVR) or blood transfusions. The patient's respiratory status will be monitored"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and acute rejection of a cadaveric kidney transplant. He presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was admitted to the ICU. The patient experienced hematemesis and melena, resulting in a 10-point drop in hematocrit (HCT) from 30% to 20%. He also had sinus tachycardia ranging from 100-120 beats per minute (baseline HR is 90-100). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed in the morning stabilized active bleeding. The patient received two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is being monitored closely. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure of 151/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient presented with UGIB, which could lead to further blood loss and hemodynamic instability if not managed appropriately.
2. Acute Rejection of Kidney Transplant: The patient has a history of acute rejection of his kidney transplant, which may contribute to his current condition and require careful monitoring.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and acute rejection of a kidney transplant. He was previously diagnosed with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient presented to the hospital with hematemesis, melena, and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, which showed a bleeding ulcer and erosive esophagitis. The patient received pantoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, and Zofran for nausea. He also received a blood transfusion to address the anemia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure of 151/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient may experience rebleeding due to the underlying cause of the initial upper GI bleed, such as a peptic ulcer or erosive esophagitis.
2. Infection: As the patient has a compromised immune system due to HIV/AIDS, he is at a higher risk for infections, especially since he is receiving immunosuppressive therapy post-transplantation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with HIV, admitted to the ICU with a brisk duodenal bleed. He has a history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). The patient presented with hematemesis, melena, profound tachycardia, and a 10-point drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT). He is currently experiencing recurrent hematemesis and requires urgent endoscopic intervention for an ongoing duodenal ulcer bleed. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 140s, blood pressure of 160/90, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and will undergo an elective endoscopy to assess the bleeding source and potentially perform banding or inject intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip. Pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion has been initiated. The patient's allergies include Bactrim (oral) and aspirin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's current presentation and history suggest ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding. If left untreated or uncontrolled, this can lead to further blood loss, hypotension, shock, and even death.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 160/90. Uncontrolled hypertension can increase the risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
3. Renal Transplant: Although not directly related to the current acute issue, the patient's history of renal transplant requires ongoing immunosuppression. Discontinuation or alteration of these medications should be done with caution.
4. HIV: The patient's HIV infection needs to be managed appropriately with antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic medications. It is crucial to consider the potential drug interactions with the current ICU medications.
5. Depression: The patient is also diagnosed with depression and is currently on antidepressant medication. It is important to ensure that his mental health needs are addressed while in the ICU.
6. ICU Care: The patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and management of various aspects, including nutrition, glycemic control, lines placement, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and communication with the family."

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with HIV who was admitted with a brisk duodenal bleed. The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). On the current admission, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed a duodenal ulcer. The patient experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin (Hct) from 30 to 20 and tachycardia with a heart rate of 140 beats per minute (bpm). His blood pressure is elevated at 160/90 mmHg. The patient is receiving two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and will undergo another EGD to determine the source of the bleed. He is also on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip, and his antiplatelet medications (aspirin and Plavix) have been held.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) - The patient's current condition and history of GIB indicate a potential complication related to the duodenal ulcer. There is a risk of re-bleeding or further bleeding from the ulcer.
2. Hypertension - The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated at 160/90 mmHg. If left uncontrolled, this could lead to complications such as heart attack, stroke, or organ damage.
3. Renal complications - As a renal transplant recipient, the patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   47yo gentleman with h/o HIV, ESRD s/p cadaveric kidney transplant, and
   SVC syndrome previously on ASA and plavix, admitted with upper GI
   bleed.
   #GI Bleed:
   s/p EGD with cauterization/injection of active bleeding ulcer;
   continued to have Hematemesis/melena ON, sinus tachycardia in 100-130
   (baseline HR is 90-100), with 5pt HCT drop from 27
22 ON.  s/p 2units
   RBCs ON without issue. Decreasing IV access.
   - Appreciate GI recs. Will obtain post-transfusion HCT to assess for
   active bleeding and d/w GI regarding repeat EGD if needed.
   - Will reassess HCT post-transfusion and will transfuse to keep HCT
   >25.
   - IV pantoprazole 8mg/hr gtt
   - monitor on tele
   - currently has 2 right-sided 20 gauge PIVs; will place femoral
   Advanced Vascular Access line given decreasing IV access
   # Respiratory status:
   Stable on 2L NC, sating in high 90
s. Etiology most likely pulm edema
   (secondary to IVR/pRBCs), yet considering infectious process
   (considering temp, immunosuppression).
   - monitor respiratory status with careful IV hydration
   -Continue 2LNC O2
   # HTN:
   Patient's SBP continues to remain elevated (up to 160
s) ON
   - hold all anti hypertensives during acute bleed
   - will provide anti-hypertensives (eg: hydralazine) PRN
   # ESRD s/p R renal transplant. Appreciate renal recs.
   - Baseline Cr 1.9-2.4, current Cr stable at 1.9 adequate UOP overnight.
   - continue cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil) and tacrolimus (Prograf);
   will provide Solumedrol 20mg IV q12hr.
   - f/u tacro level today prior to dose
   - hold ASA and plavix given acute GI bleed; waiting for IR recs
   (emailed IR [**9-17**] for recs)
   -follow lytes and urine output
   #Elevated Liver Enzymes: Continue to be mildly elevated LFTs; likely
   medication induced (eg: dapsone) vs ischemia (decreased HCT and O2
   delivery) vs infection (eg: viral; unlikely as LFTs not chronically or
   significantly elevated).
   -f/u with LFTs tomorrow.
   # HIV/AIDS:
   -Continue Combivir (Lamivudine-Zidovudine), efavirenz, and abacavir
   -continue dapsone and azithromycin prophylaxis
   # h/o SVC syndrome s/p L BCL stent and h/o RUE DVTs: no s/s of SVC
   syndrome upon admission, RUE DVT diagnosed in [**6-22**], on Plavix and ASA
   before admission
   -Holding ASA and Plavix [**1-17**] to GIB;
   -Will discuss with IR with regards to starting ASA/Plavix
   # Depression: Affect continues to be very flat.
   - continue mirtazipine
   - social work consult
   # FEN:  NPO for possible EGD/GI intervention; appreciate nutrition
   recs-if no advance in diet in 48, [**Street Address(1) 5798**].
   # PPX: ppi IV BID, pneumoboots
   # ACCESS: 2 x 20 gauge PIV's, will place femoral Trauma line on left
   side given right sided kidney transplant.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome.
- He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of an active bleeding ulcer.
- The patient continues to have hematemesis/melena, sinus tachycardia, and a significant drop in hematocrit (HCT) from 27 to 22.
- He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) without issue.
- The patient has decreasing IV access, and a femoral advanced vascular access line will be placed.
- His respiratory status is stable on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen, and he is in the high 90s saturation range.
- The etiology of his respiratory status is likely pulmonary edema secondary to intravascular volume resuscitation/packed RBCs, yet considering an infectious process.
- The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and anti-hypertensive medications will be provided as needed.
- The patient has a history of ESRD post-renal transplant and is currently on immunosuppressive medications such as cellcept and tacrolimus.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of an active bleeding ulcer. Despite receiving two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), the patient continues to have hematemesis and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) from 27% to 22%. The patient's heart rate is in the range of 100-130 beats per minute (tachycardia), which is higher than his baseline heart rate of 90-100 beats per minute. He is currently receiving pantoprazole intravenously and being monitored on telemetry. The patient has three right-sided peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines and may require a femoral cordis if he decompensates, considering his history of SVC syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent or recurrent upper GI bleeding: The patient continues to have hematemesis despite receiving treatment for the bleeding ulcer. There is a risk of further bleeding or re-bleeding, which could lead to worsening anemia and shock.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, but it may drop due to blood product transfusion and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of an active bleeding ulcer. Despite receiving two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), he continues to have hematemesis and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration from 27% to 22%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being closely monitored.

Potential medical complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has ongoing upper GI bleeding despite receiving treatment. There is a risk of re-bleeding or further complications such as perforation or development of anemia.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and there is a concern for ongoing blood loss leading to hypotension and potential organ dysfunction.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a history of ESRD and is on immunosuppressive therapy. AKI can occur due to hypoperfusion or direct injury to the kidneys.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or other respiratory complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) following a cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted for an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of an active bleeding ulcer. Despite this, he continues to have hematemesis and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) from 27% to 22%. He is currently receiving two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and will be monitored closely. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient's ongoing hematemesis and drop in HCT indicate a persistent GI bleed. There is a risk of re-bleeding or worsening of the current bleeding, which could lead to further drops in blood pressure and HCT levels.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, possibly due to anxiety during the emesis episode. However, if the GI bleed continues, hypotension may develop, requiring prompt intervention.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's recent kidney transplant and ongoing blood loss may lead to AKI. Close monitoring of renal function and urine output is crucial.
4. Infection: As an immunocompromised patient with HIV/AIDS, the patient is at an increased risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of an active bleeding ulcer. Despite this, he continues to have hematemesis and a significant drop in hemoglobin (HCT) from 27 to 22. He is currently receiving two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).

The patient also has respiratory status that is stable on 2 liters of nasal cannula (NC), with a high oxygen saturation. The etiology is likely pulmonary edema secondary to intravascular volume resuscitation/pRBCs, but an infectious process should be considered due to immunosuppression. A chest X-ray will be checked in the morning, and respiratory status will be monitored with IV hydration.

The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 180/75 mmHg, which is secondary to anxiety during an emesis episode. His hypertension should be managed with antihypertensives on an as-needed basis.

The patient has ESRD post renal transplant and is currently on mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept) and tacrolimus (Prograf). His hydrocortisone dose"

   Assessment and Plan
   47yo gentleman with h/o HIV, ESRD s/p cadaveric kidney transplant, and
   SVC syndrome previously on ASA and plavix, admitted with upper GI
   bleed.
   #GI Bleed:
   s/p EGD with cauterization/injection of active bleeding ulcer;
   continued to have hematemesis? ON, sinus tachycardia in 100-120
   (baseline HR is 90-100), with 5pt HCT drop from 27
22 ON.  Currently
   receiving pRBCx2units.
   - Appreciate GI recs. Will d/w GI this am re possible additional EGD in
   am.
   - Will reassess HCT post-transfusion and will transfuse to keep HCT
   >25.
   - continue NS IV fluid boluses as needed for tachycardia
   - IV pantoprazole 8mg/hr gtt
   - monitor on tele
   - currently has 3 right-sided 20 gauge PIVs.
   - If decompensates, would place femoral Cordis given h/o SVC syndrome
   # Respiratory status:
   Stable on 2L NC, sating in high 90
s. Etiology most likely pulm edema
   (secondary to IVR/pRBCs), yet considering infectious process
   (considering temp, immunosuppression).
   - check CXR in am [**9-18**] and monitor respiratory status with IV hydration
   -Continue 2LNC O2
   # HTN:
   Patient's SBP elevated 180
s ON secondary to anxiety during emesis
   episode with continuing elevated SBP.
   -          hold all anti hypertensives during acute bleed
   -          will provide anti-hypertensives (eg: hydralazine) PRN
   # ESRD s/p R renal transplant. Appreciate renal recs.
   - Baseline Cr 1.9-2.4, current Cr stable at 1.9 adequate UOP overnight.
   - continue cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil) and tacrolimus (Prograf);
   decreased hydrocortisone from 50mg IV q6h to 25mg IV q6h per renal and
   will switch to prednisone 5mg qday today.
   - f/u tacro level today prior to dose
   - hold ASA and plavix given acute GI bleed; waiting for IR recs
   -follow lytes and urine output
   #Elevated Liver Enzymes: Etiologies in today
s mildly elevated LFTs
   include medication induced (eg: dapsone) vs infection (eg: viral;
   unlikely as LFTs not chronically or significantly elevated).
   -f/u with LFTs today
   # HIV/AIDS:
   -Continue Combivir (Lamivudine-Zidovudine), efavirenz, and abacavir
   -continue dapsone and azithromycin prophylaxis
   # h/o SVC syndrome s/p L BCL stent and h/o RUE DVTs: no s/s of SVC
   syndrome upon admission, RUE DVT diagnosed in [**6-22**], on Plavix and ASA
   before admission
   -Holding ASA and Plavix [**1-17**] to GIB;
   -Will discuss with IR with regards to starting ASA/Plavix
   # Depression: Affect continues to be very flat.
   - continue mirtazipine
   - social work consult

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was previously on aspirin (ASA) and Plavix. He presented with upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of an active bleeding ulcer. Despite receiving two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), the patient continues to have hematemesis and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) from 27 to 22. He also has sinus tachycardia in the range of 100-120 beats per minute (bpm), which is higher than his baseline heart rate of 90-100 bpm. The patient is currently receiving intravenous pantoprazole and being monitored closely. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has ongoing hematemesis despite EGD with cauterization/injection of the bleeding ulcer. This indicates a potential ongoing or recurrent GI bleed, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure if not managed appropriately.

2. Anemia: The patient's HCT has dropped from 27 to 22 after receiving two units of pRBCs. This suggests significant blood loss and ongoing bleeding. If the bleeding continues, the patient may"

   47yo gentleman with h/o HIV, ESRD s/p cadaveric kidney transplant, and
   SVC syndrome previously on ASA and plavix, admitted with upper GI
   bleed.
   #GI Bleed:
   s/p EGD with cauterization/injection of active bleeding ulcer;
   continued to have Hematemesis/melena O/N, sinus tachycardia in
   100-130
s (baseline HR is 90-100), with 5pt HCT drop from 27
22 O/N.
   s/p 2units RBCs O/N without issue. Decreasing IV access.
   - Appreciate GI recs. Will obtain post-transfusion HCT to assess for
   active bleeding and d/w GI regarding repeat EGD if needed.
   - Will reassess HCT post-transfusion and will transfuse to keep HCT
   >25.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of an active bleeding ulcer. Despite receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) overnight, the patient continues to have hematemesis/melena and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) from 27 to 22. The patient's heart rate is sinus tachycardia in the range of 100-130 beats per minute (baseline HR is 90-100). The patient's respiratory status is stable on 2 liters nasal cannula (NC), and he is saturating in the high 90s. There is a concern for pulmonary edema secondary to intravascular volume resuscitation/packed RBCs or an infectious process. The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and all anti-hypertensive medications have been held during the acute bleed. The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.9, indicating adequate urine output overnight. He is currently on immunosuppressive medications including cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil) and tacrolimus (Prograf), and steroids will be provided. The"

Key points from the progress note include:

- The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of an active bleeding ulcer. However, he continues to have hematemesis/melena overnight, and his heart rate remains in the sinus tachycardia range of 100-130 beats per minute (baseline HR is 90-100).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent an endoscopy on 09/17/2156 at 10:30 AM, which revealed a bleeding ulcer. The ulcer was injected and cauterized during the procedure. The patient has a history of allergies to Bactrim (Oral) and Aspirin. He is currently receiving pantoprazole, midazolam, and fentanyl infusions in the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level decreased from 27% to 22% this morning, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate compensation for the initial blood loss. The patient is receiving a second unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's recent endoscopy showed a bleeding ulcer, which was managed by injection and cauterization. However, there is a possibility of recurrent bleeding or complications related to the ulcer.
3. Fluid Balance: The patient has received a total of 1585 mL of fluids since midnight, including 828 mL of intravenous fluids, 360 mL of oral intake, and 475 mL of total fluid output (including 492 mL of blood products). This indicates ongoing fluid resuscitation and monitoring.
4. Hemodynamic Stability: The patient's blood pressure ranges from 126/64 mmHg to 185/95 mm"

   47yo gentleman with h/o HIV, ESRD s/p cadaveric kidney transplant, and
   SVC syndrome previously on ASA and plavix, admitted with upper GI
   bleed.
   #GI Bleed:
   Continued to have hematemesis and melenotic stools ON, sinus
   tachycardia in 100-120
s (baseline HR is 90-100), with 10pt HCT drop
   from 30
20 ON.  EGD in am stabilized active bleeding, currently
   receiving pRBCx2units.
   - Appreciate GI recs.
   - Will reassess HCT post-transfusion and will transfuse to keep HCT
   >25.

   - IV pantoprazole 8mg/hr gtt
   - monitor on tele
   - patient has been typed and crossed for total 6units
   - currently has 3 right-sided 20 gauge PIVs.
   - If decompensates, would place femoral Cordis given h/o SVC syndrome
   # Respiratory status:
   Stable on 2L NC, sating in high 90
s, faint crackles on R. Etiology
   most likely pulm edema (secondary to IVR/pRBCs), yet considering
   infectious process (considering temp, immunosuppression).
   - check CXR in am [**9-18**] and monitor respiratory status with IV hydration
   -Continue 2LNC O2
   # HTN:
   Patient's SBP elevated 170
s ON secondary to anxiety during emesis
   episode with continuing elevated SBP.
   -          hold all anti hypertensives during acute bleed
   -          will provide anti-hypertensives (eg: hydralazine) PRN
   # ESRD s/p R renal transplant. Appreciate renal recs.
   - Baseline Cr 1.9-2.4, current Cr stable at 1.9 adequate UOP overnight.
   - continue cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil) and tacrolimus (Prograf);
   will decrease hydrocortisone from 50mg IV q6h to 25mg IV q6h per renal
   and switch to prednisone 5mg qday tomorrow.
   - Will check tacro level in am prior to dose
   - hold ASA and plavix given acute GI bleed
   -follow lytes and urine output
   #Elevated Liver Enzymes: Etiologies in today
s mildly elevated LFTs
   include medication induced (eg: dapsone) vs infection (eg: viral;
   unlikely as LFTs not chronically or significantly elevated).
   -Will follow LFTs daily.
   # HIV/AIDS:
   -Continue Combivir (Lamivudine-Zidovudine), efavirenz, and abacavir
   -continue dapsone and azithromycin prophylaxis

   syndrome upon admission, RUE DVT diagnosed in [**6-22**], on Plavix and ASA
   before admission
   -Holding ASA and Plavix [**1-17**] to GIB
   -Will discuss with IR with regards to starting ASA/Plavix
   # Depression: Affect continues to be very flat.
   - continue mirtazipine
   - social work consult
   # FEN:  Currently NPO, will advance to clears in pm

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was previously on aspirin (ASA) and Plavix, and he presented with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He continues to have hematemesis and melena, sinus tachycardia, and a significant drop in hematocrit (HCT) from 30 to 22. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, which stabilized active bleeding. The patient received two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is currently receiving pantoprazole IV at 8 mg/hr. He is being monitored on telemetry and has been typed and crossed for a total of six units of blood. He also has three right-sided 20-gauge peripheral IV lines.

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI Bleed: The patient is experiencing ongoing hematemesis and melena, with a drop in HCT from 30 to 22. Active bleeding was stabilized during an EGD, and he received two units of pRBCs. The plan is to reassess HCT post-transfusion and transfuse to maintain a HCT >25. IV pantoprazole will be continued, and the patient will be monitored on tele.
2. Respiratory status: The patient is"

   - monitor on tele
   - currently left femoral Advanced Vascular Access line
   - appreciate surgery and GI input
   # h/o SVC syndrome s/p L BCL stent and h/o RUE DVTs previously on
   [**Month (only) **] and ASA before admission, holding for GIB. Presents with left
   facial swelling. Etiologies include dependent edema (from lying on Left
   side) or exacerbation of SVC syndrome with stenosis of stent; s/p
   platelet unitx1.
   -Holding ASA and [**Month (only) **] [**1-17**] to GIB until HCT stabilize.
   - U/S of left upper extremities.
   # HTN:
   Patient's SBP continues to remain elevated with max of SBP 220
   yesterday.
   - hold all anti hypertensives during acute bleed
   - will provide anti-hypertensives (eg: hydralazine) PRN
   # ESRD s/p R renal transplant. Appreciate renal recs.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Baseline Cr 1.9-2.4, current Cr stable at 2.2.
   - continue cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil) and tacrolimus (Prograf);
   - will decrease Solumedrol from 20mg to 15mg IV q12hr per surgery.
   - f/u tacro level
   -follow lytes and urine output
   # Respiratory status:
   Stable on RA, sating in high 90
s. Etiology most likely pulm edema
   (secondary to IVR/pRBCs).
   - monitor respiratory status with careful IV hydration
   #Elevated Liver Enzymes: Continue to be mildly elevated LFTs; likely
   medication induced (eg: dapsone) vs ischemia (decreased HCT and O2
   delivery) vs infection (eg: viral; unlikely as LFTs not chronically or
   significantly elevated).
   -follow LFTs

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after a cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He is currently admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions, and his hemoglobin levels have been fluctuating. He also has a history of right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and is on anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia in the range of 100-120 beats per minute, with a baseline heart rate of 90-100 beats per minute. His blood pressure remains elevated, with a maximum of 220/93 mmHg yesterday. His respiratory status is stable, but there is a concern for possible pulmonary edema secondary to intravenous fluid administration and blood transfusions.

Laboratory results indicate mildly elevated liver enzymes, likely due to medication-induced causes such as dapsone or infection. The patient's creatinine levels are within the expected range for someone with ESRD. Other lab values show abnormalities in electrolytes, kidney function tests, and coagulation profile.

The patient's physical examination reveals pallor, depressed mental status, and edematous left face with a mass over the left jaw. There is also mild edema over the distal right arm with erythema around old peripheral"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and has undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of an active bleeding ulcer. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) yesterday without any issues. He continues to experience sinus tachycardia in the range of 100-120 beats per minute (baseline heart rate is 90-100 beats per minute) and has had a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 32.4% to 29.4 overnight. The patient also received a unit of platelets. A trauma line has been placed in his left femoral vein.

The patient has a history of SVC syndrome post-left bronchial stent and right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). He is currently on ASA and holding for a gastrointestinal bleed. He presents with left facial swelling, which may be due to dependent edema or exacerbation of SVC syndrome with stenosis of the stent. The patient has been given a platelet unit.

The patient's systolic blood pressure remains elevated, with a maximum of 220 mmHg yesterday. Anti-hypertensive medications have been withheld"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of the active bleeding ulcer. The patient continues to have hematemesis/melena overnight, sinus tachycardia, and a drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) from 27% to 22% overnight. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) without any issues. The plan is to keep the HCT >25% and reassess after transfusion. IV pantoprazole is being given at 8mg/hr. The patient's respiratory status is stable on 2 liters of nasal cannula (NC), but there is a concern for pulmonary edema secondary to intravascular volume resuscitation and blood products. The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and all anti-hypertensive medications are being held during the acute bleed. 

Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI Bleed: The patient presented with an upper GI bleed and required an EGD with cauterization/injection of the active bleeding ulcer. Despite receiving 2 units of RBCs, he continues to have hematemesis/melena, indicating ongoing bleeding."

   SVC syndrome previously on ASA and [**Year (4 digits) 1495**], admitted with upper GI
   bleed.
   #GI Bleed:
   s/p EGD with cauterization/injection of active bleeding ulcer; s/p
   4units RBCs yest without issue; sinus tachycardia in 100-120
   (baseline HR is 90-100); 3pt HCT drop from 32.4
29.4 O/N. Trauma line
   in place.
   - will d/w GI regarding repeat EGD considering [**Month (only) 38**] HCT drop.
   - IV pantoprazole 8mg/hr gtt
   - monitor on tele
   - currently left femoral Advanced Vascular Access line
   - appreciate surgery input
   # Respiratory status:
   Stable on 2L NC, sating in high 90
s. Etiology most likely pulm edema
   (secondary to IVR/pRBCs).
   - monitor respiratory status with careful IV hydration
   -Continue 2LNC O2
   # HTN:
   Patient's SBP continues to remain elevated with max of SBP 220
   yesterday.
   - hold all anti hypertensives during acute bleed
   - will provide anti-hypertensives (eg: hydralazine) PRN
   # ESRD s/p R renal transplant. Appreciate renal recs.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Baseline Cr 1.9-2.4, current Cr stable at 2.2 adequate UOP overnight.

   will decrease Solumedrol from 20mg to 15mg IV q12hr per surgery.
   - f/u tacro level
   - hold ASA and [**Month (only) 1495**] given acute GI bleed; waiting for IR recs
   (emailed IR [**9-17**] for recs)
   -follow lytes and urine output
   #Elevated Liver Enzymes: Continue to be mildly elevated LFTs; likely
   medication induced (eg: dapsone) vs ischemia (decreased HCT and O2
   delivery) vs infection (eg: viral; unlikely as LFTs not chronically or
   significantly elevated).
   -f/u with LFTs tomorrow.
   # HIV/AIDS:
   -Continue Combivir (Lamivudine-Zidovudine), efavirenz, and abacavir
   -continue dapsone and azithromycin prophylaxis

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) following a cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was previously on aspirin and another medication (name not specified) and admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of an active bleeding ulcer and received 4 units of red blood cells (RBCs) without any issues. He has been experiencing sinus tachycardia in the range of 100-120 beats per minute (bpm), which is higher than his baseline heart rate of 90-100 bpm. There has been a significant drop in hematocrit (HCT) from 32.4 to 29.4 overnight. A trauma line has been placed in the left femoral area.

The patient's respiratory status is stable on 2 liters nasal cannula (NC), with oxygen saturation in the high 90s. The etiology of the respiratory status is most likely pulmonary edema secondary to intravascular volume resuscitation and blood transfusions. The patient's blood pressure continues to remain elevated, with a maximum systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 220 yesterday. All anti-hypertensive medications"

   47yo gentleman with h/o HIV, ESRD s/p cadaveric kidney transplant, and
   SVC syndrome previously on ASA and plavix, admitted with upper GI
   bleed.
   #GI Bleed:
   s/p EGD with cauterization/injection of active bleeding ulcer ([**9-17**]);
   s/p 4units RBCs yesterday without issue (s/p total of 10units); sinus
   tachycardia in 100-120
s (baseline HR is 90-100); 3pt HCT drop from
   32.4
29.4 O/N. s/p plateletx1unit. Trauma line in place.
   - will d/w GI regarding repeat EGD considering [**Month (only) 38**] HCT drop.
   - Will hold off from transfusing again until d/w GI.
   - IV pantoprazole 8mg/hr gtt
   - monitor on tele
   - currently left femoral Advanced Vascular Access line
   - appreciate surgery and GI input
   # h/o SVC syndrome s/p L BCL stent and h/o RUE DVTs previously on
   Plavix and ASA before admission, holding for GIB. Presents with left
   facial swelling. Etiologies include dependent edema (from lying on Left
   side) or exacerbation of SVC syndrome with stenosis of stent; s/p
   platelet unitx1.
   -Holding ASA and Plavix [**1-17**] to GIB until HCT stabilize.
   - U/S of left upper extremities.
   # HTN:
   Patient's SBP continues to remain elevated with max of SBP 220
   yesterday.
   - hold all anti hypertensives during acute bleed
   - will provide anti-hypertensives (eg: hydralazine) PRN
   # ESRD s/p R renal transplant. Appreciate renal recs.

   # Respiratory status:
   Stable on RA, sating in high 90
s. Etiology most likely pulm edema
   (secondary to IVR/pRBCs).
   - monitor respiratory status with careful IV hydration
   #Elevated Liver Enzymes: Continue to be mildly elevated LFTs; likely
   medication induced (eg: dapsone) vs ischemia (decreased HCT and O2
   delivery) vs infection (eg: viral; unlikely as LFTs not chronically or
   significantly elevated).
   -follow LFTs

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of active bleeding ulcer. The patient received 4 units of red blood cells (RBCs) without any issues and has a baseline heart rate (HR) of 90-100 beats per minute. His hemoglobin (HCT) dropped from 32.4% to 29.4% overnight. The patient also has a history of right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and is currently on hold for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He presents with left facial swelling, which could be due to dependent edema or exacerbation of SVC syndrome with stent stenosis. The patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) remains elevated, with a maximum of 220 mmHg yesterday. His current creatinine (Cr) level is stable at 2.2 mg/dL. The patient is stable on room air and has an oxygen saturation of 98%. His respiratory status is being monitored with careful intravenous (IV) hydration. The patient's liver enzymes are mildly elevated, possibly due to medication-induced effects or decreased oxygen delivery. He is continuing on his"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which has been managed with endoscopic cauterization/injection and blood product transfusion. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has dropped from 29.5 to 28.7 overnight. He is also experiencing left facial swelling, which is resolving and may be related to lying on the left side. The patient is currently on pantoprazole, ranitidine, and benadryl for allergic reactions. His vital signs are stable, but he has persistent hypertension. His renal function is stable with a creatinine level of 2.2. The patient's liver enzymes are mildly elevated. He has chronic anemia with a HCT of 28.7%. His respiratory status is stable on room air. The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS and is on antiretroviral therapy. He is also being treated for depression and has prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia. The patient's recent lab results show mild leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. He has a scheduled follow-up for tacrolimus level and will be transferred to the floor with a triple lumen line."

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was previously on aspirin and Plavix, admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of active bleeding ulcer, received 4 units of red blood cells (RBCs) yesterday without issue, and has a baseline heart rate (HR) of 90-100. He also has sinus tachycardia in the range of 100-120. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) dropped from 32.4 to 29.4 overnight. He received a platelet unit. The patient has a left femoral advanced vascular access line and is currently on telemonitoring. The patient presents with left facial swelling, which could be due to dependent edema or exacerbation of SVC syndrome with stent stenosis. The patient is holding aspirin and Plavix until the GI bleed stabilizes. An ultrasound of the left upper extremities was performed. The patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) remains elevated, with a maximum of SBP 220 yesterday. All anti-hypertensives were held during the acute bleed, and anti-hypertensives will be provided as needed ("

The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cadaveric kidney transplant, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of active bleeding ulcer. The patient received 4 units of red blood cells (RBCs) without any issues, but had a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) from 32.4 to 29.4 overnight. He also received a platelet unit. The patient's heart rate is sinus tachycardia in the range of 100-120 beats per minute (bpm), which is higher than his baseline rate of 90-100 bpm. 

The patient has a history of SVC syndrome that was previously treated with a left brachiocephalic vein (LBC) stent and right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). He is currently on hold for GI bleed and presents with left facial swelling. Potential etiologies include dependent edema from lying on the left side or exacerbation of SVC syndrome with stent stenosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of an active bleeding ulcer. The patient received 4 units of red blood cells (RBCs) yesterday without any issues. His heart rate has been in the range of 100-120 beats per minute (sinus tachycardia), and there has been a significant drop in hematocrit (HCT) from 32.4 to 29.4 overnight. The patient also received a platelet unit. A trauma line is in place.

The patient presents with left facial swelling, which could be due to dependent edema from lying on the left side or exacerbation of SVC syndrome with stent stenosis. The patient is currently holding aspirin and Plavix due to the GI bleed until HCT stabilizes. An ultrasound of the left upper extremities was performed.

The patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) remains elevated, with a maximum SBP of 220 yesterday. Anti-hypertensive medications will be held during the acute bleed and provided as needed (e.g., hydralazine).

The patient has a history of right renal transplant and continues to be on immunos"

   SVC syndrome previously on ASA and plavix, admitted with upper GI
   bleed.
   #GI Bleed:
   s/p EGD with cauterization/injection of active bleeding ulcer ([**9-17**]);
   s/p 10units RBCs total; s/p plateletx1unit); sinus tachycardia in
   90-110
s (baseline HR is 90-100); 1.2pt HCT drop from 29.5
28.7 O/N.
   Trauma line in place.
   - will follow HCTs at 4pm and then again at 10pm.
   - IV pantoprazole 8mg/hr gtt [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor on tele
   - currently left femoral Advanced Vascular Access line; will switch [**Location (un) **]
   to a triple line in preparation for transfer to floor; will attempt for
   additional PIV access
   - appreciate surgery and GI input
   # h/o SVC syndrome s/p L BCL stent and h/o RUE DVTs previously on
   Plavix and ASA before admission, holding for GIB.  Left facial swelling
   O/N resolving; U/S of LUE showed no evidence of stenosis/obstruction.
   Etiologies include dependent edema (from lying on Left side).
   -Holding ASA and Plavix [**1-17**] to GIB until HCT stabilize.
   -Will d/w IR, Renal, and Surgery (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 511**], who performed stent
   placement/recanalizations) concerning beginning ASA/Plavix.
   # HTN:
   Patient's SBP continues to remain elevated with max of SBP 220
   yesterday.
   -Appreciate renal recs
   -Per renal, will begin amlodipine, metoprolol, and lisinopril PO.
   # ESRD s/p R renal transplant.
   - Appreciate surgery and renal recs
   - Baseline Cr 1.9-2.4, current Cr stable at 2.2.
   - will change cellcept and tacrolimus to PO doses (Myfortic 720mg PO
   BID and Tacrolimus PO)
   - will change Solumedrol to Prednisone 5mg PO qday.

   Stable on RA, sating in high 90
s. Etiology most likely pulm edema
   (secondary to IVR/pRBCs).
   - monitor respiratory status with careful IV hydration
   #Elevated Liver Enzymes: Continue to be mildly elevated LFTs; likely
   medication induced (eg: dapsone) vs ischemia (decreased HCT and O2
   delivery) vs infection (eg: viral; unlikely as LFTs not chronically or
   significantly elevated).
   -check LFTs tomorrow

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleed from an upper source, specifically a duodenal ulcer. He also has a background of renal transplant, HIV, and depression. The patient is currently experiencing left-sided facial swelling due to suspected superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, but his left upper extremity ultrasound is patent. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in blood pressure. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes, as well as low hemoglobin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleed from an upper source, which could lead to further bleeding and potential complications such as hypovolemic shock.
2. Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVC): The patient's left-sided facial swelling indicates a possible SVC syndrome, which can cause compression of the superior vena cava and lead to symptoms such as facial swelling, dyspnea, and cyanosis.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may require management and control to prevent complications like heart failure or stroke.
4. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests the possibility of an ongoing infection, which needs to be monitored and treated promptly to prevent further complications.
5. Anemia: The low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia, which can result from chronic blood loss or other underlying conditions. It should be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleed from an upper source, specifically a duodenal ulcer. The bleeding appears to have slowed down but is still present. The patient's vital signs show hypertension with blood pressure ranging from 177/93 to 190/106 mmHg. He also has mild edema over the right eyelid and a left groin line in place for a central venous catheter.

The patient's lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 163 K/uL, low platelet count of 168 K/uL, and elevated creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL. Other lab values show abnormalities in liver function tests, electrolytes, and kidney function.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary concerns include gastrointestinal bleed, hypertension, depression, and renal transplant management. The plan involves transfusing blood products if hemoglobin falls below 26, accessing the femoral site if needed, holding antiplatelet medications ASA/Plavix during active bleeding, and resuming these medications after stabilization.

The patient's history of superior vena cava syndrome is noted, along with left-sided facial swelling. It is planned to resume ASA/Plavix once bleeding is under control. Renal transplant management involves continuing current immunosuppressants and tapering steroids. HIV management includes continuing antiretro"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-right renal transplant, hypertension, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was previously on aspirin and Plavix, but is currently holding these medications due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient presented with hypokalemia, which was repleted. He also has chronic anemia with a hemoglobin concentration in the upper 20s to low 30s. The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite being on antihypertensive medications. There is no evidence of SVC syndrome symptoms. 

Potential Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's history of GIB and ongoing use of NSAIDs like aspirin and Plavix increase the risk of recurrent bleeding.
2. Hypertension: The patient's persistent hypertension despite medication suggests a potential complication related to the renal transplant or underlying medical conditions.
3. SVC Syndrome: Although the patient's symptoms have resolved, there is still a risk of recurrence if the underlying cause of the stenosis or obstruction is not addressed.
4. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may require ongoing monitoring and management to prevent complications associated with decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV/AIDS increases the risk of infection, which can be exacerbated by invasive procedures or poor wound healing.
6. Depression: The patient's flat affect suggests depression, which if left untreated, can have negative impacts on his overall well-being and compliance with medical management.
7. Liver Enzyme Elevation: The patient's mildly elevated liver enzymes may indicate potential liver injury or dysfunction, which requires further investigation to determine the cause and appropriate management."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-right kidney transplant, hypertension, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted for an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which required an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of an active bleeding ulcer.
- The patient received 10 units of red blood cells (RBCs) and 1 unit of platelets. His hemoglobin concentration (HCT) is stable.
- The patient's left facial swelling, which was present overnight, resolved, and an ultrasound of the left upper extremity (LUE) showed no evidence of stenosis/obstruction. The etiology of the swelling was determined to be dependent edema from lying on the left side.
- The patient continues to have hypertension with a maximum systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 190 yesterday. Oral antihypertensive medications were restarted, and the dose of metoprolol was increased to 100 mg three times a day. Valsartan 40 mg per day was also started.
- The patient's serum potassium level (K) was low at 3.2 but has been repleted. No cardiac manifestations were observed.
- The patient's creatinine level is stable at 2.0, within the baseline range of 1.9-"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, ESRD post renal transplant, HTN, and SVC syndrome. He was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of an active bleeding ulcer. The patient received 10 units of red blood cells and platelets, and his hemoglobin concentration is stable. He has a history of SVC syndrome, left femoral swelling that resolved, and right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). He was previously on Plavix and aspirin, which are currently being held due to GIB. The patient also has hypokalemia, hypertension, anemia, respiratory issues, HIV/AIDS, depression, and feeding and prophylaxis concerns. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's GIB requires close monitoring for signs of re-bleeding or worsening condition. Proper management is crucial to prevent further blood loss and potential shock.
2. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be controlled to prevent complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage. It is important to monitor blood pressure regularly and adjust medications accordingly.
3. Hypokalemia: Low potassium levels can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other electrolyte imbalances. Monitoring potassium levels and repleting as"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-right kidney transplant, hypertension, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with cauterization/injection of an active bleeding ulcer. The patient received 10 units of red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets.

Current medical issues:
1. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleed: The patient is stable, and pantoprazole has been initiated. The trauma line is still in place.
2. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium level is low but has been repleted. No cardiac manifestations have been observed.
3. Hypertension: The patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) remains elevated, with a maximum of 190 yesterday. Medications such as amlodipine, metoprolol, and lisinopril have been started.
4. ESRD post-right renal transplant: The patient's baseline creatinine (Cr) is 1.9-2.4, and the current Cr is stable at 2.0. Myfortic 720mg PO BID and Tacrolimus PO are being continued, along with Prednisone 5mg PO qday with quick taper per renal. Monitoring of electrolytes and urine output is important.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has been chronically low, ranging from the upper 20s to low 30s. A transfusion of 10 units of RBCs was given after the upper GI bleed. Epoetin alpha (Epo) 20,000 units subcutaneously was administered today per renal consultation.
6. Respiratory status: The patient is stable on room air, with oxygen saturation in the high 90s. Hypoxia during admission was likely due to pulmonary edema (secondary to intravenous fluid administration and blood transfusions).
7. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) continue to be mildly elevated, possibly due to medication-induced hepatotoxicity, ischemia, or infection.
8. HIV/AIDS: The patient's antiretroviral therapy consists of Combivir (Lamivudine-Zidovudine), efavirenz, and abacavir. Prophylaxis with dapsone and azithromycin is also being continued.
9. Depression: The patient's affect remains very flat. Mirtazapine is being continued, and a social work consultation is requested.
10. Nutrition: The patient's diet has been advanced from clear liquids to a full enteral nutrition (FEN).
11. Prophylaxis for pneumonia: Pantoprazole IV BID and pneumoboots have been initiated.
12. Access: The patient has a femoral trauma line on the left side due to the right-sided kidney transplant. This will be changed to a triple lumen line for transfer to the floor, and additional peripheral intravenous (PIV) access will be attempted.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Re-bleeding of the GI ulcer.
2. Hypotension or worsening hypertension.
3. Acute kidney injury due to inadequate renal perfusion or medication-induced nephrotoxicity.
4. Respiratory distress due to fluid overload or infection.
5. Hepatic dysfunction or failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding from an upper source. He has been diagnosed with a duodenal ulcer, which appears to have slowed down. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/102 to 194/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is currently receiving various medications including anti-hypertensives, antibiotics, and immunosuppressants.

The patient has a history of renal transplant and is on current immunosuppressants. He also has hypertension, depression, and HIV. He is experiencing some complications such as left-sided facial swelling due to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, but his left upper extremity ultrasound showed no obstruction. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, but his creatinine and glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values including liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are also provided.

Plan:
The patient's management plan includes transfusion if his hematocrit (Hct) falls below 25, accessing the femoral line, and rewiring the femoral line to a triple lumen access while searching for alternative access. Antiplatelet medications ASA/Plavix have been held due to acute bleeding, and the patient will resume"

 DEPRESSION
   47-year-old man with GI bleed from upper source.
   GI bleed - Duodenal Ulcer - Appears to have slowed down. Transfuse if
   Hct falls below 25. Access if fem [**Location (un) **]
 needs rewire to triple lumen
   while searching for other access (no PICC given SVC syndrome) .
   ASA/Plavix held while acutely bleeding. Appreciate GI and transplant
   surgery
s help
   Hx of SVC syndrome:  now with left-sided facial swelling but LUEXT US
   patent. Will resume asa/plavix once bleeding under control
 perhaps
   one after the other after 48 hrs stable HCT
   Renal transplant: Continue current immunosuppressants
 issues with
   getting Myfortic- see if wife can bring in or keep on IV [**Name (NI) 5873**].
   Check FK level. Dose per transplant Taper steroids a bit.
   HTN: Lisinopril, Norvasc, Metoprolol which we will increase and add
   Valsartan
   HIV: continue antiretrovirals; resume prophylactic meds once he is able
   to take PO meds
   Depression : continue antidepressants once able to take PO meds

","The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of gastrointestinal bleed from an upper source. He has a duodenal ulcer and is currently stable, but still requires close monitoring in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 150/102 mmHg, heart rate of 93 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.6 g/dL, leukocyte count is 167 K/uL, and platelet count is 182 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 2.2 mg/dL, likely due to renal impairment. Other lab results show normal glucose levels and electrolyte imbalances. The patient has a history of hypertension, depression, and renal transplant. He is currently receiving various medications including antiplatelet agents, immunosuppressants, antiretrovirals, and antidepressants. The patient's current plan involves continuing with current immunosuppressants, checking FK levels, tapering steroids, increasing blood pressure medications, resuming prophylactic medications, and continuing antidepressants once able to take oral medications."
