   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided. I have reviewed the note of Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4021**] and
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  Following partial colectomy
   the patient appears to have lost blood into the abdomen and so for now
   her plavix has been held.  We have been in close contact with the
   general and vascular surgical teams and once her Hct is stable, we will
   restart her Plavix.  Transfusion reaction is being worked up.  She is
   hemodynamically stable  for now, with adequate BP and no CHF on CXR.

","The patient is a 78-year-old female who underwent a right colectomy due to ischemic right proximal colon. She has a history of hypertension and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/31 mmHg to 181/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 15.0 K/uL and a decreased hematocrit (Hct) at 33%. The platelet count is within normal range at 312,000/mm³. The creatinine (Cr) level is 0.4 mg/dL, and the blood glucose level is 194 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes mesenteric ischemia, acute; hypovolemia (volume depletion without shock); and hypertension. The right colon infarction was successfully removed during surgery, and the cause is believed to be emboli/acute thrombosis of known diseased arteries, possibly including jailing of a collateral branch from the celiac to the right colon.

The patient's plan includes IV fluid administration as needed for hypotension, continuation of vancomycin and zosyn for infection prevention, pain control using a PCA"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female who underwent a right colectomy for ischemic right proximal colon. She received 1 liter of normal saline for low urine output with good response. The patient experienced a fever after receiving blood transfusions, raising concerns about a possible transfusion reaction. She has allergies to hydromorphone, Vicodin, and Percocet. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for dry mouth, minimal abdominal pain, and discomfort with deep inspiration. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/31 to 145/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and metoprolol. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Transfusion Reaction: The patient's fever after receiving blood transfusions raises concerns about a potential transfusion reaction. Immediate actions have been taken to address this, including holding the transfusion and awaiting blood bank results.
2. Active Bleeding: The patient's decreased hematocrit level of 33% and increased right flank ecchymoses suggest the possibility of active bleeding. This is further compounded by the patient's recent use of Plavix, a medication that can increase the risk of bleeding.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female who underwent a colectomy due to a right colon infarction and resection. She is currently in the ICU and experiencing several medical complications.

1. Anemia: The patient has a significant drop in hemoglobin levels (Hct) before and after blood transfusions. This indicates ongoing blood loss, likely surgical in nature. The surgical team aims to maintain a target hemoglobin level of 30.

2. Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled high blood pressure despite being on metoprolol and hydralazine. The goal blood pressure is 140s, as per the surgical team's plan.

3. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's cholesterol levels are elevated, but no immediate intervention has been mentioned. It is planned to restart home medications when the patient advances to a diet that allows it.

4. Celiac stent: The patient had a celiac stent placed, and Plavix was restarted per vascular surgery. This indicates a potential concern for arterial disease or stent-related issues.

5. Allergies: The patient has known allergies to hydromorphone, Vicodin (oral), and Percocet (oral).

6. Review of systems: The patient reports mild lower left quadrant pain but denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, confusion, dizziness, or fever.

   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed the note of Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4058**] above
   and agree with the findings and plan of care.
   Patient looks and feels well this AM following right colectomy for
   ischemic colitis.  Initial blood loss appears to have stopped and she
   has responded well to our transfusions.  Plavix has been restarted
   without incident and we
ll also add subcut. Heparin.  She is stable
   enough to go to the floor where her stress steroids can be further
   tapered.
   Time spent in care of the patient: 30min

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female who underwent a right colectomy due to a right colon infarction and resection. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring.

24-hour events include a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) before administration of blood transfusions, which were given due to the patient being febrile with half of the first blood transfused. The patient received one unit of blood in the morning and another unit in the evening. The Hct levels have shown an increasing trend.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/38 to 182/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen delivery and has crackles in the right chest more than the left.

The patient's blood work reveals a white blood cell count of 15.0 K/uL, hemoglobin concentration of 33.7%, platelet count of 208 K/uL, and creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include:
1. Right colon infarction: The patient had no major intraoperative complications during the surgery. The removed infarcted colon was the cause of the"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of colectomy. The patient has experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) before administration of blood products, indicating possible internal bleeding. The patient has received two units of blood transfusions and continues to receive vasopressor support with an increased dose of lopressor.

The patient's vital signs show fever with a maximum temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius. Blood pressure is within the normal range, but there is evidence of hypotension at times. The respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is slightly low at 92%.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,522 mL and output of 745 mL, indicating a positive fluid balance. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 6 mmHg, which is within normal limits.

The patient has received multiple blood products, including packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma. Coagulation studies are within normal limits.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and moderately high glucose level. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, acute mesenteric ischemia, and hypovolemia without shock. The patient also has a history of hypertension.

The patient's current plan includes restarting Plavix when Hct stabilizes, maintaining a goal Hct of 30"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a post-colectomy individual in the ICU. Here is a summary of the information:

1. The patient experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) before administering antibiotics, and they were febrile with half of the initial blood transfusion. Two units of blood were transfused, one in the morning and one in the evening.

2. The patient's Hct levels have been trending upwards since then: 22>21.5>24.6>27.7.

3. The patient's input/output goals are even, negative, with plans to monitor urine output.

4. The vascular team asked to restart Plavix, and surgery restarted it when the patient's Hct was stable, with a goal Hct of 30 and a goal blood pressure of 140s.

5. Lopressor was increased to 10 mg IV q4, and the plan is to likely discharge the patient to the floor in the morning.

6. The patient has allergies to hydromorphone, Vicodin (Oral), Percocet (Oral), and nausea/vomiting.

7. The last dose of antibiotics was given.

8. The patient is currently receiving infusions of hydralazine and metoprolol.

9. Review of systems shows mild left lower quadrant pain. The patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, confusion, d"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female who underwent a colectomy for a right colon infarction and resection. She is currently in the ICU on the second postoperative day. The patient experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin (Hct) before administration of blood transfusions. Her hemodynamic status is stable, with goal even intake and output. Vascular surgery restarted Plavix due to the celiac stent. The patient's coagulation profile is within normal limits. Pain control is being managed with PCA, and she will be evaluated overnight for signs of infection or blood loss. The patient's anemia is likely due to surgical blood loss, and a goal Hct of 30 has been set by surgery. Metoprolol and hydralazine have been started to manage hypertension. The patient's hypercholesterolemia will be addressed when she advances to a regular diet. She is expected to be discharged to the surgical floor today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing surgical site infections or other infections due to her compromised immune system.
2. Bleeding: The patient's recent blood loss during surgery increases her risk of bleeding, especially since she is taking medications that may affect clotting.
3. Thrombosis: The patient's history of known diseased arteries and the use of Plavix may increase her risk of thrombosis or clot formation.
4. Hypot"
