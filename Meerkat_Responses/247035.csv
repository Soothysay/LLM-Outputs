   Assessment and Plan
   31yo male with history of inflammatory bowel disease post-operative day
   #8 from left colectomy was admitted with fever and abdominal pain from
   presumed sepsis related to C. diff infection.
   .
   1. Sepsis
   Patient has evidence of sepsis given elevated temperature, heart rate,
   leukocytosis, and bandemia. Source of infection is likely related to
   recent bowel surgery. Remarkable leukocytosis makes C. diff most
   likely. Additional possibilities though certainly include blood or
   urinary infections given shaking chills, recent foley placement, recent
   hospitalization, etc . . . No evidence of pulmonary infection on
   history, exam, or CXR.
   - follow-up blood, urine, and stool cultures
   - follow-up C. diff assay
   - continue to treat presumptively for C. diff with metronidazole
   - will continue fluoroquinolone to treat presumptively for gram
   negative infection given likely GI source
   - continue to bolus prn with lactated ringer's
   - maintain at least two peripheral IVs
   - patient going to the OR for colectomy
   .
   2. Inflammatory Bowel Disease
   Unclear if patient has Crohn's Disease or ulcerative colitis. Patient
   is s/p left sided hemicolectomy and has been refractory to medical
   therapy. Patient to go to the OR with surgery for likely colectomy.
   - colectomy per surgery
   - dilaudid prn for pain control
   - continue cipro / metronidazole as above
   - will follow-up with surgery in the AM regarding hydroxychloroquine
   .
   3. Depression
   Stable
   - continue citalopram
   .
   4. Iron deficiency Anemia
   Patient has iron deficiency anemia per previous labs in [**3-3**].
   - will follow-up with surgery in the AM regarding restarting ferrous
   sulfate

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of inflammatory bowel disease who underwent a left colectomy and is currently on post-operative day #8. He was admitted to the ICU with fever and abdominal pain, presumed to be related to a Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and has been treated with antibiotics for the suspected C. diff infection.

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated body temperature. His blood work shows leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count and bandemia. The patient also has anemia, with a low hematocrit level. Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes, abnormal electrolyte levels, and low albumin.

The patient's physical examination reveals tenderness in the abdomen and no signs of edema or joint swelling. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's neurologic assessment is normal, but his gait assessment has been deferred.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated temperature, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and bandemia suggest ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis. This is further supported by his recent surgery and the presence of C. diff infection.

2. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): The"

   Assessment and Plan
   31yo male with history of inflammatory bowel disease post-operative day
   #8 from left colectomy was admitted with fever and abdominal pain from
   presumed sepsis related to C. diff infection.
   .
   1. Sepsis: Picture is distributive shock.  Pt s/p 14 L of fluid
   yesterday.  Pt with volume expansion acidosis. Patient has evidence of
   sepsis given elevated temperature, heart rate, leukocytosis, and
   bandemia. Likely secondary to c diff infection as pt came back + for c
   diff.  Pt s/p colectomy with rectal stump and ileostomy.
   -continue IV flagyl and PO Vanco, further discuss with surgery PR vanco
   - follow-up blood, urine
   - bolus PRN with LR
   - maintain at least two peripheral IVs
   -follow lactate q 4hrs
   -follow UOP, mentation, and LFTs to look for end organ ischemia and
   evidence of DIC.  Would check DIC labs if concern for DIC.
   .

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of inflammatory bowel disease who underwent a left colectomy and is currently in the ICU. The patient is experiencing fever and abdominal pain, which are symptoms of sepsis related to a Clostridium difficile infection. 

The patient has received a significant amount of fluid resuscitation with cryo, FFP, and LR, and has undergone surgery involving a total colectomy except for the rectal stump and creation of an ileostomy. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated temperature. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, bandemia, acidosis, and elevated lactate levels, suggesting distributive shock likely secondary to sepsis.

The patient's past medical history includes inflammatory bowel disease, for which he has undergone surgery, and he is also diagnosed with depression and iron deficiency anemia. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and prophylactic medications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening sepsis, organ dysfunction (such as kidney or liver failure), hypoglycemia, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and further complications related to the surgical procedure.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to promptly identify and manage any potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   31yo male with history of inflammatory bowel disease post-operative day
   #8 from left colectomy was admitted with fever and abdominal pain from
   presumed sepsis related to C. diff infection.
   .
   1. C. Diff Sepsis:  Patient hemodynamically stable.  Patient s/p 14 L
   fluid resusitation on admission.  Lactate trending down to 1.3.  WBC
   trending downward.  Patient has had low grade temps overnight to
   100.3.   At this point, patient is clinically improving so have
   deferred PR Vancomycin.  If patient clinically deteriorates, can
   consider IgG therapy.
   -continue IV flagyl and PO Vanco
   - follow-up blood, urine
   - bolus PRN with LR
   - follow UOP
   .
   2. Inflammatory Bowel Disease: likely Crohn's Disease.  Patient is now
   s/p colectomy with rectal stump and end ileostomy.  Patient
   peritoneal fluid sample has grown sparce GPCs.  Will follow for
   speciation.  As patient is post op, concern for possible peritonitis.
   Patient
s INR has trended downward with Vitamin K admin.
   - Continue Vancomycin 1g [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue dilaudid pca, toradol
   - ativan to assist with anxiety
   - continue PO Vanco / metronidazole
   .
   3. Hypoglycemia;  Patient
s blood sugars have been generally > 100.
   - Monitor BS
   4.  Respiratory:  Patient with 3L oxygen requirement.  Patient with
   bibasilar crackles on examination, likely either related to pulmonary
   edema versus ateletasis.  Given patient
s post-op nature, will defer
   diuresis and place IS at bedside.
   - IS at bedside
   - OOB to chair, ambulate as tolerated
   5. Depression
   - continue citalopram
   .
   6. Iron deficiency Anemia:  HCT stable post operatively.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] HCT
   7. Elevated Total Bilirubin:  Patient
s AP has been trending upward
   over past several days, Direct Bilirubin also trending upward,
   concerning for cholestatic pattern.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Consider RUQ u/s

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of inflammatory bowel disease who is currently in the ICU. He underwent a left colectomy and was admitted with fever and abdominal pain due to sepsis related to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient received fluid resuscitation and is showing improvement, with decreasing lactate levels and a downward trend in white blood cell count. Antibiotics have been administered, and the patient's blood, urine, and peritoneal fluid samples are being monitored. 

The patient has a history of inflammatory bowel disease, likely Crohn's disease, and has undergone surgery with a rectal stump and end ileostomy. There is concern for possible peritonitis, and the patient's peritoneal fluid sample has grown sparse Gram-positive cocci. Vitamin K has been given to address the elevated international normalized ratio (INR). 

The patient's blood sugars have been stable above 100 mg/dL, but he is still receiving maintenance fluids. He requires supplemental oxygen and has bibasilar crackles on examination, which may indicate pulmonary edema or atelectasis. 

Other conditions being managed include depression, iron deficiency anemia, and elevated total bilirubin. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are being monitored, and a root cause for the elevated bilirubin is being investigated. 

ICU care includes nutrition via nasogastric tube, glycemic control"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, who is currently in the ICU post left colectomy. He was admitted with fever and abdominal pain due to sepsis related to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has received fluid resuscitation and is showing signs of improvement, with a decreasing lactate level. His white blood cell count is also trending downward. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), blood pressure ranging from 105/72 to 117/103 mmHg, heart rate of 111 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and receiving IV fluids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. Diff Sepsis: Although the patient's condition appears to be improving with appropriate treatment, there is still a risk of worsening sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and lab parameters is necessary to detect any signs of deterioration.
2. Peritonitis: Given the patient's history of inflammatory bowel disease and recent surgery, there is a concern for possible peritonitis. Monitoring of abdominal tenderness and assessing peritoneal fluid culture results will help in determining the presence of peritonitis.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been experiencing low blood sugars despite receiving maintenance fluids. Frequent monitoring of glucose levels and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, who underwent a left colectomy and is currently on post-operative day #8. He was admitted with fever and abdominal pain due to presumed sepsis related to a Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has received fluid resuscitation and is being treated with IV flagyl and PO Vancomycin. His condition is stable, with trending down lactate levels and decreasing white blood cell count. However, there are concerns regarding possible peritonitis due to the presence of sparse Gram-positive cocci in his peritoneal fluid sample. Other ongoing concerns include hypoglycemia, respiratory issues with bibasilar crackles on examination, depression, iron deficiency anemia, and elevated total bilirubin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. Diff Sepsis: The patient's current condition suggests a potential complication of sepsis due to C. diff infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent further complications.

2. Peritonitis: Given the patient's history of inflammatory bowel disease and recent surgery, there is a concern for possible peritonitis, which can be a serious and potentially life-threatening complication.

3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugars have been generally above 100, indicating a potential risk of hypoglycemia. Monitoring blood sugar levels regularly is important to prevent any adverse effects.

He was admitted with fever and abdominal pain due to presumed sepsis related to a Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has received fluid resuscitation and is clinically improving, so the decision has been made to defer PR Vancomycin. The patient will continue with IV Flagyl and PO Vancomycin.

2. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (likely Crohn's Disease): The patient has undergone a colectomy with a rectal stump and end ileostomy. The growth of sparse Gram-positive cocci in the peritoneal fluid sample suggests a possible peritonitis. Regular follow-up and monitoring are necessary to prevent complications associated with the underlying bowel disease.
