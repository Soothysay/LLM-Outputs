","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 24-year-old female with a chief complaint of fever. She has been experiencing fevers, passed melanotic stools, and had hematemesis. Her white blood cell count is expected to recover within the week.
- The patient has allergies to cefepime and has been receiving multiple antibiotics and other medications.
- Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 105.5 degrees Celsius, current temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 90-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/44 mmHg to 151/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with a total input of 6,330 mL and output of 1,400 mL since 12 AM.
- The patient is receiving pantoprazole infusion, meperidine, and other ICU medications.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever.
- Flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other measurements.
- Physical examination findings include sinus rhythm, not assessed peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and no abnormalities noted.
- Lab results show low white blood cell count (28 K/uL), low hemoglobin (9.9 g/dL), low platelet count (45 K/uL), normal creatinine (0.6 mg/dL), normal TCO2 (25), low calcium (7.4 mg/dL), and other abnormalities in lab values.
- Microbiology results indicate an infection caused by Enterococcus.
- Assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition, altered mental status, coagulopathy, hypocalcemia, leukemia, rash, neutropenia, and other conditions.
- ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and VAP precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The presence of fever and positive microbiology results suggest an ongoing infection. The patient's low white blood cell count also indicates an increased risk of infection.
2. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and coagulopathy may increase the risk of bleeding. The history of hematemesis could be a manifestation of this complication.
3. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium level can lead to symptoms such as muscle cramps, cardiac arrhythmias, and tetany.
4. Leukemia: The patient's diagnosis of leukemia puts her at risk for complications associated with this condition, such as bone marrow suppression, increased susceptibility to infections, and bleeding tendencies.
5. Neutropenia: The patient's low white blood cell count increases her risk of developing infections.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of complications.
8. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory rate is on the higher end of the normal range, and she is receiving supplemental oxygen. Close monitoring of her respiratory status is essential to prevent respiratory distress.
9. Malnutrition: The patient's altered nutrition status may contribute to delayed wound healing, weakened immune system, and poor overall recovery.

Please note that these potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

 NEUTROPENIA
   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile,
   and having hematemesis and melena consistent with acute GI bleed.
   GI BLEED
   Acute bleed in the setting of neutropenia and leukopenia, as well as
   thrombocytopenia. This setting both increases bleeding risk from
   ordinary causes of GIB (e.g., PUD, AVM, etc); and also raises the
   question of infectious causes (e.g., HSV, CMV; or an erosive
   esophagitis). He is well covered for most microbial causes, although he
   does continue to have VRE growing through -antibiotics that should
   cover it, suggesting an ongoing source for bacterial infection.
   - PPI bolus+drip
   - crossmatch 4 units, transfusing 2 units PRBCs
   - 2 units platelets
   - blood products in setting of fever is suboptimal; will give IVF
   boluses if fever rising and hemodynamics stable
   - one unit FFP if INR down
   - GI consult much appreciated; appreciate prelim recs of watchful
   waiting, PPI, blood product support, trying to avoid endoscopy in the
   setting of profound neutropenia
   - q4h Hcts
   - HSV and CMV viral loads
   FEVER AND RASH
   Patient has neutropenic fever for which he has been on a lengthy course
   of multiple antimicrobials including wide antibacterial and antifungal
   coverage. Of particular concern today is the apparently new emergence
   of a morbilliform rash which would be consistent with a drug rash and
   suggests the possibility of drug fever. Aztreonam is one reasonable
   suspect; he has been on this medicine for a sustained period, giving
   time for a T-cell driven primary response to develop. Given ongoing
   VRE, VRE sepsis is also a reasonable source for fevers, although the
   high fevers are not accompanied by septic physiology, so the fever
   would seem out of proportion. Further discussion of infection is below.
   - tylenol if not having active bleeding
   - sponge baths, cooling blankets, other efforts to cool if fever
   continues to go to these high levels
   - changing aztreonam and substituting meropenem per ID recs, much
   appreciate ID service ongoing involvement and counsel
   ONGOING INFECTION
   VRE has been growing from Mr [**Known lastname 4258**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6462**] for many days now despite
   several different approaches to treating it including daptomycin,
   linezolid, and now daptomycin + gentamicin; nonetheless, gram positive
   cocci, most likely continued VRE infection, are growing out of bottles
   drawn as recently as this morning. Clot in cephalic vein must be
   presumed to be now seeded with VRE. Though previous TTE was negative,
   endocarditis is increasingly likely, although his peripherhal petichiae
   are not entirely c/w septic emboli.
   - continue dapto+gent
   - continue voriconazole and flagyl
   - as above, stopping aztreonam and substituting meropenem
   - if infectious signs continue, consider TTE; would not change acute
   mgmt
   - given cephalic clot, cover long-term for endovascular infection
   AML
   On clinical trial protocol. Recent bone marrow reportedly shows
   remission. Currently on filgrastim.
   - will increase filgrastim from 300 sc daily to 480 sc daily
   - appreciate heme/onc involvement in this phase of his care
   DIARRHEA
   Was on bowel regimen prn and loperamide prn on the floor. Have held
   both. Monitor stools for guaiac. History of diarrhea before this acute
   event raises the question of whether this might have been the result of
   then-undetected GI bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was admitted for chemotherapy. He is currently profoundly neutropenic and febrile, with recent hematemesis and melena indicative of acute gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hypoalbuminemia. He has an ongoing infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), despite multiple antibiotic treatments. The patient also has a rash consistent with drug-induced hypersensitivity. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal coverage. His vital signs include a temperature of 105.5°F, blood pressure of 105/57 mmHg, heart rate of 90 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's mental status is altered but not delirious. He is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient's melena and hematemesis suggest acute gastrointestinal bleeding. This could lead to hypotension and shock if not managed promptly.
2. Infection: The patient has an ongoing infection with VRE, which is resistant to multiple antibiotics. There is a concern for sepsis and endovascular infection.

 NEUTROPENIA
   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacterimia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed.
   # GI BLEED
   Acute bleed in the setting of neutropenia and leukopenia, as well as
   thrombocytopenia. This setting both increases bleeding risk from
   ordinary causes of GIB (e.g., PUD, AVM, etc); and also raises the
   question of infectious causes (e.g., HSV, CMV; or an erosive
   esophagitis). He is well covered for most microbial causes, including
   HSV at his current dose of acyclovir. CMV viral load was recently
   negative.
   - PPI bolus+drip
   - q6h checks of Hct, plts, coags
   - active T+S and transfuse for Hct less than 25
   - transfuse plts for less than 50 given active bleed
   - Fibrinogen for increases in INR
   - blood products in setting of fever is suboptimal; will give IVF
   boluses if fever rising and hemodynamics stable
   - GI consult much appreciated; appreciate prelim recs of watchful
   waiting, PPI, blood product support, trying to avoid endoscopy in the
   setting of profound neutropenia
   - HSV serologies
   # FEVER AND RASH
   Patient has neutropenic fever for which he has been on a lengthy course
   of multiple antimicrobials including wide antibacterial and antifungal
   coverage. Of particular concern today is the apparently new emergence
   of a morbilliform rash which would be consistent with a drug rash and
   suggests the possibility of drug fever. Aztreonam is one reasonable
   suspect; he has been on this medicine for a sustained period, giving
   time for a T-cell driven primary response to develop. Given ongoing
   VRE, VRE sepsis is also a reasonable source for fevers, although the
   high fevers are not accompanied by septic physiology, so the fever
   would seem out of proportion
   - Tylenol for T>102 if not having active bleeding
   - sponge baths, cooling blankets, other efforts to cool
   - changing aztreonam and substituting meropenem per ID recs
   - ID recs
   # ONGOING INFECTION
   VRE has been growing from cultures for many days now despite treatment
   with daptomycin, linezolid, and now daptomycin + gentamicin;
   nonetheless, gram positive cocci, most likely continued VRE infection,
   are growing out of bottles drawn as recently as [**5-19**]. Clot in cephalic
   vein must be presumed to be now seeded with VRE.  [**Month (only) 8**] be chronically
   seeding from GI source. Though previous TTE was negative, endocarditis
   is increasingly likely, that said a repeat negative TTE would not rule
   out and TEE would not be pursued for the same reasons as EGD.
   - continue dapto+gent
   - continue voriconazole and flagyl
   - as above, stopped aztreonam and started meropenem overnight
   - given cephalic clot, will need long-term ABX for endovascular
   infection
   # AML
   On clinical trial protocol. Recent bone marrow reportedly shows
   remission. Currently on filgrastim. Per his oncologist, he is entering
   the window during which counts usually recover, his bone marrow biopsy
   shows that Tx has been effective in eliminating AML.  Likely that he
   will be able to clear infection when counts recover.
   - increased filgrastim from 300 sc daily to 480 sc daily
   - appreciate heme/onc involvement in this phase of his care
   # DIARRHEA
   Was on bowel regimen prn and loperamide prn on the floor. These have
   been stopped. Monitor stools for guaiac. Diarrhea may explain his high
   requirements for potassium repletion

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who presented to the hospital for chemotherapy. He is now experiencing fever, hypotension, and evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (hematemesis and melena), which indicates an acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has profound neutropenia and leukopenia, making him at high risk for bleeding from ordinary causes as well as infectious causes.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors. He has ongoing VRE bacteremia despite treatment with multiple antibiotics, and there is concern for a possible drug fever due to a morbilliform rash. The patient also has a clot in the cephalic vein, raising the suspicion of endovascular infection, although a repeat TTE was negative. Additionally, the patient has diarrhea, which may contribute to his high requirements for potassium repletion.

Based on the patient's presentation and ongoing infections, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. GI bleed: The patient's acute upper GI bleed is a significant concern due to his neutropenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. This increases the risk of bleeding from ordinary causes as well as infectious causes such as erosive esophagitis or infections like HSV or CMV.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 4258**] has received 3 units pRBC's overnight and platelet transfusion
   too. He has remained febrile despite tylenol and antibiotics. He denies
   abdominal pain or emesis.
   Exam notable for Tm of 105 BP 108/66 HR of 94 RR of 30 with sats of
   100% on 2lpm O2 . His MM are dry and crusted. His lung fields are clear
   and there is minimal ankle edema. He does have a diffuse maculopapular
   rash. Labs notable for WBC 0.1 K, HCT 26.8 , plts of 28K, K+  2.9, Cr
   0.7 . CXR with clear lung fields and no effusions.
   Agree with plan to follow Hct / plts closely and relpete with pRBC/
   platelet transfusions as appropriate .he has poor IV access and his
   needs have escalated with ongoing GI bleed. Despite peristent
   bacteremia, he will need CVL access for short term to keep up with Hct/
   plt support. He will receive tylenol/ demerol for fevers and hopefully
   with immune reconstitution, will have clearance of bacteremia. Follow
   up echo to be ordered this week to r/ o endocarditis. Antibiotics to
   continue per ID recs.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has been admitted to the ICU for chemotherapy treatment. The patient is profoundly neutropenic and febrile with persistent vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. He also has hematemesis and melena consistent with acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. GI bleed: The patient has experienced hematemesis and melena, indicating a significant upper GI bleed. This could lead to hypotension, shock, and potential organ failure if not managed promptly.

2. Infection: The patient is neutropenic and febrile, suggesting a high risk of infection. Despite being on multiple antimicrobials, the patient still has ongoing VRE bacteremia. There is also a concern for drug fever due to the recent emergence of a morbilliform rash.

3. Endovascular infection: The presence of a clot in the cephalic vein raises the concern for endovascular infection, particularly endocarditis. The patient has been on prolonged antibiotic therapy, which further increases the risk.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, putting him at risk for bleeding complications. This is particularly concerning in the setting of GI bleed and potential endovascular infection.

5. Hypocalcemia: The patient"

   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacterimia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed.
   # GI BLEED:  Unclear cause, although most likely would be infectious
   esophagitis (e.g. HSV, CMV) in the settting of profound
   immunosuppression.  Other potential causes would include ulcer.
   Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy unless he is unstable and/or
   counts recover.
   - f/u Hct this morning after 3 units of blood
   - continue PPI gtt
   - continue q6h checks of Hct, platelets, and coags
   - transfuse to Hct >25, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**]
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection.  Blood
   cultures growing this daily 5/8/5/16.  Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**] -
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] -
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] -
   metronidazole [**4-21**] -
   voriconazole [**5-2**] -
   As above, currently on daptomycin + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl. Drug fever is also a concern.
   Patient has neutropenic fever for which he has been on a lengthy course
   of multiple antimicrobials including wide antibacterial and antifungal
   coverage. Of particular concern today is the apparently new emergence
   of a morbilliform rash which would be consistent with a drug rash and
   suggests the possibility of drug fever. Aztreonam is one reasonable
   suspect; he has been on this medicine for a sustained period, giving
   time for a T-cell driven primary response to develop. Given ongoing
   VRE, VRE sepsis is also a reasonable source for fevers, although the
   high fevers are not accompanied by septic physiology, so the fever
   would seem out of proportion
   - Tylenol for T>102 if not having active bleeding
   - sponge baths, cooling blankets, other efforts to cool
   - changing aztreonam and substituting meropenem per ID recs
   - ID recs
   # ONGOING INFECTION
   VRE has been growing from cultures for many days now despite treatment
   with daptomycin, linezolid, and now daptomycin + gentamicin;
   nonetheless, gram positive cocci, most likely continued VRE infection,
   are growing out of bottles drawn as recently as [**5-19**]. Clot in cephalic
   vein must be presumed to be now seeded with VRE.  [**Month (only) 8**] be chronically
   seeding from GI source. Though previous TTE was negative, endocarditis
   is increasingly likely, that said a repeat negative TTE would not rule
   out and TEE would not be pursued for the same reasons as EGD.
   - continue dapto+gent
   - continue voriconazole and flagyl
   - as above, stopped aztreonam and started meropenem overnight
   - given cephalic clot, will need long-term ABX for endovascular
   infection
   # AML
   On clinical trial protocol. Recent bone marrow reportedly shows
   remission. Currently on filgrastim. Per his oncologist, he is entering
   the window during which counts usually recover, his bone marrow biopsy
   shows that Tx has been effective in eliminating AML.  Likely that he
   will be able to clear infection when counts recover.
   - increased filgrastim from 300 sc daily to 480 sc daily
   - appreciate heme/onc involvement in this phase of his care
   # DIARRHEA
   Was on bowel regimen prn and loperamide prn on the floor. These have
   been stopped. Monitor stools for guaiac. Diarrhea may explain his high
   requirements for potassium repletion

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the hospital for chemotherapy due to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He is now presenting with profound neutropenia and fever with persistent Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. The patient also experienced hematemesis and melena, indicating an acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The cause of the GI bleed is unclear, but it is most likely due to infectious esophagitis, possibly caused by Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) or Cytomegalovirus (CMV), given the patient's immunosuppressed state.

The patient has received multiple antimicrobial treatments, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals, but continues to have ongoing VRE infection. There is also a concern for drug fever, as the patient has developed a morbilliform rash, which is consistent with a drug rash. The patient's fever may be out of proportion to the ongoing VRE sepsis, raising concerns for endocarditis, although further testing such as transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may not be pursued due to the patient's unstable condition.

The patient's anemia is acute and secondary to blood loss from the GI bleed. His altered mental status is not consistent with delirium. He also has coagulopathy, hypocalcemia, and neutropenia. The patient's ongoing infection, specifically the V"

   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacterimia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed.
   # GI BLEED:  Possible causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV
   or CMV in the settting of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential
   causes would include ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy
   unless he is unstable and/or counts recover.
   - f/u Hct this morning after 3 units of blood
   - continue PPI gtt
   - continue q4h checks of Hct, platelets, and coags
   - transfuse to Hct >25, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection.  The source
   of his bacteremia (despite adequate antibiotics) is not clear.  He does
   have a history of superficial cephalic vein clot that could be seeded.
   He has had a TTE that was negative for clot a week ago, but this could
   be another source if he has a new/occult clot.  Finally, given GI bleed
   would need to consider an intra-abdominal source (he had a history of
   typhlitis last month).   Blood cultures continue to grow daily VRE
   [**5-11**]-/[**5-19**].  Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]

   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**] -
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] -
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] -
   metronidazole [**4-21**] -
   voriconazole [**5-2**] -
   As above, currently on daptomycin + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, and we will keep this in mind as we
   investigate and treat his VRE bacteremia..
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort
   - repeat TTE today; will pursue TEE when able to lie flat and counts
   have improved
   - would like to pursue CT torso when able to lie flat; KUB in the
   meantime
   - continue daptomycin and gentamycin for VRE
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight most
   likely represented volume overload.  He did receive multiple blood
   products and a bolus just prior to this and was considerably net
   positive for the day.  Much improved now s/p diuresis.
   - check CVP to evaluate volume status
   - consider gentle diuresis if volume up
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently admitted to the ICU for chemotherapy treatment. He is profoundly neutropenic and febrile with persistent vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. The patient also has signs of acute gastrointestinal bleeding, including hematemesis and melena. Other potential causes of the GI bleed include infectious esophagitis or peptic ulcer disease. 

The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status. His laboratory results indicate pancytopenia (low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and low platelet count), anemia, hypocalcemia, coagulopathy, and leukocytosis with a predominance of lymphocytes. Blood cultures have grown VRE.

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI bleed: Possible causes include infectious esophagitis or peptic ulcer disease. No plan for endoscopy unless the patient is unstable and/or counts recover. Continue PPI gtt and monitor Hct, platelets, and coags. Transfuse to Hct >25, fibrinogen >100.
2. Fever: Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection. Continue daptomycin and gentamicin for VRE. Consider an intra-abdominal source such as typhlitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock. The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with episodes of flash pulmonary edema, repeated pulmonary edema, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia, and fever. He required non-invasive ventilation, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of ARDS and repeated pulmonary edema, there is a risk of developing pneumonia due to the presence of infection and impaired lung function.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been intubated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP, which can lead to further respiratory complications.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's chronic kidney disease and fluid management in the ICU may increase the risk of AKI. Close monitoring of renal function is crucial.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile indicates abnormalities, suggesting a higher risk of bleeding or clotting disorders.
5. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium level requires attention as it can lead to muscle cramps"

   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacterimia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed.
   # GI BLEED:  Possible causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV
   or CMV in the settting of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential
   causes would include ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy
   unless he is unstable and/or counts recover.
   - f/u Hct this morning after 3 units of blood
   - continue PPI gtt
   - continue q4h checks of Hct, platelets, and coags
   - transfuse to Hct >25, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection.  The source
   of his bacteremia (despite adequate antibiotics) is not clear.  He does
   have a history of superficial cephalic vein clot that could be seeded.
   He has had a TTE that was negative for clot a week ago, but this could
   be another source if he has a new/occult clot.  Finally, given GI bleed
   would need to consider an intra-abdominal source (he had a history of
   typhlitis last month).   Blood cultures continue to grow daily VRE
   [**5-11**]-/[**5-19**].  Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**] -
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] -
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] -
   metronidazole [**4-21**] -
   voriconazole [**5-2**] -
   As above, currently on daptomycin + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, and we will keep this in mind as we
   investigate and treat his VRE bacteremia..
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort
   - repeat TTE today; will pursue TEE when able to lie flat and counts
   have improved
   - would like to pursue CT torso when able to lie flat; KUB in the
   meantime
   - continue daptomycin and gentamycin for VRE
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight most
   likely represented volume overload.  He did receive multiple blood
   products and a bolus just prior to this and was considerably net
   positive for the day.  Much improved now s/p diuresis.
   - check CVP to evaluate volume status
   - consider gentle diuresis if volume up
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile with persistent vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia.
- He also has hematemesis and melena consistent with an acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.
- Possible causes of the GI bleed include infectious esophagitis (e.g., HSV or CMV) in the setting of profound immunosuppression, as well as ulcers.
- The patient's fever is most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, with the source of bacteremia not clear.
- He has a history of superficial cephalic vein clot, and there is a possibility of a new/occult clot.
- The patient received chemotherapy for AML and is currently on daptomycin, meropenem, gentamicin, voriconazole, and metronidazole.
- He has a history of typhlitis last month, which could be another potential source of infection.
- The patient's laboratory results show anemia, acute pancytopenia, altered mental status, coagulopathy, hypocalcemia, and leukopenia.
- The patient's imaging and microbiology results indicate a VRE infection.
- The patient's assessment and plan include pulmonary edema, pancytopenia, anemia, fever, altered nutrition, altered mental status, coagulopathy, hypocalcemia, and leukemia.
- The patient has been admitted to the ICU with the following interventions: non-invasive ventilation, trans-thoracic echo, and chest X-ray (CXR).
- His vital signs include a temperature of 103.9°F, heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure of 117/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient's physical examination reveals no distress, normal heart sounds, clear lung fields, soft abdomen with no guarding or rebound tenderness, and no extremity edema.
- The patient's laboratory values indicate anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.
- The patient's imaging studies show no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI), and his disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient has presented with hematemesis and melena, which indicate an acute gastrointestinal bleed. Possible causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g., HSV or CMV) and ulcers. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic status, and ongoing bleeding risk is essential.
2. VRE Infection: The patient has persistent VRE bacteremia despite adequate antibiotic therapy. This indicates a potential antibiotic resistance and the need for further evaluation of the source of infection. Continued surveillance of the patient's vital signs and laboratory results is necessary.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient exhibits signs of pancytopenia, including anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. This can be attributed to the patient's underlying condition (AML) and the administration of chemotherapy. Regular monitoring of blood counts and prompt management of any complications related to pancytopenia are required.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient demonstrates evidence of coagulopathy, as indicated by the low fibrinogen level"

   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed, now requiring Bi-PAP for pulmonary
   edema and shortness of breath.
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight, CXR
   consistent with flash pulmonary edema in setting of  decreased ejection
   fraction.
   - BiPAP as above
   - DNR/DNI
   - gentle diuresis with lasix as tolerated
   #Tachycardia: HR up to 150
s this afternoon, trial of IVF today given
   that patient may be dry due to lasix  as well as IV lopressor. Tele
   shows sinus tach,.
   # GI BLEED:  Hct still trending downward although recent values include
   post-transfusion shift, total recent loss not clear and grossly he
   reportedly has not been putting out as much melanotic stool. Possible
   causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV or CMV in the settting
   of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential causes would include
   ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy unless he is
   unstable and/or counts recover.
   - continue Q6 Hct checks; last Hct this morning 29.6
   - continue PPI gtt
   - transfuse to Hct >30, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, now shown to
   be daptomycin resistant.  At this point, a trial of linezolid will help
   clarify whether his ongoing infection is really simply the product of
   inadequate treatment, or whether the evolution of the microbe is the
   product of an inadequately treated source. The source of his bacteremia
   is unclear; as prior, cephalic vein clot, endocarditis not seen by TTE,
   or GI source given past typhlitis are top suspects.  Blood cultures
   continue to grow daily VRE.
   Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]; [**5-22**]-present
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**]
 [**5-22**]
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] - present
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] - present
   metronidazole [**4-21**] - present
   voriconazole [**5-2**] - present
   As above, currently on linezolid + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, although we had hoped that this might have
   been from aztreonam and given that his fevers continue after d/c
   this medication and without significant worsening of his morbilliform
   rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort, though low dose given that
   meperedine with linezolid can lower seizure threshold
   - continue Linezolid as above, Gentamycin d/c
d per ID recs
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation may be partly demand-related in setting of
   tachycardia overnight. Difficult to intervene at this point given the
   severity of his GI bleed, which would likely be life-threatening in the
   face of heparin. He is currently DNR/DNI.
   - support Hct >30
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - trend enzymes for prognostic purposes
   - Continue captopril for afterload reduction
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently admitted to the ICU for chemotherapy. He is profoundly neutropenic and febrile with persistent vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. The patient has experienced hematemesis and melena, indicating acute gastrointestinal bleeding. He also has pulmonary edema and requires BiPAP for respiratory support. The patient's ejection fraction has decreased from 55% to 25-30%, and there are wall motion abnormalities suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction. His white blood cell count is very low, and he is at risk for infection. The patient has a rash, possibly due to a drug reaction or an infection. He is on multiple antibiotics and antifungals, including linezolid for the VRE infection. The patient's condition is complex and includes pulmonary edema, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, fever, altered mental status, coagulopathy, hypocalcemia, and leukemia. He is DNR/DNI.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's worsening hypoxia and tachypnea indicate respiratory distress. The use of BiPAP may help improve oxygenation.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which could be due to fever, hypoxia, or other underlying conditions. IV fluids and vasop"

","The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently in the ICU due to various medical complications. The patient's conditions include:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema, which resolved with the administration of lasix. However, there is ongoing concern for recurrent pulmonary edema.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient is profoundly neutropenic and febrile with persistent vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia.

3. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss from gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The source of the GI bleed could be infectious esophagitis or an ulcer.

4. Fever: The patient's fever is most likely secondary to the ongoing VRE infection, which is now shown to be daptomycin-resistant. A trial of linezolid will be given to clarify the treatment response.

5. Decreased Ejection Fraction (EF): The patient has a significantly decreased EF of 25-30%, with evidence of myocardial ischemia/infarction on echocardiogram. This is concerning, especially given the severity of the GI bleed.

   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed, now requiring Bi-PAP for pulmonary
   edema and shortness of breath.
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight, CXR
   consistent with flash pulmonary edema in setting of  decreased ejection
   fraction.
   - BiPAP as above
   - DNR/DNI
   - gentle diuresis with lasix as tolerated
   #Tachycardia: HR up to 150
s this afternoon, trial of IVF today given
   that patient may be dry due to lasix  as well as IV lopressor. Tele
   shows sinus tach,.
   # GI BLEED:  Hct still trending downward although recent values include
   post-transfusion shift, total recent loss not clear and grossly he
   reportedly has not been putting out as much melanotic stool. Possible
   causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV or CMV in the settting
   of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential causes would include
   ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy unless he is
   unstable and/or counts recover.
   - continue Q6 Hct checks; last Hct this morning 29.6
   - continue PPI gtt
   - transfuse to Hct >30, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, now shown to
   be daptomycin resistant.  At this point, a trial of linezolid will help
   clarify whether his ongoing infection is really simply the product of
   inadequate treatment, or whether the evolution of the microbe is the
   product of an inadequately treated source. The source of his bacteremia
   is unclear; as prior, cephalic vein clot, endocarditis not seen by TTE,
   or GI source given past typhlitis are top suspects.  Blood cultures
   continue to grow daily VRE.
   Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]; [**5-22**]-present
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**]
 [**5-22**]
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] - present
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] - present
   metronidazole [**4-21**] - present
   voriconazole [**5-2**] - present
   As above, currently on linezolid + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, although we had hoped that this might have
   been from aztreonam and given that his fevers continue after d/c
   this medication and without significant worsening of his morbilliform
   rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort, though low dose given that
   meperedine with linezolid can lower seizure threshold
   - continue Linezolid as above, Gentamycin d/c
d per ID recs
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation may be partly demand-related in setting of
   tachycardia overnight. Difficult to intervene at this point given the
   severity of his GI bleed, which would likely be life-threatening in the
   face of heparin. He is currently DNR/DNI.
   - support Hct >30
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - trend enzymes for prognostic purposes
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was admitted for chemotherapy. He is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile with persistent vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. The patient has hematemesis and melena consistent with acute gastrointestinal bleeding and requires non-invasive ventilation due to pulmonary edema and shortness of breath. His ejection fraction has decreased from 55% to 25-30%, and there are signs of myocardial ischemia/infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight indicate a potential respiratory compromise, which can lead to further pulmonary edema and decreased oxygenation.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently above 100 beats per minute, indicating possible cardiac stress and increased risk of arrhythmias.
3. GI Bleed: The patient's hematemesis and melena suggest ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to anemia, hypotension, and potential shock.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's low fibrinogen levels indicate a potential bleeding tendency, increasing the risk of hemorrhage.
5. Fever: The patient's persistent fever despite antibiotic therapy suggests an ongoing infection, most likely due to VRE bacteremia.
6. Decreased Ejection Fraction: The significant decrease in the patient's e"

   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacterimia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed.
   # GI BLEED:  Hct still trending downward although recent values include
   post-transfusion shift, total recent loss not clear and grossly he
   reportedly has not been putting out as much melanotic stool. Possible
   causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV or CMV in the settting
   of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential causes would include
   ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy unless he is
   unstable and/or counts recover.
   - f/u Hct this morning after 3 units of blood
   - continue PPI gtt
   - continue q4h checks of Hct, platelets, and coags
   - transfuse to Hct >25, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, now shown to
   be daptomycin resistant.  At this point, a trial of linezolid will help
   clarify whether his ongoing infection is really simply the product of
   inadequate treatment, or whether the evolution of the microbe is the
   product of an inadequately treated source. The source of his bacteremia
   is unclear; as prior, cephalic vein clot, endocarditis not seen by TTE,
   or GI source given past typhlitis are top suspects.  Blood cultures
   continue to grow daily VRE.
   Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]
   Micafungin [**Date range (1) 6505**]
   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]; [**5-22**]-present
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**]
 [**5-22**]
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] - present
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] - present
   metronidazole [**4-21**] - present
   voriconazole [**5-2**] - present
   As above, currently on linezolid + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, although we had hoped that this might have
   been from aztreonam and given that his fevers continue after d/c
   this medication and without significant worsening of his morbilliform
   rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort
   - would like to pursue CT torso when able to lie flat; KUB in the
   meantime
   - continue daptomycin and gentamycin for VRE
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation may be partly demand-related in setting of
   tachycardia overnight. Difficult to intervene at this point given the
   severity of his GI bleed, which would likely be life-threatening in the
   face of heparin. He is currently DNR/DNI.
   - support Hct >30
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - trend enzymes for prognostic purposes
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight,
   likely [**2-6**] flash pulmonary edema, associated with decreased ejection
   fraction.
   - BiPAP as above
   - DNR/DNI
   - gentle diuresis as tolerated
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications including:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient experienced an episode of flash pulmonary edema, which was resolved with lasix and BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) therapy.

2. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss from a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The cause of the GI bleed could be infectious esophagitis (e.g., HSV or CMV), ulcer, or other factors.

3. Fever: The patient is febrile with ongoing bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The source of bacteremia is unclear, with possible sources including a central line clot, endocarditis, or a GI source.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy indicated by low platelets and coagulation factors. This may be due to sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

5. Hypocalcemia: The patient has low calcium levels, which may be related to the coagulopathy or other factors.

6. Leukemia: The patient has AML and is undergoing chemotherapy with cytarabine +/- clofarabine. His remission status is reported as positive on recent bone marrow biopsy"

s this afternoon, trial of IVF today given
   that patient may be dry due to lasix  as well as IV lopressor. Tele
   shows sinus tach often occuring in the setting of fevers/rigors, but
   unclear why patient still having worsening sinus tach throughout the
   course of the day.  Tachycardia could be related to heart failure and
   worsening EF.  Pt maintaining blood pressures.
   - Consider standing low dose metoprolol for sinus tach, given reduced
   EF

   rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort, though low dose given that
   meperedine with linezolid can lower seizure threshold
   - continue Linezolid as above, Gentamycin d/c
d per ID recs
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation may be partly demand-related in setting of
   tachycardia overnight. Difficult to intervene at this point given the
   severity of his GI bleed, which would likely be life-threatening in the
   face of heparin. He is currently DNR/DNI.
   - support Hct >30
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - trend enzymes for prognostic purposes
   - Continue captopril for afterload reduction, titrate up as BP
   tolerates
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old man admitted for chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile with persistent vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. He also has hematemesis and melena consistent with acute gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient requires BiPAP for pulmonary edema and shortness of breath. He is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient experienced an episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight, with a chest X-ray consistent with flash pulmonary edema in the setting of decreased ejection fraction. BiPAP has been initiated.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate has been up to 150, and it is unclear why he is still experiencing sinus tachycardia throughout the day. This could be related to heart failure and worsening ejection fraction. Standing low-dose metoprolol is being considered for sinus tachycardia, given reduced ejection fraction.
3. GI Bleed: The patient has a trend of decreasing hematocrit values, indicating ongoing blood loss. Possible causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g., HSV or CMV) or an ulcer. GI recommendations are pending.
4. Fever: The patient's fever is most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, which is now shown to be daptomycin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in the setting of new acute myeloid leukemia (AML), post chemotherapy. The patient has been experiencing ongoing fevers and rigors, sinus tachycardia, and decreased oxygen saturation. A chest x-ray revealed a diffuse bilateral infiltrative pulmonary process, which continues to worsen, more so on the right side. The patient was placed on BiPAP. The patient's DNR/DNI status should be continued, and full care will be continued in other respects. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PULMONARY EDEMA: The patient's chest x-ray shows signs of pulmonary edema, indicating fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can compromise oxygen exchange and lead to respiratory distress.
2. PANCYTOPENIA: The patient's lab results indicate low white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), indicating pancytopenia. This can increase the risk of infections, anemia, and bleeding complications.
3. ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING): The patient's history of UGIB and low Hct suggest acute anemia due to blood loss. This can result in decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and may lead to organ dysfunction.

   consistent with acute GI bleed, now requiring Bi-PAP for pulmonary
   edema and shortness of breath.
   # Hypoxia:  Worsening hypoxia and tachypnea, previous CXR consistent
   with flash pulmonary edema in setting of  decreased ejection fraction;
   showing improvement s/p diuresis. Current CVP does not imply fluid
   overload.   Also need to consider possibiluty of early ARDS given
   persistent bacterimia, TRALI given recent transfusions, and PE given hx
   of other thrombosis (cephalic vein).
   - Continue BiPAP, intubation is not an option as he is DNI; need to
   recheck ABG (last over 24hrs ago)
   - Consider CTA to assess for PE and also lung parenchyma although pt

   - repeat 12-lead
   # GI BLEED:  Hct relatively stable and has not required transfusion for
   over 24hrs. By report, has not been putting out as much melanotic
   stool. Possible causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV or CMV
   in the settting of profound imunosuppression).  Other potential causes

   # FEVER/ Neutropenia:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection
   which is now shown to be daptomycin resistant.  . The source of his
   abx-refractory bacteremia is unclear; cephalic vein clot, endocarditis
   not seen by TTE, or GI source given past typhlitis are top suspects.
   Blood cultures continue to grow daily VRE. ABX course as outlined

   likely be more able to clear the infection when his WBC recover.
   Another potential source of fever could be a drug reaction, although we
   had hoped that this might have been from aztreonam and given that his
   fevers continue after d/c
ing this medication and without significant
   worsening of his morbilliform rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing
   source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort, though low dose given that
   meperedine with linezolid can lower seizure threshold
   - continue Linezolid as above;       Gentamycin d/c

   tachycardia ans not representive of ACS. Difficult to intervene at this
   point given GI bleed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who presented to the hospital for chemotherapy. He is now experiencing upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), fevers, and respiratory distress, requiring BiPAP support. His condition is complicated by pulmonary edema, pancytopenia, anemia, coagulopathy, hypocalcemia, and a recent rash. The patient is profoundly neutropenic and has persistent vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. There are concerns about possible endocarditis, thrombotic events, and drug reactions. The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and there are focal wall motion abnormalities suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction. The patient's condition is critical, and he remains in the ICU with multiple ongoing medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms, along with the presence of diffuse bilateral infiltrative pulmonary process on chest x-ray, suggest the possibility of pneumonia. This could be due to aspiration or hospital-acquired infection.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the worsening hypoxia and bilateral infiltrates, ARDS should be considered as a potential complication.
3. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP): The patient's pancytopenia and recent transfusions raise the possibility of TTP, a condition"

   This is a 64 year old man who was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] on [**4-12**]^th for
   chemotherapy for AML, who is now profoundly neutropenic and febrile
   with persistent VRE bacteremia, and having hematemesis and melena
   consistent with acute GI bleed, now requiring Bi-PAP for pulmonary
   edema and shortness of breath.
   # Hypoxia:  Episode of worsening hypoxia and tachypnea overnight, CXR
   consistent with flash pulmonary edema in setting of  decreased ejection
   fraction.
   - BiPAP as above
   - DNR/DNI
   - gentle diuresis with lasix as tolerated
   #Tachycardia: HR up to 150
s this afternoon, trial of IVF today given
   that patient may be dry due to lasix  as well as IV lopressor. Tele
   shows sinus tach often occuring in the setting of fevers/rigors, but
   unclear why patient still having worsening sinus tach throughout the
   course of the day.  Tachycardia could be related to heart failure and
   worsening EF.  Pt maintaining blood pressures.
   - Consider standing low dose metoprolol for sinus tach, given reduced
   EF
   # GI BLEED:  Hct still trending downward although recent values include
   post-transfusion shift, total recent loss not clear and grossly he
   reportedly has not been putting out as much melanotic stool. Possible
   causes include infectious esophagitis (e.g. HSV or CMV in the settting
   of profound immunosuppression.  Other potential causes would include
   ulcer.  Appreciate GI recs.  No plan for endoscopy unless he is
   unstable and/or counts recover.
   - continue Q6 Hct checks; last Hct this morning 29.6
   - continue PPI gtt
   - transfuse to Hct >30, fibrinogen >100
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - fu/ HSV viral load
   - continue acyclovir (likely should be treatment doses given possible
   HSV contribution to GI bleed, will clarify this with ID)
   # FEVER:  Most likely secondary to ongoing VRE infection, now shown to
   be daptomycin resistant.  At this point, a trial of linezolid will help
   clarify whether his ongoing infection is really simply the product of
   inadequate treatment, or whether the evolution of the microbe is the
   product of an inadequately treated source. The source of his bacteremia
   is unclear; as prior, cephalic vein clot, endocarditis not seen by TTE,
   or GI source given past typhlitis are top suspects.  Blood cultures
   continue to grow daily VRE.
   Antibiotic course has been:
   Cefepime [**Date range (1) 6502**]
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6503**]
   Vanco oral [**Date range (1) 6504**]

   ----
   Daptomycin 8mg/kg [**Date range (1) 6506**]
   Linezolid [**Date range (1) 6507**]; [**5-22**]-present
   Daptomycin 10mg/kg [**5-18**]
 [**5-22**]
   Gent 1mg/kg q8h [**5-18**] - present
   Aztreonam [**Date range (1) 6508**]
   Meropenem [**5-19**] - present
   metronidazole [**4-21**] - present
   voriconazole [**5-2**] - present
   As above, currently on linezolid + meropenem + gentamicin +
   voriconazole + flagyl.  He will likely be more able to clear the
   infection when his WBC recover.   Another potential source of fever
   could be a drug reaction, although we had hoped that this might have
   been from aztreonam and given that his fevers continue after d/c
   this medication and without significant worsening of his morbilliform
   rash, VRE is probably the likely ongoing source of fever.
   - continue Tylenol around-the-clock
   - continue meperidine for comfort, though low dose given that
   meperedine with linezolid can lower seizure threshold
   - continue Linezolid as above, Gentamycin d/c
d per ID recs
   - continue voriconazole, meropenem, and flagyl for empiric coverage of
   neutropenic fever
   # Decreased EF: Worsening cardiac enzymes, decreased EF, focal wall
   motion abnormalities, suggestive of myocardial ischemia/infarction,
   although enzyme elevation may be partly demand-related in setting of
   tachycardia overnight. Difficult to intervene at this point given the
   severity of his GI bleed, which would likely be life-threatening in the
   face of heparin. He is currently DNR/DNI.
   - support Hct >30
   - continue BiPAP to optimize O2 delivery
   - trend enzymes for prognostic purposes
   - Continue captopril for afterload reduction, titrate up as BP
   tolerates
   # AML:  On cytarabine +/- clofarabine with reported remission on recent
   BM bx.
   - continue filgrastim
   - f/u heme/onc recs

","The patient is a 64-year-old man admitted to the ICU for chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He is profoundly neutropenic and febrile with persistent vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, and has been experiencing hematemesis and melena consistent with acute gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is also on BiPAP for pulmonary edema and shortness of breath.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has been experiencing worsening hypoxia and tachypnea, with a chest X-ray showing flash pulmonary edema in the setting of decreased ejection fraction. BiPAP has been initiated, but the patient may require further intervention.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate has been up to 150, with ongoing sinus tachycardia. This could be related to heart failure and worsening ejection fraction. Metoprolol has been considered for sinus tachycardia, given the reduced ejection fraction.
3. GI bleed: The patient has had hematemesis and melena, indicating a possible upper GI bleed.
