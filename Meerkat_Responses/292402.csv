   Assessment and Plan
   75 yom with multiple risk factors for CAD without prior history p/w
   with anginal events and new LBBB on EKG and NSTEMI with depressed
   cardiac function (EF 20%).
   .
   # CP, LBBB:  Given his risk factors, his atypical chest pain is likely
   to have represented ACS. He initially was well controlled on medical
   management, but subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now
   controlled on morphine and nitro.
   - cath in AM
   - on asa, heparin gtt, lipitor
   - will add on BB in am (HR 60 on admission, so will hold tonight)
   .
   # decompensated LV dysfunction: CXR and TTE at OSH reporting worsened
   CHF with EF of 25%. Currently euvolemic on exam, after lasix ggt.
   Likely precipitant is an ischemic event given above presentation.
   - will hold lasix overnight, in anticipation of cath in am
   - monitor I/O
   - consider repeat TTE
   - Will add on BB and ACEi
   .
   # LBBB: Noted on initial presentation to OSH, on [**2138-12-19**]. Now appears
   resolved. Unclear if this was really new, since the only comparison is
   from 07.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   # Pulm/SOB: most likely CHF, although has h/o COPD, so perhaps mixed
   picture. Less likely infective, but given levofloxacin at OSH
   presumably for leucocytosis and concern for CAP.
   - nebs, O2, will d/c levo and monitor for fever/leukocytosis.
   .
   # CKD:  Creatinine has been upward trending since his admission, unsure
   of the baseline Creatinine prior to OSH. Likely secondary to poor
   forward flow.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), presenting with anginal events and a new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on EKG. The patient also has a history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with depressed cardiac function, as evidenced by an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%.

The patient's chest pain initially responded well to medical management but subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now controlled with morphine and nitroglycerin. The plan is to perform a cardiac catheterization in the morning, start the patient on aspirin, heparin, and atorvastatin, and add a beta-blocker in the morning (with caution due to the patient's baseline heart rate of 60 bpm).

The patient is also diagnosed with decompensated left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, as indicated by a worsening ejection fraction of 25% on a recent chest X-ray (CXR) and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The likely precipitant of this decompensation is an ischemic event. The plan is to hold lasix overnight, monitor intake and output (I/O), consider a repeat TTE, and add on a beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor.

The patient's LBBB, initially noted on presentation to the outside hospital, has now resolved. It is unclear whether"

He presented with anginal events, new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on EKG, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction of 20%). He initially responded well to medical management but developed recurrent pain, which is now controlled with morphine and nitroglycerin. The patient also has decompensated left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 25% and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's symptoms and EKG changes suggest ongoing ischemia, which could lead to further myocardial damage if not promptly treated.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's ejection fraction is significantly reduced, indicating impaired cardiac function. This increases the risk of heart failure exacerbations and fluid overload.
3. Arrhythmias: LBBB can predispose the patient to arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Close monitoring of heart rhythm is necessary.
4. Pulmonary Edema: Given the patient's heart failure and COPD, there is an increased risk of pulmonary edema, which can cause shortness of breath and respiratory distress.
5. Kidney Injury: The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest possible acute kidney injury, potentially secondary"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with atypical chest pain, new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on EKG, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction of 20%). The patient initially responded well to medical management but subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now controlled with morphine and nitroglycerin.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's initial presentation with atypical chest pain and subsequent development of recurrent pain suggests ongoing ischemia, indicating the possibility of ACS.

2. Heart Failure (HF): The patient has evidence of decompensated left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 25%, indicating significant impairment in cardiac function. This puts the patient at risk for further decompensation and development of heart failure symptoms such as pulmonary edema and fluid overload.

3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels have been upward trending since admission, suggesting a decline in renal function. This may be secondary to poor forward flow due to depressed cardiac function.

4. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is experiencing shortness of breath, which could be due to congestive"

   1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
   demonstrated three vessel disease.  The LMCA had no angiographically
   apparent disease.  The LAD was a long vessel with a proximal, heavily
   calcified lesion extending across a long first diagonal which was 90%
   stenosed.  The middle and distal LAD was diffusely diseased.  The LCx
   had a 90% stenosis at a proximal OM1.  The LPDA and LPL were hazy with
   serial 70% lesions in the terminal vessel.   The RCA was a small,
   non-dominant vessel.
   2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling
   pressures with RVEDP of 21mmHg and LVEDP of 38mmHg.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 50mmHg.
   3. There was no pressure gradient noted on carefull pullback of the

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease.
- He presented with atypical chest pain and was initially well-controlled on medical management.
- However, he subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now controlled on morphine and nitroglycerin.
- He underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease.
- The patient also has moderate pulmonary hypertension and moderate diastolic dysfunction.
- He was found to have a left bundle branch block (LBBB) on EKG and NSTEMI with depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction of 20%).
- The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): Given the patient's risk factors and presentation with anginal events, there is a possibility of ongoing or recurrent ACS. Close monitoring and prompt intervention will be necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Cardiogenic shock: With the presence of depressed cardiac function and evidence of three-vessel coronary artery disease, the patient may be at risk of developing cardiogenic shock. Continuous hemodynamic monitoring and prompt treatment are essential.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary hypertension and moderate diastolic dysfunction may predispose him to pulmonary edema, particularly if there is an exacerbation of his heart failure symptoms. Close monitoring for signs of respiratory distress and prompt intervention"

   1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
   demonstrated three vessel disease.  The LMCA had no angiographically
   apparent disease.  The LAD was a long vessel with a proximal, heavily
   calcified lesion extending across a long first diagonal which was 90%
   stenosed.  The middle and distal LAD was diffusely diseased.  The LCx
   had a 90% stenosis at a proximal OM1.  The LPDA and LPL were hazy with
   serial 70% lesions in the terminal vessel.   The RCA was a small,
   non-dominant vessel.
   2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling
   pressures with RVEDP of 21mmHg and LVEDP of 38mmHg.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 50mmHg.
   3. There was no pressure gradient noted on carefull pullback of the
   pigtail catheter from the left ventricle to the aorta.

The patient is currently on a lasix drip, milrinone, beta-blocker, and heparin gtt. Monitoring of the patient's intake and output is important to prevent fluid overload. The patient's renal function has been declining since admission, and measures should be taken to avoid nephrotoxic medications and monitor for signs of renal dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with anginal events, new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on EKG, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction of 20%). The patient initially responded well to medical management but subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now controlled with morphine and nitroglycerin. He has undergone cardiac catheterization, which revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is severely reduced at 20%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery - indicated due to the severe three-vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Diastolic dysfunction - the patient has moderate diastolic dysfunction, which may lead to heart failure symptoms.
3. Pulmonary hypertension - the patient has moderate pulmonary hypertension, which can worsen over time and lead to right heart failure.
4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) - the patient's creatinine levels have been upward trending since admission, indicating potential renal impairment.
5. Anemia - the patient has chronic anemia and is on erythropoietin (epo) and iron supplementation.
6. Hyperglycemia - the patient is a known diabetic and is on insulin therapy.
7. Deep vein thrombosis ("

   1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
   demonstrated three vessel disease.  The LMCA had no angiographically
   apparent disease.  The LAD was a long vessel with a proximal, heavily
   calcified lesion extending across a long first diagonal which was 90%
   stenosed.  The middle and distal LAD was diffusely diseased.  The LCx
   had a 90% stenosis at a proximal OM1.  The LPDA and LPL were hazy with
   serial 70% lesions in the terminal vessel.   The RCA was a small,
   non-dominant vessel.
   2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling
   pressures with RVEDP of 21mmHg and LVEDP of 38mmHg.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 50mmHg.
   3. There was no pressure gradient noted on carefull pullback of the
   pigtail catheter from the left ventricle to the aorta.

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), presenting with anginal events, new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on EKG, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction of 20%). He underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease. He also has moderate pulmonary hypertension and moderate diastolic dysfunction. 

The patient's current medications include aspirin, heparin, lipitor, and beta-blockers. He is being closely monitored for several conditions, including decompensated left ventricular dysfunction, LBBB, pulmonary symptoms, chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM). 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include further cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina, worsening of heart failure symptoms, progression of CKD due to poor renal perfusion, development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization, and possible infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection."

   COMMENTS:
   1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
   demonstrated three vessel disease.  The LMCA had no angiographically
   apparent disease.  The LAD was a long vessel with a proximal, heavily
   calcified lesion extending across a long first diagonal which was 90%
   stenosed.  The middle and distal LAD was diffusely diseased.  The LCx
   had a 90% stenosis at a proximal OM1.  The LPDA and LPL were hazy with
   serial 70% lesions in the terminal vessel.   The RCA was a small,
   non-dominant vessel.
   2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling
   pressures with RVEDP of 21mmHg and LVEDP of 38mmHg.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 50mmHg.
   3. There was no pressure gradient noted on carefull pullback of the
   pigtail catheter from the left ventricle to the aorta.
   4. Left ventriculography was deferred.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   3. Moderate diastolic dysfunction.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease.
- He presented with anginal events and new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on EKG, as well as NSTEMI with depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction of 20%).
- Initial management included medical therapy, but the patient developed recurrent chest pain, which is now controlled on morphine and nitroglycerin.
- Coronary angiography revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and moderate diastolic dysfunction.
- The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction was found to be 25% on a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed at another facility.
- The patient is currently euvolemic and responding well to lasix and milrinone therapy.
- Plans include coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in one week, along with pre-operative workup, including carotid ultrasound and ankle-brachial index (ABI).
- The patient's chronic conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, anemia, and CLL, are being managed accordingly.
- Code status remains DNR/DNI.
- The patient is currently in the CCU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic events leading to recurrent chest pain and NSTEMI.
2. Poor forward flow resulting in worsening renal function.
3. Fluid overload or hypovolem"

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease, presenting with anginal events, new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on EKG, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction of 20%). He was initially well-controlled on medical management but subsequently developed recurrent pain, now controlled on morphine and nitroglycerin. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), anemia, and is at risk for dialysis.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed horrendous three-vessel disease, elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) was indicated per cardiologist recommendations. The patient's left dominant coronary system has serial 70% lesions in the left posterior descending artery (LPDA). 

The patient's left ventricular (LV) dysfunction has worsened, with an ejection fraction of 25% as per echocardiogram (ECHO) at OSH. The patient is currently euvolemic on exam, after receiving lasix (a diuretic). The likely precipitant of the decompensated LV dysfunction is an ischemic event, given the patient's presentation. 

The patient's LBBB, initially noted on presentation to OSH, appears to have resolved. However, it is unclear if this"

- The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD).
- He presented with atypical chest pain, new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on EKG, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction of 20%).
- He was transferred from another hospital for cardiac catheterization.
- The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), anemia, and is at risk for dialysis in the coming months.
- Coronary angiography revealed significant coronary artery disease, and the patient is recommended to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
- The patient's left ventricular (LV) dysfunction has worsened, with an ejection fraction of 25%, possibly due to an ischemic event.
- The patient is currently euvolemic and receiving lasix and milrinone to manage congestive heart failure (CHF).
- The patient's LBBB, which was initially present, appears to be resolved.
- The patient also has pulmonary symptoms of congestive heart failure and may have a mixed picture of heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- The patient's creatinine levels have been upward trending since admission, indicating worsening renal function, likely secondary to poor forward flow.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   No recurrence of chest pain. past 24 hour events reviewed
   Physical Examination
   Sitting in chair and appears comfortable.
   Medical Decision Making
   Severe ischemis cardiomyopathy and acute coronary syndrome with severe
   3 vesssel CAD on recent caronary angiogram. It is likely that
   substantial myocardial recovery is possible after revascularization.
   Continue inotropic support and diuresis as needed for euvolemia while
   awaiting CABG.  Will likely need dialysis post CABG.

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease, presenting with anginal events and a new left bundle branch block on EKG, as well as an NSTEMI with depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction of 20%). The patient has chronic kidney disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, anemia, and is at risk for heart failure.

Based on the assessment and plan, the patient's condition appears to be critical and complex, involving multiple medical complications. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient initially presented with anginal events, which could represent ACS. The presence of a new left bundle branch block on EKG and NSTEMI with depressed cardiac function further supports this diagnosis. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's cardiac function and consider revascularization options, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

2. Heart Failure (HF): The patient's ejection fraction is significantly reduced at 20%, indicating impaired cardiac function. This increases the risk of developing heart failure. The patient's current symptoms of pulmonary congestion and the presence of a pericardial effusion on echocardiogram suggest ongoing fluid overload. Close monitoring of the patient's fluid status and ongoing management with diuretics and inotropic support will be necessary.

3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels have been upward trending since admission, indicating worsening renal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) presenting with atypical chest pain, new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on EKG, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), anemia, and hypertension. He was initially well-controlled on medical management but subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now controlled with morphine and nitroglycerin. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed horrendous three-vessel disease (3VD) with elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was indicated based on the recommendations of Dr. [**Doctor First Name**]. The patient's carotids, ankle-brachial index (ABI), and other pre-CABG workup will be done today. 

The patient also has decompensated left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25%, worsening congestive heart failure (CHF), and an ischemic event as the likely precipitant. An echocardiogram showed EF 20-25%, cardiac index (CI) of 1.95, pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) of 34-60, LV hypertrophy with global hypokinesis, mild aortic reg"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and without prior history presenting with anginal events and new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on electrocardiogram (EKG) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction of 20%).
- The patient was initially well-controlled on medical management but subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now controlled on morphine and nitroglycerin.
- The patient has undergone cardiac catheterization revealing horrendous three-vessel disease (3VD), elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) indicated as per cardiologist's recommendations.
- The patient's right internal carotid artery (ICA) has less than 40% stenosis, and the left ICA also has less than 40% stenosis, so no need to fix before surgery.
- The patient is on aspirin, heparin infusion, and atorvastatin (Lipitor).
- The patient has decompensated left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 25% and is currently euvolemic on exam after lasix infusion.
- The patient's recent echo showed an ejection fraction of 20"

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease, presenting with atypical chest pain, new left bundle branch block (LBBB), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), anemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed severe three-vessel disease, elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), and a recommendation for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient's current condition in the ICU includes euvolemia after diuresis, worsened congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20-25%, and global hypokinesis on echocardiogram. He is being treated with milrinone, lasix, beta-blockers, and morphine for pain control. The patient also has a small circumferential pericardial effusion.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications:
- Worsening CHF due to the patient's depressed cardiac function and the presence of a significant pericardial effusion.
- Development of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
- Possibility of cardiogenic shock if the patient's cardiac function deteriorates further.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), anemia, and impending hemodialysis (HD).

2. The patient presented with atypical chest pain, which is likely to represent acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Initially well-controlled on medical management, the patient subsequently developed recurrent pain that is now controlled on morphine and nitro.

3. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed horrendous three-vessel disease (3VD), elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), and indications for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The catheterization also showed 90% proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) lesion, 90% proximal lesion in the left circumflex artery (LCX), and serial 70% lesions in the left posterior descending artery (LPDA).

4. The patient's right internal carotid artery (ICA) has less than 40% stenosis, and the left ICA also has less than 40% stenosis, with no need to fix before surgery.

5. The patient is currently receiving aspirin (ASA), heparin, and atorvastatin (Lipitor) for medical management. Pre-CAB"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease, who presented with atypical chest pain and new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on electrocardiogram (EKG). He was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction of 20%). The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), anemia, and is awaiting heart surgery due to significant coronary artery disease. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of significant coronary artery disease, NSTEMI, and depressed cardiac function puts him at risk for further cardiac complications such as congestive heart failure (CHF), arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
2. Renal Complications: The patient's CKD and recent diuresis may lead to renal complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI), electrolyte imbalances, or worsening renal function.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary symptoms may increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia, exacerbation of COPD, or respiratory failure.
4. Hematological Complications: The patient's CLL and anemia may contribute to hematological complications like bleeding disorders or infections due to"

   # CP:  Given his risk factors, his atypical chest pain is likely to
   have represented ACS. He initially was well controlled on medical
   management, but subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now
   controlled on morphine and nitro.   Horrendous 3VD on cath, elevated
   PCWP, CABG indicated as per C-[**Doctor First Name **] recs.  Cath -> 90% prox LAD crossing
   D1, LCX 90% Prox to OM1, and a left dominant system with serial 70%
   lesions in the LPDA.  Despite no change in his symptomology and EKG, an
   elevated AST and LDH were noted.  As cardiac was the most likely source
   in this patient, a set of cardiac enzymes were added to yesterday
s AM
   labs and an elevated CK-MB and troponin were noted.  Given his horrible
   disease burden it was thought that this enzyme leak was secondary to
   strain in the setting of inotropic therapy.  We weaned him off
   Milrinone.

   ADDENDUM RE: CODE STATUS
   The patient had been previously DNR/DNI.  However, this code status was
   reversed for catherization.  Code status was discussed with the patient
   today, as it was unclear whether he preferred to be DNR/DNI at this
   time as he awaits CABG or full code.  After discussion, the patient
   decided he would like to be FULL CODE at this time as he awaits CABG.
   Following CABG, he will re-evaluate his code status.  For the purposes
   of his current hospitalization, a POE order to the effect of FULL CODE
   has been placed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-inch tall and 82.4 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. The patient has been receiving furosemide (Lasix) at a rate of 20 mg/hour. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 110/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is hemodynamically stable and has a sinus rhythm. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,177 mL, including 66 mL of IV fluids, and a total output of 1,760 mL, including 980 mL of urine output. The patient's blood products and NG output are minimal.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, platelet count of 66 K/uL, creatinine level of 5.7 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 123 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 5.68 K/uL. Other lab values include elevated levels of CK, CKMB, ALT, AST, LDH, and decreased levels of albumin. Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Plan:
The patient's plan includes stopping heparin at 3 AM, rechecking PTT at 8 AM, placing a new hemodialysis (HD) line at 9 AM, and proceeding with dialysis today. The patient's PICC line was placed on 12/23/2138 at 02:35 PM.

Potential Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Fluid overload: The patient's total fluid input exceeds the total fluid output, indicating a positive fluid balance. This may lead to fluid overload and subsequent pulmonary edema or heart failure.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function. AKI can further complicate the patient's condition and may require ongoing dialysis.
3. Cardiac complications: Elevated troponin-T levels indicate possible myocardial injury. This, along with the patient's tachycardia and hypotension, raises concerns for cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may suggest an ongoing infection. Infections can worsen the patient's overall condition and prolong ICU stay.
5. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged PTT and elevated INR indicate a bleeding tendency. Discontinuing heparin and monitoring coagulation parameters will be important to prevent bleeding complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yom with multiple risk factors for CAD without prior history p/w
   with anginal events and new LBBB on EKG and NSTEMI with depressed
   cardiac function (EF 20%).  Transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for cath by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] in anticipation of Cardiac cath.  CKD, CLL, Anemia, and looming
   HD complicate his picture.
   .
   # CP:  Given his risk factors, his atypical chest pain is likely to
   have represented ACS. He initially was well controlled on medical
   management, but subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now
   controlled on morphine and nitro.   Horrendous 3VD on cath, elevated
   PCWP, CABG indicated as per C-[**Doctor First Name **] recs.  Cath -> 90% prox LAD crossing
   D1, LCX 90% Prox to OM1, and a left dominant system with serial 70%
   lesions in the LPDA.  Despite no change in his symptomology and EKG, an
   elevated AST and LDH were noted.  As cardiac was the most likely source
   in this patient, a set of cardiac enzymes were added to yesterday
s AM
   labs and an elevated CK-MB and troponin were noted.  Given his horrible
   disease burden it was thought that this enzyme leak was secondary to
   strain in the setting of inotropic therapy.  We weaned him off
   Milrinone.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with anginal events, new left bundle branch block (LBBB), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), anemia, and diabetes mellitus. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed severe coronary artery disease requiring coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was also found to have a large pericardial effusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CAD, NSTEMI, and severe coronary artery disease, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
2. Renal complications: The patient has CKD with worsening renal function, as indicated by an upward trending creatinine level since admission. There is a risk of acute kidney injury or further decline in renal function due to factors like nephrotoxic medications, hypotension, or inadequate fluid management.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient had pulmonary edema and required diuresis. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory distress or pneumonia due to fluid overload or aspiration.
4. Bleeding complications: As the patient is on heparin prophylaxis, there is a risk of bleeding complications such as gastrointestinal"

   ADDENDUM RE: CODE STATUS
   The patient had been previously DNR/DNI.  However, this code status was
   reversed for catherization.  Code status was discussed with the patient
   today, as it was unclear whether he preferred to be DNR/DNI at this
   time as he awaits CABG or full code.  After discussion, the patient
   decided he would like to be FULL CODE at this time as he awaits CABG.
   Following CABG, he will re-evaluate his code status.  For the purposes
   of his current hospitalization, a POE order to the effect of FULL CODE
   has been placed.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with atypical chest pain and new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on EKG, along with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction of 20%). The patient was initially managed medically but developed recurrent pain, which is now controlled with morphine and nitroglycerin.

Subsequently, the patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed horrible three-vessel disease, elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), and indications for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) as per the recommendation of the consulting cardiologist. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), anemia, hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM).

The patient's current condition includes decompensated left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20-25%, congestion, and global hypokinesis on echocardiogram. The patient's renal function has been worsening since admission, and he is scheduled for hemodialysis (HD) today. He also has anemia, which is being managed with erythropoietin (epo) and iron supplementation.

The patient's medication regimen includes aspirin (ASA), heparin, lisinopril"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yom with multiple risk factors for CAD without prior history p/w
   with anginal events and new LBBB on EKG and NSTEMI with depressed
   cardiac function (EF 20%).  Transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for cath by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] in anticipation of Cardiac cath.  CKD, CLL, Anemia, and looming
   HD complicate his picture.
   .
   # CP:  Given his risk factors, his atypical chest pain is likely to
   have represented ACS. He initially was well controlled on medical
   management, but subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now
   controlled on morphine and nitro.   Horrendous 3VD on cath, elevated
   PCWP, CABG indicated as per C-[**Doctor First Name **] recs.  Cath -> 90% prox LAD crossing
   D1, LCX 90% Prox to OM1, and a left dominant system with serial 70%
   lesions in the LPDA.  Despite no change in his symptomology and EKG, an
   elevated AST and LDH were noted.  As cardiac was the most likely source
   in this patient, a set of cardiac enzymes were added to yesterday
s AM
   labs and an elevated CK-MB and troponin were noted.  Given his horrible
   disease burden it was thought that this enzyme leak was secondary to
   strain in the setting of inotropic therapy.  We weaned him off
   Milrinone.
   - CABG next week
   - Impression: Right ICA with <40% stenosis. Left ICA with <40%
   stenosis. No need to fix before surgery
   - ABI:
   Normal lower extremity arterial hemodynamics at rest. Note of
   some noncompressible vessels, consistent with history of diabetes.

   # CKD:  Creatinine has been upward trending since his admission, unsure
   of the baseline Creatinine prior to OSH. Likely secondary to poor
   forward flow.   FeNa <1, FeUrea-25% = Pre-Renal, low flow
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - monitor I/O
 continues to put-out good urine despite being tapered
   off Milrinone
   - Patient to have HD today and run even, if UOP trails off and we feel
   patient is fluid overloaded we can try to run him negative in the
   future.  His BUN is dangerously high at this point.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with atypical chest pain, new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on EKG, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction of 20%). The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), anemia, and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications. Firstly, the patient developed recurrent anginal events despite initial control on medical management, necessitating the use of morphine and nitroglycerin. Subsequently, the patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed significant coronary artery disease with 90% proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis, 90% proximal left circumflex artery (LCX) stenosis, and serial 70% lesions in the left posterior descending artery (LPDA). This indicates severe blockages in the coronary arteries supplying blood to the heart muscle.

Secondly, the patient's renal function has worsened, as indicated by an upward trending creatinine level since admission. This may be secondary to poor forward flow due to the heart's impaired pumping function. The patient's fluid balance is also a concern, with ongoing fluid losses through urine and a need to monitor intake/output (I/O) to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), presenting with anginal events, new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on electrocardiogram (EKG), and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction 20%). He was initially managed medically but developed recurrent pain controlled on morphine and nitroglycerin. Subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed severe three-vessel disease, elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) was indicated. The patient's cardiac enzymes showed elevated CK-MB and troponin. Due to the severity of his disease, it was thought that the enzyme leak was secondary to strain in the setting of inotropic therapy. Milrinone was tapered off. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), anemia, and diabetes mellitus (DM). He is currently euvolemic after receiving lasix and is expected to undergo CABG next week. Other notable findings include decompensated left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 25%, improvement in pulmonary symptoms of breathlessness, resolved LBBB, and preexisting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's medication regimen includes asa, heparin, lipitor, and beta-blockers"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with multiple risk factors for CAD without prior history p/w
   with anginal events and new LBBB on EKG and NSTEMI with depressed
   cardiac function (EF 20%).  Transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for cath by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] in anticipation of Cardiac cath.  CKD, CLL, Anemia, and looming
   HD complicate his picture.
   .
   # CP:  Given his risk factors, his atypical chest pain is likely to
   have represented ACS. He initially was well controlled on medical
   management, but subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now
   controlled on morphine and nitro.   Severe 3VD on cath, elevated PCWP,
   CABG indicated as per C-[**Doctor First Name **] recs.  Cath -> 90% prox LAD crossing D1,
   LCX 90% Prox to OM1, and a left dominant system with serial 70% lesions
   in the LPDA.  Despite no change in his symptomology and EKG, an
   elevated AST and LDH were noted.  Currently off milrinone.
   - CABG next week
   - Impression: Right ICA with <40% stenosis. Left ICA with <40%
   stenosis. No need to fix before surgery
   - ABI: Normal lower extremity arterial hemodynamics at rest. Note of
   some noncompressible vessels, consistent with history of diabetes.
   Lower extremity arterial hemodynamics at rest.
   - on ASA, heparin gtt, lipitor, BB
   - If CP call C-[**Doctor First Name 213**]
   - concentrate of lasix
   - uptitrate BB vs. TID dosing as tolerated
   .
   # decompensated LV dysfunction: CXR and TTE at OSH reporting worsened
   CHF with EF of 25%. Currently euvolemic on exam, after lasix gtt / HD.
   Likely precipitant is an ischemic event given above presentation.
   ECHO here yesterday showed, Ef 20-25%, CI-1.95, PASP
 34-60, LVH with
   Global hypokinesis, mild AR, mild MR, small circumferential pericardial
   effusion.
   - stopped lasix gtt, continues to put out good UOP
   - monitor I/O keep (-) 1L today including what is tolerated at HD; no
   need to take off extra vol with HD
   - on BB
   - UOP has tapered off, creatinine has bumped
   .
   # LBBB: Noted on initial presentation to OSH, on [**2138-12-19**]. Now appears
   resolved. Unclear if this was really new, since the only comparison is
   from 07.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   # Pulm/SOB: Greatly improved with fluid off
   - nebs, O2, will d/c levo and monitor for fever/leukocytosis.
   .
   # CKD:  Creatinine has been upward trending since his admission, unsure
   of the baseline Creatinine prior to OSH. Likely secondary to poor
   forward flow.   FeNa <1, FeUrea-25% = Pre-Renal, low flow.  S/P HD
   yesterday, first session.
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - monitor I/O
 continues to put-out good urine despite being tapered
   off Milrinone
   - HD again today.
   - started Phoslo
   - continue Procrit with Fe/Vit C supplementation.
   - creatinine has bumped with diuresis
   .
   # Claudication- Precludes IABP
   .
   # CLL: doing very well on chlorambucil, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11577**] aware, would like
   to discuss with him today.
   - No Chlorambucil prior to surgery
   - Onc [**Last Name (un) **] for CBC/Diff, Ig, smear
   - f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Dialysis initiated.
   No further ischemic symptoms and hemodynamic status stable.
   Await CABG plan.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2075**], MD
   on:[**2138-12-27**] 12:14 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have been upward trending since admission, indicating a decline in kidney function. This could be due to poor forward flow as mentioned in the note. The patient's fluid balance also shows a negative balance, which may be contributing to the AKI. Monitoring I/O and avoiding nephrotoxic medications are important in preventing further kidney injury.

2. Ventricular Arrhythmias: The patient experienced a run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) overnight. Monitoring the patient's heart rhythm and administering appropriate antiarrhythmic medications will be important to prevent the development of more severe arrhythmias.

3. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute exacerbations of COPD. Monitoring oxygen saturation levels and providing supportive care, such as bronchodilators and oxygen therapy, will be necessary.

4. Pericardial Effusion: The patient has a small circumferential pericardial effusion noted on echocardiogram. This can be a sign of cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis. Monitoring for signs of hemodynamic compromise and considering drainage or other interventions if necessary.

5. Bleeding Complications: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), including a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN). The patient presented with atypical chest pain, which is likely to represent acute coronary syndrome (ACS). He was initially well-controlled on medical management but subsequently developed recurrent pain, now controlled with morphine and nitroglycerin. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed a 90% proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) lesion, a 90% proximal left circumflex artery (LCX) lesion, and serial 70% lesions in the left posterior descending artery (LPDA). These findings indicate significant coronary artery disease and have led to the recommendation for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

The patient also has decompensated left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%. This is likely due to an ischemic event. The patient's congestive heart failure (CHF) has been managed with diuretics and hemodialysis (HD). 

Additionally, the patient has a history of claudication, which precludes the use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). He is currently on aspirin (ASA), heparin, atorvastatin (L"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with multiple risk factors for CAD without prior history p/w
   with anginal events and new LBBB on EKG and NSTEMI with depressed
   cardiac function (EF 20%).  Transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for cath by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] in anticipation of Cardiac cath.  CKD, CLL, Anemia, and looming
   HD complicate his picture.
   .
   # CP:  Given his risk factors, his atypical chest pain is likely to
   have represented ACS. He initially was well controlled on medical
   management, but subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now
   controlled on morphine and nitro.   Horrendous 3VD on cath, elevated
   PCWP, CABG indicated as per C-[**Doctor First Name **] recs.  Cath -> 90% prox LAD crossing
   D1, LCX 90% Prox to OM1, and a left dominant system with serial 70%
   lesions in the LPDA.  Despite no change in his symptomology and EKG, an
   elevated AST and LDH were noted.  As cardiac was the most likely source
   in this patient, a set of cardiac enzymes were added to yesterday
s AM
   labs and an elevated CK-MB and troponin were noted.  Given his horrible
   disease burden it was thought that this enzyme leak was secondary to
   strain in the setting of inotropic therapy.  We weaned him off
   Milrinone.
   - CABG next week
   - Impression: Right ICA with <40% stenosis. Left ICA with <40%
   stenosis. No need to fix before surgery

   Normal lower extremity arterial hemodynamics at rest. Note of
   some noncompressible vessels, consistent with history of diabetes.

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), anemia, and impending hemodialysis (HD) complications. The patient initially presented with anginal events and new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on electrocardiogram (EKG) as well as non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction of 20%). He was transferred from another hospital for cardiac catheterization due to severe three-vessel disease (3VD) on coronary angiography, elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), and indication for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) as per cardiologist's recommendations. The patient's chest pain is now controlled on morphine and nitroglycerin.

The patient's recent medical history includes an ischemic event with worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and ejection fraction of 25% reported on chest X-ray (CXR) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). An ischemic event likely precipitated the decompensated left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), anemia, and hypertension. He presented with atypical chest pain, which was initially controlled on medical management but subsequently developed recurrent pain. The patient was transferred from another hospital for cardiac catheterization due to non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with depressed cardiac function. Severe three-vessel disease (3VD) was found on catheterization, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is indicated.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions, including hemodialysis (HD), fluid removal, and medication adjustments. His condition has been complicated by decompensated left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20-25%, pulmonary congestion, worsening renal function, claudication that precludes intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement, CLL, anemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications:
   - Myocardial infarction (MI) due to ongoing ischemia
   - Heart failure exacerbation due to fluid overload or further LV dysfunction
   - Arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation

2. Pulmonary Complications:

   cardiac function (EF 20%).  Transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for cath by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] in anticipation of Cardiac cath.  CKD, CLL, Anemia, and looming
   HD complicate his picture.
   .
   # CP:  Given his risk factors, his atypical chest pain is likely to
   have represented ACS. He initially was well controlled on medical
   management, but subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now
   controlled on morphine and nitro.   Severe 3VD on cath, elevated PCWP,
   CABG indicated as per C-[**Doctor First Name **] recs.  Cath -> 90% prox LAD crossing D1,
   LCX 90% Prox to OM1, and a left dominant system with serial 70% lesions
   in the LPDA.  Despite no change in his symptomology and EKG, an
   elevated AST and LDH were noted.  Currently off milrinone.
   - CABG next week
   - Impression: Right ICA with <40% stenosis. Left ICA with <40%
   stenosis. No need to fix before surgery
   - ABI: Normal lower extremity arterial hemodynamics at rest. Note of
   some noncompressible vessels, consistent with history of diabetes.
   Lower extremity arterial hemodynamics at rest.

   # Pulm/SOB: Greatly improved with fluid off
   - nebs, O2, will d/c levo and monitor for fever/leukocytosis.
   .
   # CKD:  Creatinine has been upward trending since his admission, unsure
   of the baseline Creatinine prior to OSH. Likely secondary to poor
   forward flow.   FeNa <1, FeUrea-25% = Pre-Renal, low flow.  S/P HD

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), presenting with anginal events and new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on electrocardiogram (EKG), as well as non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction 20%). He was initially well-controlled on medical management but subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now controlled on morphine and nitroglycerin. Severe three-vessel disease (3VD) was found on cardiac catheterization, along with elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), indicating the need for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient also has chronic kidney disease (CKD), anemia, CLL, and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
- Heart rate: 64 beats per minute (bpm)
- Blood pressure: 107/49 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 94%

Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,548 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates sinus bradycardia. The patient's weight is 78.4 kg, with a height of 68 inches.

Laboratory results include:
- White blood cell count: 12.3 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 28.1%
- Platelet count: 319 K/uL
- Creatinine: 5.8 mg/dL
- Glucose: 117 mg/dL
- Troponin-T: 4.49 ng/mL
- Other lab values within normal ranges

The patient's medications include aspirin, heparin, and atorvastatin.

Assessment and plan:
1. Coronary artery disease with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and depressed cardiac function.
2. Severe three-vessel disease on cardiac catheterization.
3. Elevated PCWP indicating the need for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with upward trending creatinine since admission.
5. Anemia managed with erythropoietin and iron supplementation.
6. CLL well-controlled on chlorambucil.
7. Diabetes mellitus managed with levimer and aspart SSI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications such as myocardial ischemia, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
2. Kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease due to poor forward flow and fluid overload.
3. Respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Infection such as sepsis or urinary tract infection (UTI).
5. Bleeding or thrombosis related to anticoagulant therapy.
6. Metabolic disturbances such as electrolyte imbalances or hyperglycemia.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and a thorough physical examination and additional tests may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with anginal events, new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on electrocardiogram (EKG), and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction of 20%). He was transferred from another hospital for cardiac catheterization by Dr. [Last Name (Title)] in anticipation of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), anemia, hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM).

The patient initially presented with atypical chest pain, which is likely to have represented acute coronary syndrome (ACS). He was initially well-controlled on medical management but subsequently developed recurrent pain, now controlled on morphine and nitroglycerin. Severe three-vessel disease (3VD) was found during cardiac catheterization, along with elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), indicating significant left ventricular dysfunction. CABG was indicated based on the recommendations of Dr. [Doctor First Name].

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure of 109/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation"

   cardiac function (EF 20%).  Transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for cath by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] in anticipation of Cardiac cath.  CKD, CLL, Anemia, and looming
   HD complicate his picture.
   .
   # CP:  Given his risk factors, his atypical chest pain is likely to
   have represented ACS. He initially was well controlled on medical
   management, but subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now
   controlled on morphine and nitro.   Severe 3VD on cath, elevated PCWP,
   CABG indicated as per C-[**Doctor First Name **] recs.  Cath -> 90% prox LAD crossing D1,
   LCX 90% Prox to OM1, and a left dominant system with serial 70% lesions
   in the LPDA.

   - Carotid Doplers: Right ICA with <40% stenosis. Left ICA with <40%
   stenosis. No need to fix before surgery
   - ABI: Normal lower extremity arterial hemodynamics at rest. Note of
   some noncompressible vessels, consistent with history of diabetes.
   Lower extremity arterial hemodynamics at rest.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with anginal events and new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on electrocardiogram (EKG), along with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and depressed cardiac function (ejection fraction 20%). He was initially well-controlled on medical management but subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now controlled on morphine and nitroglycerin. Severe three-vessel disease was found during cardiac catheterization, with elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and recommendation for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) by cardiologist [**Doctor First Name**]. The patient underwent CABG surgery today.

Medical Complications:
1. Decompensated LV dysfunction: The patient has a history of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 25% according to recent chest X-ray and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) at OSH. The patient is currently euvolemic on examination, after administration of lasix and hemodialysis (HD). This is likely precipitated by an ischemic event given the above presentation. An ECHO showed an ejection fraction of 20-25%, cardiac index of 1.95, pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) 34-60, left ventricular hypertrophy (LV"
