   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx of CAD s/p CABG, Sys/Diastolic CHF, Afib, ESRD on HD
   s/p failed renal transplant in 03 who remains on prednisone taper, H/o
   C.Diff on po Vanc taper who was transferred with transient
   hypotension, MS changes and fever.
   .
   # Fever/Hypotension: Pt reports intermittent hypotension for the last
   few wks, assoc with HD. However, fever curve has been trending up in
   house.  Adrenal Insufficiency and multiple infectious sources possible:
   LLE suspicious for cellulitis, LFT abnormalities suggestive of
   obstructive cholestasis, cough and infiltrates concerning for PNA,
   raises concern for PCP in pt on chronic steroids, elevated LDH and not
   on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1512**].  Infiltrates location suggestive of aspiration and MS
   compromised intermittently.  PT also has a h/o pulm nocardia.  Lower
   suspician for endocarditis but would consider Echo to eval valves given
   HD pt with one + blood Cx. Lower suspician for sinus infection given CT
   findings.  One blood Cx possible, unclear if true bacteremia vs
   contaminant. C diff neg yesterday.  Per primary, lower extremity
   findings unchanged from prior. Given all possibilities, suspect source
   is pulmonary.
   - send induced sputum for cultures
   - consider bronch with BAL
   - repeat blood Cx, f/u sensitivities
   - continue vanc dosed at HD & Zosyn for possible HAP
   - s/s eval, NPO for now given possible aspiration
   - would consider Bactrim until PCP ruled out
   - f/u RUQ u/s
   - cortisol stim test
   - consider TTE to r/o endocarditis
   - f/u ID recs
   - bolus IVF prn
   .
   # MS changes: Pt mildly confused but following commands, seems
   consistent with prior presentations when infected.  Suspect due to
   intermittent hypotension and systemic infection.  Concern for
   aspiration given intermittent confusion
   - aspiration precautions, NPO for now
   - s/s eval
   - d/w family regarding baseline
   .
   # LFT Abnormalites: Elevated LDH, Alk Phos, GGT & Tbili.  Denies any
   RUQ pain and RUQ ultrasound pending.  Differential includes obstructive
   cholestasis, acalculous cholecystitis, hemolysis, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pulm
   process.
   - send induced sputum for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u RUQ u/s
   - f/u hemolysis labs
   .
   # Afib: Pt with h/o Afib on coumadin, intermittently in RVR.  Current
   rates in 110s.  Would prefer to avoid beta blockers given intermittent
   hypotension
   - continue Coumadin, INR pending
   - metoprolol 5mg IV prn persistently elevated rates >120
   - consider standing Metoprolol 12.5mg TID if BPs stable
   .
   # ESRD on HD: complicated renal history s/p failed transplant, apprec
   renal consult.
   - continue HD via fistula
   - continue Calcium Acetate TID
   - continue Prednisone 5mg daily (f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 45**] stim test)

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG surgery, systolic/diastolic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and a failed renal transplant. He is currently admitted to the ICU with intermittent hypotension, fever, and multiple systemic infections. The patient has been experiencing confusion, cough, infiltrates on chest X-ray, elevated liver enzymes, and concerns for possible aspiration, pulmonary infection (PCP), endocarditis, and sinus infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever/Hypotension: The patient's intermittent hypotension and trending up fever curve may indicate adrenal insufficiency or multiple infectious sources, including cellulitis, obstructive cholestasis, pneumonia, or pulmonary coccidioidomycosis.
2. MS changes: The patient's mild confusion and intermittent hypotension suggest possible aspiration and compromised mental status due to systemic infection.
3. LFT abnormalities: Elevated liver enzymes (LDH, Alk Phos, GGT, and bilirubin) could be indicative of obstructive cholestasis, acalculous cholecystitis, hemolysis, or pulmonary processes such as PCP or a pulmonary embolism.
4. Afib: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with intermittent rapid ventricular response raises concerns for potential complications associated with this arrhythmia.

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), systolic/diastolic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD HD), and a failed renal transplant in 2003. The patient is on a prednisone taper and has a history of Clostridium difficile infection, which was treated with oral vancomycin. 

The patient was admitted with transient hypotension, malnutrition, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and fever. On admission, the patient had a temperature of 38.1°C, blood pressure of 101/52 mmHg, heart rate of 91 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula, and atrial fibrillation.

Physical examination revealed dry mucous membranes, clear oropharynx, supple neck, bronchial breath sounds and expiratory wheezes over the right lower lobe (RLL), rhonchi and crackles over the left lower lobe (LLL) base, tachycardia, irregular rhythm, and murmurs. The abdomen was soft, non-tender, non-distended, with bowel sounds present. The extremities were cool, with dopplerable pedal pulses. Ulcerative lesions were scattered all over the upper and lower"

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a failed renal transplant in 2003. He remains on a prednisone taper. The patient has had previous episodes of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and was transferred with transient hypotension, MS changes, and fever.

The patient presents with fever/hypotension, likely secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. No endocarditis is seen on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), but a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is being considered due to high-grade bacteremia. The patient complains of new left-sided ankle pain with erythema, effusion, and pustules on the left lower extremity, concerning for septic joint. There is no true fever overnight.

The patient's mental status has improved significantly, likely secondary to MRSA bacteremia. Aspiration precautions, failed speech, and swallow dysphagia with thick liquids are recommended.

The patient has liver function abnormalities with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. A differential diagnosis includes obstructive cholestasis, acalculous cholecyst"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a failed renal transplant. The patient is currently experiencing dysphagia, renal failure, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, fever of unknown origin, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever of unknown origin (FUO) - The patient has been experiencing fever, but the source has not been identified. This could be due to an infection, such as a nosocomial infection or bacteremia. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the fever.

2. MRSA bacteremia - The patient has been treated with vancomycin for possible MRSA bacteremia. This suggests that there may have been a positive blood culture indicating a bacterial infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

3. Liver function abnormalities - The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and bilirubin levels. This could be due to various causes, including medication-induced liver injury, obstructive cholestasis, acalculous cholecystitis, hemolysis, or pulmonary involvement with Pneumocystis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of CAD, ESRD, and AFib, admitted to the hospital with HOTN and MS. He was initially admitted to the floor but developed HOTN again and was transferred to the MICU. Blood culture on 12/28 was positive for MRSA, but subsequent cultures have been negative. The patient failed a systemic sensitivity exam yesterday and has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), for which he received doses of diltiazem and lopressor.

Medical Complications:
1. Staph bacteremia/HOTN/septic shock: The patient initially presented with HOTN and septic shock, which has since resolved. He is currently being treated with vancomycin for bacteremia.
2. Left ankle pain: The patient's left ankle is painful, swollen, warm, and tender, indicating a possible septic joint, gout, or hemarthrosis. Needle aspiration will be necessary to determine the cause.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status needs to be monitored closely due to the use of Coumadin, and it should be held as advised.
4. AFib with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response needs to be managed by increasing the dose of oral metoprolol (lopressor) as he is currently on a low dose.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of CAD, ESRD, and AFib who was admitted to the hospital with HOTN and MS. He was found to have MRSA and received doses of diltiazem and lopressor for AFib with RVR. The patient failed a systemic sensitivity exam and was transferred to the MICU. He has multiple allergies, including hair loss from Mevacor and pravastatin sodium, skin breakdown from adhesive tape, and rash from clindamycin. The patient is currently receiving several medications, including metoprolol, diltiazem, calcium acetate, flovent, amiodarone, prednisone, allopurinol, neurontin, Lipitor, ASA, folate, vancomycin PO, prilosec, vancomycin IV, albuterol/atrovent, midodrine, lopressor, and SSI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Staph bacteremia/HOTN/septic shock: The patient has been treated with vancomycin for bacteremia, but there is a potential risk of developing septic shock due to the presence of staph bacteremia.
2. Left ankle pain: The patient has tender, swollen, and warm left ankle with pain on movement. This could indicate a possible septic joint, gout, or hemarthrosis. Needle aspiration is planned to further evaluate the condition.

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD), and a previous failed renal transplant. He remains on a prednisone taper and has a history of Clostridium difficile infection treated with oral vancomycin.

The patient presents with fever, hypotension, and new left-sided ankle pain with erythema, effusion, and pustules, which are concerning for septic joint or osteomyelitis. There is a high-grade bacteremia, but no endocarditis on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The patient also complains of new left-sided ankle pain with erythema, effusion, and question of pustules on the left lower extremity concerning for septic joint vs. osteomyelitis. The ankle is more likely the source of infection. Cultures have been drawn, and the patient is being treated with vancomycin dosed at hemodialysis, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam for possible other sources of nosocomial infection. Orthopedic consultation is pending for possible joint tap, and an MRI is planned to evaluate for extension of the infection.

The patient's mental status has improved, likely secondary to MRSA bacteremia. As"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and end-stage renal disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU for fever of unknown origin, altered mental status, and liver function abnormalities. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and antipyretics. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 C (100.9 F), heart rate of 149 bpm, blood pressure of 134/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for increased somnolence overnight. 

Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has not been assessed for skin breakdown, which can lead to pressure ulcers or infections.
2. Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute pain and chronic pain, indicating the need for effective pain management.
3. Dysphagia: The patient's swallowing difficulty may increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
4. Renal failure, end stage: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function, potentially requiring dialysis.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's increased somnolence suggests a decline in cognitive function, which could be due to various causes such as infection, medication side effects, or metabolic imbalances.
6. Liver function abnormalities: Elevated liver enzymes indicate liver dysfunction, which can be associated with"

   Assessment and Plan
   Fever/HOTN:  BP has been stable, but is now tachycardic.
   Respiratory distress:  Somewhat SOB, weight is up suggesting fluid
   overload.
   left LE infection:  Will get FFP today to allow for orthopedic
   athrocentesis of ankle.  Will potentially need imaging of LE given
   possibility of soft tissue pus collection with MRI.
   Afib with RVR:  Better controlled HR on dilt drip.
   coagulopathy:  Getting 2U FFP for tap.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, systolic/diastolic heart failure, and failed renal transplant. He was admitted from the floor with high output cardiac output (HOTN) and fevers. The patient's ankle swelling ruptured and is draining pus. He feels shortness of breath (SOB) and wheezing, with a temperature of 101.6.

Medical Complications:
1. Septicemia: The presence of fever, drainage from the ankle wound, and elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible infection leading to septicemia.
2. Left lower extremity (LE) infection: The ankle swelling has ruptured, resulting in drainage of pus. This indicates a localized infection in the left leg.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's weight gain and respiratory distress suggest fluid overload, which can be caused by inadequate fluid management in the ICU.
4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR): The patient's heart rate is elevated, indicating atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a bleeding tendency.
6. Respiratory distress: The patient's wheezing and shortness of breath suggest respiratory distress, which may be due to underlying heart failure or a pulmonary infection.

   bottles positive from [**2151-12-28**].  No endocarditis on TTE, consider TEE
   given high grade bacteremia.  However, the patient also complains of
   new left sided ankle pain with erythema, effusion and question of
   pustules on left lower extremity concerning for septic joint vs.
   osteomylelitis.  Febrile this morning on rounds, CXR consistent with
   previous X rays, making ankle more likely source

   - f/u ID recs
   - Continue vancomycin dosed at HD, cipro and zosyn for possible other
   sources of nosocomial infection
   - Consult Ortho for possible joint tap-will give FFP today to try to
   get INR below 2.0
   - MRI today to eval for extension

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a complex medical history including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presents with fever, hypotension, and signs of sepsis. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia and irregular heart rhythm. Physical examination reveals diffuse ecchymoses, cool extremities, pedal pulses that are dopplerable, ulcerative lesions on the upper and lower extremities, erythema, edema, and warmth over the lateral ankle, along with pustules rupturing with purulent material.

The patient has elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, indicating an inflammatory response. Blood cultures have been obtained and are pending. The patient's blood glucose levels are also elevated.

The patient's mental status has improved since admission, likely due to treatment for MRSA bacteremia. However, he remains febrile, and there is concern for a potential joint infection or osteomyelitis in the left ankle. An MRI has been ordered to evaluate for extension of the infection.

The patient's liver function tests show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, which may indicate liver dysfunction. Renal function tests reveal impaired renal function, consistent with ESRD.

The patient is currently receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/t"
