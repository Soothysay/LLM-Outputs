","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with respiratory distress and hypoxemia. They have a history of fever, cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, and no abdominal pain. The patient is receiving Heparin sodium infusion, as well as other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 143/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool face tent with supplemental oxygen.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows normal sinus rhythm and a fluid balance of 52 mL total in, with a urine output of 180 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has not received any blood products. Respiratory support is being provided through the use of an aerosol-cool face tent with supplemental oxygen. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.31.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is overweight/obese, with PERRL eyes, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, normal heart sounds, and bilateral lower extremity edema absent. Muscle wasting is noted, but skin and neurologic assessments are not performed.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with decreased serum glucose and potassium levels. Other lab values,"

   HPI:
   85 y/o with HTN, paroxsymal afib admitted to OSH on [**10-3**] with
   abdominal pain.   He was found to have cecal volvulus requiring a
   laparotomy on [**10-4**] with R hemicolectomy and primary anastmosis.
   Post-operatively he developed afib with RVR, and given dilt and IV
   heparin. Because of an ileus he was given TPN.  He returned to the OR
   on [**10-12**] for an ex-lap with lysis of adhesions, partial colectomy and
   colostomy. The pathology showed mucosal ischmia and a CTA of the abomen
   was unremarkable.  Post operatively he again developed afib with RVR
   and hypotension requiring DC cardioversion. He received pressors
   perioperatively. He was extubated on [**10-14**] then reintubated [**10-19**]
   because of dyspnea and  unresponsiveness. ABG showed CO2 retention. He
   went back into afib during this episode. He was extubated [**10-22**] and
   treated with BiPap until today. He spiked a fever on [**10-21**] with sputum
   culture positive for pseudomonas and was placed on Meropenem. Today,
   his family requested a transfer.
   Currently, he complains of cough but no dyspnea at rest and he denies
   abdominal pain. He has an extremely weak voice since his intubations.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the hospital due to abdominal pain and was found to have cecal volvulus requiring a laparotomy on [**10-4**]. During the surgery, a right hemicolectomy and primary anastomosis were performed. Post-operatively, he developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was given diltiazem and intravenous heparin. Due to ileus, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was initiated. He underwent another operation on [**10-12**] for exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions, partial colectomy, and colostomy. The pathology showed mucosal ischemia and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the abdomen was unremarkable. Post-operatively, he again developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension requiring direct current (DC) cardioversion. Pressors were used perioperatively. He was extubated on [**10-14**] but reintubated on [**10-19**] due to dyspnea and unresponsiveness. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed CO2 retention. He went back into atrial fibrillation during this episode. He was extubated on [**10-22**] and treated with bilevel"

   Fever / leukocytosis
 possible culprits include respiratory tract
   versus intra-abdominal. Being covered currently for both sources. Also
   on valgan  for oral herpetic lesions
   Bowel ischemia
 original surgery was for volvulus though path from
   second surgery suggested ischemia. Continue supportive care and advance

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and found to have cecal volvulus, which required a laparotomy with right hemicolectomy and primary anastomosis. Post-operatively, he developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was given diltiazem and intravenous heparin. Due to an ileus, he was started on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). He underwent another surgery for exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions, partial colectomy, and colostomy. Pathology showed mucosal ischemia and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the abdomen was unremarkable. Post-operatively, he again developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension requiring direct current cardioversion. He received pressors perioperatively. He was extubated on [date] but reintubated on [date] due to dyspnea and unresponsiveness. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed carbon dioxide retention. He went back into atrial fibrillation during this episode. He was extubated on [date] and treated with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPap) until today. He spiked a fever on [date] with sputum culture positive for Pseudomonas and was placed on meropenem. The patient complains of cough but no dyspnea at rest and denies abdominal pain. He has an extremely weak voice since his intubations. The patient's family requested a transfer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress/hypoxemia: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia may be due to a combination of hospital-acquired pneumonia and excess volume. The plan is to continue antibiotics and diuretics.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient has had recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR. He was cardioverted and started on amiodarone, and will continue for now. He is also being anticoagulated with intravenous heparin.
3. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, which could be caused by respiratory tract infection or intra-abdominal infection. He is currently being covered for both sources with antibiotics.
4. Bowel ischemia: The patient's original surgery was for volvulus, but pathology from the second surgery suggested ischemia. Supportive care and advancement of diet will continue.
5. ICU Care: The patient is receiving TPN, prophylactic anticoagulation, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis."

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. They have a history of atrial fibrillation and are currently experiencing respiratory failure. The patient also has impaired skin integrity and small bowel obstruction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's pre-existing condition of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of complications such as stroke or heart failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to complications like pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or hypoxemia.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, or decreased mobility.
4. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient has small bowel obstruction, which can lead to complications like bowel ischemia, perforation, or necrosis if not managed properly.
5. Medication Reactions: Since the patient has no known drug allergies, there is a possibility of adverse reactions or interactions with medications administered in the ICU.
6. Infection: Given the patient's compromised immune state, there is an increased risk of infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and other risk factors can increase the risk of developing DVT in the ICU.

These potential medical complications need to be closely monitored and managed to ensure the patient's well-being"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and was found to have cecal volvulus. He underwent two bowel resections and experienced complications such as respiratory distress, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, fever, mild leukocytosis, bowel ischemia, and oral herpes-like lesions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient required intubation for hypercapnia, indicating a possible respiratory failure or difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient had episodes of AFib with RVR, which can lead to inadequate heart pumping, increased risk of blood clots, and potential complications like stroke.
3. Infections: The patient has positive cultures for pseudomonas, ESBL E. coli, and enterococcus. These infections can cause systemic illness and may require appropriate antibiotic therapy.
4. Bowel Ischemia: Despite bowel resections, the patient still shows signs of potential ongoing ischemia. This can lead to further complications such as bowel necrosis or perforation.
5. Oral Herpes-like Lesion: The presence of an oral herpes-like lesion may indicate a viral infection, which can be treated with antiviral medication.
6. Psychiatric Issues: The patient's psychiatric history and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and was found to have cecal volvulus, requiring bowel resection. The patient's course has been complicated by respiratory distress, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and positive cultures for pseudomonas and ESBL E. coli. The patient has undergone cardioversion and is currently on amiodarone. He also has a history of syncope from significant bradycardia due to calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient previously experienced respiratory distress and was intubated for hypercapnia. There is a risk of recurrence, especially if the patient's condition worsens or if there are any complications related to sedation or pain management.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient has ongoing AFib with RVR despite cardioversion. This can lead to hemodynamic instability and the need for further interventions, such as additional cardioversion or medication adjustments.
3. Infection: The patient has positive cultures for pseudomonas and ESBL E. coli, indicating a potential bacterial infection. This could result in sepsis or localized infections, requiring appropriate antibiotic therapy and source control measures.
4. Bowel Ischemia: The patient had bowel resections due"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with cecal volvulus and had a complicated hospital stay, including reoperation for ischemic bowel and adhesions, emergency cardioversion for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute kidney injury (now resolved), infection, and reintubation for hypercapnea. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation via face tent and is showing signs of respiratory distress. He also has right and left lower extremity edema, and his vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 108/68 mmHg to 150/74 mmHg, heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's current respiratory distress may worsen if he is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation while on mechanical ventilation.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with RVR can lead to further complications such as stroke or heart failure if not properly managed.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and fever indicate the presence of an infection, which could potentially progress to sepsis if not treated promptly and effectively.
4. Bowel Ischemia: The patient's history of bowel ischemia and subsequent surgeries increases the risk of further complications related to his gastrointestinal system.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and edema in the lower extremities put him at an increased risk for developing DVT.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU for cecal volvulus and underwent reoperation for ischemic bowel and adhesions. The patient experienced a complicated hospital stay including emergent cardioversion for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute respiratory failure (now resolved), infection, and reintubation for hypercapnea. The patient has been extubated and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient was reintubated for hypercapnea and somnolence, likely related to volume overload and/or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and following up with appropriate interventions are necessary.

2. Pseudomonas Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient is on cefepime for possible Pseudomonas HAP. It is important to follow sensitivity results and continue the antibiotic as prescribed.

3. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of heart failure, and his vital signs show low blood pressure and fluid overload. Diuretic therapy and further evaluation with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) are recommended.

4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient underwent cardioversion and is currently maintained on amiodarone. It is important to continue antiarrhythmic therapy"

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation who presented to the hospital with abdominal pain. He was found to have cecal volvulus and underwent an ileocolectomy on October 4th. His course was complicated by a bowel obstruction, and he subsequently had a repeat resection and ileal-to-transverse colon anastomosis on October 12th. He also developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which required cardioversion. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further care. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 114/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. He is currently in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 100s-110s. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.4 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin at 10.3 g/dL, normal platelet count of 141 K/uL, and elevated creatinine at 1.0 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits. 

The patient has known positive cultures including sputum culture with pseudomonas and intraoperative wound cultures with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and enterococcus. He has completed treatment for pseudomonas and ESBL E. coli with meropenem, but further treatment for enterococcus is being held as it has been 10 days since the culture. 

The patient has a history of cecal volvulus, for which he has undergone two bowel resections. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the abdomen showed good flow in the proximal superior mesenteric artery, inferior mesenteric artery, and celiac axis. Surgery consulted agrees that bowel is viable. 

The patient's respiratory distress has resolved, and he is breathing well on a nasal cannula. He is currently on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation and on heparin drip. He also has an oral herpes-like lesion, for which a viral culture is pending, and he is being started on valacyclovir. 

The patient is taking citalopram for psychiatric reasons and is not compliant with it at home. His hoarseness is likely due to recent intubation, but if it does not resolve in the next few days, an ENT consult may be considered. 

The patient's follow-up recommendations include checking for Clostridium difficile infection, covering pseudomonas and ESBL E. coli with meropenem, holding treatment for enterococcus, advancing his diet as tolerated, evaluating by speech and swallow, and holding on reglan as he is experiencing diarrhea.

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He was admitted to the hospital on [**2140-10-03**] for abdominal pain and was found to have cecal volvulus. He underwent an ileocolectomy on [**10-04**] and later experienced complications such as bowel obstruction. The patient then went back to the operating room on [**10-12**] for a repeat resection and ileal to transverse colons anastomosis. He developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, requiring cardioversion and was transferred to another hospital for further care.

The patient's current condition includes fever, mild leukocytosis, and known positive cultures including sputum with pseudomonas and intraoperative wound cultures with ESBL and enterococcus. His chest CT from [**10-19**] showed no pulmonary infiltrate. The patient has completed broad-spectrum antibiotics, covering ESBL E. coli with meropenem, and is currently on day 4 of an 8-day course.

The patient has a history of cecal volvulus and has undergone bowel resections twice. There are currently no surgical issues, and the patient is tolerating a full diet. The surgical team will provide further recommendations.

The patient previously experienced respiratory distress and was intubated for hypercapnia at OSH. However, his"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and small bowel obstruction. The patient is currently on heparin sodium infusion, other ICU medications, and antibiotics. His vital signs are stable, but he has a low oxygen saturation level of 92%. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 233 mL. He is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has multiple lines inserted, including a PICC line and a 20-gauge line. The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk due to immobility and the presence of multiple lines.
2. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk due to impaired skin integrity and prolonged ICU stay.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's low oxygen saturation level and respiratory support indicate a potential risk for VAP.
4. Bleeding: The patient is on heparin sodium infusion, which increases the risk of bleeding.
5. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may suggest an underlying infection.
6. Liver dysfunction: The abnormal liver function tests indicate possible liver dysfunction"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation who was admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain. He was found to have cecal volvulus in the operating room and underwent two bowel resections. The patient's course has been complicated by respiratory distress, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and fever. He is currently in the ICU for monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient previously experienced respiratory distress and was intubated twice. He is currently breathing comfortably on 3L nasal cannula.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR): The patient has ongoing episodes of AFib with a rate of 100s-110s. He underwent cardioversion and is being maintained on amiodarone.
3. Infection: The patient has known positive cultures including sputum with pseudomonas and intraoperative wound cultures with ESBL and enterococcus. He is being covered for pseudomonas and ESBL E. coli with meropenem, and enterococcus is being held as he is 10 days out from the culture.
4. Bowel ischemia: The patient had bowel resections due to bowel ischemia. A CT angiography of the abdomen showed good flow in the proximal superior mesenteric artery, flow in the inferior mesenteric artery, and celiac axis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with cecal volvulus and underwent a complicated hospital stay, including reoperation for ischemic bowel and adhesions. The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requiring emergent cardioversion, acute renal failure (now resolved), infection, and reintubation for hypercapnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient was reintubated at OSH for hypercapnea and somnolence, likely related to volume overload +/- ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The plan is to follow oxygen saturation levels and wean as tolerated, continue last name (un) x 8 days for possible Pseudomonas hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and diurese as tolerated.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient underwent cardioversion and is now maintained on amiodarone. He will continue amiodarone and heparin infusion, transitioning to coumadin.
3. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient is being treated with meropenem for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli and enterococcus from intraoperative surgical culture and PsA. The plan is to complete an 8-day course of meropenem, follow up on cultures, and finish the course of valganciclovir (until 10/28) for oral herpetic lesions.
4. Bowel Ischemia post-resection: The patient had surgery consult with no ischemic/vascular issues. The plan is to continue with full diet and monitor closely.
5. ICU Care: The patient's nutrition is being provided with a full diet, and there is ongoing monitoring for glycemic control. He has two lines inserted, a PICC line and a 20-gauge line. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is being administered. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor soon."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o with HTN, HLD, Afib admitted with cecal volvulus and subsequent
   complicated hospital stay including reoperation for ischemic bowel and
   adhesions, afib with RVR requiring emergent cardioversion, ARF (now
   resolved), infection, and reintubation for hypercapnea.
   # Hypoxemia: Reitubated for hypercapnea and somnolence, likely related
   to volume overload +/- VAP
 extubated [**10-22**]. Doing well now on NC.
   - Follow sats, wean as tolerated
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] x 8 days for possible Pseudomonas HAP.
   - Diurese as tolerated
   # A fib with RVR: S/p cardioversion. Maintained on amio.  In SR now.
   - Continue amio, heparin gtt
 transition to coumadin
   # Fever / leukocytosis:
   - Meropenem for ESBL E. coli and enterococcus from introp surgical
   culture and PsA.  Plan for 8 days.
   - F/u our cultures
   - Finish course of valganciclovir (until [**10-28**]) for oral herpetic
   lesions
   # Bowel ischemia s/p resection x 2:
   - Sugery consult
 no ischemic/vascular issues

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with cecal volvulus and underwent a complicated hospital stay including reoperation for ischemic bowel and adhesions, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requiring emergent cardioversion, acute renal failure (resolved), infection, and reintubation for hypercapnea. The patient is currently on noninvasive ventilation and is expected to be weaned as tolerated. He is being treated with meropenem for possible Pseudomonas hospital-acquired pneumonia, diuretics for volume overload, amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, and heparin for anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient may continue to experience difficulties with oxygenation due to underlying respiratory issues and potential volume overload.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be closely monitored for any signs of recurrence or worsening ventricular response rate.
3. Infection: The patient is currently being treated with meropenem for an infection caused by ESBL E. coli and enterococcus. It is important to follow up with cultures and complete the full course of antibiotics.
4. Bowel Ischemia: The patient had undergone resection twice for bowel ischemia, and any complications related to the surgery should be closely monitored.
