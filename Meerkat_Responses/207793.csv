","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. She presents with nausea and vomiting and has severe hyponatremia, likely secondary to Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH). The patient's sodium levels are corrected to 118 and then fell to 115. The cause of hyponatremia is multifactorial, including recent reinitiation of paxil, HCTZ use, likely pulmonary infection, macrolide use, and pain from her left wrist fracture.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 128/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. She is on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other medications for bronchitis/pneumonia, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism/hypoparathyroidism, and benzodiazepine usage.

The patient has a new superimposed distal left radial fracture in addition to her previous distal radial fracture treated with volar plate and screws. There is also a slight deformation of the volar plate. Plastics has evaluated the patient and she will need surgical repair of the fracture.

The patient's laboratory results show hyponatremia (sodium of 97 mg/dL), hypokalemia (potassium of 3.9 mEq/L), slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 30.9 mg/dL, and creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL. Her white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 8.6 K/uL, and her platelet count is 282 K/uL. Troponin-T is less than 0.01, indicating no cardiac damage.

The patient's chest X-ray reveals a deformity of the distal left radius consistent with a new superimposed distal left radial fracture in a patient with a previous distal radial fracture treated by volar plate and screws. There is also a slight deformation of the volar plate.

The plan includes addressing the electrolyte and fluid disorder, specifically the hyponatremia/SIADH. The cause is likely multifactorial given her recent paxil reinitiation, HCTZ use, likely pulmonary infection, macrolide use, and pain secondary to her left wrist fracture. Sodium correction will be continued, and if it continues to fall, hypertonic saline will be resumed. Fluid restriction is recommended, along with serial neuro checks and repeat urine osmolality.

Regarding the wrist fracture, the patient will need surgical repair when she is stable. Pain management will be provided, and a wrist splint will be applied. For bronchitis/pneumonia, levoflox"

   1- Hyponatremia/SIADH:  Cause is likely multifactorial given her recent
   paxil reinitiation, HCTZ, likely pulmonary infection, macrolide use and
   pain secondary to her left wrist fracture.  Most recent sodium 127 s/p
   6 hrs of hypertonic saline at 32cc/hr overnight.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with an altered mental status, likely secondary to hypoxia and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's sodium levels have been fluctuating, with a current reading of 118, which indicates hyponatremia. Hypertonic saline was administered but did not correct the sodium levels. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, maintaining a SpO2 of 95%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/51 to 165/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and temperature within normal limits.

Physical examination findings are limited due to the patient's unresponsiveness and inability to assess certain vital signs such as peripheral pulses and skin condition. Imaging shows no acute processes or signs of congestion, but does reveal a moderately widened and elongated thoracic aorta.

Laboratory results indicate elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels at 259 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine at 1.2 mg/dL, low potassium levels at 3.1 mEq/L, and low magnesium levels at 1.7 mg/dL. Other lab values including white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, glucose levels, and cardiac enzymes appear within normal ranges.

The patient is receiving various medications including lorazepam for sedation, heparin"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. She presents with nausea, vomiting, severe hyponatremia, and a left wrist fracture. The patient's sodium levels have been fluctuating, corrected to 118 and then fell to 115. The cause of hyponatremia is likely multifactorial due to recent paxil reinitiation, HCTZ use, likely pulmonary infection, macrolide use, and pain from her left wrist fracture. Fluid restriction, holding offending agents (paxil), holding hypertonic saline, repleting potassium PO, serial neuro checks, and repeat urine osms have been initiated. The patient's mental status has improved significantly, but she still requires close monitoring. 

The patient will need surgical repair for her wrist fracture. She is also being treated for bronchitis/pneumonia with levofloxacin and will have a repeat CXR. Anemia is suspected due to fluid shifts, and the patient's Hct will be checked. The patient's hypertension is currently uncontrolled, and she will restart Valsartan in the morning while holding HCTZ. Her hypothyroidism/hypoparathyroidism will continue to be managed with levothyroxine and vitamin D supplementation. The patient's benzodiazepine usage is being monitored. 

No evidence of acute process on CXR. Plastics have evaluated the patient, and she is not ready for surgery yet. The patient's arterial line was inserted on 04/05/2119 at 09:54 PM."

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. She presents with nausea, vomiting, severe hyponatremia (low sodium levels), and a left wrist fracture. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including altered elimination related to constipation, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypotonia, fracture, bronchitis/pneumonia, anemia, hypertension, and hypothyroidism/hypoparathyroidism. She is currently receiving various treatments and medications for these conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has a slightly elevated heart rate. Her sodium levels have been corrected to 118 and then fell to 115. Fluid restriction has been implemented, and hypertonic saline will be resumed at 32 cc/hr if sodium continues to fall. The patient's mental status has improved after repletion of potassium. She requires surgical repair for her wrist fracture and is being managed with pain medication and splinting. Levofloxacin has been prescribed for bronchitis/pneumonia, and a repeat chest X-ray is planned. Anemia is likely due to fluid shifts, and the patient's hypertension is currently uncontrolled. She will continue receiving levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and vitamin D supplementation for hypoparathyroidism. Benzodiazepine usage is being monitored, and the patient's new T-wave inversion on EKG is under evaluation"
