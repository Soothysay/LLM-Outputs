   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   18 yoF with complicated neurologic history & demyelinating disease,
   hospital course complicated by b/l PE without hemodynamic compromise,
   as well as coag neg staph bactermia.  Transferred to the ICU today for
   tachycardia to 160 and desaturations to mid 80's in setting of likley
   aggitation.
   .
   (#) TACHYCARDIA: has has sinus tach in the 120-130's since arriving tot
   he ICU; was briefly to the 150-160's when she was having a seizure and
   another time when her family was in the room.  Likely ST from PE's.  No
   evidence of volume depletion on exam or labs; going to restart tube
   feeds.  Anxiety may be contributing; on standing clonazepam.  Was
   bactermic, but on vanco without fever or WBC; no evidence now of
   uncontrolled infection driving HR.  Pain may also be contributing from
   general immobilization or some other process (pt non-verbal).  Last TSH
   nml on [**10-25**].
   -- f/u  repeat EKG in am
   -- no need for beta-blocker currently as sinus tach, likely
   compensatory
   -- cont clonazepam for anxiety; frequent reassurance may help though pt
   not able to speak back.
   -- cont tube feeds; low threshold for additional maintenance fluids,
   though will not start now
   -- consider pain control with low dose morphine PRN (though likely not
   primary driver of sinus tach)
   -- cont treatment of PE with heparin ggt; would consider rescanning for
   tx with thrombolytics if becomes hemodynamically unstable.
   -- consider repeating TSH (though would eb difficult to interpret in
   setting of acute illness)
   .
   (#) DESATURATION: resolved; in mid to upper 90's on room air; satted
   briefly while aggitated; tolerated placement of CVL while flat fairly
   well.  No evidence of PNA or extension of PE's currently.  Had another
   brief episode unsustained episode of desat to 60s unprovoked.
   -- cont to treat PE
   -- cont to monitor
   .
   (#) MS, ENCEPHALOPATHY: no clear cause; intermittently seizing; obvious
   CNS infections have been ruled out on LP; JCV and HIV also negative; sx
   been progressively getting worse since being here.  Possibly a delirium
   from hospitalization/pain/anxiety on top of underlying neuro process,
   though pt fairly young and not considered high risk for hospital
   delirium.  no gross elecrolyte or lab abnormalities.
   -- neuro wants repeat MRI under GA which cannot be scheduled until
   [**Name (NI) 501**] (pt requires general anesthesia)
   -- psych and neuro following
   -- zyprexa PRN for aggitation
   (#) PE's:
   -- on heparin ggt now that access has been re-established
   -- will need coumadin 3-6 months
   .
   (#) HTN: listed as a prior dx in H&P, thoguh not on home med list; BP
   has been ~150/80 since being in the ICU
   -- on captopril 6.25 TID
   -- might consider changing from ACE I (afterload reduction) to a CCB or
   other given risk of reflex tachycardia
   .
   (#) COAG NEG STAPH BACTERMIA: PICC was pulled yesterday; on vancomcyin
   (1750 mg IV BID); ID followed
   -- cont vanco for two week course; ? whether needs TTE
   -- will check trough before next 4th dose
   -- ID recs
   -- f/u pending cultures
   (#) SEIZURE: dilantin currently at tx levels; albumin normal.  Seizures
   seem to be the genralize tonic clonic type (witnessed during ICU
   stay).  Seizures are frequent movements small twitches or jerking
   movements of facial muscles or upper and lower extremities.
   -- cont dilantin 200/300
   -- ativan PRN for seizure with concern for injury
   -- seizure precautions
   -- neurology and psych following
   .
   (#) DEMYELINATING DISEASE NOS: being followed by neurology; does not
   have clear diagnosis
   -- neurology wanted repeat MRI under GA (given aggiation); per
   scheduling tech, next available is [**Name (NI) 501**] [**11-13**]
   -- continue solumderol 125 mg QID taper per neuro
   -- FSG QID + SSI PRN while on solumedrol

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease, and their hospital course has been complicated by bilateral PE without hemodynamic compromise. This indicates that the patient is at risk for further pulmonary embolisms.

2. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to a combination of factors such as hospitalization, pain, anxiety, and an underlying neurological process. It is important to monitor the patient's mental status closely and consider repeat imaging or further evaluation by neurology and psychiatry.

3. Seizures: The patient has had several episodes of seizures, which seem to be generalized tonic-clonic in nature. This could be related to the underlying demyelinating disease or a complication of the hospitalization. The patient is currently on dilantin for seizure control, but ongoing monitoring and adjustment of the medication may be necessary.

4. Coag-Negative Staph Bacteremia: The patient has a documented coag-negative staph bacteremia, which requires ongoing treatment with vancomycin. Close follow-up with infectious disease is necessary to ensure appropriate management of this infection.

5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, although it is not currently on their home medication list. Their blood pressure has been around 150/"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female with a complicated neurological history and demyelinating disease. She has been hospitalized for bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise, as well as coag-negative staph bacteremia. 

The patient was transferred to the ICU for tachycardia to 160s and desaturations to mid 80's in the setting of likely agitation. Upon arrival, the patient experienced multiple medical complications, including seizures and status epilepticus, altered mental status (not delirium), and a new small pericardial effusion and right pleural effusion on imaging.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, with a heart rate ranging from 115-145 beats per minute. Her blood pressure is within normal limits, and her respiratory rate is slightly elevated. Her oxygen saturation is mostly in the mid 90's, but she had a brief episode of desaturation to the 60s unprovoked.

Laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose, and electrolyte levels. However, her platelet count is elevated at 272 K/uL, and her coagulation profile shows prolonged prothrombin time (PTT) and partial thromboplastin time (PT/INR) due to heparin therapy. Imaging reveals a small hematoma at the puncture site and a small pericard"

 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS: As above.

 SINUS TACHYCARDIA:  Still concerned about component of anxiety; more
   emotionally labile overnight, crying.  Consider haldol.  Doesn't seem
   clinically dry.  Also has underlying PEs.  Sats stable, doubt recurrent
   PE.  If she becomes more labile or has noted desaturations will
   consider repeat scan to evaluate for recurrent PE.  Add nodal [**Doctor Last Name **].

 PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  Adjusting heparin dosing given elevated PTT.
   Repeat labs this afternoon.
 TRANSIENT DESTURATIONS:  Typically in setting of seizure-like
   activity, albeit doesn't happen with all observed movements.
 LINE INFECTION:  Being treated empirically with vanco albeit cultures
   growing coag negative staph.  Following levels.  Echo without evidence
   of vegetations.  ID following.
OPTIC NEURITIS:  Continues methylprednisolone for empiric treatment of
   optic neuritis.

   (#) TACHYCARDIA: has  sinus tach in the 120-130's since arriving to the
   ICU; was briefly to the 150-160's when people are present or during
   seizure like activity.  Contributing to tachycardia are bilateral PEs,
   bacteremia, and baseline bacteria.  There is no evidence of volume
   depletion on exam or labs; Anxiety may be contributing; on standing
   clonazepam.  Was bactermic, but on vanco without fever or WBC.   Pain
   may also be contributing from general immobilization or some other
   process (pt non-verbal).  Last TSH nml on [**10-25**].

   -- cont treatment of PE with heparin ggt
   (#) DESATURATION: resolved; in mid to upper 90's on room air; satted
   briefly while aggitated; tolerated placement of CVL while flat fairly
   well.  No evidence of PNA or extension of PE's currently.  Had another
   brief episode unsustained episode of desat to 60s unprovoked.
   -- cont to treat PE

   (#) MS, ENCEPHALOPATHY: no clear cause; intermittently seizing; obvious
   CNS infections have been ruled out on LP; JCV and HIV also negative; sx
   been progressively getting worse since being here.  Possibly a delirium
   from hospitalization/pain/anxiety on top of underlying neuro process,
   though pt fairly young and not considered high risk for hospital
   delirium.  no gross elecrolyte or lab abnormalities.
   -- neuro wants repeat MRI, will discuss with them when

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease. She has been admitted to the ICU due to tachycardia to 160 and desaturations to mid 80's in the setting of likely agitation.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has had a fever since admission without a clear source identified.

2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has had bilateral PEs without hemodynamic compromise. She is being treated with heparin sodium and will need coumadin for an extended period.

3. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, which has been progressively worsening since being in the ICU. This may be due to hospitalization, pain, anxiety, or an underlying neurologic process. Repeat MRI is planned to further evaluate the cause.

4. Seizure with status epilepticus: The patient has been experiencing generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which seem to be frequent movements of facial muscles or upper and lower extremities. She is currently on dilantin at therapeutic levels, and seizure precautions are in place.

5. Coag-negative staph bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing infection with coag-negative staphylococcus bacteremia. She is on vancomycin and will continue the treatment for a two-week course.

6. Hypertension: The patient has a"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated neurological history and demyelinating disease. She has been admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and desaturations in the setting of likely agitation. The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had persistent fever despite being on appropriate antibiotics for coag-negative staphylococcus bacteremia. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of the fever.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of bilateral PEs without hemodynamic compromise. She is currently being treated with heparin sodium and will require long-term anticoagulation with coumadin.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing seizures and altered mental status, which may be due to encephalopathy. The cause of the encephalopathy is unclear, and further evaluation is necessary. Repeat MRI is recommended.

4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and her blood pressure has been around 150/80 since being in the ICU. She has been started on metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] to control her blood pressure.

5. Coag-Negative Staph Bacteremia: The patient was previously bacteremic with coag-negative staphylococcus. She is currently on vancomycin (1750 mg IV BID) and will continue this medication"

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease. She has been hospitalized for bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise, as well as coag-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia. The patient was transferred to the ICU for tachycardia and desaturations in the setting of likely agitation and observation peri-intubation for an MRI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever, Unknown Origin (FUO, Hypothermia, Pyrexia): The patient has a fever, and the source has not yet been identified. This can lead to further complications such as sepsis or multi-organ dysfunction.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has had two episodes of PE. The first one was without hemodynamic compromise, but it can progress to a more severe form known as massive PE, which can cause shock and death. Continuous monitoring and treatment with heparin are necessary to prevent further clot formation.

3. Altered Mental Status (Not Delirium): The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to various factors including the underlying demyelinating disease, hospitalization, pain, anxiety, or seizures. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's neurological condition and follow-up with neurology.

4. Seizure, With Status Epilepticus: The patient has been seizing, and the type of seizures is described as generalized"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease. She has been admitted to the ICU due to tachycardia and desaturations. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), coag-negative staph bacteremia, and seizure activity. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing sinus tachycardia in the 120-130's since arriving at the ICU, with spikes to the 150-160's during agitation and convulsive activity. Possible underlying causes include bilateral PE, bacteremia, anxiety, agitation, and convulsive activity.
2. Desaturation: The patient has had episodes of desaturation, which have resolved and currently remains in the mid to upper 90's on room air. This could be due to PE or other factors.
3. Altered Mental Status/Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing intermittent seizures and encephalopathy with no clear cause. Gross electrolyte or lab abnormalities have been ruled out, and possible causes include hospitalization-related delirium or an underlying neurologic process.
4. Coag-Negative Staph Bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing infection caused by coag-negative staphylococcus. She is currently being treated with vancomycin, and her PICC line has been removed due to concern for line"

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old female with a complicated neurological history and demyelinating disease. She was admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and desaturation, and she underwent an MRI. The patient has been experiencing seizures, and her symptoms have been progressively worsening. She has ruled out obvious CNS infections, including HIV and JCV. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, receiving propofol for sedation. She is being treated for bacteremia with vancomycin, as well as for pulmonary embolism (PE) with heparin. The patient's blood pressure is controlled with metoprolol. She has a history of hypertension but is not currently on home medication. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MS/Encephalopathy: The patient has been intermittently seizing and experiencing worsening symptoms since admission. It is possible that she may develop further complications related to her underlying neurological condition.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing sinus tachycardia in the range of 120-160 bpm, which can be caused by various factors such as anxiety, agitation, convulsive activity, and bilateral PE.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has a growing infection caused by methicillin-sensitive coag-negative staphylococcus in her PICC line. This may lead to further complications if not appropriately treated.
4. PE: The patient has been diagnosed with bilateral PE"

- The patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated neurological history and demyelinating disease.
- She was admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and desaturation in the setting of likely agitation and observation peri-intubation for an MRI.
- The patient has been intermittently seizing, with obvious CNS infections ruled out on LP. JCV and HIV tests are negative.
- Her symptoms have been progressively worsening since being in the hospital.
- The patient has bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), without hemodynamic compromise, as well as coag-negative staph bacteremia.
- She was intubated yesterday and underwent an MRI, with results pending today.
- Psych and neuro follow-ups are ongoing with no new recommendations.
- Zyprexa is being used PRN for agitation.
- ID panel of tests is pending, and urine tox screening could be considered.
- The patient has sinus tachycardia in the 120-130's since arriving in the ICU, with spikes to the 150-160's during agitation and convulsive activity.
- Possible underlying causes include bilateral PE, bacteremia, anxiety, agitation, and convulsive activity.
- No evidence of volume depletion is observed on exam or labs. The last TSH was normal on [**10-25**].
- Clonazepam is being continued for anxiety, and frequent"

   1. No definite evidence for intramedullary abnormal enhancement or
   abnormal T2 hyperintensity to suggest multiple sclerosis plaques.
   2. Left psoas muscles and right posterior paraspinal muscle fluid-fluid
   levels, likely represent intramuscular hematomas with surrounding
   inflammation of the muscles. In presence of signs of infection,
   hemorrhagic abcesses cannot
   be excluded.
   3. New large cystic lesion within the perisplenic region, incompletely
   characterized on this examination. This can represent the stomach,
   however,
   cystic lesion other than this cannot be excluded. CT scan of the
   abdomen is
   recommended.
   4. New right upper lobe opacification. Differential diagnostic
   considerations would include right upper lobe atelectasis or pneumonia.
   Given
   the acuity of this lesion, mass lesion is unlikely. Right basilar lower
   lobe
   segmental dependent atelectasis versus aspiration pneumonia.
   MRI Head: 1. Interval development of a heterogeneous FLAIR
   hyperintensity within the
   right cerebral peduncle. Interval decrease in size of the left parietal
   subcortical white matter hyperintensity and stable bilateral forceps
   major,
   splenium, and right cerebellar peduncle/basis pons FLAIR
   hyperintensity. This can be seen demyelinating processes such as
   multiple sclerosis or [**Year (4 digits) 9255**].
   2. Fluid within the right mastoid air cells. In the correct clinical
   history,
   this can reflect mastoiditis.
   Microbiology:  all spinal fluid micro -  negative to date
   blood cultures after [**10-29**] are negative to date

   18 yoF with complicated neurologic history & demyelinating disease,
   hospital course complicated by b/l PE without hemodynamic compromise,
   as well as coag neg staph bactermia.  Transferred to the ICU  for
   tachycardia to 160 and desaturations to mid 80's in setting of likley
   agitation and observation peri-intubation for procedure (MRI).
   (#) MS, ENCEPHALOPATHY: no clear cause; intermittently seizing; obvious
   CNS infections have been ruled out on LP; JCV and HIV also negative; sx
   been progressively getting worse since being here.  Possibly a delirium
   from hospitalization/pain/anxiety on top of underlying neuro process,
   though pt fairly young and not considered high risk for hospital
   delirium.  no gross elecrolyte or lab abnormalities.
   -- was intubated yesterday and went for MRI: results pending today.
   -- psych and neuro following: no new recs
   -- zyprexa PRN for aggitation
   -- f/u pending ID panel of tests

   (#) Fever/increasing white count - She has known infection with coag
   staph bacteremia, but all bcx negative since [**11-8**]. MRI suggested
   multiple possibilitites for infection including RUL PNA vs atelectasis,
   hemorrhagic abscess in the left psoas or right paraspinal muscles.

   - US of the left psoas, right paraspinal to detect hematoma, vs fluid
   (#) Left psoas/Righ paraspinal hematoma - known history of traumatic LP
   setting of poor landmarks.
   (#) TACHYCARDIA: has has sinus tach in the 120-130's since arriving to
   the ICU, with spikes to the 150-160's during agitation and convulsive
   type activity.  Many possible physiologic underlying causes including
   bilateral PE, bacteremia (Tmax 100.4, increasing WBC), anxiety ,
   agitation, and convulsive activity.   No evidence of volume depletion
   on exam or labs.  Last TSH nml on [**10-25**].
   -- cont clonazepam for anxiety; frequent reassurance may help though pt
   not able to speak back.
   -- continue treatment of bacteremia with vancomycin: course ends [**11-22**]
   -- cont treatment of PE with heparin ggt
   -- workup and treat for infection as appropriate
   - echo was grossly normal

   1. No definite evidence for intramedullary abnormal enhancement or
   abnormal T2 hyperintensity to suggest multiple sclerosis plaques.
   2. Left psoas muscles and right posterior paraspinal muscle fluid-fluid
   levels, likely represent intramuscular hematomas with surrounding
   inflammation of the muscles. In presence of signs of infection,
   hemorrhagic abcesses cannot
   be excluded.
   3. New large cystic lesion within the perisplenic region, incompletely
   characterized on this examination. This can represent the stomach,
   however,
   cystic lesion other than this cannot be excluded. CT scan of the
   abdomen is
   recommended.
   4. New right upper lobe opacification. Differential diagnostic
   considerations would include right upper lobe atelectasis or pneumonia.
   Given
   the acuity of this lesion, mass lesion is unlikely. Right basilar lower
   lobe
   segmental dependent atelectasis versus aspiration pneumonia.
   MRI Head: 1. Interval development of a heterogeneous FLAIR
   hyperintensity within the
   right cerebral peduncle. Interval decrease in size of the left parietal
   subcortical white matter hyperintensity and stable bilateral forceps
   major,
   splenium, and right cerebellar peduncle/basis pons FLAIR
   hyperintensity. This can be seen demyelinating processes such as
   multiple sclerosis or [**Year (4 digits) 9255**].
   2. Fluid within the right mastoid air cells. In the correct clinical
   history,
   this can reflect mastoiditis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated neurological history and demyelinating disease. She was admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and desaturation, likely due to agitation and observation peri-intubation for a procedure (MRI). The patient has been intermittently seizing, with obvious CNS infections ruled out on LP. JCV and HIV tests were negative. Her symptoms have progressively worsened since being in the hospital.

Assessment and Plan:
1. FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA): The patient has a fever of 101.3°F. She has known infection with coag-negative staph bacteremia, but all blood cultures have been negative since November 8th. There are possibilities of right upper lobe pneumonia versus atelectasis, as well as hemorrhagic abscess in the left psoas or right paraspinal muscles. A chest X-ray and ultrasound of the left psoas and right paraspinal area are recommended to detect hematoma versus fluid.
2. PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE: The patient has had two PEs without hemodynamic compromise. She is currently on heparin and will need coumadin for 3-6 months. Further anti-phospholipid testing is planned.
3. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): The patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old with a demyelinating disorder and severe progression of loss of mental status. The hospital course has been complicated by pulmonary embolism (PE) and generalized paresis of the cerebellar type (GPC) bacteremia. The patient has had persistent worsening of mental status and function without a clearly defined etiology, along with concerning findings on the MRI scan.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The underlying disorder remains incompletely defined, along with significant insult from recurrent seizure activity. This condition requires continued seizure management, avoidance of sedating medications, and no evidence of infection. Neurology input is needed for further guidance.

2. Seizure Disorder: Dilantin levels should be monitored to continue treatment.

3. Pulmonary Emboli: Heparin IV should continue to be administered.

4. Sepsis coag negative staph bacteremia: Vancomycin should continue to be administered. It is important to check CXR, urine, and blood again. There is concern for possible hemorrhagic abscess in the psoas, and further imaging and discussion with radiology are necessary to address this issue.

5. Possible areas of hematoma from previous tap should be considered and addressed accordingly.

6. Persistent fevers and resting tachycardia raise concern for possible infection, which needs to be discussed and imaged.
