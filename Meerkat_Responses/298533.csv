   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD.  The patinet was treated conservatively, and was not
   anticoagulated due to risk of bleeding in the post-operative period.
   The patient's troponin's peaked at 72.  He remained chest pain free
   after his intial event.  The patient was begun on heparin gtt after
   developing new AF.
   - ASA 325mg
   - begin metoprolol 100mg TID, and titrate as tolerated
   - start 5 mg lisinopril in am if BP improves
   - while no role for revascularization following infarcted myocardium 3
   days prior, would imagine likely cardiac catherization to evaluate for
   degree of CAD.
   - will discuss with ortho ability to start plavix in conservative
   mangement of STEMI
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam, with distended neck veins,
   low O2 sats, and crackles on lung exam with low SBP.
   - ween dilt gtt as tolerated
   - TTE to evaluate for post-infarction complications
   - IV lasix
   - CXR to evaluate lung fields.
   - start ACE in am if BP allows
   - cont metoprolol
   - rate control as given below
   - possible repeat TTE on [**Year (4 digits) **]
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed on [**Year (4 digits) 4140**], dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.  Currently in
   AF, and started on heparin gtt.
   - ween dilt gtt as tolerated.
   - uptitrate metoprolol as tolerated for rate control
   - continue [**Last Name (LF) 4140**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to give IV load if unable to rate
   control
   - continue heparin gtt
   - if remains in AF by [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] c/s EP for possible cardioversion.
   As heparin started at time of onset, no need for TEE.
   - if HR remains stable w/o pauses, will d/c transvenous pacer in am
   .
   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  Incomplete work-up at NEBH.
   - BCx with next spike
   - CXR
   - UA and UCX
   - hold abx for now
   - stopping tylenol to trend fever curve
   - encourage IS
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patinet on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP not w/ pronouced output.
   - GAS
   - serial HCT
   .
   # Hypotension:  Mild hypotension on admission while on dilt gtt.  Will
   ween as tolerated, but titrate up above medications as tolerated.
   .
   #  Constipation:  No BM in days with distended abdomen on morphine PCA.
   - colace
   - senna
   - lactulose
   - bisacodyl
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Will consult ortho for assistance with
   post-operative needs.
   - IV morphine PRN
   - if has high narcotic [**Last Name (LF) 4141**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] get pain c/s in AM for PCA.
   - d/c RTC tylenol to trend fever curve.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction, who presented with chest pain following spinal surgery. The patient had prominent anterior ST elevations consistent with mid-left anterior descending artery involvement. He was treated conservatively and not anticoagulated due to the risk of bleeding in the post-operative period. His troponin levels peaked at 72, and he remained chest pain-free after the initial event. The patient developed new-onset atrial fibrillation and was started on heparin.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 104/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a non-rebreather mask. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Physical examination reveals a well-dressed male who is tachypneic and diaphoretic. The patient's neck veins are distended, and there are crackles at the bases of both lungs. There are no murmurs, gallops, or rubs heard on cardiac examination. The abdomen is soft, mildly tense, and distended with decreased bowel sounds.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.6 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels at 2.21, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a STEMI following spinal surgery. The patient's course has been complicated by pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and ileus. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 104/50 mmHg, heart rate of 96 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 100% non-rebreather. Physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles, mild abdominal distension, and decreased bowel sounds. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications:
   - Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, which can lead to poor cardiac output, embolic events, and an increased risk of stroke.
   - Myocardial Infarction: The patient's recent STEMI and history of CAD put him at risk for recurrent ischemic events and subsequent MIs.
   - Heart Failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and crackles on lung examination suggest worsening heart failure.

2. Pulmonary Complications:
   - Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, crackles on lung examination, and low oxygen"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. underwent cardioversion for Afib, unsuccessful.  Was thus continued
   on diltiazem gtt increased to 10mg/hr with HR now in 80-90s, SBPs >
   100.  He continued to be on amiodarone at 0.5mg/min and received 150 IV
   in AM.  Pt. spiked to 100.4F oral he was panCx in early afternoon.
   Lasix drip was continued, he received chlorothiazide 250mg x2
   throughout the day, UOP was maintained > 100cc/hr.   Spiked again
   in evening to [**Age over 90 1287**]F rectal and 100.6F oral on Tylenol, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and/or possible spinal soft tissue inf or
   osteo.  CXR showed mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and smal R pl
   effusion now resolved.  His JP came out early in afternoon, per Ortho,
   NTD.  Pt. has abdominal distension and likely prolonged post op ileus.
    He received 2 water enemas w/o effect, KUB repeat showed adynamic
   ileus w/ more bowel distension that expected from ileus, but per
   radiology still its likely ileus and not SBO.  NGT was placed, and put
   out over 800cc by MN.  Enema'swere d/ced as was lactulose.   Code
   status was addressed and patient is FULL CODE.  Midnight lytes were Na

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF and ileus.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD.  The patient was treated conservatively, and was not
   anticoagulated due to risk of bleeding in the post-operative period.
   The patient's troponin's peaked at 72.  He remained chest pain free
   after his intial event.  The patient was begun on heparin gtt after
   developing new AF.  He continues to be chest pain free.  No signs or
   symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath on Monday per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - change Metoprolol to Diltiazem given afib and hypotension, worsening
   pulmonary edema
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam, with distended neck veins,
   low O2 sats, and crackles on lung exam with low SBP.  O2 requirements
   increasing likely c/w worsening pulmonary edema.
   - continue Lasix gtt with Diovan to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - daily CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows
   - change Metoprolol to Dilt gtt for HR control
   - cardioversion today to improve atrial kick and HR to augment CO
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Currently in AF, and started on heparin gtt.  Given Metoprolol last
   night with HR 100s-110s.
   - continue amioderone, give second 150mg IV bolus
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt, stop Metoprolol as per above
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic
   .
   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  No bandemia.  UA does not show UTI.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.
   - hold antibiotics until pt spikes here or evidence of infection
   - f/u urine cultures
   - Tylenol PRN for fevers
   - encourage IS
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Constipation:  No BM in days with distended abdomen on morphine
   PCA.  Like secondary to medication effect and post-op state with
   ileus.  KUB consistent with stool in colon.
   - colace
   - senna
   - lactulose
   - soap suds enema
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Ortho to evaluate for post-op needs.
   - IV morphine PRN
   - d/c RTC tylenol to trend fever curve.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with IV morphine
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CAD and MI who was transferred from NEBH after experiencing a STEMI following spinal surgery. The patient's condition has been complicated by pulmonary edema consistent with CHF, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and ileus.

Medical Complications:

1. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI and multiple PCIs. The patient presented with chest pain following surgery, with prominent anterior ST elevations consistent with mid-LAD involvement. The patient was treated conservatively, and due to the risk of bleeding in the post-operative period, he was not anticoagulated. Troponin levels peaked at 72, and the patient has remained chest pain-free. There are no signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD. The patient is currently on ASA 325mg, Plavix, and heparin gtt. Consideration is being given to a cardiac catheterization on Monday, although the benefit after three days post-STEMI is unclear.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient's condition is complicated by pulmonary edema, which is likely secondary to CHF. The patient has low O2 sats, crackles on lung exam, and increasing O2 requirements, indicating worsening pulmonary edema. The plan is to continue Lasix gtt with Diovan to maintain UOP >"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 97-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute decompensated heart failure. On day 5, the patient underwent cardioversion for atrial fibrillation, which was unsuccessful. The patient was started on diltiazem at a rate of 10mg/hr to control heart rate, and amiodarone was continued at a rate of 0.5mg/min. The patient's blood pressure remained above 100 and the heart rate was in the 80-90 range. Lasix was continued, and chlorothiazide was given twice throughout the day. The patient's urine output remained above 100cc/hr. The patient's temperature fluctuated throughout the day, reaching 100.4F orally in the afternoon and 100.6F rectally in the evening. Tylenol was administered, and Vancomycin and Zosyn were started for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia and/or spinal soft tissue infection or osteomyelitis. The chest X-ray showed mild pulmonary edema with consolidation and a small right pleural effusion, which has since resolved. The patient's joint puncture came out early in the afternoon, as per Ortho, indicating no tumor. The patient has abdominal distension and likely prolonged post-operative ileus. Enemas were given without effect, and a KUB repeat showed dynamic ileus with more bowel distension than expected from ileus, but it is still likely ileus and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine), line infection, pt has cordis in
   place, transvenous pacer pulled.  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.
   -          Monitor WBC/fever curve, Tylenol prn for fevers
   -          Will discuss pulling line w/ attending, if so, will pull and
   Cx.
   -          CIS, f/u Cx
   -          Serial back exams daily
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does
   not have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - f/u CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - d/ced Amiodarone, given improvement w/ diltiazem
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Pt. w/ 2 watery BMs o/n,
   improving.  NPO for possible cath for now, will discuss w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   - colace
   - senna
   - no enema
s given no stool in colon.
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Ortho
   to evaluate for post-op needs.  No signs of infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's  , will d/c cordis today.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above
   CODE: FULL code, discussed with patient and family.
   DISPO: CCU for now given hypoxia.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI), who was transferred from New England Baptist Hospital (NEBH) after experiencing a STEMI following spinal surgery. The patient's course has been complicated by pulmonary edema consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure (ARF), ileus, and continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuretics.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient continues to require non-rebreather oxygen, with a respiratory rate consistently in the 20-24 range. The patient has been approximately 4.3 liters negative overnight with minimal improvement in oxygenation, ranging from 92-95%. The chest X-ray from yesterday showed mild pulmonary edema with consolidation and right pleural effusion, which has resolved. Differential diagnosis includes CHF, pneumonia (PNA), and pulmonary embolism (PE). Due to fever overnight and continued O2 requirement, the patient has been started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for coverage of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP), as well as possible soft tissue infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery. The patient's white blood cell count actually decreased overnight. Urinalysis was negative, and blood and urine cultures are pending. It is unclear whether the patient has had a PE"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine), line infection, pt has cordis in
   place, transvenous pacer pulled.  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.
   -          Monitor WBC/fever curve, Tylenol prn for fevers
   -          Will discuss pulling line w/ attending, if so, will pull and
   Cx.
   -          CIS, f/u Cx
   -          Serial back exams daily
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does
   not have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - f/u CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - d/ced Amiodarone, given improvement w/ diltiazem
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Pt. w/ 2 watery BMs o/n,
   improving.  NPO for possible cath for now, will discuss w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   - colace
   - senna
   - no enema
s given no stool in colon.
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Ortho
   to evaluate for post-op needs.  No signs of infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above
   CODE: FULL code, discussed with patient and family.
   DISPO: CCU for now given hypoxia.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. He was transferred from a neighboring hospital after experiencing a STEMI following spinal surgery. The patient's course has been complicated by pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, ileus, and continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuretics.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's current condition include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient continues to require non-rebreather oxygen therapy and has minimal improvement in oxygenation. There is a possibility of pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or congestive heart failure contributing to the ongoing hypoxia.

2. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient has had two episodes of fever overnight, which could indicate an ongoing infection. Possible sources include pneumonia (HCAP), urinary tract infection, soft tissue/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery, or line infection. It is important to monitor the WBC count and fever curve, discuss line removal with the attending physician, and follow up with cultures.

3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CAD with prior MI and multiple PCIs. He developed chest pain following surgery, with prominent anterior ST elevations consistent with mid-LAD involvement. Although the patient was managed conservatively without anticoagulation initially, he developed new-onset atrial fibrillation. The patient's tropon"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. underwent cardioversion for Afib, unsuccessful.  Was thus continued
   on diltiazem gtt increased to 10mg/hr with HR now in 80-90s, SBPs >
   100.  He continued to be on amiodarone at 0.5mg/min and received 150 IV
   in AM.  Pt. spiked to 100.4F oral he was panCx in early afternoon.
   Lasix drip was continued, he received chlorothiazide 250mg x2
   throughout the day, UOP was maintained > 100cc/hr.   Spiked again
   in evening to [**Age over 90 1287**]F rectal and 100.6F oral on Tylenol, started on o/n
   Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and/or possible spinal soft tissue inf or
   osteo.  CXR showed mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and smal R pl
   effusion now resolved.  His JP came out early in afternoon, per Ortho,
   NTD.  Pt. has abdominal distension and likely prolonged post op ileus.
    He received 2 water enemas w/o effect, KUB repeat showed adynamic
   ileus w/ more bowel distension that expected from ileus, but per
   radiology still its likely ileus and not SBO.  NGT was placed, and put
   out over 800cc by MN.  Enema'swere d/ced as was lactulose.   Code
   status was addressed and patient is FULL CODE.  Midnight lytes were Na
   136, K 3.7, Mg 2.1, Cr 1.5.  Pt. had two watery stools o/n.  Currently
   Lasix 15mg/hr, Dilt 10mg/hr and d/ced amio drip this AM
   Pt. denies SOB, CP, LBP, has had two watery BMs and is passing gas.
   Pt. required K and Phos replacement o/n.  Pain well controlled w/
   Tylenol and rare morphine prn.

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a STEMI following spinal surgery. The patient's condition has been complicated by pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, ileus, and continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuretics. The patient has also developed fever and is showing signs of potential infection, including leukocytosis and an elevated white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient continues to require non-rebreather and has shown minimal improvement in oxygenation.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's chest X-ray shows mild pulmonary edema, and the patient is experiencing shortness of breath and crackles in the lungs.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation post-MI, and cardioversion was unsuccessful. The patient is currently on amiodarone, diltiazem gtt, and metoprolol.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased, indicating possible acute renal failure.
5. Ileus: The patient has been experiencing abdominal distension and has not had a bowel movement in days, suggesting a possible ileus.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.
   - continue Lasix gtt with Diovan to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - daily CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows
   - change Metoprolol to Dilt gtt for HR control
   - cardioversion today to improve atrial kick and HR to augment CO
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Currently in AF, and started on heparin gtt.  Given Metoprolol last
   night with HR 100s-110s.
   - continue amioderone, give second 150mg IV bolus
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt, stop Metoprolol as per above
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic
   .
   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  No bandemia.  UA does not show UTI.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.
   - hold antibiotics until pt spikes here or evidence of infection
   - f/u urine cultures
   - Tylenol PRN for fevers
   - encourage IS
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Constipation:  No BM in days with distended abdomen on morphine
   PCA.  Like secondary to medication effect and post-op state with
   ileus.  KUB consistent with stool in colon.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF and ileus.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD.  The patient was treated conservatively, and was not
   anticoagulated due to risk of bleeding in the post-operative period.
   The patient's troponin's peaked at 72.  He remained chest pain free
   after his intial event.  The patient was begun on heparin gtt after
   developing new AF.  He continues to be chest pain free.  No signs or
   symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath on Monday per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - change Metoprolol to Diltiazem given afib and hypotension, worsening
   pulmonary edema
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam, with distended neck veins,
   low O2 sats, and crackles on lung exam with low SBP.  O2 requirements
   increasing likely c/w worsening pulmonary edema.
   - continue Lasix gtt with Diovan to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - daily CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows
   - change Metoprolol to Dilt gtt for HR control
   - cardioversion today to improve atrial kick and HR to augment CO
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Currently in AF, and started on heparin gtt.  Given Metoprolol last
   night with HR 100s-110s.
   - continue amioderone, give second 150mg IV bolus
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt, stop Metoprolol as per above
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic
   .
   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  No bandemia.  UA does not show UTI.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.
   - hold antibiotics until pt spikes here or evidence of infection
   - f/u urine cultures
   - Tylenol PRN for fevers
   - encourage IS
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CAD and MI who underwent spinal surgery. Post-surgery, the patient experienced several complications including pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and ileus. The patient presented with chest pain following the surgery, with prominent anterior ST elevations consistent with a mid-LAD myocardial infarction. Conservative treatment was administered, and the patient remained chest pain-free. The patient developed new-onset atrial fibrillation and was started on heparin gtt. Troponin levels peaked at 72. No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD were observed. No new murmurs were noted.

Medical Complications:
1. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) with two stents placed in [**2192**]. The patient's current episode of chest pain following surgery is consistent with a mid-LAD myocardial infarction. The patient's troponin levels peaked at 72, indicating myocardial injury.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient developed new-onset AF, which was managed with amiodarone, diltiazem gtt, and metoprolol. The patient's heart rate was controlled with diltiazem gtt, and the decision to perform an electrical cardioversion was made.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine).  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.  Other etiologies of fever include occult infections
   (endocarditis, spinal abscess, abdominal infection), non-infectious
   causes such as PE/DVT, central fevers.  Pt is already being treated
   with heparin for PE, LENIs negative for DVT.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals
   - check urine legionella, r/o influenza with nasal aspirate
   - check LFTs, amylase, lipase
   # Hypoxia.  CXR w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and R pl effusion
   resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Also may be secondary
   to abdominal distention and compression on lungs.  Positional nature of
   hypoxia consistent with effusions.  LENIs negative although PE is still
   in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt, goal negative 1 L today
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   - f/u sputum cultures
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but lung exam is
   improving.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does not
   have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to clears
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Ortho
   to evaluate for post-op needs.  No signs of infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - f/u ortho recs
   .
   FEN:  clears

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a STEMI following spinal surgery. The patient's condition has been complicated by pulmonary edema consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, ileus, and persistent hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuretics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, suggesting a possible infection. Potential sources include pneumonia (HCAP, aspiration given emesis and NGT placement), urinary tract infection (UTI), soft tissue/osteo infection given recent spinal surgery and hardware, or a post-operative stress response. Other etiologies of fever include occult infections such as endocarditis, spinal abscess, or abdominal infection.

2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is already being treated with heparin for PE, and the leg examination is negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, PE remains in the differential diagnosis due to the patient's hypoxia and risk factors.

3. Coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction: The patient has a history of CAD and prior MI. The recent STEMI and subsequent development of atrial fibrillation indicate ongoing cardiac issues. The patient is on heparin gtt, ASA 325mg, Plavix,"

   hypoxia and were negative for DVT.  Plan is for cath on Wednesday -
   will need to have acetylcysteine written for t/m.  The patient spiked
   fevers throughout the day and was cultured.  Will need to call ortho
   here t/m am to have them come and evaluate his back as a possible
   source of infection.  His dilt drip was increased to 10 to 12.5 to
   15 as his HR began increasing to the 100s -110s.  He remained
   persistently febrile on tylenol (tmax 102.0) so his tachycardia may be
   due to his fever.  The patient had liquid brown stool this am.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine), line infection, pt has cordis in
   place, transvenous pacer pulled.  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.
   -          Monitor WBC/fever curve, Tylenol prn for fevers
   -          Will discuss pulling line w/ attending, if so, will pull and
   Cx.
   -          CIS, f/u Cx
   -          Serial back exams daily
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does
   not have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - f/u CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - d/ced Amiodarone, given improvement w/ diltiazem
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Pt. w/ 2 watery BMs o/n,
   improving.  NPO for possible cath for now, will discuss w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   - colace
   - senna
   - no enema
s given no stool in colon.
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Ortho
   to evaluate for post-op needs.  No signs of infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's  , will d/c cordis today.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above
   CODE: FULL code, discussed with patient and family.
   DISPO: CCU for now given hypoxia.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBCs 19.2.  From prior
   records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals.  Will continue broad-spectrum
   abxs for now and consider narrowing tomorrow
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Change Diltiazem to PO and stop gtt.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   - plan for cath tomorrow to assess coronaries, NPO after midnight
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Diltiazem for rate control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Currently in
   AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not brady,
   transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to soft
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   .
   FEN:  clears
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction who was transferred from the New England Baptist Hospital after experiencing a STEMI following spinal surgery. The patient's course has been complicated by pulmonary edema consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure (ARF), ileus, and continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuretics.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure of 120/91 mmHg, heart rate of 93 beats per minute (bpm) with an irregular rhythm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's general appearance is described as comfortable and in no acute distress, oriented x3, with appropriate mood and affect.

Physical examination findings include neck supple with jugular venous distention at the mandible, bibasilar crackles in the lungs, soft abdomen that is mildly tense and distended with decreased bowel sounds, and no extremity edema or femoral bruits. The patient's back examination shows an intact dressing without drainage, erythema, or edema, and no tenderness to palpation along the spine.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 21.6 thousand/mm^3, hemoglobin (H"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine).  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.  Other etiologies of fever include occult infections
   (endocarditis, spinal abscess, abdominal infection), non-infectious
   causes such as PE/DVT, central fevers.  Pt is already being treated
   with heparin for PE, LENIs negative for DVT.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals
   - check urine legionella, r/o influenza with nasal aspirate
   - check LFTs, amylase, lipase
   # Hypoxia.  CXR w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and R pl effusion
   resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Also may be secondary
   to abdominal distention and compression on lungs.  Positional nature of
   hypoxia consistent with effusions.  LENIs negative although PE is still
   in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt, goal negative 1 L today
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   - f/u sputum cultures
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but lung exam is
   improving.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does not
   have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to clears

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI), who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a STEMI following spinal surgery. The patient's course has been complicated by pulmonary edema consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), acute renal failure (ARF), ileus, and continued hypoxemia despite significant fluid removal via diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which may be due to pneumonia (HCAP, aspiration given emesis and NGT placement), urinary tract infection (UTI) (although less likely), or a soft tissue/osteomyelitis infection (given recent spinal surgery and hardware). Other possible sources of infection include occult infections like endocarditis, spinal abscess, or abdominal infection. Non-infectious causes such as pulmonary embolism (PE)/deep vein thrombosis (DVT), central fever, or postoperative stress response should also be considered.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be secondary to CHF, pneumonia, PE, or abdominal distention and compression on the lungs. The patient has mild pulmonary edema with consolidation and right pleural effusion on chest X-ray, which has resolved since January 17th. The differential diagnosis includes CHF, pneumonia, PE,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBCs 19.2.  From prior
   records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals.  Will continue broad-spectrum
   abxs for now and consider narrowing tomorrow
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Change Diltiazem to PO and stop gtt.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   - plan for cath tomorrow to assess coronaries, NPO after midnight
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Diltiazem for rate control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Currently in
   AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not brady,
   transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to soft
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   .
   FEN:  clears
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) who was transferred from New England Baptist Hospital (NEBH) after experiencing a STEMI following spinal surgery. The patient's course has been complicated by pulmonary edema consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), acute renal failure (ARF), ileus, and continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuretics.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 86 beats per minute in AF, blood pressure of 116/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 2 liters nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs bilaterally and a JVP of 9 cm. The abdomen is soft with slight distension, and there are no obvious signs of infection or drainage from the dressing over the patient's back. The extremities are cool and clammy, and the skin is dry and warm.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.4 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 826 IU/L. The blood cultures are negative, and the sputum cultures are pending.

The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix) at 10 mg/hour, heparin sodium at 2,000 units/hour, pantoprazole (Protonix), and diltiazem. The patient has received Piperacillin, Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin in the past.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient is now afebrile with a white blood cell count of 19.2 K/uL. There are no clear signs of pneumonia on the chest X-ray, but the patient has improved on antibiotics and has been in the hospital setting. Continue to follow cultures, perform serial back exams daily, and consider narrowing broad-spectrum antibiotics tomorrow.

2. Hypoxia: The chest CT does not show focal consolidation, but the patient has been coughing and improved with antibiotics. It is likely some atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT. Continue diuresis with Lasix gtt and diuril as necessary, and continue Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Levofloxacin.

3. Coronaries: The patient had a STEMI post-operatively, and he continues to be chest pain-free. No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD are present, and no new murmurs have been identified. The"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Chest CT final read w/ small bilateral effusions, atelectasis, mild
   congestion.  Pt. afebrile, was net negative, but only ~ 500cc on lasix
   gtt.  Was changed to PO diltiazem from gtt and eventually had aflutter
   w/ HR in 150s.  Received IV dilt 10mg x3, PO increased to 60mg with
   poor response.  Restarted on Diltiazem gtt @ 2000with HR down to 80-90
   by 2300 and SBPs > 110, HR 70-80s o/n.  Discussed with Dow, he may
   undergo cardioversion on cath lab tomorrow, pt is NPO.  Infectious w/up
   w/ negative influenza nasal wash, negative legionella and UCx and
   catheter tip Cx. PT saw pt, ambulated in room, will see him in AM prior
   to cath.  O2 weaned off, but restarted while pt was in flutter.  Ortho
   felt ok w/o MRI (would get it if we were concerned re: infection), they
   were less concerned re: infection in spine, OK OOB.  PM lytes were wnl,
   no replacement.  Cr climbing back up, sent UA repeat w/ Lytes.

   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals.  Will continue broad-spectrum
   abxs for now and consider narrowing tomorrow
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Change Diltiazem to PO and stop gtt.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   - plan for cath tomorrow to assess coronaries, NPO after midnight
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Diltiazem for rate control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Currently in
   AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not brady,
   transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to soft
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction who was transferred from NEBH after experiencing a STEMI following spinal surgery.
2. The patient's course has been complicated by pulmonary edema consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure (ARF), ileus, and continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuretics.
3. The patient is currently afebrile with a WBC count of 19.2, which has been elevated in the past. There are no clear signs of pneumonia on chest X-ray, but the patient has improved on antibiotics and has been in the hospital setting. Sputum cultures have been obtained.
4. A chest CT does not show focal consolidation, but the patient has been coughing and improved with antibiotics. The CT also shows some atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions. A Legionella test is negative.
5. The patient continues to have hypoxia, but this is likely due to atelectasis and small bilateral pulmonary effusions rather than pneumonia. The patient will continue to receive diuretics, Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Levofloxacin.
6. The patient's coronary arteries are still in the post-STEMI state. He is currently in atrial fibrillation"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Chest CT final read w/ small bilateral effusions, atelectasis, mild
   congestion.  Pt. afebrile, was net negative, but only ~ 500cc on lasix
   gtt.  Was changed to PO diltiazem from gtt and eventually had aflutter
   w/ HR in 150s.  Received IV dilt 10mg x3, PO increased to 60mg with
   poor response.  Restarted on Diltiazem gtt @ 2000with HR down to 80-90
   by 2300 and SBPs > 110, HR 70-80s o/n.  Infectious w/up w/ negative
   influenza nasal wash, negative legionella and UCx and catheter tip
   Cx. PT saw pt, ambulated in room, will see him in AM prior to cath.  O2
   weaned off, but restarted while pt was in flutter.  Ortho felt ok w/o
   MRI (would get it if we were concerned re: infection), they were less
   concerned re: infection in spine, OK OOB.  PM lytes were wnl, no
   replacement.  Cr climbing back up, sent UA repeat w/ Lytes.
   This am the patient denies CP, SOB, or change in his back pain.  Had
   two loose bowel movements yesterday.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBC stable at 19.2.  From
   prior records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.  Chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, bilateral
   atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion as well as calcified
   pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Serial back exams daily
   - Will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation.  Ortho agrees that an MRI is not
   necessary at this time.
   - Will DC Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]) as there is no
   clinical evidence of infection requiring board-spectrum coverage.
   - Continue Levofloxacin (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) as he became afebrile once
   the levofloxacin was added.
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt yesterday and the dilt gtt
   was stopped and he was switched to po dilt, however he developed a
   flutter with HRs in the 150s unresponseive to 10 mg IV dilt x3 and
   increased dosing of po dilt.  Was eventually placed back on a dilt gtt
   with control of his rate.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.   Will
   gradually add po dilt and slowly wean off the dilt gtt.  Also getting
   po metoprolol.
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Cath today.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg tid.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with a Cr rise to 2.2 from a baseline of
   1.3 to 1.6.  Unclear cause, possibly due to slight hypotension during
   the episode of tachycardia yesterday.  Differential includes prerenal
   vs ATN vs AIN (given recent antibiotics), vs postrenal.  Vanc level was
   elevated at 22.3, but this is unlikely to have caused such a large
   increase in Cr.
   -  Will given IVF with bicarb and acetylcysteine given dye at cath
   -  Trend Cr
   -  Check urinary electrolytes and urinary eosinophils
   -  Place foley to check for urinary retension and consider a renal US
   if his Cr continues to worsen.
   -  Hold diuresis for now.
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - Lasix gtt stopped given ARF
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Patient had two loose bowel movements overnight.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction who was transferred from New England Baptist Hospital after experiencing a STEMI following spinal surgery. The patient's course has been complicated by pulmonary edema consistent with congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, ileus, and continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuretics.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including ASA, Plavix, heparin gtt, diltiazem gtt, metoprolol, lasix gtt, diuril, vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate have been fluctuating, with an initial heart rate in the 150s and blood pressure above 110 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status has improved with antibiotics, but he still has some atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion as seen on chest CT.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a creatinine rise to 2.2 from a baseline of 1.3 to 1.6. The cause is unclear, possibly due to slight hypotension during the episode of tachycardia yesterday. The differential includes prerenal azotemia, acute tubular necrosis, allergic interstitial nephritis, or postrenal obstruction.

   Chief Complaint: 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered
   from NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery in persistent a.fib
   with continued hypoxia now s/p cath with a DES to the mid-LAD
   24 Hour Events:
   Cath yesterday showed high grade mid-LAD 90% lesion with thrombus, got
   [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  Was given N-acetylcysteine and sodium bicarb prior to
   procedure, Creat post-procedure was 2.6.
   At 10pm, HR increased to 100s, 110s.  Was given
   The patient's Cr rose to 2.2 this am, 2.4 on recheck (from 1.3).  He
   went to cath where he was found to have single vessel disease of the
   LAD with a mid vessel high grade 90% lesion with thrombus which was
   stented with a Xience 3x18mm stent.  Also moderate biventricular
   diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension were
   noted.  Urinary eosinophils were checked and returned positvie with
   rare eosinophils seen.  His FEurea returned at 19.3% which suggests a
   prerenal etiology.  He was given acetylcysteine and IVF with bicarb pre
   and post procedure for renal protection.  A post cath Cr returned at
   2.6.  His vanc and zosyn were stopped as he has been afebrile; he was
   continued on levofloxacin.  His post cath check was normal.  Around 10
   pm his HR started increasing to the 100's to 110's. He was given an
   extra 30 mg of po dilt (was still on 5 mg/hr IV dilt gtt at the time
   and had gotten his po metoprolol 2 hrs prior).  He then started to have
   hypoxia to the mid 80's even on 50% facemask.  His post cath IVF were
   stopped and he was given 40 mg IV lasix.  He was wheezy on exam so he
   was given albuterol and atrovent.  An ABG showed 7.50/37/84/30 (likely
   metabolic alkalosis from bicarb drip).  A CXR showed some mild increase
   in fluid in his lungs, but no infiltrate.  His sats then improved to
   the mid to high 90's.  His HR then persistently increased to the 100's
   sometimes increasing to the 120's to 130's.  His dilt gtt was turned up
   at intervals eventually to 15 mg/hr.  He was given another 30 mg of
   dilt and then 25 mg of metoprolol.  (and his normal doses were
   increased to dilt 60 qid and metoprolol 25 tid).  He was still high so
   10 mg IV dilt was pushed twice.  Finally his HRs decreased to the 80's
   to 90's.  Throughout this he remained asymptomatic and comfortable.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBC stable at 19.2.  From
   prior records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.  Chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, bilateral
   atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion as well as calcified
   pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Serial back exams daily
   - Will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation.  Ortho agrees that an MRI is not
   necessary at this time.
   - Will DC Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]) as there is no
   clinical evidence of infection requiring board-spectrum coverage.
   - Continue Levofloxacin (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) as he became afebrile once
   the levofloxacin was added.
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt yesterday and the dilt gtt
   was stopped and he was switched to po dilt, however he developed a
   flutter with HRs in the 150s unresponseive to 10 mg IV dilt x3 and
   increased dosing of po dilt.  Was eventually placed back on a dilt gtt
   with control of his rate.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.   Will
   gradually add po dilt and slowly wean off the dilt gtt.  Also getting
   po metoprolol.
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Cath today.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg tid.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with a Cr rise to 2.2 from a baseline of
   1.3 to 1.6.  Unclear cause, possibly due to slight hypotension during
   the episode of tachycardia yesterday.  Differential includes prerenal
   vs ATN vs AIN (given recent antibiotics), vs postrenal.  Vanc level was
   elevated at 22.3, but this is unlikely to have caused such a large
   increase in Cr.
   -  Will given IVF with bicarb and acetylcysteine given dye at cath
   -  Trend Cr
   -  Check urinary electrolytes and urinary eosinophils
   -  Place foley to check for urinary retension and consider a renal US
   if his Cr continues to worsen.
   -  Hold diuresis for now.
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - Lasix gtt stopped given ARF
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Patient had two loose bowel movements overnight.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   FEN:  clears

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) who was transferred from NEBH after experiencing a STEMI following spinal surgery. The patient's condition has been complicated by pulmonary edema consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), acute renal failure (ARF), ileus, and continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuretics. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, and there are signs of infection. The patient's creatinine (Cr) levels have risen from a baseline of 1.3 to 2.2, indicating ARF. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 40% with apical and septal hypokinesis, suggesting heart failure. The patient also has anemia, which is likely due to bleeding secondary to heparin therapy post-surgery. Additionally, the patient is experiencing postoperative ileus. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's Cr levels have significantly increased, indicating impaired renal function. This could be due to prerenal causes, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN), or postrenal obstruction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.
2. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's pulmonary edema"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction who was transferred from NEBH after experiencing a STEMI following spinal surgery. He also has persistent atrial fibrillation and continued hypoxia. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with a drug-eluting stent (DES) placed in the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery due to a high-grade lesion with thrombus.

Overnight, the patient's heart rate increased to the 100s-110s and he was given 30mg of oral diltiazem. Despite being on a facemask with 50% oxygen, the patient became hypoxic in the mid-80s and received 40mg of intravenous lasix. A chest X-ray showed worsened pulmonary edema, and the patient was given albuterol and atroven nebulizers. An arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed a pH of 7.5, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, PaO2 of 84 mmHg, and HCO3- of 27 mEq/L. The patient's heart rate remained in the 120s to 130s, and the diltiazem drip was increased to 15mg/hr for rate control. Additional medications given included 30mg of oral diltiazem and 25mg of metoprolol, with standing doses increased. The patient was asymptomatic"

   Chief Complaint: 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered
   from NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery in persistent a.fib
   with continued hypoxia now s/p cath with a DES to the mid-LAD
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's Cr rose to 2.2 this am, 2.4 on recheck (from 1.3).  He
   went to cath where he was found to have single vessel disease of the
   LAD with a mid vessel high grade 90% lesion with thrombus which was
   stented with a Xience 3x18mm stent.  Also moderate biventricular
   diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension were
   noted.  Urinary eosinophils were checked and returned positvie with
   rare eosinophils seen.  His FEurea returned at 19.3% which suggests a
   prerenal etiology.  He was given acetylcysteine and IVF with bicarb pre
   and post procedure for renal protection.  A post cath Cr returned at
   2.6.  His vanc and zosyn were stopped as he has been afebrile; he was
   continued on levofloxacin.  His post cath check was normal.  Around 10
   pm his HR started increasing to the 100's to 110's. He was given an
   extra 30 mg of po dilt (was still on 5 mg/hr IV dilt gtt at the time
   and had gotten his po metoprolol 2 hrs prior).  He then started to have
   hypoxia to the mid 80's even on 50% facemask.  His post cath IVF were
   stopped and he was given 40 mg IV lasix.  He was wheezy on exam so he
   was given albuterol and atrovent.  An ABG showed 7.50/37/84/30 (likely
   metabolic alkalosis from bicarb drip).  A CXR showed some mild increase
   in fluid in his lungs, but no infiltrate.  His sats then improved to
   the mid to high 90's.  His HR then persistently increased to the 100's
   sometimes increasing to the 120's to 130's.  His dilt gtt was turned up
   at intervals eventually to 15 mg/hr.  He was given another 30 mg of
   dilt and then 25 mg of metoprolol.  (and his normal doses were
   increased to dilt 60 qid and metoprolol 25 tid).  He was still high so
   10 mg IV dilt was pushed twice.  Finally his HRs decreased to the 80's
   to 90's.  Throughout this he remained asymptomatic and comfortable.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBC stable at 19.2.  From
   prior records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.  Chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, bilateral
   atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion as well as calcified
   pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Serial back exams daily
   - Will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation.  Ortho agrees that an MRI is not
   necessary at this time.
   - Will DC Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]) as there is no
   clinical evidence of infection requiring board-spectrum coverage.
   - Continue Levofloxacin (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) as he became afebrile once
   the levofloxacin was added.
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt yesterday and the dilt gtt
   was stopped and he was switched to po dilt, however he developed a
   flutter with HRs in the 150s unresponseive to 10 mg IV dilt x3 and
   increased dosing of po dilt.  Was eventually placed back on a dilt gtt
   with control of his rate.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.   Will
   gradually add po dilt and slowly wean off the dilt gtt.  Also getting
   po metoprolol.
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Cath today.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg tid.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with a Cr rise to 2.2 from a baseline of
   1.3 to 1.6.  Unclear cause, possibly due to slight hypotension during
   the episode of tachycardia yesterday.  Differential includes prerenal
   vs ATN vs AIN (given recent antibiotics), vs postrenal.  Vanc level was
   elevated at 22.3, but this is unlikely to have caused such a large
   increase in Cr.
   -  Will given IVF with bicarb and acetylcysteine given dye at cath
   -  Trend Cr
   -  Check urinary electrolytes and urinary eosinophils
   -  Place foley to check for urinary retension and consider a renal US
   if his Cr continues to worsen.
   -  Hold diuresis for now.
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - Lasix gtt stopped given ARF
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Patient had two loose bowel movements overnight.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has

- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, who was transferred from NEBH after experiencing a STEMI following spinal surgery. 
- The patient has persistent atrial fibrillation with continued hypoxia and underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting of the mid-LAD due to a high-grade lesion.
- The patient's serum creatinine (Cr) has risen to 2.2 this morning from a baseline of 1.3, indicating acute renal failure.
- The patient developed atrial fibrillation in the post-MI setting and was initially managed with amiodarone, diltiazem gtt, and metoprolol. However, he failed cardioversion and required increasing doses of diltiazem gtt to control his heart rate.
- The patient also experienced hypoxia, which improved with antibiotics and diuresis but may be due to atelectasis and bilateral pulmonary effusions seen on CT scan.
- The patient has undergone several interventions, including heparin gtt, diltiazem gtt, metoprolol, and Lasix gtt, as well as changes in medications and dosages.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, ileus, and hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuretics.

The patient has a history of renal failure, coronary artery disease, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, impaired transfers, impaired knowledge, fever of unknown origin, leukocytosis, constipation, acute heart failure, pain control, atrial fibrillation, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/46 to 135/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient is being monitored for hemodynamics and fluid balance.

The patient's recent lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and potassium levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet count (Plt). The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting renal impairment. Electrolyte levels such as sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), potassium (K+), bicarbonate (HCO3-), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO43-) are within normal range. The liver function tests (ALT/AST) and lipid profile are normal.

The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. The patient's cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   Cath with mid-LAD thrombus s/p DES [**2195-1-22**].
   # Hypoxia.  Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of IVF and afib
   with RVR.  Responded to 40mg IV Lasix last night.
   - additional 40mg IV lasix this morning
   - will re-evaluate and diurese more if necessary for goal -1L today
   - PM lytes
   - HR control with Diltiazem 90mg PO QID (increased) and Metoprolol 25mg
   TID
   - Vanc and Zosyn stopped yesterday, will continue Levoquin for 5 day
   course (today is day [**5-17**])
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.  Cath [**2195-1-22**] showing mid-LAD
   thrombus, now s/P LAD stent.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt, Integrilin for 18 hours post-stent
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO TID, Simvastatin
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .# RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt and has been difficult to
   transition to PO Dilt.
   - will increase Dilt to 90mg PO QID and attempt to wean Dilt gtt
   - increase Metoprolol to 25mg PO TID
   - continue heparin gtt and start Coumadin today for anticoagulation
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - diurese today with PRN Lasix for goal of -1L
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine now rising with urine lytes
   consistent with pre-renal via FeUrea.  Will continue to monitor.
   Expecting a rise in the next few days due to ATN from contrast.
   -  continue to monitor urine output and creatinine
   - hold nephrotoxic meds
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Having intermittent bowel movements.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   FEN:  cardiac diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain management with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a STEMI following spinal surgery. The patient's course has been complicated by pulmonary edema consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), acute renal failure (ARF), ileus, and continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuretics.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with mid-LAD thrombus and subsequent stenting. He is currently on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and Plavix, as well as anticoagulation with heparin.

The patient developed AF in the post-MI setting, which has been managed initially with amiodarone and metoprolol. However, the patient failed cardioversion and has been in AF rate-controlled with a diltiazem drip and metoprolol. The plan is to increase diltiazem to 90mg PO QID and attempt to wean the diltiazem drip.

The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 40% with apical and septal hypertrophy. There are signs of heart failure, and the patient has benefited symptomatically from diuresis. The plan is to continue diuretic therapy with Lasix for a goal of -1L today.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   Cath with mid-LAD thrombus s/p DES [**2195-1-22**].  Now afebrile but on
   Tylenol and stable WBC count.
   # Hypoxia.  Much improved.  Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting
   of IVF in cath lab and afib with RVR.  Responded to 120mg IV Lasix
   total yesterday.  CTAB today.
   - Wean off O2
   - diurese w/ goal of -0.5L today
   - PM lytes
   - Continue Levoquin for 10 day course (today is day [**6-21**]) for HCAP.
   - f/[**Location 39**] CXR read
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.  Cath [**2195-1-22**] showing mid-LAD
   thrombus, now s/P LAD stent.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO TID, Simvastatin
   - Will start  ACE when tolerated by BP and Cr. improves.
   .# RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt and has been difficult to
   transition to PO Dilt, successfully transitioned yesterday w/ 90mg QID,
   gtt off since 5pm.
   - Continue Diltiazem 90mg PO QID
   - Continue Metoprolol to 25mg PO TID
   - continue heparin gtt and Coumadin, d/c heparin once INR > 2.0 x 24hrs
   # PUMP:  Echo here w/ LVEF 35-40%, mild symmetric LVH w/ regional
   systolic dysfunction c/w CAD and mild MR.  On exam much improved from
   yesterday, trace LE edema.  Has runs of NSVT on Tele.
   - diurese today with Lasix for goal of -0.5L
   - Will start  ACEI once ARF is improved and BPs tolerate (mean SBP >
   110).
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   - Pt. will require ECHO within 6-8wks as OP and ECG to assess for need
   of an ICD, as currently w/ runs of NSVT.
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine now stable, UOP > 50cc/hr and  urine
   lytes consistent with pre-renal via FeUrea.  Will continue to monitor.
   Will monitor for CIN as pt. received dye load in setting of elevated
   Cr.
   -  continue to monitor urine output and creatinine
   - hold nephrotoxic meds
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT 27.2, mostly ranging in 28-31 since
   admission.
   -          continue to monitor
   -          guiac all stools.
   #  Post op ileus:  Having intermittent bowel movements.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.  Pt. ambulating w/ walker comfortably.
   - change Tylenol to prn to monitor for fever, given now that he has
   been Cx.
   - oxycodone 5mg q4h prn pain
   FEN:  cardiac diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain management with Tylenol and oxycodone
   -Bowel regimen as listed above
   CODE: FULL code, discussed with patient and family.
   DISPO: CCU
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) who was transferred from another hospital after experiencing a STEMI following spinal surgery. The patient's course has been complicated by pulmonary edema consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), acute renal failure (ARF), ileus, and continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuretics.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with the placement of a stent in the mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD) due to a thrombus. The patient is currently stable and chest pain-free.

The patient's current medications include aspirin (ASA) 325mg, clopidogrel (Plavix), heparin via a continuous infusion, metoprolol 25mg orally three times a day (TID), simvastatin, and warfarin. The patient will also be started on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) when blood pressure and creatinine levels improve.

The patient's rhythm is currently in AF with a heart rate ranging from 70 to 140 beats per minute (bpm). The patient was initially managed with amiodarone, diltiazem (gtt), and metoprolol at the previous hospital. Cardioversion was unsuccessful, and the patient was transitioned to oral diltiazem successfully yesterday with a dose"
