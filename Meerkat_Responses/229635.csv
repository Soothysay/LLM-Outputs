   .
   Assessment and Plan
   79yo woman with h/o metastatic pancreatic CA s/p xeloda and carboplatic
   admitted with nausea/vomiting, developed ileus with likely aspiration
   pneumonia and sepsis.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION):
   -          currently on vasopressin and levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -          most likely source is aspiration pneumonia, but other
   possibilities include bowel perforation/microperforation or SBP.
   -          Has Right IJ
   -          s/p aggressive volume resuscitation with CVPs > [**10-5**]
   -          [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim with elevated cortisol; did not start stress dose
   steroids
   -          will try to wean pressors as tolerated
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION with hypoxic respiratory failure
   -          note that patient has lung mets, which have been stable on
   imaging
   -          treating with vancomycin and zosyn (day 1 = [**1-26**])
   -          following ABGs
   -          albuterol/ipratroprium MDI
   -          versed and fentanyl for sedation while on vent
   -          awaiting TTE
   -          holding CTA at present although PE in the DDx
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS) and distention
   -          continuing to drain feculent material; CT abdomen showed
   profound dilation of small and large bowel
   -          also of note, pt has new ascites on CT scan, so SBP in DDx
   -          intraabdominal source of infection covered with zosyn
   -          holding motility agents
   -          strictly NPO
   # Coagulopathy:
   Patient has elevated INR and dropping platelets.  She is septic with
   pancreatic cancer, so it is possible that DIC is responsible for her
   clinical picture.  On the other hand, her fibrinogen has been high and
   her FDP has been normal.  Will avoid all heparin products and check HIT
   antibody.
   -          appreciate input from Hem/Onc
   -          monitor patient for evidence of clotting or bleeding; if
   bleeding, would give FFP
   -          follow DIC labs; peripheral smear done this AM
 LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient presented to ICU with WBC 18 and 40% bands.
   She is s/p cipro for UTI.  As discussed above, most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary or bowel.
   -          continue vanc/zosyn
   -          follow cultures
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -          most likely prerenal, although is at risk for ATN given
   profound hypotension on evening of transfer
   -          rapid improvement of Cr with IV fluids is reassuring that
   she did not have tubular necrosis
   -          Foley to closely monitor I/O
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), PANCREAS
metastatic to lungs
   -          holding chemotherapy at present
   -          appreciate assistance from Onc team in discussing goals of
   care with family
   # h/o CVA:  holding coumadin (unclear why on coumadin)
   # Hypothyroidism: on levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer who was admitted with nausea and vomiting. She developed an ileus with likely aspiration pneumonia and sepsis. She is currently on vasopressin and levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. Her most likely source of infection is aspiration pneumonia, but other possibilities include bowel perforation/microperforation or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She has a right internal jugular (IJ) line and has undergone aggressive volume resuscitation with central venous pressures (CVPs) above 10. She did not receive stress dose steroids despite having a low cortisol level. The plan is to try to wean off the pressors as tolerated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The most likely source of infection is aspiration pneumonia, but other possibilities include bowel perforation/microperforation or SBP. She is already receiving vasopressin and levophed to maintain MAP above 65.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has developed aspiration pneumonia, which is being treated with vancomycin and zosyn.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, most likely prerenal, although she is at risk for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given her profound hypotension"

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo woman with h/o metastatic pancreatic CA s/p xeloda and carboplatic
   admitted with nausea/vomiting, developed bowel obstruction/ileus and
   sepsis.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION):
   -          currently on vasopressin and levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -          most likely source is bowel, particularly bowel
   perforation/microperforation or SBP.  Could also consider C Diff.
   -          continue vanc/zosyn and add flagyl for improved coverage of
   bowel pathogens and C Diff.
   -          Has Right IJ
   -          s/p aggressive volume resuscitation with CVPs > [**10-5**]; IV
   fluids PRN CVP > 10
   -          [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim with elevated cortisol; did not start stress dose
   steroids
   -          will try to wean pressors as tolerated
 Hypoxic respiratory failure
   -          note that patient has lung mets, which have been stable on
   imaging
   -          treating possible pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn (day 1
   = [**1-26**]); adding flagyl as above
   -          following ABGs
   -          albuterol/ipratroprium MDI
   -          versed and fentanyl for sedation while on vent
   -          awaiting TTE
   -          holding CTA at present although PE in the DDx
   # Altered Mental Status:
   -          remains sedated this morning despite 2 hours off of
   midazolam and fentanyl
   -          follow exam to determine if this is oversedation or if she
   suffered neurologic insult during her acute decompensation
   -          consider head CT for evidence of bleed
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS) and distention
   -          continuing to drain feculent material; CT abdomen showed
   profound dilation of small and large bowel
   -          also of note, pt has new ascites on CT scan, so SBP in DDx
   -          intraabdominal source of infection covered with zosyn; will
   add flagyl to cover any C Diff and send toxin B
   -          holding motility agents, NPO
   # Coagulopathy:
   Patient has elevated INR and dropping platelets.  She is septic with
   pancreatic cancer, so it is possible that DIC is responsible for her
   clinical picture.  On the other hand, her fibrinogen has been high and
   her FDP has been normal.  Will avoid all heparin products and check HIT
   antibody.
   -          appreciate input from Hem/Onc
   -          monitor patient for evidence of clotting or bleeding; if
   bleeding, would give FFP
   -          follow DIC labs; peripheral smear done this AM
 LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient presented to ICU with WBC 18 and 40% bands.
   She is s/p cipro for UTI.  As discussed above, most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary or bowel.
   -          continue vanc/zosyn and flagyl
   -          follow cultures
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -          most likely prerenal, although is at risk for ATN given
   profound hypotension on evening of transfer
   -          rapid improvement of Cr with IV fluids is reassuring that
   she did not have tubular necrosis
   -          Foley to closely monitor I/O
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), PANCREAS
metastatic to lungs
   -          holding chemotherapy at present
   -          appreciate assistance from Onc team in discussing goals of

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer who was admitted with nausea/vomiting and developed bowel obstruction/ileus and sepsis. 

The patient is currently experiencing hypotension and tachycardia, indicating potential cardiovascular instability. She is being treated with vasopressin and levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. The most likely source of sepsis is the bowel, particularly bowel perforation/microperforation or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). There is also a possibility of Clostridium difficile infection. 

The patient has pleural effusions, lower lobe volume loss, and evidence of lung metastases. She is being treated for possible pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and Flagyl has been added for improved coverage of bowel pathogens and C. difficile.

The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, and her mental status is altered. She is sedated and on mechanical ventilation. Imaging shows a new right internal jugular (IJ) line with the tip in the superior vena cava (SVC), and the tip of the endotracheal tube is 4 cm above the carina.

   Total time spent:
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. The patient has sepsis, severe with organ dysfunction, as well as pneumonia aspiration. Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure and cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the pancreas.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, organ dysfunction, and failure, exacerbation of pneumonia aspiration, further deterioration of renal function, and progression of pancreatic cancer.

It is crucial for the patient's well-being to closely monitor vital signs, administer appropriate antibiotics, maintain fluid balance, provide respiratory support as needed, manage pain, and ensure proper nutrition and glycemic control. Regular assessment of laboratory values and imaging studies should also be conducted to evaluate the progression of the diseases and adjust the treatment plan accordingly."

   Imaging: [**1-27**] CT Head
   FINDINGS:  There is an area of encephalomalacia involving the right
   cerebellar hemisphere consistent with old infarct.  There are
   periventricular white matter hypodensities which could be the result of
   chronic small vessel
   ischemic change.  There is no mass effect or shift of the midline
   structures.
   No abnormal enhancing lesion is identified.  There is mild prominence
   of the ventricular system and cerebral sulci, which is likely the
   result of
   age-related brain atrophy.
   The visualized bony structures are within normal limits.
   IMPRESSION:  No CT evidence of an acute territorial infarct.  No
   intracranial
   hemorrhage.  No abnormal enhancing lesion identified.  Area of
   encephalomalacia involving the right cerebellar hemisphere.  Changes
   suggestive of chronic microangiopathic change.

   # Altered Mental Status:
   -          remains sedated this morning despite off of midazolam and
   fentanyl. Could be residual effect of sedatives
   -          may be also neurologic insult during her acute
   decompensation (hypotension to 50s)

   flagyl to cover any C Diff and f/u toxin B
   -          holding motility agents, NPO
   # Coagulopathy: most c/w DIC, as platelets dropping, INR and PTT
   trending uipwards. However,  FDP 0-10 and fibrinogen elevated (but also
   an Acute Phase Reactant). Pt with malignancy and sepsis as etiologies
   -          monitor patient for evidence of clotting or bleeding; if
   bleeding, give FFP if not [**Month/Day (2) 617**]

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer who was admitted with nausea/vomiting, developed bowel obstruction/ileus, aspiration pneumonia (PNA), severe sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). She is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation and has been treated with antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole) for various infections. The patient's mental status has not significantly improved off sedation, and her CT head is negative for bleed/stroke. She has thrombocytopenia and has received a blood transfusion. The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status and the medical team is discussing extubation and comfort care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to aspiration PNA and respiratory failure. She requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory status.
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis, likely secondary to her aspiration PNA and bowel obstruction/ileus. She will continue to be monitored for signs of infection and septic shock. Antibiotics will be continued, and cultures will be followed.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a declining platelet count, elevated INR and PTT, which may indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Close monitoring of the patient for evidence"

   FINDINGS:  There is an area of encephalomalacia involving the right
   cerebellar hemisphere consistent with old infarct.  There are
   periventricular white matter hypodensities which could be the result of
   chronic small vessel
   ischemic change.  There is no mass effect or shift of the midline
   structures.
   No abnormal enhancing lesion is identified.  There is mild prominence
   of the ventricular system and cerebral sulci, which is likely the
   result of
   age-related brain atrophy.
   The visualized bony structures are within normal limits.
   IMPRESSION:  No CT evidence of an acute territorial infarct.  No
   intracranial
   hemorrhage.  No abnormal enhancing lesion identified.  Area of
   encephalomalacia involving the right cerebellar hemisphere.  Changes
   suggestive of chronic microangiopathic change.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a frail and elderly individual admitted to the ICU with aspiration pneumonia. The patient's mental status has not significantly improved despite being off sedation, and a CT scan of the head showed no evidence of bleeding or stroke. The patient is unresponsive and has been intubated. The patient has a history of cancer, specifically pancreatic cancer.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. This is indicated by the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which is a common complication in individuals with impaired swallowing or gag reflexes.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient is at risk for DIC due to sepsis and has a prolonged PT/INR and low platelet count.
4. Abdominal pain: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain, which could be related to the underlying pancreatic cancer or complications associated with sepsis.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an immune response to infection.
6. Malignant neoplasm of the pancreas: The patient has a history of pancreatic cancer, which could contribute to the overall clinical picture and complications.
7. Organ dysfunction: The patient is experiencing organ dysfunction, as indicated by the need for ICU"

   periventricular white matter hypodensities which could be the result of
   chronic small vessel
   ischemic change.  There is no mass effect or shift of the midline
   structures.
   No abnormal enhancing lesion is identified.  There is mild prominence
   of the ventricular system and cerebral sulci, which is likely the
   result of
   age-related brain atrophy.
   The visualized bony structures are within normal limits.
   IMPRESSION:  No CT evidence of an acute territorial infarct.  No
   intracranial
   hemorrhage.  No abnormal enhancing lesion identified.  Area of

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old woman with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer who was admitted with nausea, vomiting, bowel obstruction/ileus, aspiration pneumonia, and sepsis. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications including severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, aspiration pneumonia with respiratory failure, altered mental status, abdominal pain and distention (ileus or partial small bowel obstruction), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), anemia, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and malignancy-related cancer. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, vasopressors, and other medications to manage her conditions. Her code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and she is currently receiving ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis with organ dysfunction indicates a systemic infection that has led to organ failure. It is crucial to continue aggressive treatment with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia has resulted in respiratory failure. Continued management with antibiotics, respiratory support, and monitoring of oxygenation is necessary.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's sedation and lack of responsiveness may be due to neurologic insult or medication effects. Close monitoring and further evaluation, including a TTE (transesophageal echocardiogram), are needed.
4. Abdominal Pain and Distention: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a chief complaint of sepsis. She is currently unresponsive and remains on a ventilator. The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, pneumonia due to aspiration, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), leukocytosis, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the pancreas, and bowel obstruction secondary to the pancreatic cancer.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 107/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving vasopressin and norepinephrine infusions for hemodynamic support.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2955 mL and output of 2403 mL, with a net fluid loss of 552 mL. The patient's weight has increased from 58 kg at admission to 70.1 kg currently.

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has received metronidazole, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Other medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.4 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 38 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated troponin-T levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient continues to require pressors for hemodynamic support. There is an attempt to decrease fluid resuscitation due to low central venous pressure (CVP) and ongoing fluid leakage into the interstitium. The patient remains on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's abdominal pain and distension have improved, but there is still copious output from the nasogastric tube, indicating a possible bowel obstruction secondary to the pancreatic cancer.

The patient has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), leukocytosis, pneumonia due to aspiration, and cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the pancreas.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis-related complications: The patient's sepsis may lead to further organ dysfunction or failure, such as acute kidney injury or respiratory failure.

2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's DIC can result in bleeding complications due to the consumption of clotting factors and platelets.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia can progress to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or develop respiratory failure.

4. Bowel obstruction: The patient's bowel obstruction can lead to complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation if not promptly managed.

5. Cancer progression: The patient's pancreatic cancer may continue to progress and cause additional complications or symptoms.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and promptly address any potential complications that may arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo woman with h/o metastatic pancreatic CA s/p xeloda and carboplatic
   admitted with nausea/vomiting, developed bowel obstruction/ileus,
   aspiration PNA, severe sepsis, and MODS.
Aspiration PNA with respiratory failure
   -          treating with vancomycin and zosyn (day 1 = [**1-26**]); added
   flagyl as above
   -          d/c
ed sedation, RSBI is acceptable, will extubate today as
   part of overall plan to make pt [**Name (NI) 617**]
   -          cont albuterol/ipratroprium MDI
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION):
   -          Continue vasopressin and norepinephrine to maintain MAP >
   65, wean as tolerated.
   -          continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl (C Diff was negative x 1)
   -          CVP =[**7-1**], but would not give IVF as developing anasarca and
   volume overload
   -          No stress dose steroids as cortisol response acceptable
   # Coagulopathy :much improved with vitamin K, would argue for
   nutritional or antibiotic-associated coagulopathy.
   -          continue vitamin K x 3 days total
   -          if pt not [**Month/Day (3) 617**] would transfuse platelets if <50 and bleeding
   -          thrombocytopenia likely a manifestation of sepsis
   # Anemia
 pt with large GI bleeding as etiology. HCTs appear to have
   stabilized
   -          if [**Month/Day (3) 617**] would not favor any intervention
   -          if not, check PM HCT,  would transfuse additional blood
   # Altered Mental Status:
   -          remains very sedated this morning despite off of meds. Could
   be residual effect of sedatives
   -          may be also neurologic insult during her acute
   decompensation (hypotension to 50s)
   -          CT head negative for evidence of bleed
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS) and distention
 [**1-25**]
   ileus or partial SBO
   -          Continues to drain feculent material from above and below
   -          intraabdominal source of infection covered with zosyn;
   flagyl to cover any C Diff
   -          holding motility agents, NPO
 LEUKOCYTOSIS: - resolved
   -          all culture data negative
   -          continue vanc/zosyn and flagyl
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -          resolved, was likely prerenal
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), PANCREAS
metastatic to lungs, locally
   advanced
   -          no more chemotherapy, appreciate assistance from Onc team in
   discussing goals of care with family
   # h/o CVA:  holding coumadin (unclear why on coumadin)
   # Hypothyroidism: on levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer who was admitted with nausea/vomiting, developed bowel obstruction/ileus, aspiration pneumonia, severe sepsis, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and metronidazole. Despite being off sedatives, her mental status remains poor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient developed aspiration pneumonia, which has led to respiratory failure. She is being treated with appropriate antibiotics, but there is a risk of further respiratory complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis, and her condition requires continued management with vasopressin and norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. There is a risk of septic shock and organ failure if not properly managed.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient had coagulopathy, which has improved with vitamin K administration. However, there is a risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, likely a manifestation of sepsis. Close monitoring of platelet count is necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to large gastrointestinal bleeding. Her hematocrit (HCT) levels appear to have stabilized, but"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly, frail, and ill individual admitted to the ICU with aspiration pneumonia. They have a history of severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, abdominal pain, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), leukocytosis, pneumonia due to aspiration, and pancreatic cancer. The patient's mental status remains poor despite no sedatives, and they are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. They have developed bloody stools with clots, which were treated with fresh frozen plasma and platelets. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is low at 19.9%. The family is expected to arrive soon for the extubation procedure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to aspiration pneumonia and poor respiratory function. There is a risk of respiratory failure if the ventilation support is discontinued prematurely or if the patient's underlying lung condition worsens.
2. Bleeding: The presence of bloody stools and low platelet count indicate a potential bleeding risk. The administration of fresh frozen plasma and platelets suggests an attempt to correct the coagulopathy. However, if the underlying cause of the bleeding is not addressed, further complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage could occur.
3. Infection: Aspiration pneumonia can lead to respiratory infections, and the patient already has leukocytosis and pneumonia. If the infection progresses or if there are new infections, it may compromise the patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo woman with h/o metastatic pancreatic CA s/p xeloda and carboplatic
   admitted with nausea/vomiting, developed bowel obstruction/ileus,
   aspiration PNA, severe sepsis, and MODS. Planning for conversion to [**Month/Day (4) 617**]
   status today.
Aspiration PNA with respiratory failure
   -          treating with vancomycin and zosyn (day 1 = [**1-26**]); added
   flagyl as above
   -          d/c
ed sedation, RSBI is acceptable, will extubate today as
   part of overall plan to make pt [**Name (NI) 617**]
   -          cont albuterol/ipratroprium MDI
   -          if [**Name (NI) 617**] would d/c all of the above except for prn nebs
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION):
   -          Continue vasopressin and norepinephrine to maintain MAP >
   65, wean as tolerated.
   -          continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl (C Diff was negative x 1)
   -          CVP =[**7-1**], but would not give IVF as developing anasarca and
   volume overload
   # Coagulopathy :much improved with vitamin K, would argue for
   nutritional or antibiotic-associated coagulopathy.
   -          continue vitamin K x 3 days total
   -          if pt not [**Month/Day (3) 617**] would transfuse platelets if <50 and bleeding,
   otherwise no further CBCs
   -          thrombocytopenia likely a manifestation of sepsis
   # Anemia
 pt with large GI bleeding as acute etiology. HCTs appear to
   have stabilized at 19-20.
   -          if [**Month/Day (3) 617**] would not favor any intervention
   -          if not, check PM HCT,  would transfuse additional blood
   # Altered Mental Status:
   -          remains very sedated this morning despite off of meds. Could
   be residual effect of sedatives
   -          may be also neurologic insult during her acute
   decompensation (hypotension to 50s)
   -          CT head negative for evidence of bleed
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS) and distention
 [**1-25**]
   ileus or partial SBO
   -          Continues to drain feculent material from above and below
   -          intraabdominal source of infection covered with zosyn;
   flagyl to cover any C Diff
   -          holding motility agents, NPO
 LEUKOCYTOSIS: - resolved
   -          all culture data negative
   -          continue vanc/zosyn and flagyl
   # Hypothyroidism: on levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer who was admitted with nausea, vomiting, and developed bowel obstruction/ileus, aspiration pneumonia, severe sepsis, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). She is currently being treated for aspiration pneumonia with vancomycin and Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam), and also for sepsis with vasopressin and norepinephrine. The patient's condition remains unstable, and there are concerns about her altered mental status, anemia, coagulopathy, and abdominal pain/distention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has aspiration pneumonia and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if her lung function does not improve.
2. Sepsis: The patient is still experiencing septic shock, as indicated by the need for vasopressin and norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure. There is a risk of continued organ dysfunction or deterioration.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a low platelet count and prolonged clotting times, indicating coagulopathy. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level, suggesting anemia. This may be due to large gastrointestinal bleeding or other causes. Anemia can lead to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Altered Mental Status: The"
