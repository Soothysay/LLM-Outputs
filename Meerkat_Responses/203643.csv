   Imaging: HISTORY: 54-year-old female with right internal jugular line
   placement, to assess the positioning.
     TECHNIQUE: Single portable AP radiograph of the chest was performed.
   Comparison is made with examination of [**2120-11-8**] done at 18:45.
     FINDINGS:
   The endotracheal tube is approximately 16 mm from the carina and needs
   repositioning. The nasogastric tube is projected over the distal
   esophagus and should be further advanced. The right internal jugular
   line is projected over the right atrium. No pneumothorax. The heart
   again is grossly enlarged, and there is prominence of the pulmonary
   vasculature. There also may be a
   left basal effusion.
     CONCLUSION:
   The constellation of findings is consistent with CHF with consolidation
   at the left base. The ET tube needs to be repositioned and the NG tube
   needs to be advanced further. The right- sided central line has its tip
   projected over the right atrium.
     The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 54 yoF w/ a h/o obesity hypoventilation syndrome, OSA,
   multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure presents with
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis: fever and possible pulmonary infiltrate as well as
   hypotension so will treat for sepsis preliminarily as a pneumonic
   source.  Given the patient's multiple hospitalizations and very recent
   hospitalization will need to cover hospital organisms, also likely that
   she has aspirated given history of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Also the patient has a + u/a with moderate leuk esterase and > 50wbc so
   urosepsis is also a possibility.  She was hypotensive prior to
   intubation.
   -f/u u/a and urine culture
   -f/u blood cultures
   -send sputum cultures
   -send C diff if diarrhea
   -previous culture data without resistant bacteria, but was on cefpodox
   so will cover with vanc / zosyn and levofloxacin for atypical coverage
   -bolus IVF to CVP of [**9-8**]
   -continuous SVO2 monitoring, hct is 30.5 so if < 70 will add dobutamine
   -MAP=76. Goal is greater than 65.
   -f/u lactate
   -given steroid use will draw cortisol and [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim, if relative
   adrenal insufficiency and still hypotensive will start stress dose
   steroids otherwise can use prednisone 5mg daily.
   -f/u CBC
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Initial PCO2 was 105.  Improved with
   mechanical ventilation. Now alkalemic with pH=7.50.
   -multiple hospitalizations related to hypercarbic respiratory failure
   thought to be due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
   -baseline PaCO2 is in the 60s
   -follow serial ABGs, this hypercarbic respiratory failure was likely
   secondary to aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis however it is possible
   she had hypercarbic respiratory failure and obtundation / mental status
   changes which caused her to aspirate.
   .
   # mental status changes: per ED she was unable to respond fully to
   questions but was arousable, she improved with supplemental oxygen but
   her PaCO2 was extremely elevated so she was intubated. On
   fentanyl/versed, patient remains unresponsive to verbal stimuli. She
   does respond to painful stimuli by withdrawing.
   -likely is secondary to PaCO2 and to pneumonia / infectious process,
   will need to reevaluate by decreasing fentanyl/versed as PaCO2 has
   decreased with mechanical ventilation.
   .
   # Panhypopituitarism: partially empty sella on desmopressin,
   levothyroxine, prednisone at home, will continue these medications at
   the current dosage.
   -followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2226**] as an outpatient
   .
   # HTN: given hypotension / sepsis will hold home antihypertensives
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr is 0.9, currently is 1.0, improved from 1.2 last
   night.
   -send u/a, urine culture, and urine electolytes
   -trend Cr.
   -if worsening, can further investigate with renal ultrasound

   Assessment and Plan
   1)  Sepsis:  Possible sources include urinary and pulmonary
 likely
   PNA given infiltrates and respiratory failure.  Currently covered
   empirically with vanco/zosyn/levoflox given history of multiple
   admission and need resistant gram negative and gram positive
   organisms.  Await culture results.  Currently she is hemodynamically
   stable following volume resucitation.  Last measured CVP was 9, MAP
   70s, lactate 1.8, CvO2 >70%
   - Continue empiric antibiotics until cultures return.
   - Currently volume status is appropriate, will give volume for HoTN or
   decreased UOP but no longer needed to maintain CVP as a stand-alone
   goal given > 12h from onset of infection and now hemodynamically
   stable.
   2)  Hypercarbic/Hypoxemic respiratory failure: initial Pco2 105; likely
   related to Obesity hypoventilation syndrome and AMS from UTI/PNA.
   - Current minute ventilation of 5.9L/min is appropriate with goal PCO2
   of 50-60
   - She is hypoxemic with A-a gradient, related to PNA, ? CHF. She was HD
   unstable on admission, and will follow today. Will diurese when proves
   she is HD stable.
   3) Endocrine: h/o panhypopit
 on replacement doses.  Cortisol > 20
   - desmopressin, synthroid, prednisone
   4) CV- Hypertension:  currently holding anti-hypertensives given sepsis

   Assessment and Plan
   1)  Sepsis:  Possible sources include urinary and pulmonary
 likely
   PNA given infiltrates and respiratory failure.  Currently covered
   empirically with vanco/zosyn/levoflox given history of multiple
   admission and need resistant gram negative and gram positive
   organisms.  Await culture results.  Currently she is hemodynamically
   stable following volume resucitation.  Last measured CVP was 9, MAP
   70s, lactate 1.8, CvO2 >70%
   - Continue empiric antibiotics until cultures return.
   - Currently volume status is appropriate, will give volume for HoTN or
   decreased UOP but no longer needed to maintain CVP as a stand-alone
   goal given > 12h from onset of infection and now hemodynamically
   stable.
   2)  Hypercarbic/Hypoxemic respiratory failure: initial Pco2 105; likely
   related to Obesity hypoventilation syndrome and AMS from UTI/PNA.
   - Current minute ventilation of 5.9L/min is appropriate with goal PCO2
   of 50-60
   - She is hypoxemic with A-a gradient, related to PNA, ? CHF. She was HD
   unstable on admission, and will follow today. Will diurese when proves
   she is HD stable.
   3) Endocrine: h/o panhypopit

   Imaging: HISTORY: 54-year-old female with right internal jugular line
   placement, to assess the positioning.
     TECHNIQUE: Single portable AP radiograph of the chest was performed.
   Comparison is made with examination of [**2120-11-8**] done at 18:45.
     FINDINGS:
   The endotracheal tube is approximately 16 mm from the carina and needs
   repositioning. The nasogastric tube is projected over the distal
   esophagus and should be further advanced. The right internal jugular
   line is projected over the right atrium. No pneumothorax. The heart
   again is grossly enlarged, and there is prominence of the pulmonary
   vasculature. There also may be a
   left basal effusion.
     CONCLUSION:
   The constellation of findings is consistent with CHF with consolidation
   at the left base. The ET tube needs to be repositioned and the NG tube
   needs to be advanced further. The right- sided central line has its tip
   projected over the right atrium.
     The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 54 yoF w/ a h/o obesity hypoventilation syndrome, OSA,
   multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure presents with
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis: Patient admitted with fever and possible pulmonary infiltrate
   as well as hypotension, so she was treated for sepsis due to a
   pneumonic source.  Given the patient's multiple hospitalizations and
   very recent hospitalization will need to cover hospital organisms, also
   likely that she has aspirated given history of hypercarbic respiratory
   failure.  Also the patient has a + u/a with moderate leuk esterase and
   > 50wbc so urosepsis is also a possibility.  She was hypotensive prior
   to intubation.
   -f/u u/a and urine culture
   -f/u blood cultures
   -send sputum cultures
   -send C diff if diarrhea
   -previous culture data without resistant bacteria, but was on cefpodox
   so will cover with vanc / zosyn and levofloxacin for atypical coverage
   -MAP=76. Goal is greater than 65.
   -f/u lactate
   -Coritsol = 29, indicating sufficient adrenal response, ruling out
   adrenal insufficiency as a cause of her hypotension
   -f/u CBC daily
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Multiple hospitalizations related to
   hypercarbic respiratory failure thought to be due to obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome. At this admission, initial PCO2 was 105 with
   improvement on mechanical ventilation. Current pH=7.42 with PCO2=51 and
   PO2=82. This is appropriate for her as she has chronically elevated
   PCO2. Furthermore, PO2 at this level provides adequate oxygenation. It
   is likely that her pneumonic process is affecting her oxygenation as
   well.
   - Maintain current vent settings. Recheck ABG if settings changed in
   future.
   - baseline PaCO2 is in the 60s. This is her goal.
   .
   # Mental status changes: Per ED she was unable to respond fully to
   questions but was arousable, she improved with supplemental oxygen but
   her PaCO2 was extremely elevated so she was intubated. On
   fentanyl/versed, patient remains unresponsive to verbal stimuli. She
   does respond to painful stimuli by withdrawing. With decrease infusion
   of fentanyl/versed, patient is able to respond to verbal commands.
   Mental status changes likely were initially related to her infectious
   process.
   - Continue to evaluate daily as her infection/sepsis resolves.
   .
   # Panhypopituitarism: Partially empty sella, currently on desmopressin,
   levothyroxine, prednisone at home.
   - Will continue these medications at the current dosage.
   - Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2226**] as an outpatient
   .
   # HTN: given hypotension / sepsis will hold home antihypertensives
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr is 0.9, currently is 1.0, improved from 1.2 last
   night.
   -send u/a, urine culture, and urine electolytes
   -trend Cr.
   -if worsening, can further investigate with renal ultrasound
   -foley in place
   .
   # FEN:  Start tube feeds. With elevated [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give 1 liter free
   water in the NG tube. Currently receiving Phos repletion. Will monitor
   with electrolytes at 3pm today. Elevated INR likely due to decreased
   nutritional status as albumin is also decreased. Will recheck this
   afternoon as well after starting tube feeds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She presented with fever, hypotension, and possible pulmonary infiltrate, leading to treatment for sepsis due to a pneumonic source. The patient also has a positive urine analysis with moderate leuk esterase and >50 WBCs, indicating the possibility of urosepsis. She was intubated prior to admission and remains on mechanical ventilation. Her current vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 135/71 mmHg to 93/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's physical examination reveals scleral edema, JVD, RRR, 2/6 SEM heard over all heart areas, CTAB anteriorly and laterally, soft obese abdomen, and 2+ pitting pedal edema bilaterally symmetric. Her laboratory results indicate an elevated WBC count, slightly decreased Hct, elevated lactate level, and abnormal imaging findings suggestive of congestive heart failure with consolidation at the left base. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, mental status changes, panhypopituitarism, hypertension, acute renal failure, and feeding"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 54 yoF w/ a h/o obesity hypoventilation syndrome, OSA,
   multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure presents with
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis: Patient admitted with fever and possible pulmonary infiltrate
   as well as hypotension, so she was treated for sepsis due to a
   pulmonary source (vanc/ zosyn/ levofloxacin for legionella coverge).
   Pt has had recent hospitalization so at risk for HAP.  Additionally, pt
   UA was positive and urine culture growing GNR.  Pt could also have
   pyelonephritis and  urosepsis as likely cause of sepsis.
   -t/c narrowing to ceftriaxone and vanc and d/c zosyn & levofloxacin
   given lack of culture data to support pna
   - urine culture & sensitivities
   -f/u blood cultures
   -f/u sputum cultures, cxr
   -send C diff if diarrhea
   -maintain MAP > 65.
   -trend wbc and fever curve
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Multiple hospitalizations related to
   hypercarbic respiratory failure thought to be due to obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome. At this admission, initial PCO2 was 105 with
   improvement on mechanical ventilation. Current pH=7.44 with PCO2=50 and
   PO2=115 HCO:35. Pt has chronically elevated PCO2.  Pt clinically
   appears much improved. RSBI: 94
   - will wean sedation and attempt to wean
   - [**Month (only) **] FiO2, will recheck ABG if settings changed in future.
   .
   # Panhypopituitarism: Partially empty sella, currently on desmopressin,
   levothyroxine, prednisone at home.
   - Will continue these medications at the current dosage.
   .
   # HTN: given hypotension / sepsis will hold home antihypertensives
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr is 0.9, currently 1.3 today adn trending up
   -trend Cr.
   -check urine lytes, hold on U/S for now
   -foley in place
   .
   #Hypernatermia: Pt with Na 149 today.  Free water deficit is 4.2L.  Pt
   is receiving water flushes from feeding tube.
   .
   #Anemia: Pt Hct 27.9 today. MCV normocytic
   - check Fe studies
   - guiac stools
   - Transfusion if Hct < 25

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure and possible pulmonary infiltrate. She has been treated for sepsis due to a pulmonary source, receiving antibiotics such as vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin. Her recent hospitalization puts her at risk for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). Additionally, she has a positive urine culture growing gram-negative rods, indicating a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) or pyelonephritis. She also has anemia, hypernatremia, acute kidney injury (ARF), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with fever and hypotension suggests sepsis. She has been treated for sepsis with appropriate antibiotics, but the source of infection is still under investigation. Monitoring her blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine culture sensitivities will help identify the causative organism and guide further treatment.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of multiple hospitalizations related to hypercarbic respiratory failure due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Mechanical ventilation has improved her current condition, with a decrease in PCO2 from 105 to 50. Weaning off sed"

   Assesment: 54 yoF w/ a h/o obesity hypoventilation syndrome, OSA,
   multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure presents with
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis: Patient admitted with fever and possible pulmonary infiltrate
   as well as hypotension, so she was treated for sepsis due to a
   pulmonary source (vanc/ zosyn/ levofloxacin for legionella coverge).
   Pt has had recent hospitalization so at risk for HAP.  Additionally, pt
   UA was positive and urine culture growing GNR.  However, pt more likely
   to have pyelonephritis and urosepsis as a cause of her sepsis then a
   pulmonary etiology given improvement in CXR.
   -Will start ceftriaxone and cont zosyn & levofloxacin.  Will d/c vanco
   -f/u urine culture & sensitivities
   -f/u blood cultures
   -f/u sputum cultures, cxr
   -maintain MAP > 65.
   -trend wbc and fever curve
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Multiple hospitalizations related to
   hypercarbic respiratory failure thought to be due to obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome. At this admission, initial PCO2 was 105 with
   improvement on mechanical ventilation. Current pH=7.44 with PCO2=50 and
   PO2=115 HCO:35. Pt has chronically elevated PCO2.  Pt clinically
   appears much improved. RSBI: 94.
   - will wean sedation and attempt to wean
   - [**Month (only) **] FiO2, will recheck ABG if settings changed in future.
   .
   # Panhypopituitarism: Partially empty sella, currently on desmopressin,
   levothyroxine, prednisone at home.
   - Will continue these medications at the current dosage.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient has been treated for sepsis due to a pulmonary source, with antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin. However, she is more likely to have pyelonephritis and urosepsis as the cause of her sepsis, given the improvement in her chest X-ray.

She has a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure related to obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Her initial PCO2 was 105, but it has improved on mechanical ventilation. Her current pH is 7.44 with PCO2=50 and PO2=115, indicating some improvement.

The patient also has panhypopituitarism and is on desmopressin, levothyroxine, and prednisone at home. These medications will be continued at the current dosage.

   Assessment and Plan
   54F with recurrent admissions for urosepsis inducing altered mental
   status; here w/ likely urosepsis and hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory
   failure.
   1)  Sepsis:  Possible sources include urinary and pulmonary.  Currently
   covered empirically with vanco/zosyn/levoflox given history of multiple
   admissions and need for resistant gram negative and gram positive
   organisms.  Urine culture with GNR, awaiting speciation.  CXR improving
   today and less concerning for PNA.  Suspect urosepsis.
   - D/c vancomycin.  Continue zosyn/levofloxacin for GN coverage until
   species and sensitivities return.
   - Currently volume status is appropriate, will give volume for HoTN or
   decreased UOP but no longer needed to maintain CVP as a stand-alone
   goal given > 12h from onset of infection and now hemodynamically
   stable.
   2)  Hypercarbic/Hypoxemic respiratory failure: initial Pco2 105; likely
   related to Obesity hypoventilation syndrome and AMS from UTI/PNA.
   Currently on SBT, is comfortable and doing well; however, her PCO2 is
   rising to 69 with pH 7.31.  She appears comfortable.  PaO2 91 on FiO2
   0.4
   - Leave on PSV ventilation and follow-up ABG later today.
   - Decrease FiO2 to 0.35 in case she has increased V/Q mismatch and/or
   blunted hypercarbic respiratory drive.
   3) Endocrine: h/o panhypopit
 on replacement doses.  Cortisol > 20
   - desmopressin, synthroid, prednisone
   4) Renal:  Cr rising to 1.3 from 0.9 today.  She has adequate urine
   output.  Suspect ATN from hypotension or sepsis induced kidney injury.
   CVP is 16 currently.
   - Will continue her home dose of lasix, aim for body balance even to
   -500cc today.
   - Check urine lytes, sediment

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient, a 54-year-old female with a history of recurrent admissions for urosepsis and altered mental status, is currently in the ICU with likely urosepsis and hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. She is intubated but awake and follows commands. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/64 mmHg to 150/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%.

The patient is on spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and is comfortable. However, her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.31, indicating respiratory acidosis. The patient's lungs are generally clear, and her chest X-ray is improving. She has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg and fluid balance within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and mild elevation in creatinine level. Other lab values are within normal range. 

The patient is being treated empirically with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin for suspected urosepsis. The urine culture with"

   Assessment and Plan
   54F with recurrent admissions for urosepsis inducing altered mental
   status; here w/ likely urosepsis and hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory
   failure.
   1)  Sepsis:  Possible sources include urinary and pulmonary.  Currently
   covered empirically with vanco/zosyn/levoflox given history of multiple
   admissions and need for resistant gram negative and gram positive
   organisms.  Urine culture with GNR, awaiting speciation.  CXR improving
   today and less concerning for PNA.  Suspect urosepsis.
   - D/c vancomycin.  Continue zosyn/levofloxacin for GN coverage until
   species and sensitivities return.
   - Currently volume status is appropriate, will give volume for HoTN or
   decreased UOP but no longer needed to maintain CVP as a stand-alone
   goal given > 12h from onset of infection and now hemodynamically
   stable.
   2)  Hypercarbic/Hypoxemic respiratory failure: initial Pco2 105; likely
   related to Obesity hypoventilation syndrome and AMS from UTI/PNA.
   Currently on SBT, is comfortable and doing well; however, her PCO2 is
   rising to 69 with pH 7.31.  She appears comfortable.  PaO2 91 on FiO2
   0.4
   - Leave on PSV ventilation and follow-up ABG later today.
   - Decrease FiO2 to 0.35 in case she has increased V/Q mismatch and/or
   blunted hypercarbic respiratory drive.
   3) Endocrine: h/o panhypopit
 on replacement doses.  Cortisol > 20
   - desmopressin, synthroid, prednisone
   4) Renal:  Cr rising to 1.3 from 0.9 today.  She has adequate urine
   output.  Suspect ATN from hypotension or sepsis induced kidney injury.
   CVP is 16 currently.
   - Will continue her home dose of lasix, aim for body balance even to
   -500cc today.
   - Check urine lytes, sediment

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of recurrent admissions for urosepsis, resulting in altered mental status. She is currently in the ICU with suspected urosepsis and hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/64 mmHg to 150/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on supplemental oxygen. She is intubated and on spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), responding appropriately to commands.

The patient has been on various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, desmopressin, and prednisone. Her fluid balance shows an intake of 2,625 mL with an output of 3,125 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 500 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with PSV/SBT ventilation mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 401 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 32 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 29 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 93.

   Assessment and Plan
   1)  Sepsis:  Possible sources include urinary and pulmonary.  Currently
   covered empirically with vanco/zosyn/levoflox given history of multiple
   admissions and need for resistant gram negative and gram positive
   organisms.  Urine culture with GNR, awaiting speciation.  CXR improving
   today and less concerning for PNA.  Suspect urosepsis.
   - D/c vancomycin.  Continue zosyn/levofloxacin for GN coverage until
   species and sensitivities return.
   - Currently volume status is appropriate, will give volume for HoTN or
   decreased UOP but no longer needed to maintain CVP as a stand-alone
   goal given > 12h from onset of infection and now hemodynamically
   stable.
   2)  Hypercarbic/Hypoxemic respiratory failure: initial Pco2 105; likely
   related to Obesity hypoventilation syndrome and AMS from UTI/PNA.
   Currently on SBT, is comfortable and doing well; however, her PCO2 is
   rising to 69 with pH 7.31.  She appears comfortable.  PaO2 91 on FiO2
   0.4
   - Leave on PSV ventilation and follow-up ABG later today.
   - Decrease FiO2 to 0.35 in case she has increased V/Q mismatch and/or
   blunted hypercarbic respiratory drive.
   3) Endocrine: h/o panhypopit
 on replacement doses.  Cortisol > 20
   - desmopressin, synthroid, prednisone
   4) Renal:  Cr rising to 1.3 from 0.9 today.  She has adequate urine
   output.  Suspect ATN from hypotension or sepsis induced kidney injury.
   CVP is 16 currently.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5950**] is a critically ill patient in the ICU. She has been stable with improvement in her hemodynamics. She has a history of multiple admissions and need for resistant gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. She is suspected to have urosepsis and her urine culture with GNR is awaiting speciation. She is currently on empiric coverage with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/64 to 150/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 401 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 0 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%. Her arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.31, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco2) of 69 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 91 on FiO2 0.4. Her laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 112 K/uL, blood glucose of 92 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, and potassium of 4.0 mEq/L. Her physical examination shows no significant abnormalities. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Ms. [**Known lastname 5950**] has sepsis with possible sources including urinary and pulmonary. She is currently covered empirically with antibiotics.
2. Hypercarbic/Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: She has initial Pco2 105 and is likely related to obesity hypoventilation syndrome and AMS from UTI/PNA. She is currently on spontaneous breath trials and her PaO2 is 91 on FiO2 0.4.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): Her creatinine is rising to 1.3 from 0.9 today, and she has adequate urine output. She may have ATN from hypotension or sepsis-induced kidney injury.
4. Panhypopituitarism: She has a history of panhypopituitarism and is on replacement doses of desmopressin, synthroid, and prednisone."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo F w/ obesity hypoventilation syndrome, OSA, multiple admissions
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure presented [**2120-11-8**] with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   #. Sepsis: Secondary to either UTI or pneumonia. Clear pathogen
   identified by urine culture. Sputum culture with no growth, although
   possible infiltrates on chest radiograph. WBC count normal, and low
   grade fever overnight. Currently on Zosyn and levofloxacin for 4 days
   now. Vanco d/c
   - D/c Zosyn
   - Continue levofloxacin
   - IVF bolus to support BP as needed
   - Trend WBC and fever curves
   - Monitor blood cultures; reculture if continues to spike fever
   #. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Multiple hospitalizations related
   to hypercarbic respiratory failure thought to be due to obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome. At this admission, initial PCO2 was 105 with
   improvement on mechanical ventilation. Pt clinically appears much
   improved
 anxious to have ETT removed. Hypercarbia resolved.
   - Wean off of vent today
   #. Panhypopituitarism: Partially empty sella, currently on
   desmopressin, levothyroxine, prednisone at home.
   - Will continue these medications at the current dosage.
   #. HTN:
   - Consider adding back anti-hypertensives if is consistently
   hypertensive after extubation
   #. ARF: Baseline creatinine is 0.9. Currently 1.2 and trending towards
   baseline. FeNa 8.2% - good urine production and creatinine normalizing.
   Possible AIN given presence of eosinophils in urine.
   - Trend Cr.
   #Hypernatremia: Serum Na 146 today. Free water deficit is 2.7L. Given
   hypokalemia as well, likely related to steroid replacement for
   panhypopituitarism.
   - D5
 NS IVF today to correct
   #Anemia: Pt Hct 27.9 today. MCV normocytic
   - check Fe studies
   - guiac stools
   - Transfusion if Hct < 25
   #Diastolic CHF: Pt was restarted on her home lasix.  Pt was net
   negative 500cc yesterday.  Goal will be to even to slightly negative.
   # FEN: D/c TF in preparation for extubation today. Replete lytes prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea who presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has had multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient's urine culture showed E. coli resistant to ampicillin, and she is on antibiotics (Zosyn and levofloxacin) for suspected sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI) or pneumonia. Her blood cultures are pending. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and she has hypernatremia, anemia, and acute kidney injury (AIN) with an elevated creatinine level. The patient's plan includes weaning off mechanical ventilation, considering the addition of anti-hypertensives, checking iron studies, and potentially transfusing if the hematocrit level falls below 25.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already on antibiotics for suspected sepsis, and her blood cultures are pending. If the infection does not improve or if new pathogens are identified, a change in antibiotics may be necessary.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening. Weaning off mechanical ventilation and ensuring proper oxygenation will be crucial in her recovery.

3. Panhypopituitarism: The patient has panhypopituitarism and is on replacement therapy for des"

   as well as hypotension, so she was treated for sepsis due to a
   pulmonary source (vanc/ zosyn/ levofloxacin for legionella coverge).
   Pt has had recent hospitalization so at risk for HAP.  Additionally, pt
   UA was positive and urine culture growing GNR.  However, pt more likely
   to have pyelonephritis and urosepsis as a cause of her sepsis then a
   pulmonary etiology given improvement in CXR.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and was treated for sepsis due to a possible pulmonary source. The patient's urine culture showed growth of a Gram-negative rod, indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI) that may have led to urosepsis. The initial plan included starting ceftriaxone and continuing with zosyn and levofloxacin, discontinuing vancomycin, and following up with urine culture and sensitivities, blood cultures, and sputum cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with fever and possible pulmonary infiltrate, suggesting sepsis. She was treated for sepsis due to a pulmonary source, but it is likely that she had urosepsis caused by a UTI rather than a pulmonary etiology.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome and multiple hospitalizations related to hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently improving on mechanical ventilation, but there is a risk of recurrence if the ventilator support is weaned prematurely.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine is 0.9, and it has increased to 1.3 today. Trending upward"

   54F with recurrent admissions for urosepsis inducing altered mental
   status; here w/ likely urosepsis and hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory
   failure.
   1)  Sepsis:  Urine culture with e.coli resistant only to unasyn; she
   has been hemodynamically stable and now afebrile.  Will tailor
   antibiotics.
   - Continue levofloxacin only for course of UTI.
   - Discontinue zosyn; off vancomycin
   2)  Hypercarbic/Hypoxemic respiratory failure: 7.42/42/96 on PSV 5/5
   with FiO2 0.3.  Hypoxemia improved with diuresis.  Suspect her
   hypercapnea yesterday related to fever.  She is passing SBT without
   development of rising PCO2, has appropriate mental status.
   - Extubate today
   - Aim for body balance negative today
   3) Endocrine: h/o panhypopit
 on replacement doses.  Cortisol > 20
   - desmopressin, synthroid, prednisone
   4) Renal:  Creatinine stable today from yesterday despite diuresis.
   Also is hypernatremic.
   - Follow daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and septic shock. She is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a FiO2 of 30% and shows good oxygenation with a SpO2 of 96%. Her vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/68 mmHg to 148/82 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-16 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 36.6°C. The patient has a history of angioedema with ACE inhibitors and shortness of breath with lisinopril.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia due to the presence of the endotracheal tube.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of blood clots forming in the deep veins, which can lead to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum due to the body's stress response. This can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient is at risk of acquiring infections from healthcare-associated sources, including catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections.

   possible infiltrates on chest radiograph. WBC count had been normal,
   now elevated to 11.6. No fever overnight. Currently on Zosyn and
   levofloxacin for 5 days now. Blood pressure has been stable overnight.
   - Continue levofloxacin
   - IVF bolus to support BP as needed
   - Trend WBC and fever curves
   - Await results of blood cultures.
   #. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Multiple hospitalizations related
   to hypercarbic respiratory failure thought to be due to obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome. At this admission, initial PCO2 was 105 with
   improvement on mechanical ventilation. Pt clinically appears much
   improved. Hypercarbia resolved. Appears comfortable off mechanical
   ventilation.
   #. Panhypopituitarism: Partially empty sella, currently on
   desmopressin, levothyroxine, prednisone at home.
   - Will continue these medications at the current dosage.
   #. HTN: On clonidine, valsartan, and metoprolol as outpatient.
   - Consider adding back anti-hypertensives if is consistently
   hypertensive after extubation
   #. ARF: Baseline creatinine is 0.9. Currently 1.0. FeNa 8.2% - good
   urine production and Creatinine normalizing. Possible AIN given

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has been on invasive ventilation and has now been extubated. She is on BiPap support and restarted on her home blood pressure medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 127/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. Her general appearance is well-nourished, non-acute distress, and overweight/obese.

On cardiovascular examination, her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and there is a systolic ejection murmur heard loudest at the upper sternal border. Peripheral pulses are present and palpable. No other abnormalities are noted.

Respiratory examination reveals expiratory wheezes louder on the left side, but no crackles, bronchial breath sounds, or rhonchi. The chest radiograph shows severe cardiomegaly, unchanged from previous images. There is also a dilated mediastinum, bibasal atelectasis, and proper placement of the endotracheal, NG, and internal jugular lines.

Abdominal examination shows soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and was initially on invasive ventilation but has now been extubated and placed on BiPap. She has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications for her chronic conditions such as hypertension, hypopituitarism, and anemia. Her fluid balance is negative 3.6L, indicating net fluid loss. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 127/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula with FiO2 of 30%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has an elevated WBC count and is on antibiotics for suspected UTI or pneumonia. Close monitoring of fever curves and blood cultures is recommended.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Although the patient appears improved and her hypercarbia has resolved, there is a risk of recurrence due to her underlying obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Continued monitoring of respiratory status is necessary.
3. Panhypopituitarism: The patient is currently on desmopressin, levothyroxine, and prednisone"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo F w/ obesity hypoventilation syndrome, OSA, pan-hypopituitarism,
   multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure presented
   [**2120-11-8**] with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   #. Sepsis: Secondary to either UTI or pneumonia. Clear pathogen
   identified by urine culture. Sputum culture with no growth, although
   possible infiltrates on chest radiograph. WBC count had been normal,
   now elevated to 11.6. As all three cell lines are increased compared to
   yesterday, this may be due to hemo-concentration from diuresis of ~4 L
   yesterday. No fever overnight, though spiked to 100.6 this morning.
   Currently on levofloxacin for 5 days now, though at renal dosing due to
   her elevated Cr. This may explain the elevated temperature. Blood
   pressure has been stable overnight.
   - Continue levofloxacin
 redose to 250mg PO Q24hrs
   - Trend WBC and fever curves
   - Await results of blood cultures.
   #. HTN: On clonidine, valsartan, and metoprolol as outpatient.
   Medications initially held due to hypotension. First doses given this
   morning with BP dropping to MAP=60..
   - Will reassess BP after she receives AM doses
 hold PM doses if
   remains hypotensive.
   #Diastolic CHF: Pt was restarted on her home lasix.  Pt was net
   negative 4L yesterday.  Goal will be even fluid balance today.
   #. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Multiple hospitalizations related
   to hypercarbic respiratory failure thought to be due to obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome. At this admission, initial PCO2 was 105 with
   improvement on mechanical ventilation. Pt clinically appears much
   improved. Hypercarbia resolved. Appears comfortable off mechanical
   ventilation. During admission has had increased work of breathing that
   seems to be related to increased temperature. Will monitor closely.
   #. Panhypopituitarism: Partially empty sella, currently on
   desmopressin, levothyroxine, prednisone at home.
   - Will continue these medications at the current dosage.
   #. ARF: Baseline creatinine is 0.9. Currently 1.0. FeNa 8.2% - good
   urine production and Creatinine normalizing. Possible AIN given
   presence of eosinophils in urine. Continue to monitor Cr.
   #Hypernatremia: Serum Na 142 today.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been related to steroid
   replacement for panhypopituitarism as there was associated hypokalemia
   with hypernatremia yesterday.
   - Stable. No intervention needed.
   #Anemia: Pt Hct 29.4 today. MCV normocytic. Appears to be at baseline.
   - Stable. Will continue to monitor with daily labs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, pan-hypopituitarism, and multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. She was successfully extubated and ordered for BiPap 10/5. The patient's current vitals are stable, with a temperature of 37.3 C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 127/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's fluid balance is negative 3.6 liters, and she has received various medications including clonidine, Diovan, lopressor, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

The patient has a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is thought to be due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She also has panhypopituitarism and is currently on desmopressin, levothyroxine, and prednisone. The patient's creatinine level is normalizing, and she has been started on levofloxacin for 5 days. Her WBC count is elevated, and she is being monitored closely for any signs of infection or sepsis. The patient's blood pressure is stable"

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   extubated yesterday
   4L neg/24 h
   4L NC supplemental oxygen
   UTI with sepsis, transient levophed, fluid resuscitation, now
   normotensive
   prednisone, desmopressin for panhypopit
   very frequent hospitalizations for hypercarbic resp distress in setting
   of OSA and likely OHS. Should be considered for chronic trach or
   intermittent NIPPV to prevent severe exacerbations

   Disposition :
   Total time spent:
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, hypercapnic respiratory failure, and urinary tract infection with sepsis. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. 

The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on 11/10/2120 at 8:51 AM. The patient received Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and Levofloxacin.

The patient has allergies to Ace inhibitors and angioedema, specifically Lisinopril.

On review of systems, the patient has fatigue, blurry vision, chest pain, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, less mobility, headache, and agitation.

Flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs as follows: maximum temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), current temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 69 bpm with a range of 65-86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/54 mmHg to 171/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute with a range of 11-19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 13 mmHg with a range of 11-25 mmHg. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,334 mL and a total output of 5,575 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes delivery of oxygen via a nasal cannula and an ABG result of pH 7.37.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, with the patient being overweight and obese. Eyes are described as PERRL. Cardiovascular examination shows distant S2. Peripheral pulses are not assessed. Respiratory/chest examination shows symmetric expansion and clear breath sounds. Abdominal examination is soft with present bowel sounds. Extremities reveal absent pulses on the right and left sides, with no cyanosis. Musculoskeletal examination shows less mobility and inability to stand. Neurologic examination indicates attentiveness, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

Lab results include a white blood cell count of 8.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 104 K/uL, blood glucose levels ranging from 84-112 mg/dL, and various other lab values within normal limits.

The patient has been extubated since yesterday. The assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring, supplemental oxygen, treatment for urinary tract infection with sepsis, and consideration for chronic tracheostomy or intermittent non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to prevent severe exacerbations. The patient is also receiving prednisone and desmopressin for panhypopituitarism."
