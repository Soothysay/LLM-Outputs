   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 78-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including COPD, GERD, hypertension, and a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented to the emergency department with malaise and upper respiratory infection symptoms. The patient's hemoglobin level was found to be low (Hct 27), and she was admitted to the floor. However, she soon developed coffee ground emesis and clots in her stool, leading to her transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU). The patient also had melena, and her hemoglobin level dropped further (Hct 20). She required intubation for airway protection and had a central line placed in her right internal jugular vein. A gastrointestinal (GI) scope revealed massive clots in the duodenum and stomach, and she received 4 units of uncrossmatched blood. Her hemoglobin level increased to 29.3.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications including propofol, pantoprazole, albuterol/atrovent, and others. She has allergies to penicillins and iodine. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36Â°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/42 to 192/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 78-year-old female with a history of moderate aortic stenosis, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The patient presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed three ulcers in the duodenal bulb. The patient received 4 units of unmatched blood and her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) increased from 20 to 31%. The patient is currently being monitored in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Re-bleeding: The presence of ulcers in the duodenal bulb increases the risk of recurrent bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of sinusitis and is on Bactrim for presumed upper respiratory infection (URI). There is a possibility of developing a secondary infection due to immunosuppression or prolonged intubation.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which may lead to decreased renal perfusion and AKI.
4. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, putting her at risk for respiratory complications such as hypoxia.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and advanced age are risk factors for DVT,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of moderate aortic stenosis, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and previous peptic ulcer disease. She presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which revealed three ulcers in the duodenal bulb. The patient received four units of unmatched blood and is being monitored for further interventions. She is currently on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) IV drip and is scheduled for another EGD in the morning to monitor the status of the clot. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has improved from 20% to 31% after transfusion. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. She is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Her urine output is normal, and her vital signs are stable. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a white blood cell count of 6.1, hemoglobin of 27.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 167,000/mm3. The patient has multiple comorbidities including anxiety, ineffective coping, depression, hyperlipidemia, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: There is a risk of rebleeding from the duodenal ulcers, especially if the current measures to control the"

She presented with symptoms of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which revealed three ulcers in the duodenal bulb. The patient received four units of blood transfusion and her hemoglobin concentration increased from 20% to 31%. The ulcers were not actively bleeding during the repeat EGD. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and she is oxygenating well on a nasal cannula. She is extubated after undergoing invasive ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UGIB: The patient initially presented with UGIB and required blood transfusion. Although the ulcers were not actively bleeding during the repeat EGD, there is a risk of re-bleeding or worsening of the condition.
2. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypertension, but her blood pressure is currently low. Close monitoring is required, and appropriate interventions should be taken to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels were critically low upon admission. Although her hemoglobin concentration has improved, ongoing monitoring is necessary to prevent further decline.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, and"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 78-year-old female with a history of moderate aortic stenosis, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). She presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was found to have a massive, dark-colored mass-like lesion near the duodenal bulb. The patient received 4 units of unmatched blood upon arrival, resulting in an increased hemoglobin concentration from 20% to 31%. A repeat endoscopy revealed three ulcers in the duodenal bulb without active bleeding. 

The patient's current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, isosorbide mononitrate, atenolol, simvastatin, ezetimibe, fluoxetine, and valium. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/51 mmHg to 127/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation with CPAP/PSV+Apnea Pres mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of moderate aortic stenosis, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and peptic ulcer disease presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and urinary tract infection symptoms (URI sx) for one week. The patient was found to have a massive, dark-colored mass-like lesion near the duodenal bulb, with clear stomach on endoscopy. She received 4 units of unmatched blood on arrival and had a significant increase in hematocrit (Hct) from 20 to 31%. The patient underwent repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed three ulcers in the duodenal bulb without active bleeding. No further interventions were taken, and recommendations were to obtain Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) testing and continue proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, as well as transfusing for Hct <30.

The patient has been placed on nothing by mouth (NPO) except for medications. The plan includes continuing PPI IV drip, monitoring Hct every third day and transfusing if below 29, maintaining systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 95-100 mmHg (avoiding mean arterial pressure [MAP] due to large pulse pressure with aortic stenosis), keeping the patient informed about worsening bleeding, and being aware of the availability of surgery and interventional radiology (IR) if the bleeding worsens.

The patient was previously intubated and is now extubated. Chest X-ray and physical examination did not indicate pneumonia. The patient is currently doing well on the nasal cannula, and respiratory support will continue with albuterol/ipratropium nebs as needed, fluticasone nasal spray daily, and Afrin as needed.

The patient's urinary tract infection symptoms could not be clarified upon admission due to the acuity of the situation, but it is likely that the symptoms were related to gastrointestinal symptoms and bleeding. The primary care physician had started the patient on Bactrim with a history of sinusitis. Monitoring for temperature and leukocytosis is recommended, and antibiotics will be held for now due to hypotension and slight elevation in white blood cell count, which is likely due to the gastrointestinal bleeding rather than infection. However, there will be a low threshold to add antibiotics if signs of infection develop.

The patient's hypertension medications will be held for now due to the bleeding, and they will be added back slowly as tolerated. Simvastatin will also be held temporarily while awaiting repeat scope, and it will be restarted after the scope. Fluoxetine and valium will be started at home after the scope in the morning.

The patient's asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) medications will continue with combivent inhalers as needed, as well as salmeterol.

The patient will be advanced to a regular diet as tolerated today, with electrolytes re"

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of moderate aortic stenosis, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). She presented with symptoms of an upper respiratory infection (URI) for one week as well as upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has been admitted to the ICU.

24-hour events:
- Endoscopy performed at 09:00 AM, revealing three ulcers in the duodenal bulb. It was recommended to order H. pylori testing and continue proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, as well as transfusing to maintain hemoglobin concentration (Hct) above 30.
- The patient's Hct improved from 27 to 29, but there are concerns about possible hemolysis due to the patient having [**Doctor Last Name**]-antibody.
- Invasive ventilation was stopped at 12:00 PM. The patient was started on folic acid, vitamin C, B12, and folate. Her home medications should be restarted post-extubation. The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 250cc of normal saline (NS).
- The patient's heart rate (HR) was initially in atrial fibrillation (AFib) ranging from 120-130 beats per minute. She minimally responded to metoprolol 5mg IV and then received diltiaz"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 78-year-old woman with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who underwent an endoscopy to control the bleed and has had no further melena. She has allergies to penicillins and iodine, and is currently receiving several medications including pantoprazole, diltiazem, midazolam, famotidine, fentanyl, and morphine sulfate.

Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/118 mmHg to 126/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's weight is 62.4 kg, with a fluid balance showing an intake of 3,498 mL (including 546 mL of IV fluids), output of 915 mL (including 510 mL of urine), and a total fluid balance of 2,583 mL with a negative balance of 36 mL.

Laboratory results indicate a hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL, hematocrit of 29.4%, leukocyte count of 158 K/uL, platelet count of 163,000/mmÂ³, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 17 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, glucose of 104 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal ranges.

The patient's extremities do not show any edema, and her neurologic examination is unremarkable.

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of anxiety, ineffective coping, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient will continue to receive blood transfusions to maintain hemoglobin levels above 27, platelet count above 50,000/mmÂ³, and an international normalized ratio (INR) below 2. The patient's atrial fibrillation is well-controlled on intermittent sinus rhythm.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and line management. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and ongoing management of her condition."
