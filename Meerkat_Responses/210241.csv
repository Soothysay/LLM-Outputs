","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, and rheumatoid arthritis. He was admitted to the MICU for a hypoxic event and vomiting, and there were concerns about potential aspiration pneumonia. The patient became bradycardic, thrashed, appeared to stop breathing, and had desaturation to the 80s. He was placed on non-rebreather oxygen therapy and noted to be incontinent of stool.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 113/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he is comfortable, alert, and oriented to place. However, he has decreased breath sounds bibasilar with diffuse moderate crackles throughout, no wheezes, and moderately distended abdomen that is non-tender. Neurological examination reveals no focal deficits.

Laboratory results show white blood cell count of 5.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.3 g/dL, platelet count of 115 K/uL, creatinine of 4.3 mg/dL, glucose of 113 mg/dL, sodium of 20 mEq/L, potassium of 4"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, rheumatoid arthritis, and depression. He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, RLE cellulitis/osteomyelitis, acute renal failure, and other chronic conditions. The patient experienced an episode overnight where he became bradycardic, thrashing, stopped breathing, had desaturation, and incontinence of stool. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 113/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination revealed comfort, oriented to place, EOMI, RRR, decreased breath sounds bibasilar with diffuse moderate crackles throughout, and an obese moderately distended non-tender abdomen. Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, blood glucose, liver enzymes, total bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The patient's chest X-ray showed an improved condition compared to yesterday, but still hazy and diffusely patchy, possibly indicating right lower lobe effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could be due to aspiration pneumonia given his history of tr"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, and obstructive sleep apnea. The patient presented to the ICU with respiratory distress, acute renal failure, and worsening encephalopathy. 

The patient underwent several interventions including paracentesis, blood cultures, placement of a PICC line, arterial line, and dialysis catheter. The patient was also intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to increased work of breathing and confusion after the paracentesis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 100/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory distress likely due to volume overload and aspiration, acute renal failure with oliguria, cirrhosis with encephalopathy, and an infected open fracture with deep infection. 

The assessment and plan include continuing intubation and mechanical ventilation, administering antibiotics, continuing CVVH for fluid removal, and adjusting medication dosages based on renal function.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, and rheumatoid arthritis. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress and volume overload. The patient has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. Other comorbidities include cirrhosis, RLE cellulitis/osteomyelitis with VRE and C. glabrata, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and rheumatoid arthritis. The patient's current medications include midodrine, octreotide, albumin, daptomycin, micafungin, zosyn, famotidine, CVVH, and various other medications for his multiple conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient may continue to experience respiratory distress due to volume overload, aspiration, and potential pneumonia. Close monitoring of vital signs, oxygenation, and chest X-ray is necessary.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, and he has suspected hepatorenal syndrome. Continued CVVH and strict intake/output monitoring are recommended. Medications should be renally dosed, and the patient should be followed up for renal recommendations.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient is not a transplant"

   Assessment and Plan
   62M with cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome on midodrine, octreotide and
   albumin, DM, s/p trimalleolar fracture s/p ex-fix with deep infection
   s/p multiple debridments to salvage the limb.
   # Respiratory Distress: Likely volume overload as well as aspiration
   given history, CXR with bilateral infiltrate as well as volume overload
   from ascites, renal failure and oliguria.  No fever or cough to suggest
   pneumonia.  Not in the context of sleeping so unlikely hypercarbia from
   OSA.  On dapto, micafungin, zosyn added yesterday.  Patient received
   lasix/diuril in attempt to diurese, however unsuccessful.  Pt. was
   intubated, sedated and HD line placed in order to take off volume.
   -continue intubation
   - f/u CXR
   -continue zosyn/dapto/micafungin
   -continue famotidine
   -continue to f/u renal recs
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with large volume of ascites which is
   not helping his respiratory status and now with worsening renal
   function and decreasing urine output. Per hepatology and renal notes,
   he has suspected hepatorenal syndome and has been on albumin,
   octreotide and midodrine. However, there has been worsening on this
   regimen, so unclear if actually a different etiology.  HD lined placed
   on [**2120-4-13**]
   - plan for dialysis now that HD line is placed
   -renally dose medications
   -continue octreotide, midodrine for HRS
 albumin stopped on [**4-13**]
   -f/u renal recs in AM
   -strict I&Os
   - tx as above
   #Cirrhosis: Not transplant candidate per hepatology.  Has had some
   increasing encephalopathy on the floor.  No fever or abdominal pain
   concerning for SBP though always a possibility. Paracentesis performed
   [**4-13**] with 3 L removed and no evidence of SBP.  Albumin and nadolol DC
   on [**4-13**].
   - continue outpatient regimen of lactulose and rifaximin - titrate to
   [**4-12**] BM daily
   - continue midodrine, octreotide
   -f/u liver recs
   # RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: has cx with VRE and C. glabrata.
   Followed by ortho and will likely need another washout in the OR. [**Month (only) 11**]
   need amputation in future.
   - continue daptomycin, micafungin
   - f/u sensitivities for C. glabrata
   - tentative plan for OR on Monday pending clinical status
   - f/u ortho recs
   - f/u ID recs
   # Bradycardia
 originally thought likely d/t hypoxemia.  Intubated on
   [**4-13**] and pt. has had HR in 50s.  Nadolol held starting on [**4-13**].
   - continue to monitor
   # Anemia: HCT stable though trending down slowly. EGD on [**3-29**] showed
   varices and is now s/p banding/glueing.  Hct stable today at 24.5
   - continue PPI
   - hold nadolol 20mg  in setting of bradycardia
   - transfusion goal of 21 or evidence of bleeding or hypoperfusion
   - will need follow up EGD
 will speak with liver regarding this
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable, >100. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - daily PLT
   - transfuse <10 or evidence of bleeding
   # Diabetes mellitus: Continue SSI
   - follow up [**Hospital 294**] Clinic recs  now that patient is intubated
   # Hypertension:
   - hold nadolol d/t intermittent bradycardia
   - Holding metoprolol and amlodipine
   # Obstructive sleep apnea:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and multiple comorbidities. The patient presented to the ICU with acute decompensation, including respiratory distress, acute renal failure, and potential complications from his underlying conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress indicates a high risk of respiratory failure due to volume overload, aspiration, and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient has a history of hepatorenal syndrome, which is a type of kidney failure associated with advanced liver disease. This condition can worsen and lead to further renal dysfunction.
3. Infection: The presence of ascites and the recent paracentesis procedure increase the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Additionally, the patient's immunosuppressed state due to cirrhosis and ongoing infections (e.g., cellulitis/osteomyelitis) make him vulnerable to additional infections.
4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension may indicate hemodynamic instability, which could be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or medication effects.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and esophageal varices, there"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute decompensation following LV paracentesis over the weekend. He required intubation and is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) with fluid removal and using levophed to sustain pressures. The patient has an allergy to no known drugs and has received multiple antibiotic doses since admission. He is on various infusions including norepinephrine, fentanyl, and calcium gluconate (CRRT). His review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent acute decompensation. The patient's vital signs show sinus bradycardia, low blood pressure, and adequate oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure within normal range, bladder pressure at 19 mmHg, and fluid balance with significant intake and output discrepancies. The patient is mechanically ventilated with a CMV mode, set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and plateau pressure of 25 cmH2O. His ABG results show a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 43 mmHg, HCO3- of 119 mEq/L, and base excess of -2. The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed due to his intubation. Lab results show elevated leukocyte"

   62M with cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome on midodrine, octreotide and
   albumin, DM, s/p trimalleolar fracture s/p ex-fix with deep infection
   s/p multiple debridments to salvage the limb.
   # Respiratory Distress: Likely volume overload as well as aspiration
   given history, CXR with bilateral infiltrate as well as volume overload
   from ascites, renal failure and oliguria.  No fever or cough to suggest
   pneumonia.  Not in the context of sleeping so unlikely hypercarbia from
   OSA.  On dapto, micafungin, zosyn added yesterday.  Patient received
   lasix/diuril in attempt to diurese, however unsuccessful.  Pt. was
   intubated, sedated and HD line placed in order to take off volume.
   -continue intubation with continued AC
   - f/u CXR
   -continue zosyn/dapto/micafungin; change zosyn dosing
   -continue famotidine
   -continue CVVH for fluid removal
   -d/c midazolam, increase fentanyl as needed with perhaps low-dose
   propofol.
   -continue to f/u renal recs
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with large volume of ascites which is
   not helping his respiratory status and now with worsening renal
   function and decreasing urine output. Per hepatology and renal notes,
   he has suspected hepatorenal syndome and has been on albumin,
   octreotide and midodrine. However, there has been worsening on this
   regimen, so unclear if actually a different etiology.  HD lined placed
   on [**2120-4-13**]
   - Continue CVVH
   -renally dose medications
   -continue octreotide, midodrine for HRS
 albumin stopped on [**4-13**]
   -f/u renal recs in AM
   -strict I&Os
   - tx as above
   #Cirrhosis: Not transplant candidate per hepatology.  Has had some
   increasing encephalopathy on the floor.  No fever or abdominal pain
   concerning for SBP though always a possibility. Paracentesis performed
   [**4-13**] with 3 L removed and no evidence of SBP.  Albumin and nadolol DC
   on [**4-13**].
   - continue outpatient regimen of lactulose and rifaximin - titrate to
   [**4-12**] BM daily
   - continue midodrine, octreotide
   -f/u liver recs
   - Check abdominal pressures
   # RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: has cx with VRE and C. glabrata.
   Followed by ortho and will likely need another washout in the OR. [**Month (only) 11**]
   need amputation in future.
   - continue daptomycin, micafungin
   - f/u sensitivities for C. glabrata
   - tentative plan for OR on Monday pending clinical status
   - f/u ortho recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - Check CK
   # Bradycardia
 originally thought likely d/t hypoxemia.  Intubated on
   [**4-13**] and pt. has had HR in 50s.  Nadolol held starting on [**4-13**].
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - continue to monitor
   # Anemia: HCT stable though trending down slowly. EGD on [**3-29**] showed
   varices and is now s/p banding/glueing.  Hct stable today at 24.5
   - continue PPI
   - hold nadolol 20mg  in setting of bradycardia
   - transfusion goal of 21 or evidence of bleeding or hypoperfusion
   - will need follow up EGD
 will speak with liver regarding this
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable, >100. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - daily PLT
   - transfuse <10 or evidence of bleeding
   # Diabetes mellitus: Continue SSI
   - follow up [**Hospital 294**] Clinic recs  now that patient is intubated
   # Hypertension:
   - hold nadolol d/t intermittent bradycardia
   - Holding metoprolol and amlodipine
   # Obstructive sleep apnea:
   - pt. intubated
   # Rheumatoid arthritis: not on home medications. Will monitor for
   symptoms. No acute treatment needed currently.
   # Depression: Continue escitalopram and bupropion.

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. He was admitted to the ICU over the weekend due to acute decompensation after LV paracentesis. The patient required intubation and is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) for fluid removal and levophed for blood pressure support. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory distress likely caused by volume overload, aspiration, and possible pneumonia. He also has acute renal failure with worsening renal function and decreasing urine output, suspected hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's cirrhosis is not transplant candidate and he has been experiencing increasing encephalopathy. 

Additionally, the patient has cellulitis and osteomyelitis in the right lower extremity with cultures positive for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and Candida glabrata. The patient will likely need another washout in the operating room. 

Other medical issues include bradycardia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and depression. The patient is currently on multiple medications including midodrine, octreotide, albumin, lasix, diuril, daptomycin, micafungin, piperacillin/tazobactam, famotidine, and fentanyl.

   62M with cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome on midodrine, octreotide and
   albumin, DM, s/p trimalleolar fracture s/p ex-fix with deep infection
   s/p multiple debridments to salvage the limb.
   # Respiratory Distress: Likely volume overload as well as aspiration
   given history, CXR with bilateral infiltrate as well as volume overload
   from ascites, renal failure and oliguria.  No fever or cough to suggest
   pneumonia.  Not in the context of sleeping so unlikely hypercarbia from
   OSA.  On dapto, micafungin, zosyn added yesterday.  Patient received
   lasix/diuril in attempt to diurese, however unsuccessful.  Pt. was
   intubated, sedated and HD line placed in order to take off volume.
   -continue intubation with continued AC
   - f/u CXR
   -continue zosyn/dapto/micafungin; change zosyn dosing
   -continue famotidine
   -continue CVVH for fluid removal
   -d/c midazolam, increase fentanyl as needed with perhaps low-dose
   propofol.
   -continue to f/u renal recs
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with large volume of ascites which is
   not helping his respiratory status and now with worsening renal
   function and decreasing urine output. Per hepatology and renal notes,
   he has suspected hepatorenal syndome and has been on albumin,
   octreotide and midodrine. However, there has been worsening on this
   regimen, so unclear if actually a different etiology.  HD lined placed
   on [**2120-4-13**]
   - Continue CVVH
   -renally dose medications
   -continue octreotide, midodrine for HRS
 albumin stopped on [**4-13**]
   -f/u renal recs in AM
   -strict I&Os
   - tx as above
   #Cirrhosis: Not transplant candidate per hepatology.  Has had some
   increasing encephalopathy on the floor.  No fever or abdominal pain
   concerning for SBP though always a possibility. Paracentesis performed
   [**4-13**] with 3 L removed and no evidence of SBP.  Albumin and nadolol DC
   on [**4-13**].
   - continue outpatient regimen of lactulose and rifaximin - titrate to
   [**4-12**] BM daily
   - continue midodrine, octreotide
   -f/u liver recs
   - Check abdominal pressures
   # RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: has cx with VRE and C. glabrata.
   Followed by ortho and will likely need another washout in the OR. [**Month (only) 11**]
   need amputation in future.
   - continue daptomycin, micafungin
   - f/u sensitivities for C. glabrata
   - tentative plan for OR on Monday pending clinical status
   - f/u ortho recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - Check CK
   # Bradycardia
 originally thought likely d/t hypoxemia.  Intubated on
   [**4-13**] and pt. has had HR in 50s.  Nadolol held starting on [**4-13**].
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - continue to monitor
   # Anemia: HCT stable though trending down slowly. EGD on [**3-29**] showed
   varices and is now s/p banding/glueing.  Hct stable today at 24.5
   - continue PPI
   - hold nadolol 20mg  in setting of bradycardia
   - transfusion goal of 21 or evidence of bleeding or hypoperfusion
   - will need follow up EGD
 will speak with liver regarding this
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable, >100. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - daily PLT
   - transfuse <10 or evidence of bleeding
   # Diabetes mellitus: Continue SSI
   - follow up [**Hospital 294**] Clinic recs  now that patient is intubated
   # Hypertension:
   - hold nadolol d/t intermittent bradycardia
   - Holding metoprolol and amlodipine
   # Obstructive sleep apnea:

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress likely due to volume overload as well as aspiration. The presence of bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray suggests fluid accumulation in the lungs.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function, indicated by decreasing urine output. This could be related to the large volume of ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen) which may not be effectively removing waste products from the kidneys.

3. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient is suspected to have HRS, a condition where liver dysfunction leads to kidney failure. This is supported by the presence of cirrhosis and the use of medications such as albumin, octreotide, and midodrine.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, which is a chronic liver disease characterized by scarring of the liver tissue. This condition can lead to complications such as encephalopathy (mental confusion) and portal hypertension (increased pressure in the portal vein).

5. RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: The patient has an infection in the right lower extremity (RLE) that has spread to the bones. This is indicated by the presence of VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) and C. glabrata (a type of yeast) in the"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. He was admitted to the ICU over the weekend due to respiratory distress and acute decompensation. The patient underwent a left ventricular paracentesis on [**4-13**] and required intubation. He is currently on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) with fluid removal and is also on levophed for hemodynamic support.

The patient has a history of trimalleolar fracture with external fixation and deep infection requiring multiple debridements. He also has a history of chronic liver disease with suspected hepatorenal syndrome, for which he has been on midodrine, octreotide, and albumin. However, his renal function has been worsening despite this treatment regimen.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated liver enzymes. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse and rhonchorous bilateral lung sounds with equal air entry, regular rapid heart rate, slightly bradycardic, distended abdomen with ascites, soft abdomen, warm and dry skin, and intubated and sedated neurologic status.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   62M with cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome on midodrine, octreotide and
   albumin, DM, s/p trimalleolar fracture s/p ex-fix with deep infection
   s/p multiple debridments to salvage the limb.
   # Respiratory Distress: Likely volume overload as well as aspiration
   given history, CXR with bilateral infiltrate as well as volume overload
   from ascites, renal failure and oliguria.  No fever or cough to suggest
   pneumonia.  Not in the context of sleeping so unlikely hypercarbia from
   OSA.  On dapto, micafungin, zosyn added yesterday.  Patient received
   lasix/diuril in attempt to diurese, however unsuccessful.  Pt. was
   intubated, sedated and HD line placed in order to take off volume.
   -continue intubation with continued AC
   - f/u CXR
   -continue zosyn/dapto/micafungin renally dosed; MRSA in lungs; if
   positive cultures will consider linezolid but hold off for now.
   -need adequate respiratory sample; if sputum/suction does not work,
   will consider BAL.
   -continue famotidine
   -continue CVVH for fluid removal at 250-300/hr
   -d/c midazolam, increase fentanyl as needed with perhaps low-dose
   propofol.
   -continue to f/u renal recs
   - CVP <4 or rise in pressor requirement >0.1 indicates approaching
   euvolemia.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with large volume of ascites which is
   not helping his respiratory status and now with worsening renal
   function and decreasing urine output. Per hepatology and renal notes,
   he has suspected hepatorenal syndome and has been on albumin,
   octreotide and midodrine. However, there has been worsening on this
   regimen, so unclear if actually a different etiology.  HD lined placed
   on [**2120-4-13**]
   - Continue CVVH
   -renally dose medications
   -continue octreotide, midodrine for HRS
 albumin stopped on [**4-13**]
   -f/u renal recs in AM
   -strict I&Os
   - tx as above
   #Cirrhosis: Not transplant candidate per hepatology.  Has had some
   increasing encephalopathy on the floor.  No fever or abdominal pain
   concerning for SBP though always a possibility. Paracentesis performed
   [**4-13**] with 3 L removed and no evidence of SBP.  Albumin and nadolol DC
   on [**4-13**].
   - If IAB >3.5, consider parascentesis
   - continue outpatient regimen of lactulose and rifaximin - titrate to
   [**4-12**] BM daily
   - continue midodrine, octreotide
   -f/u liver recs
   - Check abdominal pressures
   # RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: has cx with VRE and C. glabrata.
   Followed by ortho and will likely need another washout in the OR. [**Month (only) 11**]
   need amputation in future.
   - continue daptomycin, micafungin
    - IV vitamin K, blood bank samples, 2U on call in preparation for OR
   - f/u sensitivities for C. glabrata
   - tentative plan for OR on Monday pending clinical status 3pm
   - f/u ortho recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - Check CK
   # Bradycardia
 originally thought likely d/t hypoxemia.  Intubated on
   [**4-13**] and pt. has had HR in 50s.  Nadolol held starting on [**4-13**].
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - continue to monitor
   # Anemia: HCT stable though trending down slowly. EGD on [**3-29**] showed
   varices and is now s/p banding/glueing.  Hct stable today at 24.5
   - continue PPI
   - hold nadolol 20mg  in setting of bradycardia
   - transfusion goal of 21 or evidence of bleeding or hypoperfusion
   - will need follow up EGD
 will speak with liver regarding this
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable, >100. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - daily PLT
   - transfuse <10 or evidence of bleeding
   # Diabetes mellitus: Continue SSI
   - Got
 dose lantus; transition to sliding scale for OR. If patient is
   becoming refractory to SC insulin, will consider insulin drip
   - follow up [**Hospital 294**] Clinic recs  now that patient is intubated
   # Hypertension:
   - hold nadolol d/t intermittent bradycardia
   - Holding metoprolol and amlodipine
   # Obstructive sleep apnea:

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. He presented with respiratory distress and was intubated due to suspected volume overload and aspiration. He also has acute renal failure, suspected hepatorenal syndrome, and is on midodrine, octreotide, and albumin therapy. The patient has a trimalleolar fracture with deep infection requiring multiple debridements and external fixation. He has an upcoming OR washout procedure every 3 days. The patient's blood cultures are positive for MRSA in the lungs, and he is receiving appropriate antibiotics. There are concerns about potential medical complications such as pneumonia, SBP, and hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has respiratory distress with bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, which could indicate pneumonia. However, there is no fever or cough, suggesting a possible aspiration pneumonia rather than community-acquired pneumonia.
2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has ascites and required paracentesis, but no evidence of SBP was found. SBP should still be considered as a possibility.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient has worsening renal function and suspected HRS. He is on midodrine, octreotide, and albumin therapy, but his condition is not improving. Continued monitoring and management"

   Over the Weekend
   LV Paracentesis [**4-13**] after which acute decompensated and needed
   intubation. Now on CVVH removing fluid and levophed. A-line and
   dialysis catheter placed.
   24 Hour Events:
   Ortho: would like to take him to OR (pg [**Numeric Identifier 11396**]), taking him to the OR
   for washout roughly every 3 days. Still on CVVH trying to get fluid
   off, still requiring levophed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. He has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, acute renal failure, and other complications related to his underlying conditions.
- The patient underwent a paracentesis on [**4-13**] and had 3 liters of ascites fluid removed. No evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) was found.
- He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. The respiratory distress is likely caused by volume overload as well as aspiration, given the patient's history, chest X-ray showing bilateral infiltrates, and oliguria.
- The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, which is suspected to be hepatorenal syndrome. He has been on albumin, octreotide, and midodrine but is showing worsening renal function.
- The patient has a history of trimalleolar fracture with deep infection and has undergone multiple debridements to salvage the limb.
- Other complications include cirrhosis, RLE cellulitis/osteomyelitis with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and Candida glabrata infection, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and rheumatoid arthritis.
- The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifung"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. He presented with respiratory distress and was found to have volume overload as well as aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CVVH for fluid removal. He has a history of trimalleolar fracture with deep infection and multiple debridements to salvage the limb. The patient's renal function is worsening, and he has been diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome. He also has thrombocytopenia likely secondary to cirrhosis and is being monitored for bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to volume overload, aspiration pneumonia, and worsening renal function leading to fluid retention. Continuous monitoring and management of respiratory parameters will be necessary.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function, which may be due to hepatorenal syndrome or another underlying cause. Close monitoring of renal parameters and continuation of CVVH for fluid removal are recommended.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has advanced cirrhosis and is not a candidate for liver transplantation. Management of complications such as encephalopathy, ascites, and coagulopathy will be required.
4. Infection: The patient has infections including pneumonia, cellulitis, and osteomyelitis caused by multidrug-resistant organisms like MR"

   s/p multiple debridments to salvage the limb.
   # Respiratory Distress: Likely volume overload as well as aspiration
   given history, CXR with bilateral infiltrate as well as volume overload
   from ascites, renal failure and oliguria.  No fever or cough to suggest
   pneumonia.  Not in the context of sleeping so unlikely hypercarbia from
   OSA.  On dapto, micafungin, zosyn added yesterday.  Patient received
   lasix/diuril in attempt to diurese, however unsuccessful.  Pt. was
   intubated, sedated and HD line placed in order to take off volume.
   -continue intubation with continued AC
   - f/u CXR
   -continue zosyn/dapto/micafungin renally dosed; MRSA in lungs; if
   positive cultures will consider linezolid but hold off for now.
   -need adequate respiratory sample; if sputum/suction does not work,
   will consider BAL.
   -continue famotidine
   -continue CVVH for fluid removal at 250-300/hr
   -d/c midazolam, increase fentanyl as needed with perhaps low-dose
   propofol.
   -continue to f/u renal recs
   - CVP <4 or rise in pressor requirement >0.1 indicates approaching

   # Acute renal failure: Patient with large volume of ascites which is
   not helping his respiratory status and now with worsening renal
   function and decreasing urine output. Per hepatology and renal notes,
   he has suspected hepatorenal syndome and has been on albumin,
   octreotide and midodrine. However, there has been worsening on this
   regimen, so unclear if actually a different etiology.  HD lined placed
   on [**2120-4-13**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus, trimalleolar fracture with external fixation, and deep infection in the right lower extremity. He presented to the ICU with respiratory distress and acute renal failure. The patient has been treated for suspected MRSA pneumonia, cellulitis/osteomyelitis in the right lower extremity, and encephalopathy. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His condition remains unstable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a history of bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, volume overload from ascites, renal failure, and oliguria. He was intubated due to unsuccessful diuresis and fluid removal.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function, decreasing urine output, and a large volume of ascites. He has been on albumin, octreotide, and midodrine for hepatorenal syndrome, but without improvement.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient is not a transplant candidate and has increasing encephalopathy. He had a paracentesis performed with removal of 3 liters of ascitic fluid, but no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
4. RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: The patient has cultures positive for VRE and C. glabrata. He will likely need another surgical intervention"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and multiple comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress, suspected volume overload, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient underwent several interventions, including intubation, placement of a high-flow oxygen cannula, continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH), and administration of antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggesting volume overload and aspiration pneumonia. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or noninvasive ventilation may be necessary to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation, heart rate, and respiratory effort is essential.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by oliguria and elevated creatinine levels. CVVH may be continued to remove fluid and correct electrolyte imbalances. Renal dosing of medications should be considered to prevent further renal impairment. Frequent monitoring of urine output and renal function tests is necessary.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has decompensated cirrhosis with encephalopathy and portal hypertension. Monitoring for signs of hepatic encephalopathy (e.g., altered mental status, asterixis) and considering lactulose therapy for its effects on ammonia reduction is important. Par"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, and multiple comorbidities. He presented with respiratory distress, acute renal failure, and signs of volume overload. The patient underwent intubation and continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) for fluid removal. He also received antibiotics, antifungal medication, and diuretics. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including cirrhosis, acute renal failure, respiratory distress, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, and familial endometrial neoplasia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to likely volume overload as well as aspiration given his history, chest X-ray showing bilateral infiltrate, and oliguria. It is important to continue intubation with appropriate sedation and monitor for any changes in oxygenation or ventilation.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, and he has suspected hepatorenal syndrome. CVVH should be continued, and medications should be adjusted based on renal function. Strict input/output monitoring and close follow-up with renal team are essential.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has chronic liver disease with encephalopathy and no"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, and multiple comorbidities. The patient underwent a right leg washout yesterday and has been experiencing high pressures. The patient's condition worsened, leading to reintubation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, CVVH, and various medications including antibiotics and antifungals. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.0°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 108/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a history of bilateral infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating possible volume overload, as well as potential aspiration pneumonia. The patient was intubated due to unsuccessful diuresis and fluid overload.
2. RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: The patient has a history of VRE and C. glabrata infection in the right leg, which may require another surgical intervention.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has suspected hepatorenal syndrome and worsening renal function, with decreasing urine output. CVVH is being used for fluid removal.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has increasing encephalopathy and is not a transplant candidate. Par"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, and rheumatoid arthritis. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress, which is likely caused by volume overload and aspiration given his history, chest X-ray findings, and unsuccessful diuresis. The patient was intubated, sedated, and placed on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) to manage fluid overload.

The patient also has cellulitis and osteomyelitis in his right lower extremity, which has been treated with daptomycin and micafungin. He has suspected hepatorenal syndrome and is being treated with albumin, octreotide, and midodrine. His renal function is worsening, and he has oliguria. The patient's liver disease is not amenable to transplantation, and he has had episodes of encephalopathy.

Additionally, the patient has anemia and is being monitored closely. He is also thrombocytopenic but stable, and his diabetes mellitus is being managed with SSI. The patient's hypertension is currently being held due to intermittent bradycardia. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, so obstructive sleep apnea is not a concern at the moment.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, development of"

   # Acute renal failure: Patient with large volume of ascites which is
   not helping his respiratory status and now with worsening renal
   function and decreasing urine output. Per hepatology and renal notes,
   he has suspected hepatorenal syndome and has been on albumin,
   octreotide and midodrine. However, there has been worsening on this
   regimen, so unclear if actually a different etiology.  HD lined placed
   on [**2120-4-13**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, likely due to volume overload as well as aspiration given the history of cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and deep infection. The presence of bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray suggests pneumonia or fluid accumulation in the lungs.

2. RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: The patient has an infection caused by VRE (Vancomycin-resistant enterococci) and C. glabrata (a type of yeast) in the affected limb. This requires ongoing treatment with appropriate antibiotics and may require surgical intervention in the future.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing worsening renal function and decreasing urine output. This is suspected to be due to hepatorenal syndrome, but other etiologies need to be considered as well. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) has been initiated for fluid removal.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient has advanced liver disease, which is not a candidate for transplantation. There is an increasing encephalopathy, and paracentesis has been performed to remove ascites.

5. Gut Motility: The patient has poor gut motility, as indicated by small residuals despite starting total parenteral nutrition (TF). Continuing medication to stimulate bowel movement is recommended.

6. Bradycardia: The patient has brad"

   62M with cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome on midodrine and albumin, DM,
   s/p trimalleolar fracture s/p ex-fix with deep infection s/p multiple
   debridments to salvage the limb.
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt. remains intubated.  Original respiratory
   distress likely volume overload as well as aspiration given history,
   CXR with bilateral infiltrate as well as volume overload from ascites,
   renal failure and oliguria.  No fever or cough to suggest pneumonia.
   Not in the context of sleeping so unlikely hypercarbia from OSA.  On
   dapto, micafungin, zosyn.  Patient received lasix/diuril in attempt to
   diurese, however unsuccessful.  Has had about 16 L taken off with CVVH.
   -continue zosyn/dapto/micafungin renally dosed; MRSA in lungs; if
   positive cultures will consider linezolid but hold off for now.
   -need adequate respiratory sample; if sputum/suction does not work,
   will consider BAL.
   -continue famotidine
   -continue CVVH for fluid removal at 250-300/hr
   -wean fentanyl and propofol today with goal of waking him up
   -CVP <4 or rise in pressor requirement >0.1 indicates approaching
   euvolemia
 he is approaching this today and will discuss with renal
   -consider trial of pressure support today
 will underventilate while
   on AC to gauge response of resp. drive
   -continue to follow sputum cultures
   # RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: has cx with VRE and C. glabrata.
   Followed by ortho and will likely need s/p washout in the OR on [**4-15**].
   [**Month (only) 11**] need amputation in future.
   - continue daptomycin, micafungin
   - f/u sensitivities for C. glabrata
   - monitor wound cultures, blood cultures
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - f/u ortho recs
 wound vac changed per ortho
   - f/u ID recs
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with large volume of ascites which is
   not helping his respiratory status and now with worsening renal
   function and decreasing urine output. Per hepatology and renal notes,
   he has suspected hepatorenal syndome and has been on albumin,
   octreotide and midodrine. However, there has been worsening on this
   regimen, so unclear if actually a different etiology.  HD lined placed
   on [**2120-4-13**]
   -continue CVVH
 consider backing off today
   -renally dose medications
   -continue octreotide, midodrine for HRS
 albumin stopped on [**4-13**]
   -f/u renal recs in AM
   -strict I&Os
   - tx as above
   #Cirrhosis: Not transplant candidate per hepatology.  Has had some
   increasing encephalopathy on the floor.  No fever or abdominal pain
   concerning for SBP though always a possibility. Paracentesis performed
   [**4-13**] with 3 L removed and no evidence of SBP.  Albumin and nadolol DC
   on [**4-13**].
   - If IAB >3.5, consider parascentesis
   - continue outpatient regimen of lactulose and rifaximin - titrate to
   [**4-12**] BM daily
   - continue midodrine, octreotide
   - f/u liver recs
   - Check abdominal pressures
   # Gut Motility: multiple potential etiologies. Pt noted to have small
   residuals
   - Continuing Reglan
   - Give PO meds
   - Give methylnaltrexone if increased residuals
   # Bradycardia
 originally thought likely d/t hypoxemia.  Intubated on
   [**4-13**] and pt. has had HR in 50s.  Nadolol held starting on [**4-13**].
   - octreotide was DC
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - continue to monitor
   # Anemia: HCT stable though trending down slowly. EGD on [**3-29**] showed
   varices and is now s/p banding/glueing.  Hct stable today.
   - check QD HCTs
   - continue PPI
   - hold nadolol 20mg  in setting of bradycardia
   - transfusion goal of 21 or evidence of bleeding or hypoperfusion
   - will need follow up EGD
 will speak with liver regarding this
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable, >100. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - daily PLT

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus, s/p trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, and currently intubated for respiratory distress. He has multiple medical complications including respiratory distress, RLE cellulitis/osteomyelitis, acute renal failure, cirrhosis, gut motility issues, bradycardia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, and is on multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient remains intubated due to respiratory distress, which is likely volume overload as well as aspiration given his history, chest X-ray showing bilateral infiltrates, and renal failure with oliguria. There is no fever or cough to suggest pneumonia. The patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics and CVVH for fluid removal.

2. RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: The patient has cultures positive for VRE and C. glabrata. He will likely need a surgical washout in the OR on [**4-15**] and may require amputation in the future. He is currently on appropriate antibiotics, and wound care is being monitored.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function and decreasing urine output. He has suspected hepatorenal syndrome and is on albumin, octreotide, and midodrine."

   Assessment and Plan
   62M NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture s/p ex-fix with deep infection
   s/p multiple debridements, OSA, progressive ARF [**3-12**] hepatorenal
   syndrome on midodrine and albumin and volume overload originally
   brought to ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting
   of volume overload and aspiration. Wound improving per ortho.
   Continuing on CVVH.
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt. remains intubated. Yesterday held sedation,
   decreased Ve and tried PSV. Original respiratory distress likely volume
   overload as well as aspiration given history, CXR with bilateral
   infiltrate as well as volume overload from ascites, renal failure and
   oliguria.  No fever or cough to suggest pneumonia.  Not in the context
   of sleeping so unlikely hypercarbia from OSA.  On dapto, micafungin,
   zosyn.  Patient received lasix/diuril in attempt to diurese, however
   unsuccessful.  Has had about 16 L taken off with CVVH. RISB 24.
   -SBT this morning
   - Will start lactulose 60 mg q4h for encephelopathy
   -continue zosyn/dapto/micafungin renally dosed; MRSA in lungs; if
   positive cultures will consider linezolid but hold off for now.
   -need adequate respiratory sample; if sputum/suction does not work,
   will consider BAL.
   -continue famotidine
   -holding CVVH for now, consider HD in future
   -wean fentanyl and propofol today with goal of waking him up
   -CVP <4 or rise in pressor requirement >0.1 indicates approaching
   euvolemia
 he is approaching this today and will discuss with renal
   drive
   -continue to follow sputum cultures
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with large volume of ascites which is
   not helping his respiratory status and now with worsening renal
   function and decreasing urine output. Per hepatology and renal notes,
   he has suspected hepatorenal syndome and has been on albumin,
   octreotide and midodrine. However, there has been worsening on this
   regimen, so unclear if actually a different etiology.  HD lined placed
   on [**2120-4-13**]
   -holding CVVH
 considering transition to HD in future if tolerates
   -renally dose medications
   -continue midodrine for HRS
 albumin stopped on [**4-13**]
   -f/u renal recs in AM
   -strict I&Os
   - tx as above
   #Cirrhosis: Not transplant candidate per hepatology.  Has had some
   increasing encephalopathy on the floor.  No fever or abdominal pain
   concerning for SBP though always a possibility. Paracentesis performed
   [**4-13**] with 3 L removed and no evidence of SBP.  Albumin and nadolol DC
   on [**4-13**].
   - If IAB >3.5, consider parascentesis
   - increase lactulose as above, 60 mg q4h
   - continue rifaximin
   - continue midodrine
   - f/u liver recs
   - Track intraabdominal pressures, tap if > 25
   # Leukocytosis: WBC now 13.5 not on steroids, temps 96, hypotensive but
   bradycardic. Cannot rule out sepsis.
   - continue daptomycin, micafungin, pip-tazo
   - Will call lab for speciation of gram negative rod from sputum sample
   # RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: has cx with VRE and C. glabrata.
   Followed by ortho and will likely need s/p washout in the OR on [**4-15**].
   [**Month (only) 11**] need amputation in future.
   - Plan for bedside wound vac change tomorrow per ortho
   - continue daptomycin, micafungin, pip-tazo
   - f/u sensitivities for C. glabrata
   - monitor wound cultures, blood cultures
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - f/u ortho recs
 wound vac changed per ortho
   - f/u ID recs
   # Gut Motility/Concern for Ileus: Moved bowels overnight. On reglan.
   - Continue Reglan
   - Give PO meds
   - Give lactulose as above
   # Bradycardia
 originally thought likely d/t hypoxemia.  Intubated on
   [**4-13**] and pt. has had HR in 50s.  Nadolol held starting on [**4-13**].
   - octreotide was DC
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - continue to monitor
   # Anemia: HCT stable though trending down slowly. EGD on [**3-29**] showed
   varices and is now s/p banding/glueing.  Hct stable today.
   - check QD HCTs
   - continue PPI
   - hold nadolol 20mg  in setting of bradycardia
   - transfusion goal of 21 or evidence of bleeding or hypoperfusion
   - will need follow up EGD
 will speak with liver regarding this
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable, >100. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - daily PLT
   - transfuse <10 or evidence of bleeding
   # Diabetes mellitus: Continue SSI
   - follow up [**Hospital 294**] Clinic recs  now that patient is intubated
   - increase ISS
   - will continue dose of lantus (8 units) today; increase tomorrow as
   needed
   # Hypertension:
   - hold nadolol d/t intermittent bradycardia
   - Holding metoprolol and amlodipine
   # Obstructive sleep apnea: - pt. intubated
   # Rheumatoid arthritis: not on home medications. Will monitor for
   symptoms. No acute treatment needed currently.
   # Depression: Continue escitalopram and bupropion.
   # FEN: intubated, extubation trial today if more alert, OG tube in
   place
   - NPO now except for meds
   - NGT to suction
   # PPX: famotidine, SC heparin, bowel regimen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture, OSA, and progressive ARF with hepatorenal syndrome. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory distress and bradycardia.

The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. Sedation was weaned off, but some propofol was left on. Pressor support is still required. The patient moved his bowels overnight and is still encephalopathic, indicating ongoing hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose has been ordered for treatment.

The patient has an RISB (rapidly increasing serum bilirubin) of 24, indicating possible liver dysfunction. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning.

The patient's renal function is worsening, with decreasing urine output and increasing creatinine levels. Hepatorenal syndrome is suspected, and the patient is on midodrine and albumin. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been performed, removing about 16 liters of fluid.

The patient has a history of cirrhosis and is not a transplant candidate. Increasing encephalopathy is noted, but no fever or abdominal pain is present. Paracentesis was performed on [**4-13**], removing 3 liters of ascites fluid without evidence of spontaneous bacterial periton"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture, OSA, progressive ARF, and suspected hepatorenal syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia, likely due to volume overload and aspiration. The patient has a large volume of ascites, which is not helping his respiratory status and is now worsening his renal function. He has been on albumin, octreotide, and midodrine but with worsening on this regimen. CVVH has been initiated for fluid removal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient remains intubated, and there is a concern for ongoing respiratory compromise.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate remains in the 50s, indicating persistent bradycardia.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and there is suspicion of hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be secondary to cirrhosis.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high, and antihypertensive medications have been held due to intermittent bradycardia.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient is at"

   Assessment and Plan
   62M NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture s/p ex-fix with deep infection
   s/p multiple debridements, OSA, progressive ARF [**3-12**] hepatorenal
   syndrome on midodrine and albumin and volume overload originally
   brought to ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting
   of volume overload and aspiration.
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt. remains intubated but doing well on SBT
   without significant change in pCO2. Seems more arousable now off
   sedation and with high dose lactulose. Patient has significant history
   of sleep apnea as well. Original respiratory distress likely volume
   overload as well as aspiration given history, CXR with bilateral
   infiltrate as well as volume overload from ascites, renal failure and
   oliguria.  On dapto, micafungin, zosyn.  Patient received lasix/diuril
   in attempt to diurese, however unsuccessful.  CVVH held on [**4-18**] due to
   the fact that his dialysis catheter became clotted.  On [**4-18**] he had an
   episode of vomiting, repeat CXR not markedly different, but concern for
   possibly evolving L opacity.  Right was improved.
   - continue ventilator today, consider extubation soon
   - continue  lactulose 60 mg q4h for encephelopathy
   - continue zosyn/dapto/micafungin renally dosed; h/o MRSA in lungs
   - continue famotidine
   - CVP <4 or rise in pressor requirement >0.1 indicates approaching
   euvolemia
 he is approaching this today and will discuss with renal
   drive
   # Acute renal failure now without Dialysis Access: Patient with large
   volume of ascites which is not helping his respiratory status and now
   with worsening renal function and decreasing urine output. Per
   hepatology and renal notes, he has suspected hepatorenal syndome and
   has been on albumin, octreotide and midodrine. However, there has been
   worsening on this regimen, so unclear if actually a different etiology.
   Acidemia mixed respiratory and metabolic, CNS appears comfortable at
   pCO2 at 50.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, OSA, and progressive ARF, who was brought to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, cirrhosis, mental status changes, leukocytosis, RLE cellulitis/osteomyelitis, gut motility concerns, bradycardia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, rheumatoid arthritis, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient has worsening renal function and decreasing urine output. There is a concern for hepatorenal syndrome, but further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and is not a transplant candidate. He also has increasing encephalopathy on the floor, which needs to be managed with lactulose and rifaximin.
3. Mental status changes: The patient continues to be agitated at times and may require restraints. Sedating medications should be held.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could indicate an infection. He is already on appropriate antibiotics, but further investigation for sepsis is warranted.
5. RLE cellulitis/osteomy"

   Assessment and Plan
   62M NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture s/p ex-fix with deep infection
   s/p multiple debridements, OSA, progressive ARF [**3-12**] hepatorenal
   syndrome on midodrine and albumin and volume overload originally
   brought to ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting
   of volume overload and aspiration. Wound improving per ortho.
   Continuing on CVVH.
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt. remains intubated. Yesterday held sedation,
   decreased Ve and tried PSV. Original respiratory distress likely volume
   overload as well as aspiration given history, CXR with bilateral
   infiltrate as well as volume overload from ascites, renal failure and
   oliguria.  On dapto, micafungin, zosyn.  Patient received lasix/diuril
   in attempt to diurese, however unsuccessful.  CVVH held on [**4-18**] due to
   the fact that his dialysis catheter became clotted.  On [**4-18**] he had an
   episode of vomiting, repeat CXR not markedly different, but concern for
   possibly evolving L opacity.  Right was improved.
   - Continue  lactulose 60 mg q4h for encephelopathy
   -continue zosyn/dapto/micafungin renally dosed; MRSA in lungs; if
   positive cultures will consider linezolid but hold off for now.
   -need adequate respiratory sample; if sputum/suction does not work,
   will consider BAL.
   -continue famotidine
   -holding CVVH for now, consider HD in future
   -wean fentanyl and propofol today with goal of waking him up
   -CVP <4 or rise in pressor requirement >0.1 indicates approaching
   euvolemia
 he is approaching this today and will discuss with renal
   drive
   -continue to follow sputum cultures
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with large volume of ascites which is
   not helping his respiratory status and now with worsening renal
   function and decreasing urine output. Per hepatology and renal notes,
   he has suspected hepatorenal syndome and has been on albumin,
   octreotide and midodrine. However, there has been worsening on this
   regimen, so unclear if actually a different etiology.  HD lined placed
   on [**2120-4-13**]
   -holding CVVH
 considering transition to HD in future if tolerates
   -renally dose medications
   -continue midodrine for HRS
 albumin stopped on [**4-13**]
   -f/u renal recs in AM
   -strict I&Os
   - tx as above
   #Cirrhosis: Not transplant candidate per hepatology.  Has had some
   increasing encephalopathy on the floor.  No fever or abdominal pain
   concerning for SBP though always a possibility. Paracentesis performed
   [**4-13**] with 3 L removed and no evidence of SBP.  Albumin and nadolol DC
   on [**4-13**].
   - If IAB >3.5, consider parascentesis
   - increase lactulose as above, 60 mg q4h
   - continue rifaximin
   - continue midodrine
   - f/u liver recs
   - Track intraabdominal pressures, tap if > 25
   # Leukocytosis: WBC now 13.5 not on steroids, temps 96, hypotensive but
   bradycardic. Cannot rule out sepsis.
   - continue daptomycin, micafungin, pip-tazo
   - Will call lab for speciation of gram negative rod from sputum sample
   # RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: has cx with VRE and C. glabrata.
   Followed by ortho and will likely need s/p washout in the OR on [**4-15**].
   [**Month (only) 11**] need amputation in future.
   - Plan for bedside wound vac change tomorrow per ortho
   - continue daptomycin, micafungin, pip-tazo
   - f/u sensitivities for C. glabrata
   - monitor wound cultures, blood cultures
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - f/u ortho recs
 wound vac changed per ortho
   - f/u ID recs
   # Gut Motility/Concern for Ileus: Moved bowels overnight. On reglan.
   - Continue Reglan
   - Give PO meds
   - Give lactulose as above
   # Bradycardia
 originally thought likely d/t hypoxemia.  Intubated on
   [**4-13**] and pt. has had HR in 50s.  Nadolol held starting on [**4-13**].
   - octreotide was DC
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - continue to monitor
   # Anemia: HCT stable though trending down slowly. EGD on [**3-29**] showed
   varices and is now s/p banding/glueing.  Hct stable today.
   - check QD HCTs
   - continue PPI
   - hold nadolol 20mg  in setting of bradycardia
   - transfusion goal of 21 or evidence of bleeding or hypoperfusion
   - will need follow up EGD
 will speak with liver regarding this
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable, >100. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - daily PLT
   - transfuse <10 or evidence of bleeding
   # Diabetes mellitus: Continue SSI
   - follow up [**Hospital 294**] Clinic recs  now that patient is intubated
   - increase ISS
   - will continue dose of lantus (8 units) today; increase tomorrow as
   needed
   # Hypertension:
   - hold nadolol d/t intermittent bradycardia
   - Holding metoprolol and amlodipine
   # Obstructive sleep apnea: - pt. intubated
   # Rheumatoid arthritis: not on home medications. Will monitor for
   symptoms. No acute treatment needed currently.
   # Depression: Continue escitalopram and bupropion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, OSA, progressive ARF, and hepatorenal syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia. He has a tracheostomy and is intubated. His current medications include lactulose, piperacillin/tazobactam, micafungin, daptomycin, famotidine, and midodrine. He has multiple comorbidities including cirrhosis, leukocytosis, RLE cellulitis/osteomyelitis, gut motility concerns, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, rheumatoid arthritis, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient remains intubated due to ongoing respiratory distress. There is concern for evolving lung opacity and the possibility of pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures are necessary.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function and decreasing urine output. There is suspicion of hepatorenal syndrome. Hemodialysis (HD) is being considered as CVVH is held due to catheter clotting. Monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial.

   Assessment and Plan
","Summary:
The patient is a 72-inch tall male with respiratory distress, currently intubated and on high-dose lactulose. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/68 mmHg to 141/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a sinus rhythm and a central venous pressure of 3 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,726 mL and output of 2,813 mL, with a negative balance of 518 mL. The patient is receiving medications including norepinephrine, famotidine, and various antibiotics. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening oxygenation, is essential.

2. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobilization and decreased mobility due to being intubated increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and skin assessments should be performed to prevent and identify any pressure-related injuries.

   62M NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture s/p ex-fix with deep infection
   s/p multiple debridements, OSA, progressive ARF [**3-12**] hepatorenal
   syndrome on midodrine and albumin and volume overload originally
   brought to ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting
   of volume overload and aspiration. Wound improving per ortho.
   Continuing on CVVH.
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt. remains intubated. Yesterday held sedation,
   decreased Ve and tried PSV. Original respiratory distress likely volume
   overload as well as aspiration given history, CXR with bilateral
   infiltrate as well as volume overload from ascites, renal failure and
   oliguria.  No fever or cough to suggest pneumonia.  Not in the context
   of sleeping so unlikely hypercarbia from OSA.  On dapto, micafungin,
   zosyn.  Patient received lasix/diuril in attempt to diurese, however
   unsuccessful.  Has had about 16 L taken off with CVVH. RISB 24.
   -SBT this morning
   - Will start lactulose 60 mg q4h for encephelopathy
   -continue zosyn/dapto/micafungin renally dosed; MRSA in lungs; if
   positive cultures will consider linezolid but hold off for now.

   drive
   -continue to follow sputum cultures
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with large volume of ascites which is
   not helping his respiratory status and now with worsening renal
   function and decreasing urine output. Per hepatology and renal notes,
   he has suspected hepatorenal syndome and has been on albumin,
   octreotide and midodrine. However, there has been worsening on this
   regimen, so unclear if actually a different etiology.  HD lined placed
   on [**2120-4-13**]
   -holding CVVH
 considering transition to HD in future if tolerates
   -renally dose medications
   -continue midodrine for HRS
 albumin stopped on [**4-13**]
   -f/u renal recs in AM
   -strict I&Os
   - tx as above
   #Cirrhosis: Not transplant candidate per hepatology.  Has had some
   increasing encephalopathy on the floor.  No fever or abdominal pain
   concerning for SBP though always a possibility. Paracentesis performed
   [**4-13**] with 3 L removed and no evidence of SBP.  Albumin and nadolol DC
   on [**4-13**].
   - If IAB >3.5, consider parascentesis
   - increase lactulose as above, 60 mg q4h
   - continue rifaximin
   - continue midodrine
   - f/u liver recs
   - Track intraabdominal pressures, tap if > 25
   # Leukocytosis: WBC now 13.5 not on steroids, temps 96, hypotensive but
   bradycardic. Cannot rule out sepsis.
   - continue daptomycin, micafungin, pip-tazo
   - Will call lab for speciation of gram negative rod from sputum sample
   # RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: has cx with VRE and C. glabrata.
   Followed by ortho and will likely need s/p washout in the OR on [**4-15**].
   [**Month (only) 11**] need amputation in future.
   - Plan for bedside wound vac change tomorrow per ortho
   - continue daptomycin, micafungin, pip-tazo
   - f/u sensitivities for C. glabrata
   - monitor wound cultures, blood cultures
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - f/u ortho recs
 wound vac changed per ortho
   - f/u ID recs
   # Gut Motility/Concern for Ileus: Moved bowels overnight. On reglan.
   - Continue Reglan
   - Give PO meds
   - Give lactulose as above
   # Bradycardia
 originally thought likely d/t hypoxemia.  Intubated on
   [**4-13**] and pt. has had HR in 50s.  Nadolol held starting on [**4-13**].
   - octreotide was DC
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - continue to monitor
   # Anemia: HCT stable though trending down slowly. EGD on [**3-29**] showed
   varices and is now s/p banding/glueing.  Hct stable today.
   - check QD HCTs
   - continue PPI
   - hold nadolol 20mg  in setting of bradycardia
   - transfusion goal of 21 or evidence of bleeding or hypoperfusion
   - will need follow up EGD
 will speak with liver regarding this
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable, >100. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - daily PLT
   - transfuse <10 or evidence of bleeding
   # Diabetes mellitus: Continue SSI
   - follow up [**Hospital 294**] Clinic recs  now that patient is intubated
   - increase ISS
   - will continue dose of lantus (8 units) today; increase tomorrow as
   needed
   # Hypertension:
   - hold nadolol d/t intermittent bradycardia
   - Holding metoprolol and amlodipine
   # Obstructive sleep apnea: - pt. intubated
   # Rheumatoid arthritis: not on home medications. Will monitor for
   symptoms. No acute treatment needed currently.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture, OSA, and cirrhosis. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory distress, bradycardia, and acute renal failure. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. He is also receiving CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), lactulose for encephalopathy, and antibiotics for suspected MRSA in the lungs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient remains intubated due to respiratory distress caused by volume overload, aspiration, and possibly pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and respiratory support are required.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, and he has hepatorenal syndrome. This condition requires close monitoring, and the patient may need to transition from CVVH to hemodialysis (HD) if CVVH is not effective.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. Cultures are being obtained to identify the causative organism.

4. RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: The patient has an infection with VRE (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) and C. glabrata. Surgical debridement and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.

5. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate remains"

   # DISPO: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture, deep infection, OSA, progressive ARF, and cirrhosis. He presented to the ICU with respiratory distress, bradycardia, and volume overload. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, cirrhosis, leukocytosis, RLE cellulitis/osteomyelitis, gut motility concerns, bradycardia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, and FEN.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status is a significant concern. The presence of bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray suggests possible pneumonia or fluid overload. Given the patient's intubation and use of CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, there is a risk of further respiratory compromise.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function and decreasing urine output indicate acute renal failure. This condition may progress to hepatorenal syndrome or require dialysis.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, which increases the risk of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

4. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection. Close"

   Assessment and Plan
   62M NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture s/p ex-fix with deep infection
   s/p multiple debridements, OSA, progressive ARF [**3-12**] hepatorenal
   syndrome on midodrine and albumin and volume overload originally
   brought to ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting
   of volume overload and aspiration.
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt. remains intubated but doing well on SBT
   without significant change in pCO2. Seems more arousable now off
   sedation and with high dose lactulose, but not following commands.
   Patient has significant history of sleep apnea as well. Original
   respiratory distress likely volume overload as well as aspiration given
   history, CXR with bilateral infiltrate as well as volume overload from
   ascites, renal failure and oliguria.  On dapto, micafungin, zosyn.
   Patient received lasix/diuril in attempt to diurese, however
   unsuccessful.  CVVH held on [**4-18**] due to the fact that his dialysis
   catheter became clotted.  On [**4-18**] he had an episode of vomiting, repeat
   CXR not markedly different, but concern for possibly evolving L
   opacity.  Right was improved.  Goal is to extubate, but he continues
   not to follow commands.
   - continue ventilator today, consider extubation soon
   - continue  lactulose 60 mg q4h for encephelopathy
   - continue zosyn/dapto/micafungin renally dosed; h/o MRSA in lungs
   - continue famotidine
   - CVP <4 or rise in pressor requirement >0.1 indicates approaching
   euvolemia
 he is approaching this today and will discuss with renal
   drive
   # Acute renal failure now without Dialysis Access: Patient with large
   volume of ascites which is not helping his respiratory status and now
   with worsening renal function and decreasing urine output. Per
   hepatology and renal notes, he has suspected hepatorenal syndome and
   has been on albumin, octreotide and midodrine. However, there has been
   worsening on this regimen, so unclear if actually a different etiology.
   Acidemia mixed respiratory and metabolic, CNS appears comfortable at
   pCO2 at 50.

   Assessment and Plan
   62M NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture s/p ex-fix with deep infection
   s/p multiple debridements, OSA, progressive ARF [**3-12**] hepatorenal
   syndrome on midodrine and albumin and volume overload originally
   brought to ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting
   of volume overload and aspiration.
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt. remains intubated but doing well on SBT
   without significant change in pCO2. Seems more arousable now off
   sedation and with high dose lactulose. Patient has significant history
   of sleep apnea as well. Original respiratory distress likely volume
   overload as well as aspiration given history, CXR with bilateral
   infiltrate as well as volume overload from ascites, renal failure and
   oliguria.  On dapto, micafungin, zosyn.  Patient received lasix/diuril
   in attempt to diurese, however unsuccessful.  CVVH held on [**4-18**] due to
   the fact that his dialysis catheter became clotted.  On [**4-18**] he had an
   episode of vomiting, repeat CXR not markedly different, but concern for
   possibly evolving L opacity.  Right was improved.
   - continue ventilator today, consider extubation soon
   - continue  lactulose 60 mg q4h for encephelopathy
   - continue zosyn/dapto/micafungin renally dosed; h/o MRSA in lungs
   - continue famotidine
   - CVP <4 or rise in pressor requirement >0.1 indicates approaching
   euvolemia
 he is approaching this today and will discuss with renal
   drive
   # Acute renal failure now without Dialysis Access: Patient with large
   volume of ascites which is not helping his respiratory status and now
   with worsening renal function and decreasing urine output. Per
   hepatology and renal notes, he has suspected hepatorenal syndome and
   has been on albumin, octreotide and midodrine. However, there has been
   worsening on this regimen, so unclear if actually a different etiology.
   Acidemia mixed respiratory and metabolic, CNS appears comfortable at
   pCO2 at 50.
   - address line placement today, either tunneled or temporary, will
   discuss with renal
   - plan for HD tomorrow
   - renally dose medications
   - continue midodrine for HRS
 albumin stopped on [**4-13**]
   - f/u renal recs in AM
   - strict I&Os
   - tx as above
   #Cirrhosis: Not transplant candidate per hepatology.  Has had some
   increasing encephalopathy on the floor.  No fever or abdominal pain
   concerning for SBP though always a possibility. Paracentesis performed
   [**4-13**] with 3 L removed and no evidence of SBP.  Albumin and nadolol DC
   on [**4-13**].
   - If IAB >3.5, consider parascentesis
   - increase lactulose as above, 60 mg q4h
   - continue rifaximin
   - continue midodrine
   - f/u liver recs
   # Mental Status: continues to be agitated at times.
    - re-order restraints
    - continue to hold sedating meds
   # Leukocytosis: WBC now 13.5 not on steroids, temps 96, hypotensive but
   bradycardic. Cannot rule out sepsis.
   - continue daptomycin, micafungin, pip-tazo
   # RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: has cx with VRE and C. glabrata.
   Followed by ortho and will likely need s/p washout in the OR on [**4-15**].
   [**Month (only) 11**] need amputation in future.
   - Plan for bedside wound vac change tomorrow per ortho, OR on Monday
   - continue daptomycin, micafungin, pip-tazo
   - f/u sensitivities for C. glabrata
   - monitor wound cultures, blood cultures
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - f/u ortho recs
 wound vac changed per ortho
   - f/u ID recs
   # Gut Motility/Concern for Ileus: Moved bowels overnight. On reglan.
   - Continue Reglan
   - Give PO meds
   - Give lactulose as above
   - restart tube feeds today
   # Bradycardia
 originally thought likely d/t hypoxemia.  Intubated on
   [**4-13**] and pt. has had HR in 50s.  Nadolol held starting on [**4-13**].
   - octreotide was DC
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - continue to monitor
   # Anemia: HCT stable though trending down slowly. EGD on [**3-29**] showed
   varices and is now s/p banding/glueing.  Hct stable today.
   - check QD HCTs
   - continue PPI
   - hold nadolol 20mg  in setting of bradycardia
   - transfusion goal of 21 or evidence of bleeding or hypoperfusion
   - will need follow up EGD
 will speak with liver regarding this
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable, >100. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - daily PLT
   - transfuse <10 or evidence of bleeding
   # Diabetes mellitus: Continue SSI
   - follow up [**Hospital 294**] Clinic recs  now that patient is intubated
   - increase ISS
   - will continue dose of lantus (8 units) today; increase tomorrow as
   needed
   # Hypertension: of note, will target peripheral BPs as A line appears
   to be giving diminished readings
   - hold nadolol d/t intermittent bradycardia
   - Holding metoprolol and amlodipine
   # Obstructive sleep apnea: - pt. intubated
   # Rheumatoid arthritis: not on home medications. Will monitor for
   symptoms. No acute treatment needed currently.
   # Depression: Continue escitalopram and bupropion.
   # FEN: intubated, extubation trial today if more alert, OG tube in
   place
   - NPO now except for meds
   - NGT to suction

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, OSA, and progressive ARF. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia, which was likely due to volume overload and aspiration. He has significant comorbidities including cirrhosis, mental status changes, leukocytosis, RLE cellulitis/osteomyelitis, gut motility concerns, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, rheumatoid arthritis, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient remains intubated but is doing well on spontaneous breathing trials without significant change in pCO2. There is a concern for evolving lung opacity, which could indicate a worsening infection or pulmonary embolism.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function and decreasing urine output. He has suspected hepatorenal syndrome and has been on albumin, octreotide, and midodrine. There is a need for dialysis access, as CVVH was held due to a clotted dialysis catheter.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is now 13.5, and he is hypotensive but bradycardic. This could indicate sepsis or an ongoing infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. On admission, the patient's vital signs were stable, but he required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxemia. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin-tazobactam, daptomycin, and micafungin, for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and sepsis.

During the 24-hour period, the patient's temperature remained within normal limits, with a maximum temperature of 37.7°C. His heart rate was stable, ranging from 65 to 91 beats per minute. Blood pressure was well-controlled, with a range of 68-147 mmHg systolic and 43-73 mmHg diastolic. The patient's respiratory rate was within expected limits, averaging 12-30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation remained above 99% on supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube.

Fluid balance showed an input of 1,901 mL, including 496 mL of IV fluids, 184 mL of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and 248 mL of tube feeds. Output included 4,045 mL of urine, 30 mL of stool, and 15 mL of nasogastric drainage. The resulting fluid balance was -2,144"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. The patient's chief complaint is fever and respiratory distress. Upon admission, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 102°F. He was diagnosed with E.coli infection and started on meropenem as per ID recommendations. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed, removing 2.2 liters of fluid, which does not appear to be spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's respiratory status has improved, but he remains unable to follow commands, making extubation unsuccessful. Orthopedic plans to take the patient to the operating room on Monday.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory distress and dependency on mechanical ventilation increase the risk of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, or bronchospasm.

2. Infection: The presence of an E.coli infection indicates a risk of developing sepsis or septic shock if the infection spreads or worsens. Additionally, the patient is at risk of developing healthcare-associated infections like catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) or catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) due to the presence of various lines and catheters.

3. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate level suggests possible"

   Assessment and Plan
   62M NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture s/p ex-fix with deep infection
   s/p multiple debridements, OSA, progressive ARF [**3-12**] hepatorenal
   syndrome on midodrine and albumin and volume overload originally
   brought to ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting
   of volume overload and aspiration.
   # Fever: Temps to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday but defervesced overnight. Infectious
   sources may be orthopedic, pulmonary, SBP, urinary, possibly thrombus.
   He is broadly covered on antibiotics. He did have an episode of
   vomiting 3 days ago which may put him at risk for aspiration PNA.  C.
   Diff negative. Ascitic fluid not appearing to be SBP. UA positive but
   insufficient sample for culture.
   - f/u serial blood cultures and line tip culture
   - repeat C. Diff
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt. remains intubated but doing well on SBT
   without significant change in pCO2. Seems more arousable now off
   sedation and with high dose lactulose, but not following commands.
   Patient has significant history of sleep apnea as well. Original
   respiratory distress likely volume overload as well as aspiration given
   history, CXR with bilateral infiltrate as well as volume overload from
   ascites, renal failure and oliguria.  On dapto, micafungin, zosyn.
   Patient received lasix/diuril in attempt to diurese, however
   unsuccessful.  CVVH held on [**4-18**] due to the fact that his dialysis
   catheter became clotted.  On [**4-18**] he had an episode of vomiting, repeat
   CXR not markedly different, but concern for possibly evolving L
   opacity.  Right was improved.  Goal is to extubate, but he continues
   not to follow commands.
   - continue ventilator today, consider extubation soon
   - continue  lactulose 60 mg q4h for encephelopathy
   - continue zosyn/dapto/micafungin renally dosed; h/o MRSA in lungs
   - continue famotidine
   - CVP <4 or rise in pressor requirement >0.1 indicates approaching
   euvolemia
 he is approaching this today and will discuss with renal
   drive
   # Acute renal failure now without Dialysis Access: Patient with large
   volume of ascites which is not helping his respiratory status and now
   with worsening renal function and decreasing urine output. Per
   hepatology and renal notes, he has suspected hepatorenal syndome and
   has been on albumin, octreotide and midodrine. However, there has been
   worsening on this regimen, so unclear if actually a different etiology.
   Acidemia mixed respiratory and metabolic, CNS appears comfortable at
   pCO2 at 50.
   - temporary line in place, plan for HD line on [**4-22**]
   - plan for HD Monday
   - renally dose medications
   - continue midodrine for HRS
 albumin stopped on [**4-13**]
   - f/u renal recs in AM
   - strict I&Os
   - tx as above
   #Cirrhosis: Not transplant candidate per hepatology. Has had some
   increasing encephalopathy on the floor. No fever or abdominal pain
   concerning for SBP though always a possibility. Paracentesis performed
   [**4-13**] with 3 L removed and no evidence of SBP. Albumin and nadolol DC
   on [**4-13**].
   - As above, will do diagnostic para
   - increase lactulose as above, 60 mg q4h
   - continue rifaximin
   - continue midodrine
   - f/u liver recs
   - f/u hep panel pending
   # Mental Status: continues to be agitated at times.
    - re-order restraints
    - continue to hold sedating meds
   # RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: has cx with VRE and C. glabrata.
   Followed by ortho and will likely need s/p washout in the OR on [**4-15**].
   [**Month (only) 11**] need amputation in future.
   - Plan for bedside wound vac change tomorrow per ortho, OR on Monday
   - continue daptomycin, micafungin, pip-tazo
   - f/u sensitivities for C. glabrata
   - monitor wound cultures, blood cultures
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - f/u ortho recs
 wound vac changed per ortho
   - f/u ID recs
   # Gut Motility/Concern for Ileus: Moved bowels overnight. On reglan.
   - Continue Reglan
   - Give PO meds
   - Give lactulose as above
   - restart tube feeds today
   # Bradycardia
 originally thought likely d/t hypoxemia.  Intubated on
   [**4-13**] and pt. has had HR in 50s.  Nadolol held starting on [**4-13**].
   - octreotide was DC
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - continue to monitor
   # Anemia: HCT stable though trending down slowly. EGD on [**3-29**] showed
   varices and is now s/p banding/glueing.  Hct stable today.
   - will check PM Hct
   - continue PPI
   - hold nadolol 20mg  in setting of bradycardia
   - transfusion goal of 21 or evidence of bleeding or hypoperfusion
   - will need follow up EGD
 will speak with liver regarding this
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable, >100. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - daily PLT
   - transfuse <10 or evidence of bleeding
   # Diabetes mellitus: Continue SSI
   - follow up [**Hospital 294**] Clinic recs  now that patient is intubated
   - increase ISS
   - will continue dose of lantus (8 units) today; increase tomorrow as
   needed
   # Hypertension: of note, will target peripheral BPs as A line appears
   to be giving diminished readings
   - hold nadolol d/t intermittent bradycardia
   - Holding metoprolol and amlodipine
   # Obstructive sleep apnea: - pt. intubated
   # Rheumatoid arthritis: not on home medications. Will monitor for
   symptoms. No acute treatment needed currently.

   Assessment and Plan
   62M NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture s/p ex-fix with deep infection
   s/p multiple debridements, OSA, progressive ARF [**3-12**] hepatorenal
   syndrome on midodrine and albumin and volume overload originally
   brought to ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting
   of volume overload and aspiration.
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt. remains intubated but doing well on SBT
   without significant change in pCO2. Seems more arousable now off
   sedation and with high dose lactulose, but not following commands.
   Patient has significant history of sleep apnea as well. Original
   respiratory distress likely volume overload as well as aspiration given
   history, CXR with bilateral infiltrate as well as volume overload from
   ascites, renal failure and oliguria.  On dapto, micafungin, zosyn.
   Patient received lasix/diuril in attempt to diurese, however
   unsuccessful.  CVVH held on [**4-18**] due to the fact that his dialysis
   catheter became clotted.  On [**4-18**] he had an episode of vomiting, repeat
   CXR not markedly different, but concern for possibly evolving L
   opacity.  Right was improved.  Goal is to extubate, but he continues
   not to follow commands.
   - continue ventilator today, consider extubation soon
   - continue  lactulose 60 mg q4h for encephelopathy
   - continue zosyn/dapto/micafungin renally dosed; h/o MRSA in lungs
   - continue famotidine
   - CVP <4 or rise in pressor requirement >0.1 indicates approaching
   euvolemia
 he is approaching this today and will discuss with renal
   drive
   # Acute renal failure now without Dialysis Access: Patient with large
   volume of ascites which is not helping his respiratory status and now
   with worsening renal function and decreasing urine output. Per
   hepatology and renal notes, he has suspected hepatorenal syndome and
   has been on albumin, octreotide and midodrine. However, there has been
   worsening on this regimen, so unclear if actually a different etiology.
   Acidemia mixed respiratory and metabolic, CNS appears comfortable at
   pCO2 at 50.
   - temporary line in place, plan for HD line on [**4-22**]
   - plan for HD tomorrow
   - renally dose medications
   - continue midodrine for HRS
 albumin stopped on [**4-13**]
   - f/u renal recs in AM
   - strict I&Os
   - tx as above
   # Fever:  Axillary temp to 100.8.  Infectious sources may be
   orthopedic, pulmonary, SBP, urinary, possibly thrombus.  He is broadly
   covered on antibiotics.  He did have an episode of vomiting 2 days ago
   which may put him at risk for aspiration PNA.  C. Diff was negative
   yesterday
   - f/u serial blood cultures and line tip culture
   - send UA/UC
   - repeat C. Diff
   - bedside ultrasound with diagnostic paracentesis
   #Cirrhosis: Not transplant candidate per hepatology.  Has had some
   increasing encephalopathy on the floor.  No fever or abdominal pain
   concerning for SBP though always a possibility. Paracentesis performed
   [**4-13**] with 3 L removed and no evidence of SBP.  Albumin and nadolol DC
   on [**4-13**].
   - As above, will do diagnostic para
   - increase lactulose as above, 60 mg q4h
   - continue rifaximin
   - continue midodrine
   - f/u liver recs
   - f/u hep panel pending
   # Mental Status: continues to be agitated at times.
    - re-order restraints
    - continue to hold sedating meds
   # RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: has cx with VRE and C. glabrata.
   Followed by ortho and will likely need s/p washout in the OR on [**4-15**].
   [**Month (only) 11**] need amputation in future.
   - Plan for bedside wound vac change tomorrow per ortho, OR on Monday
   - continue daptomycin, micafungin, pip-tazo
   - f/u sensitivities for C. glabrata
   - monitor wound cultures, blood cultures
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - f/u ortho recs
 wound vac changed per ortho
   - f/u ID recs
   # Gut Motility/Concern for Ileus: Moved bowels overnight. On reglan.
   - Continue Reglan
   - Give PO meds
   - Give lactulose as above
   - restart tube feeds today
   # Bradycardia
 originally thought likely d/t hypoxemia.  Intubated on
   [**4-13**] and pt. has had HR in 50s.  Nadolol held starting on [**4-13**].
   - octreotide was DC
   - continue to hold nadolol
   - continue to monitor
   # Anemia: HCT stable though trending down slowly. EGD on [**3-29**] showed
   varices and is now s/p banding/glueing.  Hct stable today.
   - will check PM Hct
   - continue PPI
   - hold nadolol 20mg  in setting of bradycardia
   - transfusion goal of 21 or evidence of bleeding or hypoperfusion
   - will need follow up EGD
 will speak with liver regarding this
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable, >100. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - daily PLT
   - transfuse <10 or evidence of bleeding
   # Diabetes mellitus: Continue SSI
   - follow up [**Hospital 294**] Clinic recs  now that patient is intubated
   - increase ISS
   - will continue dose of lantus (8 units) today; increase tomorrow as
   needed
   # Hypertension: of note, will target peripheral BPs as A line appears
   to be giving diminished readings
   - hold nadolol d/t intermittent bradycardia
   - Holding metoprolol and amlodipine
   # Obstructive sleep apnea: - pt. intubated
   # Rheumatoid arthritis: not on home medications. Will monitor for
   symptoms. No acute treatment needed currently.
   # Depression: Continue escitalopram and bupropion.
   # FEN: intubated, extubation trial today if more alert, OG tube in
   place

   62M NASH c/b cirrhosis, varices p/w infected RLE s/p trimalleolar fx /
   osteo with ex-fix
 developed respiratory distress in the setting of
   ARF and restriction from massive ascites. Has made progress with
   aggressive volume removal via CVVH / HD, waking up slowly on PSV with
   hope to extubate when less encephalopathic. Has OSA, brittle DM,
   resolving ileus. Never give him benzos.
   key issues:
     * cirrhosis, varices
     * foot infection s/p OR repair
     * ARF, massive ascites
     * OSA and ascites-induced restrictive lung physiology from ascites
       with resp distress
     * CVVH/HD aggressive volume removal
     * intubated in setting of volume overload and aspiration
     * encephalopathic prior to intubation, now also residual effect of
       versed==> major barrier to extubation is mental status
   Received propofol 2am, no benzos in ~ 3 days
   Off levophed gtt since midnight.
   net 2L neg/24h, -17L LOS.
   CXR with some improvement in left lower and mid lung fields.

   erythema.
   During rounds noted febrile 100.8 axillary. Minimal amount bright
   yellow secretions ETT. Minimal cough, gag. Copious thin stool.
   CDiff toxin negative yesterday.
   Labs notable for WBC 13K, HCT 27, K+ 4.1, Cr 2.3. CXR with diffuse B
   infiltrates.
   Sources of fever: SBP, VAP, foot, drug reaction, thrombus, CDiff,
   urine, lines. CXR not suggestive of pna or atelectasis (though
   limited). Minimal urine (10cc/shift). Anticoagulation prophylaxis,
   CDiff has been neg.
   HD line tip sent yesterday. Blood cultures neg.
   On dapto, micafungin, zosyn.
   Will send urine and d/c foley, USG and diagnostic paracentesis, re-send
   CDiff.
   Continue to hold sedation
   Continue lactulose / rifaximin
   continuing broad [**Month/Day (1) 114**] coverage for possible nosocomial aspiration
   pneumonia (dapto / zosyn / mica), await speciation / sensitivities of
   sputum GNR.
   Volume overload / ARF is improving
   For cirrhosis / ascites, lactulose and rifaximin, LFTs are stable.
   For anemia / known varicies, serial HCT, BBS, will xfuse if <23, change
   OGT to NGT prior to extubation.
   Will continue management of RLE fx with wound care, serial washouts and

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, OSA, and progressive ARF (hepatorenal syndrome) on midodrine and albumin. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, bradycardia, and volume overload. The patient has multiple comorbidities including cirrhosis, varices, infected right lower extremity (RLE) wound post-trauma fixation, ARF, massive ascites, OSA, brittle diabetes mellitus, resolving ileus, and thrombocytopenia.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated but is doing well on spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) without significant change in pCO2. He has a history of OSA and ascites-induced restrictive lung physiology.
2. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient has worsening renal function and decreasing urine output. He has suspected hepatorenal syndrome and has been on albumin, octreotide, and midodrine.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has stable liver function tests and is not a transplant candidate per hepatology.
4. Infected RLE Wound: The patient has an infected wound on the right lower extremity with MRSA and C. glabrata.
5. Massive Ascites: The patient's ascites is contributing to respiratory distress.

   Assessment and Plan
   62M NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture s/p ex-fix with deep infection
   s/p multiple debridements, OSA, progressive ARF [**3-12**] hepatorenal
   syndrome on midodrine and albumin and volume overload originally
   brought to ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting
   of volume overload and aspiration.
   # Fever: Temps to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday but defervesced overnight. Infectious
   sources may be orthopedic, pulmonary, SBP, urinary, possibly thrombus.
   He is broadly covered on antibiotics. He did have an episode of
   vomiting 3 days ago which may put him at risk for aspiration PNA.  C.
   Diff negative. Ascitic fluid not appearing to be SBP. UA positive but
   insufficient sample for culture.
   - f/u serial blood cultures and line tip culture
   - repeat C. Diff
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt. remains intubated but doing well on SBT
   without significant change in pCO2. Seems more arousable now off
   sedation and with high dose lactulose, but not following commands.
   Patient has significant history of sleep apnea as well. Original
   respiratory distress likely volume overload as well as aspiration given
   history, CXR with bilateral infiltrate as well as volume overload from
   ascites, renal failure and oliguria.  On dapto, micafungin, zosyn.
   Patient received lasix/diuril in attempt to diurese, however
   unsuccessful.  CVVH held on [**4-18**] due to the fact that his dialysis
   catheter became clotted.  On [**4-18**] he had an episode of vomiting, repeat
   CXR not markedly different, but concern for possibly evolving L
   opacity.  Right was improved.  Goal is to extubate, but he continues
   not to follow commands.
   - continue ventilator today, consider extubation soon
   - continue  lactulose 60 mg q4h for encephelopathy
   - continue zosyn/dapto/micafungin renally dosed; h/o MRSA in lungs
   - continue famotidine
   - CVP <4 or rise in pressor requirement >0.1 indicates approaching
   euvolemia
 he is approaching this today and will discuss with renal
   drive
   # Acute renal failure now without Dialysis Access: Patient with large
   volume of ascites which is not helping his respiratory status and now
   with worsening renal function and decreasing urine output. Per
   hepatology and renal notes, he has suspected hepatorenal syndome and
   has been on albumin, octreotide and midodrine. However, there has been
   worsening on this regimen, so unclear if actually a different etiology.
   Acidemia mixed respiratory and metabolic, CNS appears comfortable at
   pCO2 at 50.
   - temporary line in place, plan for HD line on [**4-22**]
   - plan for HD Monday
   - renally dose medications
   - continue midodrine for HRS
 albumin stopped on [**4-13**]
   - f/u renal recs in AM
   - strict I&Os
   - tx as above
   #Cirrhosis: Not transplant candidate per hepatology. Has had some
   increasing encephalopathy on the floor. No fever or abdominal pain
   concerning for SBP though always a possibility. Paracentesis performed
   [**4-13**] with 3 L removed and no evidence of SBP. Albumin and nadolol DC
   on [**4-13**]
   -Diagnostic para performed yesterday
   - increase lactulose as above, 60 mg q4h
   - continue rifaximin
   - continue midodrine
   - f/u liver recs
   - f/u hep panel pending
   # Mental Status: continues to be agitated at times.
    - re-order restraints
   - continue to hold sedating meds
   -

   # RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: has cx with VRE and C. glabrata.
   Followed by ortho and will likely need s/p washout in the OR on [**4-15**].
   [**Month (only) 11**] need amputation in future.
   - Plan for bedside wound vac change tomorrow per ortho, OR on Monday
   - continue daptomycin, micafungin, pip-tazo

   # Anemia: HCT stable though trending down slowly. EGD on [**3-29**] showed
   varices and is now s/p banding/glueing.  Hct stable today.
   - will check PM Hct
   - continue PPI
   - hold nadolol 20mg  in setting of bradycardia
   - transfusion goal of 21 or evidence of bleeding or hypoperfusion
   - will need follow up EGD
 will speak with liver regarding this
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable, >100. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.
   - daily PLT
   - transfuse <10 or evidence of bleeding
   # Diabetes mellitus: Continue SSI
   - follow up [**Hospital 294**] Clinic recs  now that patient is intubated
   - increase ISS
   - will continue dose of lantus (8 units) today; increase tomorrow as
   needed

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, OSA, and progressive ARF with hepatorenal syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple complications including fever, respiratory distress, potential aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cirrhosis, mental status changes, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, rheumatoid arthritis, and depression. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory distress and ongoing need for mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and positive urine culture indicate a possible urinary tract infection. Additionally, the presence of ascites and a history of deep infection increases the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or other intra-abdominal infections.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's history of cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) puts him at risk for worsening renal function and potential kidney failure.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of varices and ongoing use of anticoagulation therapy (SC hepar"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture, deep infection, OSA, and progressive ARF with hepatorenal syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, bradycardia, and volume overload. The patient's fever defervesced overnight, and his respiratory status improved. However, he remains non-responsive and unable to follow commands, making extubation unsuccessful. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been febrile, and sources of infection may include the respiratory system, central line, urinary tract, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and cultures are pending.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has progressive ARF with hepatorenal syndrome. He is planned for hemodialysis (HD) on Monday and will require temporary HD line placement if tunneled HD line placement is not possible.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, which is not a transplant candidate. He has experienced increasing encephalopathy, and an ascitic fluid tap was performed due to concerns for SBP. The fluid analysis did not show signs of SBP.
4. Mental Status: The patient continues to have altered mental status with agitation. Lactulose has been ordered to manage encephalopathy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, OSA, and progressive ARF (hepatorenal syndrome) on midodrine and albumin. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting of volume overload and aspiration. He has been experiencing fever, mental status changes, acute renal failure, cirrhosis, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and positive urine analysis suggest a possible urinary tract infection. Additionally, there are concerns about orthopedic, pulmonary, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and thrombus infections. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further cultures and line tip cultures are recommended.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory distress. Although his respiratory status has improved, extubation is not recommended at this time due to concerns over mental status and the ability to protect his own airway. Continuous ventilator support is advised.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has progressive ARF, and plans for hemodialysis (HD) on Monday via temporary line have been made. If a tunneled HD line placement is possible, it will be done. Renal dosing of medications and strict input/output monitoring are also planned.

4. Cirrhosis:"

   24 Hour Events:
   Afebrile most of the day, but low grade temps overnight.  Chnaged to

   Linezolid if he continues to spike temps as Linezolid would have better
   lung coverage.
   Mental status remained non-responsive to commands
   Increased ISS, FS remained in mid-200s

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture, deep infection, OSA, and progressive ARF with hepatorenal syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and bradycardia due to volume overload and aspiration. The patient had a fever, which defervesced overnight, indicating potential sources of infection such as orthopedic, pulmonary, SBP, urinary, or thrombus. Broad coverage antibiotics were started, and further testing is recommended to identify the exact source of infection.

The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly, allowing him to tolerate spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs). However, extubation is still not possible due to concerns about his mental status and ability to protect his own airway. Ventilator support will continue, and lactulose for encephalopathy will be continued.

The patient's renal function is compromised, and plans for hemodialysis (HD) on Monday have been made. A temporary HD line will be used initially, and if feasible, a tunneled HD line placement will be performed. Renally dosed medications will be administered.

The patient's cirrhosis status is stable, with no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) after paracentesis. Hepatic encephalopathy management will continue, and diagnostic tests are pending.

The patient's mental status remains agitated, and restraints will"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with a non-responsive mental status, increased ISS (not specified), and mid-200s for the FS (not specified). The patient has been experiencing low-grade temperatures, prompting a change in antibiotics from piperacillin/tazobactam to meropenem. The patient's Na is 147, and there have been free water flushes administered. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Daptomycin on 04/21/20 at 04:27 PM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels (3.6, 5.3, 5.9, 6.6) indicate potential acute renal failure. This could be a result of factors such as sepsis, hypotension, or nephrotoxic medications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ABG results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 427 and a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 38, suggesting respiratory failure. This may be due to pneumonia, aspiration, or other respiratory conditions.
3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 25/55) and alkaline phosphatase levels (Alk Phos: 212) may indicate liver dysfunction. This could be caused by sepsis, cirrhosis, or other underlying liver conditions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, OSA, progressive ARF, and cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting of volume overload and aspiration. The patient has been experiencing intermittent fever spikes, mental status changes, and agitation. His current medications include famotidine, heparin sodium, midodrine, albumin, lactulose, and meropenem. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C, blood pressure ranging from 101/46-144/86 mmHg, heart rate of 60 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals clear lung sounds, rales in the lower left sternal border, regular rhythm, and warm, dry skin. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 90 K/uL. The patient's most recent blood cultures were negative. 

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, OSA, and progressive ARF. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia due to volume overload and aspiration. The patient continues to be agitated and has a mental status that is non-responsive to commands. There is a concern for opiate withdrawal. Fever is present intermittently, with temperatures reaching up to 102 degrees over the weekend. Broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated, and there is a recommendation to switch from daptomycin to linezolid if the fever persists. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but he is still unable to be extubated due to concerns about protecting his airway. Acute renal failure has been diagnosed, and the patient did not tolerate hemodialysis (HD) well today. Renal dosing of medications has been ordered, and a tunneled HD line placement is scheduled for today if the patient is afebrile and blood cultures remain negative. Cirrhosis is present, with increasing encephalopathy on the floor, but no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in the most recent paracentesis. The patient has cellulitis and osteomyelitis in the right lower extremity, with cultures positive for Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and Candida glabrata."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, varices, infected right lower extremity, and trimalleolar fracture with external fixation. He presented with respiratory distress in the setting of acute renal failure (ARF) and massive ascites. The patient remains agitated but not following commands. He has ongoing encephalopathy and cirrhosis. His current conditions include hypotension, altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleed, pneumonia aspiration, alteration in nutrition, anxiety, orthopedic device infection, renal failure, acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and cirrhosis of the liver.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, causing confusion, altered mental status, and agitation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and ARF increase the risk of respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by his inability to clear secretions due to mechanical ventilation.
3. Infection: The patient has multiple risk factors for infections, including an infected right lower extremity, use of medical devices (PICC line, arterial line, dialysis catheter), and compromised immune function due to cirrhosis and renal failure.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleed increases the risk of recurrent bleeding, especially considering his compromised liver function and portal hypertension.
5. Renal failure: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture, OSA, and progressive ARF with hepatorenal syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia. The patient has multiple comorbidities including cirrhosis, RLE cellulitis/osteomyelitis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, rheumatoid arthritis, and depression.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress but improved significantly after receiving treatment. He was extubated successfully yesterday but is now experiencing agitation and mental status changes, making airway protection a concern.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level of 150 and a free water deficit of 5L. He is being corrected with D5W at 150.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient did not tolerate hemodialysis (HD) well today. Renal consultation is recommended to discuss the possibility of dialysis again today. A tunneled HD line placement is planned if the patient is afebrile and blood cultures remain negative.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has increasing encephalopathy on the floor, but no fever or abdominal pain concerning for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). A paracentesis was performed with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and septic shock. He has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. He has been diagnosed with several infections, including pneumonia and wound infection caused by Torulopsis glabrata. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal renal function tests. He is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and vasopressors. The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating dehydration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of severe sepsis and septic shock indicates a systemic inflammatory response due to infection. If not managed appropriately, sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest pneumonia. If left untreated or inadequately treated, pneumonia can progress and cause respiratory failure.
3. Wound infection: The patient has a wound infection caused by Torulopsis glabrata, which is a yeast infection. If the infection spreads or becomes resistant to treatment, it may lead to further complications.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and abnormal renal function tests suggest kidney dysfunction. This can be a result of sepsis or other underlying conditions. If not managed properly"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia. He was successfully extubated yesterday but is still on CPAP/PSV with supplemental oxygen. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/52 to 152/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 153.7 kg at admission to 131.2 kg currently.

The patient received several antibiotics including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Daptomycin, Meropenem, and Micafungin. He is also on Propofol for sedation, Famotidine (Pepcid) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and Haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent development of hypernatremia, which was addressed by starting D5W at 150 mL/hr. His fluid balance shows an intake of 1,412 mL, including 245 mL of total intravenous fluids, and an output of 1,720 mL, including 1,000 mL of urine. His central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 5 mmHg.

   FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):
      A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or
      filamentous fungi.  A negative result should be interpreted with
      caution.  Whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated fluid should
      be submitted.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture status post external fixation with deep infection, OSA, and progressive ARF (hepatorenal syndrome) on midodrine and albumin. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting of volume overload and aspiration.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Mental Status: The patient continues to be agitated at times, possibly secondary to pain or opiate withdrawal. He will be restrained, continue lactulose for encephalopathy, and try low-dose propofol for sedation.
2. Fever: The patient had a temperature of 102 degrees over the weekend but defervesced overnight. Possible sources of infection include orthopedic, pulmonary, SBP, urinary, or thrombus. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and blood cultures and line tip culture should be followed up.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status has significantly improved, but he is still unable to be extubated due to mental status and airway protection concerns. Ventilation will continue today, and extubation may be considered soon pending mental status improvement.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is 150, with a free water deficit of 5L. He has started on D5W at 150, with 3L corrected so far.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient did not tolerate HD well today. Renal consultation should be sought for further management, and a tunneled HD line placement may be considered.
6. Cirrhosis: The patient has increasing encephalopathy on the floor but no evidence of SBP. Paracentesis was performed with 2.2L removed. Lactulose should be increased, and rifaximin and midodrine should be continued.
7. RLE Cellulitis/Osteomyelitis: The patient has cultures positive for VRE and C. glabrata. OR today, follow-up with ortho recs, and continue daptomycin, micafungin, and meropenem.
8. Anemia: The patient's HCT is stable though trending down slowly. EGD showed varices and is now s/p banding/glueing. PPI should be continued, and nadolol should be held in the setting of bradycardia.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelets are trending down, likely due to ESLD. Daily PLT should be done, and transfusion should be considered if platelets are below 10 or if there is evidence of bleeding.
10. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood sugars are in the 200s. SSI should be continued, and follow-up with endocrinology recs.
11. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure should be targeted peripherally as the arterial line may be giving diminished readings. Nadolol should be held due to intermittent bradycardia, and other antihypertensive medications should be considered.
12. Obstructive Sleep Apnea: The patient is currently intubated.
13. Rheumatoid Arthritis: The patient is not on home medications for RA. Sym"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH leading to cirrhosis. The patient has multiple medical complications including hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, orthopedic device infection, anxiety, and altered mental status. 

The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated due to increasing agitation and biting through the tube. The patient's current vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/60 mmHg to 152/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normocephalic head, symmetric chest expansion, rhonchorous breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. However, the patient is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, and responds to stimuli. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's medical plan includes treatment for hypotension, altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleed, pneumonia, altered nutrition, anxiety, orthopedic device infection, renal failure, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis, and hepatic encephalopathy."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture, deep infection, OSA, and progressive ARF. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, bradycardia, volume overload, and aspiration. The patient continues to be agitated and has had intermittent fevers. He has been diagnosed with hypernatremia, acute renal failure, cirrhosis, RLE cellulitis/osteomyelitis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, and FEN. The patient is currently intubated, on OG tube, NPO, with NGT to suction, and receiving tube feeds. He has multiple lines including PICC line, HD line, and arterial line. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress, which could be due to volume overload. This condition can lead to further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Renal Failure: The patient has progressive acute renal failure, which may worsen if not managed properly. Complications can include electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and uremic symptoms.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, which increases the risk of complications like hepatic encephalopathy"

The patient has multiple comorbidities including cirrhosis, RLE cellulitis/osteomyelitis, anemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, rheumatoid arthritis, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress, which improved after extubation. However, there is still a risk of recurrent respiratory distress due to underlying conditions such as OSA and aspiration.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has progressive ARF and hepatorenal syndrome, which requires ongoing management with dialysis. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for various infections, including SBP, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but ongoing monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient had elevated sodium levels that were corrected with D5W. Close monitoring of electrolyte balance is required.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, likely due to ESLD. Regular monitoring and appropriate management are needed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, OSA, progressive ARF, hepatorenal syndrome, cirrhosis, RLE cellulitis/osteomyelitis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, and FEN.

The patient was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting of volume overload and aspiration. He has been receiving multiple treatments including antibiotics, antifungals, lactulose for encephalopathy, and midodrine for hepatorenal syndrome.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress due to volume overload and aspiration. Although his respiratory status improved, there is still a concern about his mental status and ability to protect his own airway, which may require continued respiratory support.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has progressive acute renal failure, which has been difficult to manage with dialysis. There are plans to place a tunneled hemodialysis line and continue with renal dosed medications.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 150 and a free water deficit of 5L. He is being given"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and progressive acute renal failure (ARF) with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient presented to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia, possibly due to volume overload and aspiration. 

The patient's mental status has been less agitated since starting zydis but continues to be agitated at times, possibly secondary to pain or opiate withdrawal. Neuro exam is nonfocal.

The patient had a fever that resolved, and infectious sources may include orthopedic, pulmonary, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), urinary, or thrombus. Broadly covered on antibiotics, with C. diff negative and ascitic fluid not appearing to be SBP. UA positive but insufficient sample for culture.

The patient's respiratory status significantly improved after extubation on [4-22] and is currently doing well on a shovel mask. The patient now has a tracheostomy.

The patient's sodium level was corrected from 151 to 145 after receiving D5W on [4-23], in conjunction with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) during dialysis. The patient was transitioned from continuous veno-venous hemof"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH and cirrhosis. He presented with hepatic encephalopathy and renal failure. The patient has undergone various interventions, including the placement of a NG tube, administration of lactulose and rifaximin, treatment for a foot infection with antibiotics, and initiation of dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver dysfunction is causing cognitive impairment and altered mental status. This condition can lead to increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and even coma if not managed properly.
2. Renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning adequately, leading to the accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances. This can result in fluid overload, electrolyte disturbances, and acid-base imbalance.
3. Foot infection: The patient has an active infection in his foot, which may require debridement or amputation if it does not respond to antibiotic therapy.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient experienced respiratory distress in the past and required intubation. He has now been extubated but may still be at risk for further respiratory complications.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers or bedsores.
6. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety, which may be due to his critical illness and the stress associated with being in the ICU.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture, OSA, progressive ARF (hepatorenal syndrome), and cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting of volume overload and aspiration. The patient's mental status has significantly improved, and he is now responding to simple questions and commands. His respiratory status has also improved, and he is no longer on mechanical ventilation but is on a shovel mask. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, anemia, thrombocytopenia, depression, obstructive sleep apnea, rheumatoid arthritis, and cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels need to be closely monitored due to previous episodes of hypernatremia.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has ongoing renal issues, and dialysis may be required.
3. Oral ulcer: The patient has an oral ulcer that requires wound care recommendations and possibly a plastics consult.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of infections, including VRE and C. glabrata. Surveillance blood cultures are important to monitor for any potential infections.
5. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, and midodrine and albumin are being used to manage this condition.

The patient was brought to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting of volume overload and aspiration.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of deep infection and is currently being treated for possible sources of infection such as orthopedic, pulmonary, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and thrombus. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and cultures are being monitored.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient initially experienced respiratory distress likely due to volume overload, but has improved significantly since extubation.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient had elevated sodium levels initially, which were managed with D5W and PRBCs during dialysis. Close monitoring is required.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has progressive ARF with HRS. He was transitioned from continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) to hemodialysis (HD) and is ordered for tunneled HD line placement. Renal dosing of medications is necessary.

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture, OSA, and progressive ARF with hepatorenal syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia due to volume overload and aspiration. The patient's mental status has significantly improved, and he is now responding to simple questions and commands. He has been extubated and is doing well on a shovel mask.

The patient's fever has resolved, and he no longer has signs of respiratory distress. His oral ulcer is being managed with wound care recommendations and consideration for an ENT consult if there is no improvement. His hypernatremia has been corrected with D5W and PRBCs during dialysis. He is currently undergoing hemodialysis and will have a tunneled HD line placed for ongoing dialysis.

The patient also has cirrhosis and is not a transplant candidate. He had increasing encephalopathy on the floor but no evidence of SBP during paracentesis. He has a history of RLE cellulitis/osteomyelitis with sensitivities for C. glabrata. He is receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment and wound care recommendations. His anemia is being managed with banding/glueing of varices and transfusion of PRBCs during HD. His thrombocytopenia is suspected to be due to ESLD. His diabetes mellitus and hypertension are being managed with medication adjustments"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture, OSA, progressive ARF (hepatorenal syndrome), cirrhosis, RLE cellulitis/osteomyelitis, anemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, and obstructive sleep apnea. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting of volume overload and aspiration.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Mental status: Improved significantly today, now responding to simple questions and commands.
- Fever: Resolved, last fever on 4/20/20. Will continue to trend fever curve.
- Respiratory distress: Significantly improved, extubated on 4/22 and doing well on a shovel mask. Initial cause likely due to volume overload.
- Oral ulcer: Wound care recommendations, plastics consult?
- Hypernatremia: Sodium levels down from 151 to 145 after receiving D5W on 4/23 in conjunction with PRBCs during dialysis. Will continue to monitor.
- Acute renal failure: Transitioned from CVVH to HD and tolerated dialysis on 4/23. Ordered tunneled HD line placement for today. If unable, will dialyze through temporary HD line until able to place tunneled line.
- Cirrhosis:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, varices, and an infected right lower extremity (RLE) post traumatic malunion with external fixation. The patient is currently experiencing renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and respiratory distress due to acute respiratory failure (not ARDS). He also has impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis of the liver, and a foot infection. 

24-hour events include the placement and removal of a dialysis catheter, as well as the initiation of tunneled hemodialysis. The patient's arterial line was also stopped. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 109/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and has normal breath sounds. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normocephalic head, oral ulcer under the upper lip, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, absence of lower extremity edema, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes, with low hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. Other lab values are within normal limits. 

Assessment and plan include hypotension, altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleed, pneumonia, alteration in nutrition, anxiety, orthopedic device infection, renal failure, acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis of the liver, and others. 

The patient's condition is improving slowly, with ongoing encephalopathy but increased interaction. The foot infection is being treated with antibiotics, and the patient is receiving hemodialysis for acute renal failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory distress, foot infection, and impaired skin integrity."

There is a recommendation for a tissue sample during the next ortho debridement to determine if VRE (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) is sensitive to doxycycline.

The patient also has a negative HepBsAb status, indicating a need for Hepatitis B vaccination in the future.

In terms of allergies, there are no known drug allergies.

Regarding medications, the patient has received Micafungin on [**2120-4-24**] at 05:59 PM and Daptomycin on [**2120-4-25**] at 04:04 PM. The patient is currently taking Lansoprazole (Prevacid) since [**2120-4-25**] at 08:20 AM and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) since [**2120-4-26**] at 12:30 AM.

The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for noted below.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), a current temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), a heart rate of 98 bpm with a range of 84-103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/62 mmHg to 143/106 mm"

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, OSA, and progressive ARF. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and bradycardia. The patient has multiple comorbidities including cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, and obstructive sleep apnea. He is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics for a suspected infection, anticoagulants, PPIs, and psychotropic medications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/62 mmHg to 143/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. He is extubated and receiving supplemental oxygen. The patient's mental status has significantly improved, and he is responding to simple questions and commands.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of deep infection and is currently on antibiotics for suspected MRSA in the lungs. There is a concern for ongoing infection as evidenced by the recommendation for tissue sample to determine sensitivity to doxycycline. Close monitoring of fever curve and follow-up with serial blood cultures and line tip culture is advised.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including non-alcoholic steatohepatosis (NASH), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), trimalleolar fracture with external fixation, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), progressive acute renal failure (ARF), and cirrhosis. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting of volume overload and aspiration.

The patient's current condition includes improved mental status, resolved fever, improved respiratory status post-extubation, oral ulcer, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, cirrhosis, and cellulitis/osteomyelitis with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and Candida glabrata infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatitis B infection: The patient's HepBsAb was negative, indicating that he does not have immunity against Hepatitis B virus. Therefore, he will need Hepatitis B vaccination in the future.

2. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient has progressive ARF and is being treated with midodrine and albumin for HRS. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.

3. Cirrhosis complications: The patient has cirrhosis and is at risk for complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, OSA, and progressive acute renal failure (ARF) with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient presented to the ICU with respiratory distress, bradycardia, and volume overload, and was found to have an oral ulcer and evidence of cirrhosis. He has been experiencing increasing encephalopathy on the floor but does not have fever or abdominal pain, suggesting possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient underwent paracentesis and had 2.2 L of ascites removed without evidence of SBP. He also has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, depression, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's current medications include lactulose, midodrine, albumin, volume overload, daptomycin, micafungin, and rifaximin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has multiple risk factors for infection, including immunosuppression due to cirrhosis, presence of an oral ulcer, and previous infections with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and Candida glabrata. Monitoring of fever, wound cultures, and blood cultures is important to detect any new infections.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH and cirrhosis. The patient's chief complaints include cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and right lower extremity (RLE) pain. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, acute renal failure (ARF), and massive ascites.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.6°F (38.1°C), heart rate in the 110s, blood pressure ranging from 64-143 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals an ulcer on the underside of the upper lip, trace edema in both lower extremities, and the presence of external hardware in the RLE. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately, but movement, tone, and assessment are not evaluated.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, blood glucose, and liver enzymes such as AST and ALT. Other lab values including white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include several potential complications, including impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, inability to communicate functionally, impaired muscle performance, impaired posture, impaired"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, OSA, and progressive ARF. The patient was brought to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia in the setting of volume overload and aspiration.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note include:

1. Infection: The patient has shown fever spikes, indicating a possible infection. Blood cultures and line tip culture have been ordered to identify the causative agent.

2. Liver failure: The patient has cirrhosis and increasing encephalopathy on the floor. There is a possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, which needs to be closely monitored.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure and is currently on dialysis. Monitoring of renal function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly will be important.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is trending down, which may be due to ESLD (end-stage liver disease). Regular monitoring of platelet levels and transfusion if necessary will be required.

5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's blood sugars are in the 200s, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. Adjustments to insulin therapy will be needed.

6. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and careful monitoring of blood pressure is necessary. Medication adjustments may be required.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH, NSTEMI, trimalleolar fracture with deep infection, OSA, progressive ARF (hepatorenal syndrome), and cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and bradycardia. The patient has been improving in mental status, respiratory status, and renal function. However, he still has several ongoing medical complications including oral ulcer, anemia, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fever spikes, suggesting a possible ongoing infection. Blood cultures and line tip culture have been ordered to identify the causative organism.
2. Liver failure: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and is not a transplant candidate. He is experiencing increasing encephalopathy on the floor. Close monitoring of liver function and management of ascites is necessary.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure and is on hemodialysis. Strict I&Os and medication dosing based on renal function should be continued.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is trending down, which may be due to ESLD (end-stage liver disease). Daily monitoring of platelet levels and consideration of transfusion if"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH and cirrhosis. He has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, acute renal failure, and restriction from massive ascites. The patient also has an infected right lower extremity and a trimalleolar fracture with external fixation. He is currently being treated with lactulose and rifaximin for cirrhosis/encephalopathy, daptomycin and micafungin for foot infection, and hemodialysis for acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by confusion, altered mental status, and changes in behavior.
2. Infection: The patient has an infected right lower extremity and is receiving treatment with antibiotics. There is also a concern for a possible infection causing the fever spike.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's respiratory distress, there is a risk of developing ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by widespread inflammation in the lungs.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, which can progress to AKI if not properly managed. AKI is a sudden decline in kidney function and can be reversible with appropriate treatment.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility"
