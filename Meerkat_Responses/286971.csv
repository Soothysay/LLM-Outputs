 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 HEMOPTYSIS
   70 year old male with known CLL presents with hemoptysis in setting of
   known LLL mass; now s/p embolization of bronchial artery with recurrent
   hemoptysis.
   # Hemoptysis: most likely secondary to bleeding bronchial vessel.  In
   light of recent history of hemorrhaging LLL bronchial artery, this
   seems to be most likely source.  Because this was not able to be
   intervened on endobronciolly at the time of last IP procedure, IP and
   IR feel that it's again likely to require embolization procedure.
   - IR fellow and I attempting to reach patient's wife for consent, will
   touch base  later this morning ([**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 898**] [**Numeric Identifier 13677**]) - update, wife aware,
   will discuss with IR later this  morning
   - check hct q4h
   - transfuse to hct >30, platelets >50k
   - continue L tilted positioning, attempt to contiunme R mainstem
   intubation
   .
   # Hypotension:  likely a combination of  positive pressure ventilation
   and medication effect, less likely significant hemodynamic loss into
   thorax or adrenal infufficiency given relatively low (physiologic) home
   dose of prednisone
   - check random cortisol
   - stress-dose steroids if not off pressors later today

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with known chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who presents with hemoptysis. He has a history of left lung mass and underwent embolization of the bronchial artery due to recurrent hemoptysis. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, anemia, and elevated creatinine levels. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 5.7, decreased platelet count of 65,000/mm3, elevated troponin T level of 0.36, and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 482 IU/L. The patient's blood glucose level is also elevated at 183 mg/dL. The patient has known autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) related to CLL and has received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in the emergency department. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of his hemodynamic status, coagulopathy, and potential complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and acute kidney injury (AKI)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and a left lung mass. He presents with hemoptysis, which has been treated with bronchial artery embolization. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, but he has experienced episodes of bradycardia without changes in blood pressure or respiratory rate. He also self-removed his orogastric tube and has been weaned off levophed.

The patient has a known allergy to no known drugs and is receiving antibiotics for a suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. His medications include propofol, famotidine, midazolam, fentanyl, and others. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted hemoptysis.

Physical examination reveals constricted pupils, an endotracheal tube in place, and diminished breath sounds on the right side with rhonchi. The patient has right lower extremity edema and is unable to stand. His neurologic examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.1 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 65. Other labs are within normal ranges. Imaging studies are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension (not in shock): likely due to positive pressure ventilation and medication effect."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), coagulopathy, and lung masses of unclear etiology. He presented with recurrent hemoptysis and has been stable for over 36 hours without evidence of rebleeding. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. He has been intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/45 to 122/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on pressor support but has no evidence of bleeding. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia, and elevated platelet count. Liver function tests are within normal limits, while kidney function shows a slightly elevated creatinine level. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a low potassium level. 

Imaging studies reveal no new chest x-ray findings. The patient's coagulation profile shows prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), but normal international normalized ratio (INR).

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's assessment remains the same as before, including CLL, co"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), coagulopathy, and lung masses of unclear etiology. He presented with recurrent hemoptysis and was intubated. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/45-122/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 5 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 92. His arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal range.

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 5.7 K/uL, anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) of 30.6%, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count (Plt) of 65 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 1.4 mg/dL, elevated troponin-T levels, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 482 IU/L. Imaging and microbiology results are unremarkable.

Plan:
The patient's current plan includes observing him for 24 hours before considering transfer to the floor, maintaining glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, removing the multi-lumen line and PICC line after extubation, providing nutrition after extubation, and continuing prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent hemoptysis: The patient's history of massive hemoptysis and the presence of lung masses of unclear etiology put him at risk for recurrent episodes of hemoptysis.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy increases the risk of bleeding complications, including potential rebleeding after embolization or during invasive procedures.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's underlying respiratory issues, along with potential complications such as pneumonia or worsening lung function, may lead to respiratory distress and the need for further respiratory support.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to CLL and prolonged mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of myocardial infarction and elevated troponin-T levels suggest ongoing cardiac issues, which may result in further cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias."

   history of massive hemoptysis s/p LLL brachial artery embolization,
   represented with recurrent hemoptysis of unclear amount, no stable for
   >36 hrs without evidence of rebleeding. Unfortunately, it is not clear
   how much hemoptysis the patient had at rehab before he was intubated.
   After extensive discussion with IP and IR yesterday, we made a decision
   not to do additional procedure given that risks outweigh the benefits
   of any procedures.
   Case discussed with IP again this am. Will check an xray this morning
   in order to make a decision whether there is a need for a
clean-up

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), coagulopathy, lung masses of unclear etiology, and recent massive hemoptysis following left lower lobe brachial artery embolization. The patient presented with recurrent hemoptysis of unclear amount and has been unstable for more than 36 hours without evidence of rebleeding. 

The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. He is being treated in the ICU with multiple medications including cefepime, vancomycin, famotidine, midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of PSV/SBT. His vital signs include a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/45 mmHg to 122/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 5.7 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, elevated creatinine at 1.6 mg/dL, and elevated troponin levels. The patient's platelet count is low at 65 K/uL. Imaging and microbiology tests are pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with known chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and a lung mass, presenting with hemoptysis. The patient underwent bronchial artery embolization due to recurrent bleeding. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for close monitoring. The patient's condition has been stable since admission without evidence of rebleeding. He was extubated yesterday and is expected to be transferred to the bone marrow transplant (BMT) unit for further oncologic care. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with some fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. His respiratory support has been discontinued, and he is now on supplemental oxygen. The patient's renal function has shown some improvement. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease. The patient's medications include famotidine, propofol, lorazepam, and metoprolol. The plan is to restart metoprolol, continue monitoring, and provide appropriate care for his CLL and other medical conditions. The patient's code status remains full, and he will be transferred to the BMT floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: Given the patient's history of hemoptysis and bronchial artery embolization, there is a risk of rebleeding or new bleeding episodes.
2. Infection: The patient has recently received antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), currently presenting with mediastinal masses and a left bronchial artery bleed. He was readmitted with hemoptysis and underwent bronchoscopy per interventional pulmonology (IP) with stable left lower lobe clot noted. The patient was extubated uneventfully yesterday. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 154/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is alert and oriented to self but only to name. He has no known drug allergies and has received cefepime and vancomycin infusions.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds in both lungs, trace edema in both lower extremities, and normal neurologic examination. Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 5.7 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 65 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, and elevated troponin-T level of 0.36 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal limits.
