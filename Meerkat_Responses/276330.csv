   Assessment and Plan
   A [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, recent admission
   [**Date range (3) 7130**] for acute on chronic renal failure with decision to
   initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital stay complicated by
   left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia presenting with altered mental
   status.
   # Altered mental status: Likely due to infection with bandemia,
   hypothermia, hypotension - also with component of medication effect and
   potentially hypoxemia/hypercapnia at home.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary versus line.  Patient with recent increase in
   oxygen requirement and sputum production at home.  Chest x-ray with
   persistent left lower lobe infiltrate which may represent new process
   versus incomplete resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Recent
   admission for acute on chronic renal failure with tunnelled catheter
   placement at that time.  Received influenza vaccination [**10/2131**],
   pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  Patient took trazodone two days prior to admission,
   which has caused confusion in the past - appears to be hepatically
   cleared to active metabolite that is excreted in urine; patient
   anuric.  CT head without acute process.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn to treat pulmonary and potential line infection
   - Sputum, blood (peripheral and catheter), urine cultures pending; no
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile
   - Wean sedation as possible and hold other sedating medications
   - Check TSH, B12, RPR
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated in the ED for apnea and airway
   protection.  History of COPD.  Chest x-ray with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate with potential new pneumonia.
   - Inadequate tidal volumes on pressure support
 continue AC overnight
   - Wean FiO2 as possible
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   - Hold on steroids for COPD overnight
   # Hypotension: Likely due to medication effect.  Sepsis less likely.
   - Wean sedation
   - Small IVF bolus in order to discontinue Levophed
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely sources are pulmonary versus line
   infection as above.  Urinalysis negative.  No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - Sputum, blood, urine cultures pending
   # Bradycardia: Patient on metoprolol as an outpatient.  Likely some
   component of sinus node dysfunction.  No signs or symptoms of ischemia
   but will rule out.
   - Telemetry, ROMI
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - Renal aware
   - HD MWF
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s; at baseline.
   - Continue epogen
   - Monitor
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus bradycardia; on coumadin.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Hold coumadin for now and start heparin gtt without bolus for
   potential line replacement
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - Hold coumadin for now and start heparin gtt without bolus
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.
   - Check TSH as above
   - Continue levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Wegener's granulomatosis, and recent admission for acute on chronic renal failure. She is currently admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypotension, bandemia, bradycardia, chronic renal failure, anemia, atrial fibrillation, history of transient ischemic attack, and hypothyroidism.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient presents with altered mental status, which is likely due to infection with bandemia, hypothermia, hypotension, medication effect, and potentially hypoxemia/hypercapnia at home.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is intubated in the ED for apnea and airway protection. She also has persistent left lower lobe infiltrate with potential new pneumonia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to medication effect. Sepsis is less likely, but cannot be ruled out.
4. Bandemia/left shift: The patient has bandemia, which could be caused by pulmonary or line infection. Urinalysis is negative, and there is no diarrhea to suggest C. difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
5. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may be due to metoprolol use as an outpatient, but"

   Assessment and Plan
   A [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, recent admission
   [**Date range (3) 7130**] for acute on chronic renal failure with decision to
   initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital stay complicated by
   left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia presenting with altered mental
   status.
   # Altered mental status: Likely due to infection with bandemia,
   hypothermia, hypotension - also with component of medication effect and
   potentially hypoxemia/hypercapnia at home.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary versus line.  Patient with recent increase in
   oxygen requirement and sputum production at home.  Chest x-ray with
   persistent left lower lobe infiltrate which may represent new process
   versus incomplete resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Recent
   admission for acute on chronic renal failure with tunnelled catheter
   placement at that time.  Received influenza vaccination [**10/2131**],
   pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  Patient took trazodone two days prior to admission,
   which has caused confusion in the past - appears to be hepatically
   cleared to active metabolite that is excreted in urine; patient
   anuric.  CT head without acute process.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn to treat pulmonary and potential line infection
   - Sputum, blood (peripheral and catheter), urine cultures pending; no
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile
   - Wean sedation as possible and hold other sedating medications
   - Check TSH, B12, RPR
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated in the ED for apnea and airway
   protection.  History of COPD.  Chest x-ray with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate with potential new pneumonia.
   - Inadequate tidal volumes on pressure support
 continue AC overnight
   - Wean FiO2 as possible
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   - Hold on steroids for COPD overnight
   # Hypotension: Likely due to medication effect.  Sepsis less likely.
   - Wean sedation
   - Small IVF bolus in order to discontinue Levophed
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely sources are pulmonary versus line
   infection as above.  Urinalysis negative.  No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - Sputum, blood, urine cultures pending
   # Bradycardia: Patient on metoprolol as an outpatient.  Likely some
   component of sinus node dysfunction.  No signs or symptoms of ischemia
   but will rule out.
   - Telemetry, ROMI
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - Renal aware
   - HD MWF
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s; at baseline.
   - Continue epogen
   - Monitor
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus bradycardia; on coumadin.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Hold coumadin for now and start heparin gtt without bolus for
   potential line replacement
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - Hold coumadin for now and start heparin gtt without bolus
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.
   - Check TSH as above
   - Continue levothyroxine

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Wegener's granulomatosis, and recent admission for acute on chronic renal failure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypotension, bandemia, bradycardia, anemia, atrial fibrillation, history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hypothyroidism.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing confusion and disorientation, possibly due to infection, medication effects, and potential hypoxemia/hypercapnia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated in the emergency department for apnea and airway protection. She has a history of COPD and a persistent left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to medication effect. Sepsis is less likely, but further evaluation is needed.
4. Bandemia/left shift: The patient has an increased number of white blood cells, indicating a possible infection. The most likely sources are pulmonary versus line infection.
5. Bradycardia: The patient's slow heart rate is likely related to her use of metoprolol as an outpatient. It may also be due to sinus node dysfunction.
6. Anemia: The patient has a"

   pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  Patient took trazodone two days prior to admission,
   which has caused confusion in the past - appears to be hepatically
   cleared to active metabolite that is excreted in urine; patient
   anuric.  CT head without acute process.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn to treat pulmonary and potential line infection
   - Sputum, blood (peripheral and catheter), urine cultures pending; no
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile
   - Wean sedation as possible and hold other sedating medications
   - TSH, B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions.  History of
   COPD.  Chest x-ray with persistent left lower lobe infiltrate with
   potential new pneumonia.
   - Patient comfortable on AC and will continue
   - Wean FiO2 as possible
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   # Hypotension: Likely due to medication effect.  Sepsis less likely.
   - Wean sedation
   - Levophed for systolic < 100
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely sources are pulmonary versus line
   infection as above.  Urinalysis negative.  No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - Sputum, blood, urine cultures pending
   # Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - Renal aware
   - HD likely today
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s.  Drop from admission likely dilutional.  No
   signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - Continue epogen
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat in afternoon
   # Bradycardia: Improved - now heart rate in 60s-70s.  Patient on
   metoprolol as an outpatient.  Likely some component of sinus node
   dysfunction.  No signs or symptoms of ischemia but will rule out.
   - Two sets of cardiac enzymes negative
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus bradycardia; on coumadin.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Continue heparin gtt; holding coumadin for now
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - Continue heparin gtt; holding coumadin for now
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.
   - Check TSH as above
   - Continue levothyroxine

   pneumonia. Presents with altered mental status and respiratory failure
   in the setting of bandemia, hypothermia, and gram negative rods growing

   Unclear what the circumstances of intubation were but she has copious
   secretions now so likely premature to extubate. Wean fi02. Tolerating
   VC with little sedation so fine to stay with current settings. Mild

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a medical history of COPD, Wegener's granulomatosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and recent Moraxella pneumonia. She presented with altered mental status and respiratory failure, along with bandemia (low white blood cell count), hypothermia, and gram-negative rods growing on sputum culture. The altered mental status is likely due to an infection, possibly exacerbated by an accidental overdose of trazodone. The patient is currently intubated and receiving vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics. She has copious secretions, making premature extubation unlikely. The goal is to wean FiO2 and tolerate volume control with minimal sedation. Mild hypotension is present, which is likely secondary to decreased systemic vascular resistance due to infection. The patient requires low-dose levophed, especially during hemodialysis. Further plans will be determined based on the resident's note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to an ongoing infection, as indicated by bandemia and gram-negative rods on sputum culture. This could lead to sepsis and septic shock if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed. This can result in further deterioration of oxygenation and ventilation, potentially leading to"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a medical history of COPD, Wegener's granulomatosis, ESRD, and recent moraxella pneumonia. She presents with altered mental status and respiratory failure in the setting of bandemia, hypothermia. The altered mental status is most likely due to an infection but could also be a contribution from a recent accidental overdose of trazodone. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 81/36 mmHg to 104/39 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, hematocrit of 23.4%, platelet count of 281 K/uL, creatinine level of 6.3 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 119 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.03. Other lab values include prolonged PT/PTT/INR, elevated CK/CKMB, lactic acid level of 0.9 mmol/L, normal calcium and magnesium levels, and phosphorus level of 6.9 mg/dL.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's
   granulomatosis, recent admission [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic
   renal failure with initiation of HD at that time and hospital stay
   complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia readmitted with
   altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:  Much improved today and patient is alert and
   following commands.  Likely initially due to infection given
   presentation with bandemia, hypothermia.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary given recent moraxella pneumonia on
   zosyn/vanco.  Chest x-ray on presentation with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate which may represent new process versus incomplete
   resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Received influenza
   vaccination [**10/2131**], pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  CT head on presentation
   without acute process.
   - continue vanco/zosyn for HAP given recent admission and probable
   pulmonary source
   - f/u with micro lab re: ID on GNR in sputum
   - f/u outstanding blood and sputum cultures
   - Continue to limit sedation as able while intubated
   - TSH, B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions on presentation
   which have since lessened.  Underwent HD this morning with 3L off.
   Given mental status has markedly improved, goal to extubate today vs.
   tomorrow.
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   # Hypotension:  Remains on levophed, but titrating off.  Had increased
   pressor requirements yesterday in the setting of 2L off at HD
   transiently requiring addition of vasopressin to levophed.  Levophed
   turned up during HD session today, but now able to tolerate downward
   titration.  Given concern for infection as well, may have element of
   distributive hypotension although this seems to be less of a
   contributor.
   - Levophed for systolic < 100 given wide pulse pressures
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely source is pulmonary as above;
   blood/urine culture data negative to date.   No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - f/u outstanding sputum, blood  cultures pending
   - awaiting GNR identification in sputum
   # Chronic renal failure:  Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - continue HD
   - d/w renal goal for less negative given increased pressor requirements
   during HD sessions
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission; prior to
   that was in the low 30s.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding and
   has been guaiac negative thus far.
   - Continue epogen
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Bradycardia:  Currently normal rate.  Patient on metoprolol as an
   outpatient.
   - Hold metoprolol also in setting of hypotension
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Currently in sinus rhythm on coumadin as an
   outpatient; has been on heparin gtt here d/t h/o TIA previously while
   coumadin was held.  INR currently supratherapeutic, however so will
   hold heparin gtt.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Hold heparin gtt given INR supratherapeutic
   - continue to follow coags
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - INR supratherapeutic, but will need heparin gtt if drifts <2
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.  TSH 1.8 on this admission.
   - Continue levothyroxine

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 6908**]
s note, and would emphasize and add the following points:
   [**Age over 90 382**] year old woman with PMH COPD, Wegener's  (no current
   immunosuppresion) , ESRD, TIA, and recent Moroxella pneumonia, presents
   with altered mental status and respiratory failure due to probable
   pneumonia. This was in the setting of bandemia, hypothermia, and gram
   negative rods growing on sputum culture.
   Altered mental status most likely [**2-3**] infection but could also be
   contribution from recent accidental overdose of trazodone. Low level
   pressor requirement on sedation. ESRD on HD. Currently on vanc/zosyn.
   Acute respiratory failure appears to be improving. Will likely be able
   to extubate in AM.
   I updated patient
s daughter Sister [**Name (NI) **]. Rest of the plan as
   detailed above. Patient is critically ill. 30 minutes of critical care
   time spent with patient.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, recent admission
   [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic renal failure with decision to
   initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital stay complicated by
   left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia presenting with altered mental
   status.
   # Altered mental status: Likely due to infection with bandemia,
   hypothermia, hypotension - also with component of medication effect and
   potentially hypoxemia/hypercapnia at home.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary versus line.  Patient with recent increase in
   oxygen requirement and sputum production at home.  Chest x-ray with
   persistent left lower lobe infiltrate which may represent new process
   versus incomplete resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Recent
   admission for acute on chronic renal failure with tunnelled catheter
   placement at that time.  Received influenza vaccination [**10/2131**],
   pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  Patient took trazodone two days prior to admission,
   which has caused confusion in the past - appears to be hepatically
   cleared to active metabolite that is excreted in urine; patient
   anuric.  CT head without acute process.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn to treat pulmonary and potential line infection
   - Sputum, blood (peripheral and catheter), urine cultures pending; no
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile
   - Wean sedation as possible and hold other sedating medications
   - TSH, B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions.  History of
   COPD.  Chest x-ray with persistent left lower lobe infiltrate with
   potential new pneumonia.
   - Patient comfortable on AC and will continue
   - Wean FiO2 as possible
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   # Hypotension: Likely due to medication effect.  Sepsis less likely.
   - Wean sedation
   - Levophed for systolic < 100
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely sources are pulmonary versus line
   infection as above.  Urinalysis negative.  No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - Sputum, blood, urine cultures pending
   # Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - Renal aware
   - HD likely today
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s.  Drop from admission likely dilutional.  No
   signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - Continue epogen
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat in afternoon
   # Bradycardia: Improved - now heart rate in 60s-70s.  Patient on
   metoprolol as an outpatient.  Likely some component of sinus node
   dysfunction.  No signs or symptoms of ischemia but will rule out.
   - Two sets of cardiac enzymes negative
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus bradycardia; on coumadin.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Continue heparin gtt; holding coumadin for now
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - Continue heparin gtt; holding coumadin for now
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.
   - Check TSH as above
   - Continue levothyroxine

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Wegener's granulomatosis, and recent admission for acute on chronic renal failure. The patient was admitted with altered mental status, likely due to infection with bandemia, hypothermia, hypotension, medication effect, and potentially hypoxemia/hypercapnia at home. The most likely source of infection is pulmonary versus line infection.

The patient's current assessment includes respiratory failure, intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear etiology and for airway protection. She has a history of COPD and chest x-ray shows persistent left lower lobe infiltrate with potential new pneumonia.

The patient also has hypotension, likely due to medication effect. There is no evidence of sepsis. The patient is comfortable on AC (assisted ventilation) and will continue to be weaned off FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) as possible. Vancomycin and Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) are prescribed for pneumonia.

Additionally, the patient has bandemia/left shift, most likely sources being pulmonary versus line infection as mentioned above. Urinalysis is negative, and there is no diarrhea to suggest C. difficile or other gastrointestinal infection. Vancomycin, Zosyn, and sputum, blood, and urine cultures are pending.

The patient also has"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's
   granulomatosis, recent admission [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic
   renal failure with initiation of HD at that time and hospital stay
   complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia readmitted with
   altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:  Much improved today and patient is alert and
   following commands.  Likely initially due to infection given
   presentation with bandemia, hypothermia.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary given recent moraxella pneumonia on
   zosyn/vanco.  Chest x-ray on presentation with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate which may represent new process versus incomplete
   resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Received influenza
   vaccination [**10/2131**], pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  CT head on presentation
   without acute process.
   - continue vanco/zosyn for HAP given recent admission and probable
   pulmonary source
   - f/u with micro lab re: ID on GNR in sputum
   - f/u outstanding blood and sputum cultures
   - Continue to limit sedation as able while intubated
   - TSH, B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions on presentation
   which have since lessened.  Underwent HD this morning with 3L off.
   Given mental status has markedly improved, goal to extubate today vs.
   tomorrow.
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   # Hypotension:  Remains on levophed, but titrating off.  Had increased
   pressor requirements yesterday in the setting of 2L off at HD
   transiently requiring addition of vasopressin to levophed.  Levophed
   turned up during HD session today, but now able to tolerate downward
   titration.  Given concern for infection as well, may have element of
   distributive hypotension although this seems to be less of a
   contributor.
   - Levophed for systolic < 100 given wide pulse pressures
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely source is pulmonary as above;
   blood/urine culture data negative to date.   No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - f/u outstanding sputum, blood  cultures pending
   - awaiting GNR identification in sputum
   # Chronic renal failure:  Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - continue HD
   - d/w renal goal for less negative given increased pressor requirements
   during HD sessions
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission; prior to
   that was in the low 30s.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding and
   has been guaiac negative thus far.
   - Continue epogen
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Bradycardia:  Currently normal rate.  Patient on metoprolol as an
   outpatient.
   - Hold metoprolol also in setting of hypotension
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Currently in sinus rhythm on coumadin as an
   outpatient; has been on heparin gtt here d/t h/o TIA previously while
   coumadin was held.  INR currently supratherapeutic, however so will
   hold heparin gtt.
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   - Hold heparin gtt given INR supratherapeutic
   - continue to follow coags
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - INR supratherapeutic, but will need heparin gtt if drifts <2
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.  TSH 1.8 on this admission.
   - Continue levothyroxine
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: f/u nutrition recs for TFs while intubated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a past medical history of COPD, Wegener's granulomatosis, and chronic renal failure. She was admitted for acute on chronic renal failure and initiated on hemodialysis (HD). The patient presented with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and hypotension. She underwent HD this morning with 3L off and had increased pressor requirements yesterday. She is currently intubated for apnea of unclear etiology and airway protection. She has been on vancomycin and zosyn for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. Her mental status has improved, and she is alert and following commands.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Infection: The patient has a history of Moraxella pneumonia and is currently on vancomycin and zosyn for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. The presence of persistent left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray may indicate a new process or incomplete resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.
2. Hypotension: The patient remains on levophed, but titrating off. She had increased pressor requirements yesterday and transiently required the addition of vasopressin to levophed. There is concern for infection as well, which may contribute to hypotension.
3. Bandemia/Left Shift: The patient has bandemia with a left shift, likely due to pulmonary infection. Blood/urine culture data is negative to date,"

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's
   granulomatosis, recent admission [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic
   renal failure with initiation of HD at that time and hospital stay
   complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia readmitted with
   altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:  Much improved today and patient is alert and
   following commands.  Likely initially due to infection given
   presentation with bandemia, hypothermia.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary given recent moraxella pneumonia on
   zosyn/vanco.  Chest x-ray on presentation with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate which may represent new process versus incomplete
   resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Received influenza
   vaccination [**10/2131**], pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  CT head on presentation
   without acute process.
   - continue vanco/zosyn for HAP given recent admission and probable
   pulmonary source
   - f/u with micro lab re: ID on GNR in sputum
   - f/u outstanding blood and sputum cultures
   - Continue to limit sedation as able while intubated
   - TSH, B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions on presentation
   which have since lessened.  Underwent HD this morning with 3L off.
   Given mental status has markedly improved, goal to extubate today vs.
   tomorrow.
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   # Hypotension:  Remains on levophed, but titrating off.  Had increased
   pressor requirements yesterday in the setting of 2L off at HD
   transiently requiring addition of vasopressin to levophed.  Levophed
   turned up during HD session today, but now able to tolerate downward
   titration.  Given concern for infection as well, may have element of
   distributive hypotension although this seems to be less of a
   contributor.
   - Levophed for systolic < 100 given wide pulse pressures
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Coagulopathy:  INR continues to climb despite having been off
   coumadin and heparin stopped yesterday.  Patient has been NPO since
   admission and suspect at least in part due to nutritional deficiency.
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely source is pulmonary as above;
   blood/urine culture data negative to date.   No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - f/u outstanding sputum, blood  cultures pending
   - awaiting GNR identification in sputum
   # Chronic renal failure:  Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - continue HD
   - d/w renal goal for less negative given increased pressor requirements
   during HD sessions
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission; prior to
   that was in the low 30s.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding and

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 92-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, Wegener's granulomatosis, and chronic renal failure secondary to ANCA vasculitis. She was admitted to the ICU for acute on chronic renal failure and initiated on hemodialysis. The patient presented with altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypotension, coagulopathy, bandemia, and a left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia.

Assessment/Plan:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved today, and she is alert and following commands. The most likely source of infection is pulmonary, given recent Moraxella pneumonia. Chest x-ray showed a persistent left lower lobe infiltrate, which may represent a new process or incomplete resolution of prior pneumonia. The patient will continue on vancomycin and Zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Follow-up with microbiology regarding identification of Gram-negative rods in sputum is pending.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated in the emergency department for apnea of unclear etiology and airway protection. Secretions have since lessened. The patient underwent hemodialysis this morning with 3 liters off. Given the improvement in mental status, the goal is to extubate today or tomorrow.
3. Hypotension: The patient remains on levophed but is tolerating downward titration. Pressor requirements increased yesterday during hemodialysis,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, chronic renal failure, and altered mental status. He has been extubated successfully and is now on supplemental oxygen. The patient's blood pressure has remained stable off levophed, and heparin has been discontinued due to a supratherapeutic INR. The patient's allergies include sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, amiodarone, quinine, codeine, azithromycin, lisinopril, citalopram, ciprofloxacin, and hydralazine. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, except for slightly elevated blood pressure. He is receiving various medications and infusions in the ICU. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of nausea and vomiting. The patient's flow sheet data shows stable vital signs, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, which is likely contributing to his current renal failure. The patient's pneumonia is hospital-acquired and non-ventilator-associated. The patient's altered mental status is not delirium. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's care in the ICU includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's
   granulomatosis, recent admission [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic
   renal failure with initiation of HD at that time and hospital stay
   complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia readmitted with
   altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:  Much improved today and patient is alert and
   following commands.  Likely initially due to infection given
   presentation with bandemia, hypothermia.  Most likely source of
   infection is pulmonary given recent moraxella pneumonia on
   zosyn/vanco.  Chest x-ray on presentation with persistent left lower
   lobe infiltrate which may represent new process versus incomplete
   resolution of prior Moraxella pneumonia.  Received influenza
   vaccination [**10/2131**], pneumovax 10/[**2118**].  CT head on presentation
   without acute process.
   - continue vanco/zosyn for HAP given recent admission and probable
   pulmonary source
   - f/u with micro lab re: ID on GNR in sputum
   - f/u outstanding blood and sputum cultures
   - Continue to limit sedation as able while intubated
   - TSH, B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions on presentation
   which have since lessened.  Underwent HD this morning with 3L off.
   Given mental status has markedly improved, goal to extubate today vs.
   tomorrow.
   - Vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia
   - Combivent inhalers Q4H with albuterol Q2H:PRN
   # Hypotension:  Remains on levophed, but titrating off.  Had increased
   pressor requirements yesterday in the setting of 2L off at HD
   transiently requiring addition of vasopressin to levophed.  Levophed
   turned up during HD session today, but now able to tolerate downward
   titration.  Given concern for infection as well, may have element of
   distributive hypotension although this seems to be less of a
   contributor.
   - Levophed for systolic < 100 given wide pulse pressures
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Coagulopathy:  INR continues to climb despite having been off
   coumadin and heparin stopped yesterday.  Patient has been NPO since
   admission and suspect at least in part due to nutritional deficiency.
   # Bandemia/left shift: Most likely source is pulmonary as above;
   blood/urine culture data negative to date.   No diarrhea to suggest C.
   difficile or other gastrointestinal infection.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia
   - f/u outstanding sputum, blood  cultures pending
   - awaiting GNR identification in sputum
   # Chronic renal failure:  Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - continue HD
   - d/w renal goal for less negative given increased pressor requirements
   during HD sessions

   Disposition:  ICU given intubated and remains on pressors.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of COPD, Wegener's granulomatosis, and chronic renal failure secondary to ANCA vasculitis. The patient presented with altered mental status, respiratory failure requiring intubation, hypotension, coagulopathy, bandemia, and chronic renal failure. The patient was admitted with acute on chronic renal failure and initiation of hemodialysis (HD) at that time. She also had a recent admission for Moraxella pneumonia and was readmitted with altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 151/47 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is currently extubated and tolerating oral intake.

The patient has multiple medical complications that require ongoing management. These include:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved significantly, likely due to treatment of infection. She is alert and following commands. The source of infection is suspected to be pulmonary, given recent Moraxella pneumonia and persistent left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for apnea of unclear etiology and airway protection. Secretions have lessened, and the goal is to extubate the patient today or tomorrow.

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's
   granulomatosis, recent admission [**Date range (1) 7130**] for acute on chronic
   renal failure with initiation of HD at that time and hospital stay
   complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia readmitted with
   altered mental status.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the ED for apnea of unclear
   etiology and for airway protection.  Copious secretions on presentation
   which have since significantly lessened.  Successfully extubated on
   [**12-25**] and maintaining O2 sats on O2 via NC without e/o respiratory
   distress.  Sputum culture from [**2131-12-24**] is again growing Moraxella, no
   other new organisms.  Still with same infiltrate on chest imaging so ?
   inadequately treated previously with cefpodoxime (although should be
   sensitive and responsive to this) vs. consideration of colonization or
   endobronchial lesion with postobstructive pneumonia.  Not bronched
   while intubated to eval this further.
   -d/c vanco/zosyn as culture showing moraxella only
   -starting ceftriaxone as moraxella should be sensitive
   -will need repeat imaging as outpatient to assess for resolution of
   infiltrate as if persists despite appropriate rx, may need to pursue
   further eval with bronch to r/o endobronchial lesion
   # Altered mental status:  Much improved following extubation and
   intermittently confused although alert and oriented to person, place,
   time as [**Month (only) 102**] (not year).  Likely delirium in the setting of
   infection, sedating meds, ICU stay especially in setting of advanced
   age.   Was worse on presentation also after having taken unclear amount
   of trazadone.  CT head on presentation without acute process.  TSH,
   B12, RPR - normal/non-reactive
   - starting ctx for moraxella
   - limit sedating meds
   - frequent reorientation
   # Hypotension:  Currently normotensive off pressors.  Was worse in the
   setting of HD, however tolerated HD better yesterday and has been off
   levophed.   Given concern for infection as well, may have element of
   distributive hypotension although this seems to be less of a
   contributor.
   - off levophed
   - Hold metoprolol for now, but can restart  pending stability in BPs
   # Coagulopathy:  INR continues to climb despite having been off
   coumadin and heparin stopped yesterday.  Patient has been NPO since
   admission and suspect at least in part due to nutritional deficiency,
   but also in the setting of antibiotic effect.  No signs of active
   bleeding.  Does have h/o TIA in setting of a.fib and subtherapeutic INR
   so would be less inclined to reverse at this time.
   - continue off heparin and coumadin
   - continue to monitor coags and consider vit K if continues to rise
   # Chronic renal failure:  Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  Decision made
   to initiate HD last admission.
   - continue HD; will not get on [**12-27**], but will then resume on Friday
   - Monitor potassium; no kayexalate for K < 6.0 per renal
   - Continue epogen, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium
   # Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission; prior to
   that was in the low 30s.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding and
   has been guaiac negative thus far.  Has been slightly lower than most
   recent baseline in the low 20s, but stable there x >24h.
   - Continue epogen
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   - pm hct
   # Bradycardia:  Resolved and currently normal rate.  Patient on
   metoprolol as an outpatient.
   - Hold metoprolol also in setting of recent hypotension although can
   likely restart pending stability in BP
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Currently in sinus rhythm on coumadin as an
   outpatient; has been on heparin gtt here d/t h/o TIA previously while
   coumadin was held.  INR currently supratherapeutic, however so holding
   heparin gtt.
   - Hold metoprolol for now as above
   - Hold heparin gtt given INR supratherapeutic
   - continue to follow coags
   # History of transient ischemic attack: Notes state the patient had a
   TIA which occurred when coumadin held during a previous admission.
   - INR supratherapeutic, but will need heparin gtt if drifts <2
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.  TSH 1.8 on this admission.
   - Continue levothyroxine

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of COPD, Wegener's granulomatosis, and chronic renal failure secondary to ANCA vasculitis. She was admitted for acute on chronic renal failure and initiation of HD. During her stay, she developed respiratory failure requiring intubation in the ED due to apnea of unclear etiology and for airway protection. She was successfully extubated on 12/25 and is maintaining O2 saturation on O2 via NC without respiratory distress. 

She has an altered mental status, likely delirium in the setting of infection, sedating medications, ICU stay, and advanced age. Her hypotension resolved and she is currently normotensive off pressors. She also has a coagulopathy with an INR that continues to climb despite being off coumadin and heparin stopped yesterday. 

Her chronic renal failure is due to ANCA vasculitis, and she is on maintenance HD. She also has anemia, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include: 
1. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience difficulty breathing or develop pneumonia due to the ongoing Moraxella infection.
2. Altered mental status: The patient may become more confused or develop worsening delirium due to ongoing infection, sedating medications, or advanced age.
3. Hypotension: The patient may experience low"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 382**] year old woman presents with dyspnea and altered mental status in
   the setting of new pneumonia. Growing moraxella. Will narrow
   antibiotics to just levofloxacin today. Extubated without incident.
   Will need follow up imaging to ensure resolution of LLL infiltrate.
   Elevated INR with no signs of bleeding. Confusion likely related to
   recent sedation in context of renal failure and advanced age. ESRD, got
   HD yesterday. Renal to decide for plans to dialyse today or [**12-28**]. Okay
   to transfer to the floor. Further plans as per resident note.

","The patient is a 92-year-old woman who presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonia. She has been extubated and is currently on supplemental oxygen. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 149/43 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is still receiving respiratory support through a ventilator.

The patient has a history of multiple allergies, including reactions to medications such as amiodarone, quinine, codeine, lisinopril, citalopram, ciprofloxacin, and hydralazine. She was receiving antibiotics until yesterday, when they were discontinued.

Her flow sheet data shows that she has received a total of 792 mL of fluids over the past 24 hours, with an output of 3,015 mL of urine and 409 mL of stool. Her respiratory support includes a tidal volume set at 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O.

Her laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.6 K/uL and a decreased hemoglobin (Hct) level of 22.6%. Her platelet count is within normal range at 73 K/u"

","The patient is a 90-year-old woman presenting with hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated on mechanical ventilation. She has a history of multiple allergies, including medications such as amiodarone, codeine, ciprofloxacin, and lisinopril. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 149/43 mmHg and a heart rate of 67 bpm. She is still experiencing bronchial breath sounds on the left base.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 273 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels of 6.3 mg/dL, and slightly elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 101 to 133 mg/dL. Other lab values, including troponin-T, TCO2, and electrolytes, are within normal ranges.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. She has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The plan is to narrow antibiotics to just levofloxacin.
