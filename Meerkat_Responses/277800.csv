   Assessment and Plan
   89yo male with history of CVA in [**2143**] with disordered breathing, T2DM
   was admitted with recurrent chest pain after previous admission 2 weeks
   ago with 3 vessel disease s/p DES to RCA and found to have stent
   thrombosis.
   1. Chest Pain
   Patient found to have stent thrombosis and taken emergently to the cath
   lab where he underwent export of thrombus and POBA.
   - continue aspirin and plavix
   - restart lisinopril once weaned off dopamine.
   - trend CK to peak
   2. Shock
   Patient was continued on dopamine overnight, likely related to
   myocardial stunning.
   - try to wean dopamine as tolerated for goal MAP of 60
   - re-echo on discharge.
   3. Atrial Fibrillation
   New finding of atrial fibrillation, likely post resuscitation and
   related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine.
   - try to wean dopamine and see if atrial fibrillation converts
   - if he doesn't auto-convert, will do cardioversion while in unit.
   4. Hypoxia
   Pt has history of disordered breathing following stroke (usually on
   CPAP) and also has evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on
   Chest CT. Appears euvolemic.
   - continue Flovent 220 [**Hospital1 7**], and spiriva.
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Pt will follow up with Pulmonary ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4305**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2721**]) as outpatient, eval
   for home O2
   6. History of CVA
   Patient has had a stroke in the past, unclear if this was related to a
   previous episode of atrial fibrillation. His stroke has caused complex
   disordered breathing - pt has refused further treatment with CPAP or
   home O2 as outpatient
   - continue plavix
   7. HTN -
   - restart lisinopril and metoprolol once BP improves
   8. Type 2 diabetes - hold metformin while in house, continue insulin
   SS
   .
   9. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of stroke, disordered breathing, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted with recurrent chest pain after a previous admission two weeks ago, where he underwent a procedure for stent thrombosis. 

The patient underwent emergent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with export of thrombus and plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA). He was started on aspirin and Plavix for anticoagulation and will have his CK levels trended to peak. 

The patient was also found to be in shock, likely related to myocardial stunning, and continued on dopamine overnight. The plan is to wean off dopamine as tolerated for a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 and perform an echocardiogram on discharge. 

Additionally, the patient developed new-onset atrial fibrillation, likely post-resuscitation and related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine. The plan is to wean off dopamine and see if the atrial fibrillation converts, and if not, perform cardioversion while in the unit. 

The patient has a history of disordered breathing following his stroke and also has evidence of progression of emphysema and interstitial lung disease (ILD) on chest CT. He appears euvolemic, so oxygen therapy will be continued via nasal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of CVA and T2DM, who was admitted with recurrent chest pain after a previous admission two weeks ago due to stent thrombosis. The patient underwent emergent coronary intervention in the cath lab, including export of thrombus and POBA. 

On admission, the patient was found to have atrial fibrillation, likely post-resuscitation and related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine. The patient also had hypoxia, likely due to disordered breathing following the stroke and progression of emphysema and ILD on Chest CT. The patient is euvolemic, and oxygen therapy has been continued to maintain a saturation level above 88%. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 93/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation support. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin T levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   89yo male with history of CVA in [**2143**] with disordered breathing, T2DM
   was admitted with recurrent chest pain after previous admission 2 weeks
   ago with 3 vessel disease s/p DES to RCA and found to have stent
   thrombosis.
   1. Chest Pain
   Patient found to have stent thrombosis and taken emergently to the cath
   lab where he underwent export of thrombus and POBA.
   - continue aspirin and plavix
   - restart lisinopril once weaned off dopamine.
   - trend CK to peak
   2. Shock
   Patient was continued on dopamine overnight, likely related to
   myocardial stunning.
   - try to wean dopamine as tolerated for goal MAP of 60
   - re-echo on discharge.
   3. Atrial Fibrillation
   New finding of atrial fibrillation, likely post resuscitation and
   related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine.
   - try to wean dopamine and see if atrial fibrillation converts
   - if he doesn't auto-convert, will do cardioversion while in unit.
   4. Hypoxia
   Pt has history of disordered breathing following stroke (usually on
   CPAP) and also has evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on
   Chest CT. Appears euvolemic.
   - continue Flovent 220 [**Hospital1 7**], and spiriva.
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Pt will follow up with Pulmonary ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4305**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2721**]) as outpatient, eval
   for home O2
   6. History of CVA
   Patient has had a stroke in the past, unclear if this was related to a
   previous episode of atrial fibrillation. His stroke has caused complex
   disordered breathing - pt has refused further treatment with CPAP or
   home O2 as outpatient
   - continue plavix
   7. HTN -
   - restart lisinopril and metoprolol once BP improves
   8. Type 2 diabetes - hold metformin while in house, continue insulin
   SS
   .
   9. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and coronary artery disease who was admitted for recurrent chest pain. He underwent an emergency procedure to export thrombus and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) due to stent thrombosis. The patient experienced cardioversion/defibrillation, weaning off dopamine, increased Plavix to 150mg PO daily, and increased anticoagulation with heparin. He is currently in the ICU with ongoing monitoring and treatment for various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chest Pain: The patient's recurrent chest pain suggests ongoing myocardial ischemia or possible restenosis of the stent. Close monitoring of cardiac enzymes and symptoms is necessary.
2. Shock: The patient may be at risk of shock due to myocardial stunning following the recent myocardial infarction. Monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and fluid balance is crucial.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The new finding of atrial fibrillation could be related to the recent resuscitation efforts and medication administration. Conversion to sinus rhythm should be considered, and anticoagulation should be maintained.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's history of disordered breathing and evidence of progression of emphysema and interstitial lung disease (ILD) on chest CT suggest a predisposition to hypoxia."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous stent placement, type 2 diabetes, and a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He presented with recurrent chest pain and was found to have stent thrombosis. The patient underwent emergent catheterization and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with export of thrombus.

The patient was started on aspirin, high-dose Plavix, and a beta-blocker. He was also given lisinopril once he was weaned off dopamine. The patient's blood pressure has improved, and he is now in sinus rhythm after cardioversion for atrial fibrillation.

The patient has a history of disordered breathing following his stroke, which is likely related to his emphysema and interstitial lung disease (ILD). He is currently on Flovent 220 and Spiriva for his respiratory issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chest pain and stent thrombosis: The patient's recurrent chest pain and stent thrombosis indicate a potential complication related to coronary artery disease. Continued monitoring and management with antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, and possible anticoagulation will be necessary.
2. Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and use of dopamine suggest a state of shock. The improvement in blood pressure off dopamine indicates that the shock may have resolved.
3. Atrial fibrillation:"

   Assessment and Plan
   89yo male with history of CVA in [**2143**] with disordered breathing, T2DM
   was admitted with recurrent chest pain after previous admission 2 weeks
   ago with 3 vessel disease s/p DES to RCA and found to have stent
   thrombosis.
   1. Chest Pain
   Patient found to have stent thrombosis and taken emergently to the cath
   lab where he underwent export of thrombus and POBA.
   - continue aspirin and plavix
   - restart lisinopril once weaned off dopamine.
   - trend CK to peak
   2. Shock
   Patient was continued on dopamine overnight, likely related to
   myocardial stunning.
   - try to wean dopamine as tolerated for goal MAP of 60
   - re-echo on discharge.
   3. Atrial Fibrillation
   New finding of atrial fibrillation, likely post resuscitation and
   related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine.
   - try to wean dopamine and see if atrial fibrillation converts
   - if he doesn't auto-convert, will do cardioversion while in unit.
   4. Hypoxia
   Pt has history of disordered breathing following stroke (usually on
   CPAP) and also has evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on
   Chest CT. Appears euvolemic.
   - continue Flovent 220 [**Hospital1 7**], and spiriva.
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Pt will follow up with Pulmonary ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4305**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2721**]) as outpatient, eval
   for home O2
   6. History of CVA
   Patient has had a stroke in the past, unclear if this was related to a
   previous episode of atrial fibrillation. His stroke has caused complex
   disordered breathing - pt has refused further treatment with CPAP or
   home O2 as outpatient
   - continue plavix
   7. HTN -
   - restart lisinopril and metoprolol once BP improves
   8. Type 2 diabetes - hold metformin while in house, continue insulin
   SS
   .
   9. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of CVA, disordered breathing, T2DM, and chest pain. He was admitted with recurrent chest pain after a previous admission two weeks ago due to stent thrombosis. The patient underwent export of thrombus and POBA in the cath lab. He is currently in the ICU for shock, atrial fibrillation, hypoxia, history of CVA, and hypertension.

Potential medical complications:
1. Chest Pain: The patient has a history of chest pain and recent stent thrombosis. There is a risk of recurrent chest pain or myocardial infarction.
2. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock likely related to myocardial stunning. There is a risk of further deterioration in organ perfusion and function.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
4. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of disordered breathing following stroke and evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on Chest CT. There is a risk of worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure.
5. History of CVA: The patient has had a stroke in the past, and there is a risk of recurrence or progression of neurological deficits.
6. HTN: The patient has hypertension, and there is a risk of uncontrolled blood pressure leading to further end-organ damage.
7. Type 2 Diabetes: The patient has diabetes, and there is a risk of poorly controlled blood sugar levels leading to diabetic complications.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, and there is a risk of worsening symptoms if not properly managed.

These are potential medical complications that could arise based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important to closely monitor and manage these conditions to prevent complications and improve the patient's outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   89yo male with history of CAD s/p stent placement (DES to RCA in [**2-14**]),
   T2DM, and CVA in [**2143**] with disordered breathing  was admitted with
   recurrent chest pain admission and found to have stent thrombosis.
   1. Chest Pain
   Patient found to have stent thrombosis and taken emergently to the cath
   lab where he underwent export of thrombus and POBA.
   - continue aspirin, high dose plavix, and beta blocker
   - restart lisinopril once weaned off dopamine.
   2. Shock
   Patient
s BP has now improved off dopamine and now back in sinus
   rhythm.
   3. Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient developed new finding of atrial fibrillation, likely post
   resuscitation and related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine. He
   has remained in sinus rhythm after cardioversion on [**2146-3-14**].
   - continue telemetry
   4. Hypoxia
   Pt has history of disordered breathing following stroke (usually on
   CPAP) and also has evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on
   Chest CT. Appears euvolemic.
   - continue Flovent 220 [**Hospital1 7**], and spiriva.
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Pt will follow up with Pulmonary ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4305**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2721**]) as outpatient, eval
   for home O2
   5. History of CVA
   Patient has had a stroke in the past, unclear if this was related to a
   previous episode of atrial fibrillation. His stroke has caused complex
   disordered breathing - pt has refused further treatment with CPAP or
   home O2 as outpatient

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, stent placement, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with recurrent chest pain and found to have stent thrombosis. The patient underwent emergency catheterization and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. He is currently in the ICU.

24-hour events include cardioversion/defibrillation, weaning off dopamine, increasing Plavix dosage, and consideration of anticoagulation. The patient denies chest pain or shortness of breath but reports chest wall pain and cough. His allergies include allopurinol, thrombocytopenia, cimetidine, and hepatic toxicity. He is currently receiving propofol, hydromorphone, and heparin sodium.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for chest wall pain. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/62 to 75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress, sitting up in bed. The patient has a blowing holosystolic murmur radiating to the apex, pale conjunctiva, and ecchymoses in the right groin"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, stent placement, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with recurrent chest pain and found to have stent thrombosis. The patient underwent emergency thrombus export and percutaneous orbital athectomy (POBA). He has been on aspirin, high-dose Plavix, and beta-blocker therapy. The patient developed shock, which has now improved, and was in atrial fibrillation but converted back to sinus rhythm after cardioversion. He also has a history of disordered breathing following his CVA and evidence of progression of emphysema and interstitial lung disease (ILD) on chest CT. The patient's current medications include Flovent 220, Spiriva, and oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 88%. He is euvolemic. The patient's medical complications include stent thrombosis, shock, atrial fibrillation, hypoxia, history of CVA, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hypothyroidism. He will be transferred to the CCU for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stent thrombosis: The patient had a stent thrombosis, which led to his current admission. It is crucial to continue antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and Plavix to prevent further thrombotic events.
2. Shock: The patient experienced shock, which is a critical condition that can lead to organ failure. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and timely intervention are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of clot formation and embolic events. Telemetry monitoring should be continued to detect any recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
4. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of disordered breathing and evidence of lung disease progression. Oxygen therapy via nasal cannula will be continued to maintain adequate oxygenation. Further evaluation for home oxygen therapy may be required.
5. History of CVA: The patient has had a previous stroke, which can predispose him to further cerebrovascular events. Continued use of Plavix, blood pressure control, and glycemic control are important to reduce the risk of another stroke.
6. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and it is essential to continue ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker therapy to control blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular risks.
7. Type 2 diabetes: The patient has type 2 diabetes, and insulin therapy should be continued to maintain glycemic control. Metformin should be withheld while the patient is in the hospital.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be continued to maintain thyroid function.
9. Potential ICU complications: The patient is in the ICU, where he is at risk for infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and stress ulcers. Prophylactic measures like stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP precautions should be implemented."

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who was admitted to the ICU due to a myocardial infarction (MI). The patient has been experiencing worsening left ventricular systolic dysfunction, as evidenced by the transthoracic echo showing a decrease in ejection fraction from 60% to 50%. The patient also has mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid-inferior/inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis. There is no pericardial effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and was admitted with an MI. It is important to monitor the patient's cardiac function and provide appropriate treatment to prevent further complications.

2. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): The patient is at risk for ILD, including pulmonary fibrosis, non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP). Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and lung function is necessary.

3. Knowledge Deficit: The patient has a knowledge deficit regarding pain control, which should be addressed to ensure effective management of both acute and chronic pain.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's history of CAD puts him at risk for future cardiac events. Continuous monitoring and optimization of cardiac care are essential to prevent complications.

   [**3-15**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular
   cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with basal to mid inferior/inferolateral
   akinesis/hypokinesis. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
   normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are moderately thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
   valve chordae. Mild to moderate ([**1-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-3-3**], the
   inferior/inferolateral regional wall motion abnormalities are now more
   severe. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower.
   Mitral regurgitation is now less prominent.

   for home O2
   5. History of CVA
   Patient has had a stroke in the past, unclear if this was related to a
   previous episode of atrial fibrillation. His stroke has caused complex

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous stroke, type 2 diabetes, and hypothyroidism. He presented with recurrent chest pain and was found to have stent thrombosis in the right coronary artery. He underwent emergent cardiac catheterization and stent placement but experienced another episode of stent thrombosis. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has signs of poor cardiac output, including hypotension and cool extremities. This could be due to the recent myocardial infarction and compromised blood flow to vital organs.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation, which is likely related to the stress of the initial myocardial infarction and subsequent medical interventions. It is causing a rapid and irregular heartbeat and may contribute to hypotension.
3. Stent thrombosis: Despite receiving a stent, the patient experienced another episode of stent thrombosis. This indicates a potential issue with antiplatelet therapy or resistance to Plavix.
4. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of emphysema and ILD, which can contribute to impaired oxygenation. His current oxygen saturation is 93% on nasal cannula, indicating some degree of hypoxia.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped by 5 points"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous stroke, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and disordered breathing following a stroke. He was admitted with recurrent chest pain and found to have stent thrombosis in the right coronary artery. He underwent emergent cardiac catheterization and stent placement. 

The patient developed atrial fibrillation post-resuscitation and was initially controlled with cardioversion, but later became unresponsive and bradycardic. He was given dopamine and levophed, and his blood pressure improved. He then underwent another cardioversion attempt but remained in atrial fibrillation. 

The patient's blood hemoglobin concentration dropped significantly after the cardiac catheterization, indicating anemia. He also had guaiac-positive stool, which may suggest gastrointestinal bleeding. 

He developed a new cardiac rub, which could be indicative of post-myocardial infarction pericarditis. 

The patient's hypoxia improved, and he is now on minimal oxygen. He has a history of disordered breathing following a stroke and evidence of progression of emphysema and interstitial lung disease on chest CT. 

He has a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and is currently on multiple medications for these conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient's blood pressure was initially unstable"

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrent stent thrombosis: Given the patient's history of stent thrombosis and ongoing anticoagulation therapy, there is a risk of recurrent thrombotic events.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, and there is a possibility of further arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
3. Heart failure: The patient's ejection fraction may be compromised due to the recent myocardial infarction, leading to heart failure symptoms.
4. Pulmonary complications: The patient has a history of disordered breathing and evidence of emphysema and interstitial lung disease. These underlying lung conditions may lead to respiratory infections or exacerbation of symptoms.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the information:

- The patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) with varying heart rates.
- There were instances of bradycardia, where the heart rate dropped to 40-50 beats per minute.
- The patient's blood pressure was consistently low, ranging from 78/43 mmHg to 109/62 mmHg.
- The patient had a new onset of STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) in leads II, III, and aVF.
- The patient received dopamine and norepinephrine infusions to maintain blood pressure.
- The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and had another occlusion in the right coronary artery (RCA), for which another bare metal stent (BMS) was placed.
- The patient tested positive for occult blood in stool and is being tested for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.
- The patient has allergies to allopurinol, thrombocytopenia, cimetidine, and hepatic toxicity related to pioglitazone.
- The patient's vital signs show a fever, low body temperature, fast heart rate, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation at 93%.
- The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 2,353 mL with output of 393 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,960 mL.
- The patient is on respiratory support with nasal cannula and has an ABG showing a pH of 7.44.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and troponin-T levels.
- The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, interstitial lung disease, pain control, coronary artery disease, and knowledge deficit.
- The patient is receiving ICU care including nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
- The patient's code status is full code, and there is no mention of their disposition.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, ongoing atrial fibrillation, and new-onset STEMI. There is a risk of further cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or recurrent myocardial infarction.

2. Respiratory complications: The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or other respiratory infections due to the invasive nature of mechanical ventilation.

3. Infection: The patient has a positive guaiac test indicating occult blood in stool, and a test is being conducted for C. diff infection. Additionally, the patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection.

4. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests impaired renal function. There is a risk of worsening renal failure or the need for renal replacement therapy.

5. Bleeding complications: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially considering the use of anticoagulants like heparin.

6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's positive guaiac test and symptoms may suggest gastrointestinal bleeding or other gastrointestinal complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and take appropriate measures to manage and prevent these potential complications."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who was admitted to the ICU for an acute myocardial infarction. The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with episodes of atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, hypotension, and acute kidney injury. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and received stenting of the right coronary artery. Despite these interventions, the patient remains hypotensive and in atrial fibrillation. The patient's lab results show elevated troponin T levels, indicative of ongoing myocardial injury. The patient also has abnormal liver function tests and elevated lactic acid levels. 

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's persistent hypotension and signs of ongoing myocardial injury suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock. This is a serious condition that occurs when the heart fails to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a poor urine output throughout the day, which is a sign of AKI. This condition can occur due to hypotension and decreased renal perfusion.

3. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating potential hepatic dysfunction. This could be related to the patient's underlying coronary artery disease or other factors.

4. Infectious complications: The patient has a positive guaiac-positive stool, which raises"

   -patient had poor UO throughout day, gave increments of boluses up
   until 1L, around 6pm he went into Afib and Hr ~100 and hypotensive to
   SBP.  He was doing that for about 2 hours and then bradyed and was
   unresponsive for minutes. BS 172, HR to the 40-50s.  New junctional
   rhythm. Fellow called and patient looked crappy. EKG with new STE in
   II,III, AvF, put on dopamine max at 10 and levophed with SBP no higher
   than 80s. Taken to cath. Had new RCA occlusion, 1 more BMS.
   -still hypotensive after and in Afib, given 500cc bolus
   -had guaic pos stool, sent for Cdiff

   with recurrent chest pain admission and found to have stent thrombosis.
   #RCA STEMI: New RCA infarct overnight, s/p cath and stent to RCA
   -post cath check at noon
   #. Chest Pain
   Patient found to have stent thrombosis and taken emergently to the cath
   lab where he underwent export of thrombus and POBA.
   - continue aspirin, high dose plavix, and beta blocker
   - restarted lisinopril

   has remained in sinus rhythm after cardioversion on [**2146-3-14**].
   - continue telemetry
   4. Hypoxia.  Improved.  On minimal oxygen.
   Pt has history of disordered breathing following stroke (usually on
   CPAP) and also has evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on
   Chest CT. Appears euvolemic.
   - continue Flovent 220 [**Hospital1 7**], and spiriva.
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%

   for home O2
   5. History of CVA
   Patient has had a stroke in the past, unclear if this was related to a
   previous episode of atrial fibrillation. His stroke has caused complex
   disordered breathing - pt has refused further treatment with CPAP or
   home O2 as outpatient
   - continue plavix

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous stroke, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted with recurrent chest pain and found to have stent thrombosis. The patient underwent emergent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous intervention. He developed new findings of atrial fibrillation, likely post-resuscitation, and was cardioverted back to sinus rhythm.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in vital signs, including hypotension and bradycardia. He required dopamine and norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure. The patient also had a significant rise in troponin levels, indicating myocardial injury.

The patient has a history of disordered breathing following a stroke and has evidence of progression of emphysema and interstitial lung disease on chest CT. He is currently on minimal oxygen support.

The patient's medical complications include atrial fibrillation, hypoxia, shock, and a cardiac rub. The rub is likely due to post-myocardial infarction pericarditis or contained right ventricular rupture. The patient is being monitored closely for these conditions.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, high-dose Plavix, beta-blocker, lisinopril, Flovent, Spiriva, and insulin for glycemic control.

Disposition: The patient will be transferred to the CCU for further management."
