   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo female with history of CKD, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy EF
   50-55%, hypothyroidism, hypertension, PAD, DM admitted for hypothermia
   and hypoxia.
   .
 HYPOXEMIA:  The patient has evidence of new bilateral pleural
   effusions compared to CXR on [**2187-11-4**].  Differential includes
   parapneumonic effusion, flu or other viral illness, worsening heart
   failure or least likely PE.  The patient does not have a convincing
   history for pneumonia, especially considering lack of leukocytosis and
   sputum production.  The patient has history of dilated cardiomyopathy
   with most recent echo in [**2-19**] demonstrating preserved EF of 50-55%.
   However, today's CXR shows cardiomegaly and CEs mildly elevated (though
   this is at her baseline) and no ECG changes.  Least likely to be PE,
   however will rule out with LENIs in AM.  Will treat empirically for
   HAP, rule out flu and maintain even fluid balance to treat both
   potential etiologies with further workup in AM.
   - CE slightly elevated but at pt
s baseline x 2
   - will get PA and Lat CXR to better evaluate for consolidation and
   size/symmetry of effusions
   - consider diagnostic thoracentesis this AM
   - Supplemental O2 PRN
   - TTE in AM to determine systolic function
   - LENIS in AM
   - Empiric antibiotics with vancomycin/zosyn/levofloxacin; will narrow
   as appropriate
   - will recheck vanc trough at noon
   - gentle diuresis today with goal 500-1L neg
   - Droplet precautions, tamiflu until DFA returns
   .
 HYPOTHERMIA:  The patient was markedly hypothermic on admission
   without history of exposure, confirmed with patient and her HCP.  The
   patient's hypothermia may be secondary to systemic stress in the
   setting of multiple comorbidities including hypothyroidism, however TSH
   and cortisol within normal limits.  Cannot exclude overwhelming
   infection as cause of hypothermia, however less likely given lack of
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, or hypotension.  However, will treat
   empirically for pulmonary and skin source of infection until blood
   cultures return negative.
   - Empiric antibiotics of vanc/levo/zosyn for nosocomial infection as
   above
   - F/U culture data
   - Continue home dose of levothyroxine
   - Continue to rewarm
   .
   #.  Sinus Bradycardia:  Likely secondary to the patient's home CCB and
   betablocker dosing given recent visit to outpatient cardiologist HR was
   also in the 50s.
   - will restart carvedilol this am, and amlodopine in PM if remains
   stable
   .
   #.  Non-gap metabolic acidosis:  Most likely secondary to patient's
   chronic renal failure, although mildly worse than baseline.  Will
   continue to monitor and replete bicarb as needed.
   .
   #.  Chronic Kidney Disease:  The patient's current renal function is at
   baseline, but very elevated.  Renal has been consulted in the past for
   evaluation, thought to be secondary to diabetic nephropathy worsened by
   contrast induced nephropathy.  The patient continues to have
   nephropathy, but no factors that would require emergent dialysis.  She
   was to follow up with renal as an outpatient, but will consult tomorrow
   for further evaluation/expedited workup and/or preparation for renal
   replacement therapy.
   - Renal consult requested; will f/u recs
   .
   #.  PAD:  The patient's site does not appear to be infected, and
   appears to be healing appropriately.  Will contact the patient's
   primary vascular surgeon this AM for evaluation.  Continue home regimen
   of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 119**], and plavix.
   .
   #.  Dilated Cardiomyopathy:  Presumed to be non-ischemic, however with
   history of DM, PAD she has extensive risk factors for CAD.  Will get
   TTE in AM to evaluate for worsening disease.  In the meantime, will
   hold the patient's antihypertensives of amlodipine and carvedilol and
   diuretics given unclear if the patient's clinical status will
   deteriorate overnight.  Continue [**First Name3 (LF) 119**], statin and plavix as above.
   - Follow I/Os, goal neg 500cc-1L today as above
   - TTE in AM
   .
   #.  Coagulopathy:  All of the patient's coagulation factors are
   elevated.  She is not currently on coumadin, only [**First Name3 (LF) **] and plavix.  LFTs
   wnl.  This is most likely related to hypothermia and poor nutritional
   status.  Will check albumin.  Continue to trend.
   .
   #.  DM:  Will halve patient's home lantus given hypoglycemia this am
   and patient
s poor PO intake.  SS insulin PRN.
   .
   #   Hypothyroidism:  TSH only marginally elevated at 5.0.  Will add on
   Free T4, and T3 but suspect will be within normal limits.  Continue
   home levothyroxine dose.
   .
   #.  Anemia:  At baseline, due to anemia of chronic disease on Epogen.
   Continue to monitor.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction (EF) of 50-55%, hypothyroidism, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). She was admitted for hypothermia and hypoxia.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient has new bilateral pleural effusions compared to the previous chest X-ray. Differential diagnosis includes parapneumonic effusion, flu or other viral illness, worsening heart failure, or least likely pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient does not have a convincing history for pneumonia, considering the lack of leukocytosis and sputum production. The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, but the most recent echocardiogram showed preserved EF of 50-55%. However, today's chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly and chest X-rays are mildly elevated (though this is at her baseline), and there are no ECG changes. The least likely possibility is PE, but it will be ruled out with leg venous ultrasound (LENS) in the morning. Empirical treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) will be initiated, and flu will be ruled out. Fluid balance will be maintained to treat both potential etiologies with further workup in the morning."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 50-55%, hypothyroidism, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). She was admitted for hypothermia and hypoxia. The patient has evidence of new bilateral pleural effusions, which could be due to parapneumonic effusion, flu or other viral illness, worsening heart failure, or least likely pulmonary embolism (PE). She does not have a convincing history for pneumonia, and her leukocyte count is within normal limits. The patient's history of dilated cardiomyopathy is mentioned, but there are no ECG changes or evidence of systolic dysfunction on the most recent echocardiogram.

The patient's hypothermia may be secondary to systemic stress, but it is less likely to be caused by an overwhelming infection, as there are no signs of leukocytosis, tachycardia, or hypotension. The patient is being treated empirically for pulmonary and skin source of infection until blood cultures return negative.

Other medical conditions include sinus bradycardia, non-gap metabolic acidosis, chronic kidney disease, PAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, and coagulopathy. The patient's renal function is at baseline, and she is scheduled for a consultation with a renal specialist"

   There is interval additional progression of pulmonary edema, being
   currently
   moderate to severe. Bilateral pleural effusions are present, moderate
   to
   large as well as bibasilar atelectasis. Underlying infection might
   potentially be present, although very difficult to evaluate, currently
   with
   such a significant amount of pulmonary edema obscuring most of the lung
   fields.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo female with history of CKD, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy EF
   50-55%, hypothyroidism, hypertension, PAD, DM admitted for hypothermia
   and hypoxia.
   .
 HYPOXEMIA:  Currently patient appears volume overloaded on physical
   exam and CXR.  Feel that this is due to aggressive fluid resuscitation
   on admission, and original hypoxia on admission may have been due to
   pneumonia.
   - Continue diuresis today.  Didn
t put out all that much urine to 40mg
   IV lasix yesterday so will give 80mg IV Lasix today, with goal 1.5-2L
   neg
   - Supplemental O2 PRN
   - TTE tomorrow to determine systolic function
   - LENIS negative
   - Empiric antibiotics with vancomycin/zosyn/levofloxacin for possible
   pneumonia, treat for 8 day course (today is day 3).  Given trough, will
   give Vanc 750mg q24h
   - entle diuresis today
   - Droplet precautions, tamiflu until DFA returns
   .
 HYPOTHERMIA:  The patient was markedly hypothermic on admission
   without history of exposure, confirmed with patient and her HCP.  The
   patient's hypothermia may be secondary to systemic stress in the
   setting of multiple comorbidities including hypothyroidism, however TSH
   and cortisol within normal limits.  Cannot exclude overwhelming
   infection as cause of hypothermia, however less likely given lack of
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, or hypotension.  Still requiring warming
   overnight.
   - Empiric antibiotics of vanc/levo/zosyn for nosocomial infection as
   above
   - F/U culture data
   - Continue home dose of levothyroxine
   - Continue to rewarm
   .

   elevated.  She is not currently on coumadin, only [**First Name3 (LF) **] and plavix.  LFTs
   wnl.  This is most likely related to hypothermia and poor nutritional
   status.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical conditions and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient appears to be volume overloaded and may have pneumonia.
   - Continue diuresis with 80mg IV Lasix today to remove excess fluid.
   - Supplemental O2 PRN to maintain oxygen levels.
   - TTE (transesophageal echocardiogram) tomorrow to determine systolic function.
   - LENIS negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
   - Empiric antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin for possible pneumonia.

2. Hypothermia: The patient was markedly hypothermic on admission without any known exposure.
   - The patient's hypothermia may be secondary to systemic stress in the setting of multiple comorbidities, including hypothyroidism.
   - TSH and cortisol levels are within normal limits.
   - Cannot exclude overwhelming infection as a cause of hypothermia, but less likely given lack of leukocytosis, tachycardia, or hypotension.
   - Continue warming overnight.

   There is interval additional progression of pulmonary edema, being

   to
   large as well as bibasilar atelectasis. Underlying infection might
   potentially be present, although very difficult to evaluate, currently
   with
   such a significant amount of pulmonary edema obscuring most of the lung
   fields.
   LENIs: no evidence of right or left leg DVT
   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo female with history of CKD, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy EF
   50-55%, hypothyroidism, hypertension, PAD, DM admitted for hypothermia
   and hypoxia.
   .
 HYPOXEMIA:  The patient has evidence of new bilateral pleural
   effusions compared to CXR on [**2187-11-4**].  Differential includes
   parapneumonic effusion, flu or other viral illness, worsening heart
   failure or least likely PE.  The patient does not have a convincing
   history for pneumonia, especially considering lack of leukocytosis and
   sputum production.  The patient has history of dilated cardiomyopathy
   with most recent echo in [**2-19**] demonstrating preserved EF of 50-55%.
   However, today's CXR shows cardiomegaly and CEs mildly elevated (though
   this is at her baseline) and no ECG changes.  Least likely to be PE,
   however will rule out with LENIs in AM.  Will treat empirically for
   HAP, rule out flu and maintain even fluid balance to treat both
   potential etiologies with further workup in AM.
   - CE slightly elevated but at pt
s baseline x 2
   - will get PA and Lat CXR to better evaluate for consolidation and
   size/symmetry of effusions
   - consider diagnostic thoracentesis this AM
   - Supplemental O2 PRN
   - TTE in AM to determine systolic function
   - LENIS in AM
   - Empiric antibiotics with vancomycin/zosyn/levofloxacin; will narrow
   as appropriate
   - will recheck vanc trough at noon
   - gentle diuresis today with goal 500-1L neg
   - Droplet precautions, tamiflu until DFA returns
   .
 HYPOTHERMIA:  The patient was markedly hypothermic on admission
   without history of exposure, confirmed with patient and her HCP.  The
   patient's hypothermia may be secondary to systemic stress in the
   setting of multiple comorbidities including hypothyroidism, however TSH
   and cortisol within normal limits.  Cannot exclude overwhelming
   infection as cause of hypothermia, however less likely given lack of
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, or hypotension.  However, will treat
   empirically for pulmonary and skin source of infection until blood
   cultures return negative.
   - Empiric antibiotics of vanc/levo/zosyn for nosocomial infection as
   above
   - F/U culture data
   - Continue home dose of levothyroxine
   - Continue to rewarm
   .
   #.  Sinus Bradycardia:  Likely secondary to the patient's home CCB and
   betablocker dosing given recent visit to outpatient cardiologist HR was
   also in the 50s.
   - will restart carvedilol this am, and amlodopine in PM if remains
   stable
   .
   #.  Non-gap metabolic acidosis:  Most likely secondary to patient's
   chronic renal failure, although mildly worse than baseline.  Will
   continue to monitor and replete bicarb as needed.
   .
   #.  Chronic Kidney Disease:  The patient's current renal function is at
   baseline, but very elevated.  Renal has been consulted in the past for
   evaluation, thought to be secondary to diabetic nephropathy worsened by
   contrast induced nephropathy.  The patient continues to have
   nephropathy, but no factors that would require emergent dialysis.  She
   was to follow up with renal as an outpatient, but will consult tomorrow
   for further evaluation/expedited workup and/or preparation for renal
   replacement therapy.
   - Renal consult requested; will f/u recs
   .
   #.  PAD:  The patient's site does not appear to be infected, and
   appears to be healing appropriately.  Will contact the patient's
   primary vascular surgeon this AM for evaluation.  Continue home regimen
   of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 119**], and plavix.
   .
   #.  Dilated Cardiomyopathy:  Presumed to be non-ischemic, however with
   history of DM, PAD she has extensive risk factors for CAD.  Will get
   TTE in AM to evaluate for worsening disease.  In the meantime, will
   hold the patient's antihypertensives of amlodipine and carvedilol and
   diuretics given unclear if the patient's clinical status will
   deteriorate overnight.  Continue [**First Name3 (LF) 119**], statin and plavix as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 50-55%, hypothyroidism, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). She was admitted for hypothermia and hypoxia. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 157/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high-flow nasal cannula. She has evidence of new bilateral pleural effusions compared to her previous chest X-ray (CXR) from November 4th. The differential diagnosis includes parapneumonic effusion, flu or other viral illness, worsening heart failure, or pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient does not have a convincing history for pneumonia, and her most recent echocardiogram showed preserved EF. Her cardiac enzymes are mildly elevated, but this is at her baseline. The least likely cause is PE, but it will be ruled out with lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENIs) in the morning. The patient will be treated empirically for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ruled out for influenza, and maintained on even fluid balance to treat both potential etiologies with further workup in the morning.

   - will need diuresis today with lasix 80mg IV to goal body balance -1L
   - on vanc/zosyn/levofloxacin, difficult to exclude infiltrate on
   abnormal CXR, will continue for now
   - vanc level 15 about 30 hours after dose, will write for 750mg daily
   - effusions appear to be due to volume overload
 Hypernatremia
   - likely due to poor free water intake
   - start D5W drip at 50cc/hr x 1 L, encourage PO

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2), and hypothyroidism. She presents with hypothermia, bradycardia, significant pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, and ongoing hypoxemia. The patient has been hemodynamically stable but has had diuresis less aggressive overnight due to an increase in serum sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications. Possible causes include exposure to cold environments or underlying hypothalamic dysfunction.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions: These effusions are likely due to volume overload, which may result in decreased lung expansion and impaired gas exchange. Diuretic therapy is planned to manage this condition.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels are primarily attributed to pulmonary edema and fluid overload. Diuretic therapy and potentially other interventions may be necessary to improve oxygenation.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high serum sodium levels suggest dehydration or inadequate free water intake. Aggressive hydration with D5W drip is recommended to correct this electrolyte imbalance.
5. Renal failure/metabolic acidosis: The patient's slightly elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction. Monitoring kidney function and following diuretic therapy will be important for managing renal"

   60yo F with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, PVD, DMT2 and
   hypothyroidism who p/w hypothermia and bilateral pleural effusions.
 Hypothermia: back on Bair hugger overnight for temp 94, stilll
   unclear etiology
   - no evidence for adrenal insufficiency, does not appear septic,
   thyroid studies are relatively normal
   - on vanc/zosyn/levofloxacin and
 Hypoxemia
   - likely due to volume overload, significant pulmonary edema on CXR and
   physical exam
   - will need diuresis today with lasix 80mg IV to goal body balance -1L
   - on vanc/zosyn/levofloxacin, difficult to exclude infiltrate on
   abnormal CXR, will continue for now
   - vanc level 15 about 30 hours after dose, will write for 750mg daily
   - effusions appear to be due to volume overload
 Hypernatremia
   - likely due to poor free water intake
   - start D5W drip at 50cc/hr x 1 L, encourage PO
   - check PM lytes
 Renal Failure/Metabolic acidosis
   - creatinine slightly up, will follow with diuresis
   - bicarb now at her baseline
 Cardiomyopathy
   - diuresis as above
   - awaiting TTE to assess current function
 Hypothyroidism: unlikely to be significantly contributing to the
   picture
   - continue on home thyroid replacement
 DMT2
   - since plan for D5W fluids, will give her Lantus this morning
 Bradycardia/Hypertension
   - restart home amlodipine today
   - continue beta blocker
 Peripheral vascular disease
   - continue home regimen

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypothyroidism. She presents with hypothermia and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient has been hemodynamically stable but has significant pulmonary edema on chest x-ray and ongoing hypoxemia. Diuresis was less aggressive overnight due to an increase in her serum sodium.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (96.9 F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 151/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient is awake and alert, with a flat affect. Physical examination findings include crackles in the lung fields, distant heart sounds, and no oral lesions or masses. The patient has toe amputations on the left foot and a necrotic eschar on the right first toe.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 g/dL, hemoglobin of 25.1 g/dL, platelet count of 257 K/uL, creatinine of 3.7 mg/dL, blood glucose of 95 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.06, and sodium level of 152 mEq/L. Other lab results are within normal range. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including furosemide, heparin sodium, and dextrose 50%.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is still low, and the etiology is unclear. There is no evidence of adrenal insufficiency or sepsis. The patient is on antibiotics (vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin), but further investigation is needed.
2. Hypoxemia: This is likely due to volume overload, with significant pulmonary edema on chest x-ray and physical examination. Diuresis with Lasix 80mg IV will be given today to achieve a goal body balance of -1L. The patient will continue on vanc, zosyn, and levofloxacin.
3. Hypernatremia: This is likely due to poor free water intake. The patient will start a D5W drip at 50cc/hr x 1 L and encouraged to take oral fluids. Check PM electrolytes.
4. Renal failure/metabolic acidosis: Creatinine is slightly elevated. Diuresis will be followed, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed to assess current function.
5. Cardiomyopathy: Diuresis as above and awaiting TTE to assess current function.
6. Hypothyroidism: Unlikely to be significantly contributing to the picture. Continue on home thyroid replacement.
7. Diabetes mellitus type"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, and type II diabetes mellitus. He presented to the ICU with hypothermia, hypoxemia, and hypernatremia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 154/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient has received various antibiotics including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's history of chronic renal failure, along with the current findings of hypernatremia and fluid imbalances, increases the risk of developing AKI.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to diabetes and chronic renal failure makes him more susceptible to infections. The ongoing antibiotic treatment suggests a possible ongoing infection.
3. Hypotension: Despite having a relatively high blood pressure reading, the patient's recent administration of lasix and metolazone indicates the presence of hypotension, which could be a concern.
4. Respiratory Distress: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels and the presence of pulmonary edema on imaging raise concerns about his respiratory function.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, and diabetes mellitus type II. She was admitted for hypothermia and hypoxia. She has been receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation, which has resulted in volume overload. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 154/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high-flow nasal cannula at 60% FiO2. Her physical examination shows bibasilar atelectasis and moderate pulmonary edema. Laboratory results indicate anemia of chronic disease, non-gap metabolic acidosis, elevated serum creatinine, and hypernatremia. The patient's medical conditions include hypoxemia, hypothermia, sinus bradycardia, and hypernatremia. The patient is on multiple medications including diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, statins, and antiplatelet agents. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of hypoxia and findings of bilateral pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis on imaging may suggest pneumonia.
2. Cardiac Failure: The patient has a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomy"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo female with history of CKD, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy EF
   50-55%, hypothyroidism, hypertension, PAD, DM admitted for hypothermia
   and hypoxia.
   .
 HYPOXEMIA:  Currently patient appears volume overloaded on physical
   exam and CXR.  Feel that this is due to aggressive fluid resuscitation
   on admission, and original hypoxia on admission may have been due to
   pneumonia.
   - Continue diuresis today.  Didn
t put out all that much urine to 80mg
   IV lasix yesterday so gave 160 IV plus metolazole; will give again
   today as patient still positive [**Location **] Supplemental O2 PRN
   - TTE today  to determine systolic function
   - LENIS negative
   -  Will stop empiric antibiotics with vancomycin/zosyn/levofloxacin for
   possible pneumonia today (given [**Date range (1) 10623**]), with low threshold to
   restart if febrile.
   .
 HYPOTHERMIA:  The patient was markedly hypothermic on admission
   without history of exposure, confirmed with patient and her HCP.  The
   patient's hypothermia may be secondary to systemic stress in the
   setting of multiple comorbidities including hypothyroidism, however TSH
   and cortisol within normal limits.  Cannot exclude overwhelming
   infection as cause of hypothermia, however less likely given lack of
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, or hypotension.  Still requiring warming
   overnight.
   - Empiric antibiotics of vanc/levo/zosyn for nosocomial infection as
   above
   - F/U culture data
   - Continue home dose of levothyroxine
   - Continue to rewarm
   .
   #.  Sinus Bradycardia:  Likely secondary to the patient's home CCB and
   betablocker dosing given recent visit to outpatient cardiologist HR was
   also in the 50s.
   - Have restarted carvedilol and amlodopine
   .
   #.  Non-gap metabolic acidosis:  Most likely secondary to patient's
   chronic renal failure, although mildly worse than baseline.
   - Will continue to monitor and replete bicarb as needed, now back at
   baseline
   .
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM): Increasing free water deficit in setting
   of poor po intake and diuresis.  Improved with increased free water
   intake and D5W infusion.  Will continue to monitor.
   .
 .H/O RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC
   KIDNEY DISEASE)
   :  The patient's current renal function is at baseline, but very
   elevated.
   - FU renal recs: ABG today
   - Creatinine slightly increased, but close to baseline
   .
   #.  PAD:  The patient's site does not appear to be infected, and
   appears to be healing appropriately.
   - Appreciate visit by vascular surgery
   - Continue home regimen of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 119**], and plavix.
   .
   #.  Dilated Cardiomyopathy:  Presumed to be non-ischemic, however with
   history of DM, PAD she has extensive risk factors for CAD
   - Continue [**First Name3 (LF) 119**], statin and plavix as above.
   - Restart home hypertensives
   - TTE as above
   .
   #.  Coagulopathy:  All of the patient's coagulation factors are
   elevated.  She is not currently on coumadin, only [**First Name3 (LF) **] and plavix.  LFTs
   wnl.  This is most likely related to hypothermia and poor nutritional
   status.
   .
 .H/O DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   :  Will halve patient's home lantus given hypoglycemia this am and
   patient
s poor PO intake.  SS insulin PRN.
   - Will give hold Lantus until patient taking enough PO to require SS
   .
   #   Hypothyroidism:  TSH only marginally elevated at 5.0, other thyroid
   studies also wnl
   - Continue home levothyroxine dose.
   .
   #.  Anemia:  At baseline, due to anemia of chronic disease on Epogen.
   Continue to monitor.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism, hypertension, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and diabetes mellitus type II. She was admitted for hypothermia and hypoxia. The patient appears volume overloaded on physical examination and chest X-ray, possibly due to aggressive fluid resuscitation. She is currently receiving diuretics to manage fluid overload.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/60 mmHg to 160/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she has a 2/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 199 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.2 g/dL, platelet count of 201,000/mm³, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 43 mg/dL, creatinine level of 3.9 mg/dL, and glucose level of 115 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal ranges, except for a slightly elevated sodium level of 144 mEq/L.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo female with history of CKD, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy EF
   50-55%, hypothyroidism, hypertension, PAD, DM admitted for hypothermia
   and hypoxia.
   .
 HYPOXEMIA:  Currently patient appears volume overloaded on physical
   exam and CXR.  Feel that this is due to aggressive fluid resuscitation
   on admission, and original hypoxia on admission may have been due to
   pneumonia.
   - Continue diuresis today.  Didn
t put out all that much urine to 80mg
   IV lasix yesterday so gave 160 IV plus metolazole; will give again
   today as patient still positive [**Location **] will address need for dialysis in conjuction with renal team today
   - Supplemental O2 PRN
   - TTE today to determine systolic function
   - LENIS negative
   -  Will stop empiric antibiotics with vancomycin/zosyn/levofloxacin for
   possible pneumonia today (given [**Date range (1) 10623**]), with low threshold to
   restart if febrile.
   .
 HYPOTHERMIA:  The patient was markedly hypothermic on admission
   without history of exposure, confirmed with patient and her HCP.  The
   patient's hypothermia may be secondary to systemic stress in the
   setting of multiple comorbidities including hypothyroidism, however TSH
   and cortisol within normal limits.  Cannot exclude overwhelming
   infection as cause of hypothermia, however less likely given lack of
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, or hypotension.  Still requiring warming
   overnight.
   - stop empiric abx as above
   - F/U culture data
   - Continue home dose of levothyroxine
   - head MRI w/o contrast to evaluate for possible central cause of
   hypothermia
   .
   # Anemia, now with Hct drop: 24 to 22 this AM.  24 is patient
   baseline secondary to renal disease.  Will likely transfuse one unit
   with dialysis if gets dialyzed within next several days.
   - check PM Hct
   .
   #.  Sinus Bradycardia:  Likely secondary to the patient's home CCB and
   betablocker dosing given recent visit to outpatient cardiologist HR was
   also in the 50s.
   - Have restarted carvedilol and amlodopine
   .
   #.  Non-gap metabolic acidosis:  Most likely secondary to patient's
   chronic renal failure, although mildly worse than baseline.
   - Will continue to monitor and replete bicarb as needed, now back at
   baseline
   .
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM): Increasing free water deficit in setting
   of poor po intake and diuresis.  Improved with increased free water
   intake and D5W infusion.  Will continue to monitor.
   - pm lytes
   .
 .H/O RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC
   KIDNEY DISEASE)
   :  The patient's current renal function is at baseline, but very
   elevated.
   - FU renal recs
   - Creatinine slightly increased, but close to baseline
   .
   #.  PAD:  The patient's site does not appear to be infected, and
   appears to be healing appropriately.
   - Appreciate visit by vascular surgery; foot ulcers at baseline
   - Continue home regimen of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 119**], and plavix.
   .
   #.  Dilated Cardiomyopathy:  Presumed to be non-ischemic, however with
   history of DM, PAD she has extensive risk factors for CAD
   - Continue [**First Name3 (LF) 119**], statin and plavix as above.
   - Restart home hypertensives
   - TTE as above
   .
   #.  Coagulopathy:  All of the patient's coagulation factors are
   elevated.  She is not currently on coumadin, only [**First Name3 (LF) **] and plavix.  LFTs
   wnl.  This is most likely related to hypothermia and poor nutritional
   status.
   .
 .H/O DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II:  Will hold patient's home
   lantus given hypoglycemia and patient
s poor PO intake.  SS insulin
   PRN.
   - Will give hold Lantus until patient taking enough PO to require SS
   .
   #   Hypothyroidism:  TSH only marginally elevated at 5.0, other thyroid

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient appears to be volume overloaded and has bilateral pleural effusions, which may contribute to low oxygen levels in the blood. Supplemental oxygen and diuretics may be necessary to address this issue.

2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has dropped from 24% to 22%. This could be due to chronic renal failure or ongoing bleeding. Further evaluation and transfusion might be required.

3. Hypothermia: The patient was markedly hypothermic on admission. Although the cause is uncertain, it may be secondary to systemic stress or an underlying central cause. Warming measures and a head MRI are planned to investigate further.

4. Sinus bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently low, likely due to home medications including a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and beta-blocker. These medications have been restarted.

5. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has a mild worsening of chronic renal failure-related metabolic acidosis. Monitoring and bicarbonate repletion will be necessary.

6. Hypernatremia (high sodium): The patient has an increased free water deficit, likely due to poor oral intake and diuresis. Free water intake and D5W infusion have improved the condition, but ongoing monitoring is required.

7. Chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is at baseline"

   60yo F with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, PVD, DMT2 and
   hypothyroidism who p/w hypothermia and bilateral pleural effusions.
    Primary issues include:
   # Hypothermia: stilll unclear etiology
   - no evidence for adrenal insufficiency, does not appear septic,
   thyroid studies are relatively normal,
   --consider head MRI to r/o hypothalamic process/mass though w/o other
   neurologic symptoms
   --has received 4 days of empiric antbx with neg cxs.  Will d/c and
   follow clinical status closely
   # Hypoxemia
   - likely due to volume overload, significant pulmonary edema and
   effusions on CXR and physical exam
   --continue efforts to diurese thought minimal response and likely
   heading toward HD for fluid removal
   --f/u TTE results
   # Hypernatremia
   - likely due to poor free water intake
   - improved with free water
   --encourage PO
    # Renal Failure/Metabolic acidosis, uremia
   --heading toward HD
   --continue discussions with rpt and renal team, as we have made little
   progress with fluid removal using IV diuretics
   - bicarb now at her baseline
   # Cardiomyopathy
   - diuresis as above
   - awaiting TTE to assess current function
   # Hypothyroidism: unlikely to be significantly contributing to the
   picture
   - continue on home thyroid replacement
   # DMT2
   Poor PO, SSI
   # Peripheral vascular disease
   - continue home regimen
   - per vascular, foot exam is at baseline

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypothyroidism. She is currently experiencing hypothermia and bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's vital signs show a low body temperature (35.7°C), slightly low blood pressure (120/58 mmHg), and normal heart rate (69 bpm). She is also on respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery at 94% saturation.

The patient has received four days of empiric antibiotic treatment with negative cultures. Her fluid balance shows an intake of 2,452 mL and output of 1,340 mL, indicating a positive fluid balance of 112 mL.

Her laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 7.6 K/uL, anemia with an Hct of 21.9%, and thrombocytopenia with a Plt of 199. Other lab values include elevated creatinine (4.0 mg/dL), low glucose levels (43 mg/dL), and electrolyte imbalances such as hyponatremia (Na+: 117 mEq/L) and hyperkalemia (K+: 6.4 mEq/L).

Imaging studies reveal bilateral pleural effusions, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) shows an enlarged right atrium"

   60 yo female with history of CKD, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy EF
   50-55%, hypothyroidism, hypertension, PAD, DM admitted for hypothermia
   and hypoxia.
 HYPOXEMIA:  Currently patient appears volume overloaded on physical
   exam and CXR.  Feel that this is due to aggressive fluid resuscitation
   on admission, and original hypoxia on admission may have been due to
   pneumonia.
   - Continue diuresis today.  Patient responding to Lasix 160 +
   Metolazone 5.    Continue today.
   - will readdress need for dialysis in conjuction with renal team today,
   though it sounds nonurgent
   - Supplemental O2 PRN
   - f/u final TTE
   -  stopped empiric antibiotics with vancomycin/zosyn/levofloxacin for
   possible pneumonia today (given [**Date range (1) 10623**]), with low threshold to
   restart if febrile.
   .
 HYPOTHERMIA:  The patient was markedly hypothermic on admission
   without history of exposure, confirmed with patient and her HCP.  The
   patient's hypothermia may be secondary to systemic stress in the
   setting of multiple comorbidities including hypothyroidism, however TSH
   and cortisol within normal limits.  Cannot exclude overwhelming
   infection as cause of hypothermia, however less likely given lack of
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, or hypotension.  Did not require rewarming
   overnight
   - F/U culture data
   - Continue home dose of levothyroxine
   - head MRI w/o contrast to evaluate for possible central cause of
   hypothermia will need to readdress with patient in future though
   currently refusing

   #  Hyperparathyroidism: PTH elevated.  ? if tertiary hyperparathyroid
   due to RF
   # Anemia, now with Hct drop: low but stable.  24 is patient
s baseline
   secondary to renal disease.  Will likely transfuse one unit with
   dialysis if gets dialyzed within next several days.
   - restarted epo
   .
   #.  Sinus Bradycardia:  Likely secondary to the patient's home CCB and
   betablocker dosing given recent visit to outpatient cardiologist HR was
   also in the 50s.
   - Have restarted carvedilol and amlodopine
   .
   #.  Acidosis:  Now with an AG of 15.  Previously NAG. Most likely
   secondary to patient's chronic renal failure, although mildly worse
   than baseline.  Could be due to ketones from poor nutrition.
   - Will continue to monitor and replete bicarb as needed, now back at
   baseline
   .
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM): Increasing free water deficit in setting
   of poor po intake and diuresis.  Improved with increased free water
   intake and D5W infusion.  Will continue to monitor.
   - pm lytes

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, and type II diabetes mellitus. She was admitted for hypothermia and hypoxia. The patient's current conditions include hypernatremia, acidosis, hypoxemia, hypothermia, and sinus bradycardia. She also has an elevated parathyroid hormone level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels can lead to dehydration, increased thirst, confusion, seizures, and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed properly.
2. Acidosis: The patient's acidosis may indicate an imbalance in her blood pH, which can affect various bodily functions, including respiratory and cardiovascular systems. If left untreated, it can lead to organ damage and failure.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels in the blood can result in inadequate oxygen supply to tissues and organs, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening situations.
4. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature below normal can cause various symptoms such as confusion, cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory distress, and organ dysfunction. If not treated promptly, it can be fatal.
5. Sinus Bradycardia: The patient's slow heart rate may decrease cardiac output and impair the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. This can lead to symptoms like dizziness"

 HYPOTHERMIA
   60 yo female with history of CKD, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy EF
   50-55%, hypothyroidism, hypertension, PAD, DM admitted for hypothermia
   and hypoxia.
 HYPOXEMIA:  Currently patient appears volume overloaded on physical
   exam and CXR.  Feel that this is due to aggressive fluid resuscitation
   on admission and renal failure, and original hypoxia on admission may
   have been due to pneumonia.
   - Continue diuresis today.  Patient responding to Lasix 160 +
   Metolazone 5.    Continue today.  Dose now.
   - will readdress need for dialysis in conjuction with renal team today,
   though it sounds nonurgent.  Patient to patient conversation to take
   place.
   - Supplemental O2 PRN
   -  stopped empiric antibiotics with vancomycin/zosyn/levofloxacin for
   possible pneumonia today (given [**Date range (1) 10623**]), with low threshold to
   restart if febrile.
   .
 HYPOTHERMIA:  No resolved.  Did not require warming o/n.  The patient
   was markedly hypothermic on admission without history of exposure,
   confirmed with patient and her HCP.  The patient's hypothermia may be
   secondary to systemic stress in the setting of multiple comorbidities
   including hypothyroidism, however TSH and cortisol within normal
   limits.  Cannot exclude overwhelming infection as cause of hypothermia,
   however less likely given lack of leukocytosis, tachycardia, or
   hypotension.
   - F/U culture data
   - Continue home dose of levothyroxine
   - head MRI w/o contrast to evaluate for possible central cause of
   hypothermia will need to readdress with patient in future though
   currently refusing

   #  Hyperparathyroidism: PTH elevated.  ? if tertiary hyperparathyroid
   due to RF
   # Anemia, now with Hct drop: low but stable.  24 is patient
s baseline
   secondary to renal disease.  Will likely transfuse one unit with
   dialysis if gets dialyzed within next several days.
   - restarted epo
   .
   #.  Sinus Bradycardia:  Likely secondary to the patient's home CCB and
   betablocker dosing given recent visit to outpatient cardiologist HR was
   also in the 50s.
   - Have restarted carvedilol and amlodopine
   .
   #.  Acidosis:  Now with an AG of 15.  Previously NAG. Most likely
   secondary to patient's chronic renal failure, although mildly worse
   than baseline.  Could be due to ketones from poor nutrition.
   - Will continue to monitor and replete bicarb as needed
   .
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM): Increasing free water deficit in setting
   of poor po intake and diuresis.  Improved with increased free water
   intake and D5W infusion.  Will continue to monitor.
   - pm lytes

   #.  PAD:  The patient's site does not appear to be infected, and
   appears to be healing appropriately.
   - Appreciate visit by vascular surgery; foot ulcers at baseline
   - Continue home regimen of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 119**], and plavix.

   #.  Dilated Cardiomyopathy:  Presumed to be non-ischemic, however with
   history of DM, PAD she has extensive risk factors for CAD.  TTE without
   evidence of hypokinesis.
   - Continue [**First Name3 (LF) 119**], statin and plavix as above.
   - restarted home antihypertensives.

   #.  Coagulopathy:  All of the patient's coagulation factors are
   elevated.  She is not currently on coumadin, only [**First Name3 (LF) **] and plavix.  LFTs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism, hypertension, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and type II diabetes mellitus (DM). She was admitted for hypothermia and hypoxia. The patient has been responding well to diuretic therapy with lasix and metolazone for volume overload. Her current renal function is at baseline, but with slightly elevated creatinine levels. She also has hyperparathyroidism with elevated PTH levels, anemia, sinus bradycardia, acidosis, and hypernatremia. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is on various medications including antihypertensives, statins, antiplatelet agents, and insulin for DM. She is currently refusing an MRI to evaluate for central cause of hypothermia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation may indicate inadequate oxygen supply to the tissues. This can be due to pneumonia, as suggested by the chest X-ray showing volume overload.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels can lead to dehydration and neurological complications if not managed appropriately.
3. Acidosis: The patient's acid-base imbalance may require correction to maintain proper pH levels and prevent further complications.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit levels indicate anemia, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of chronic kidney disease, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, and type II diabetes mellitus. She was admitted for hypothermia and hypoxia. The patient's current conditions include hypernatremia (high sodium), hypoxemia, hypothermia, anemia, sinus bradycardia, acidosis, and chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels require supplemental oxygen and further evaluation to determine the underlying cause, such as pneumonia or fluid overload.

3. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature needs to be maintained within normal limits to prevent complications associated with low body temperature.

4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia, which may require transfusion or other interventions to manage.

5. Sinus Bradycardia: The patient's slow heart rate needs to be monitored and managed, especially considering her medication regimen.

6. Acidosis: The patient's acid-base imbalance needs to be corrected to prevent further complications.

7. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's kidney function is compromised, and ongoing monitoring and management are necessary to prevent complications related to renal failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2), and hypothyroidism. He is currently experiencing hypothermia and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving various treatments, including diuretics, insulin, and thyroid replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is below normal, which can lead to various complications such as decreased metabolism, impaired circulation, and increased risk of infection.
2. Bilateral Pleural Effusions: The presence of fluid in both lungs can compromise respiratory function and increase the risk of pneumonia or respiratory failure.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has significant pulmonary edema, which can be caused by fluid overload or cardiac dysfunction. This can lead to difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can cause dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and neurological symptoms.
5. Chronic Renal Failure (CRF)/Metabolic Acidosis/Uremia: The patient is heading towards hemodialysis due to poor response to diuretic therapy. CRF can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid retention, and metabolic acidosis. Uremia can cause various symptoms including fatigue, nausea, and confusion.
6. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old individual with a medical history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient presents with hypothermia, bilateral pleural effusions, and pulmonary edema. The etiology of the hypothermia remains unclear. The patient has been treated with empiric antibiotics but is now off them due to negative cultures and lack of an obvious source. The patient's hypoxemia is attributed to volume overload, as evidenced by significant pulmonary edema and effusions on the chest X-ray. The patient has hypernatremia, metabolic acidosis, and uremia. The patient also has hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and deconditioning. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications. Hypothermia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, impaired organ function, and increased risk of infection.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema: These conditions indicate fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can compromise oxygenation and lead to respiratory distress.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels can result in dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and neurological complications if not corrected.
4. Metabolic acidosis and uremia: These conditions can lead to"
