","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of mitral valve fibroelastoma and recent colonoscopy who presented with bright red blood per rectum for one day and hypotension. The patient has mild hypotension to the 90s systolic and was transferred to the MICU. The differential diagnosis for gastrointestinal bleeding includes diverticular bleed, post-polypectomy bleed, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), or other sources. The patient is currently being managed with two large bore IVs, active type and screen, transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), preparation for colonoscopy with magnesium citrate, NPO status for the procedure, and holding antihypertensive agents.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's presentation with bright red blood per rectum suggests active gastrointestinal bleeding. If not promptly managed, this can lead to significant blood loss, hypotension, shock, and potentially death.
2. Hypotension: The patient's current mild hypotension to the 90s systolic indicates inadequate blood pressure. If not corrected, it can lead to organ perfusion deficits and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's rapid hematocrit drop and potential blood loss may result in decreased renal perfusion. AKI can occur if the kidneys are unable to compensate for the reduced blood flow."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of mitral valve fibroelastoma and recent screening colonoscopy who presents with bright red blood per rectum for one day and hypotension. He has been diagnosed with a lower gastrointestinal bleed, likely due to a post-polypectomy bleed. The patient has been transferred to the MICU and is currently stable. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and is being managed with a GI consult. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient may experience rebleeding from the same site or another source in the gastrointestinal tract.
2. Hypotension: Due to acute blood loss, the patient's blood pressure may drop further, leading to hypotension.
3. Infection: Prolonged use of indwelling lines and catheters may increase the risk of infection.
4. Thrombosis: Immobility and prolonged bed rest can increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
5. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to critical illness and the use of medications such as corticosteroids.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's need for respiratory support, there is a risk of developing VAP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of mitral valve fibroelastoma and recent screening colonoscopy who presented with bright red blood per rectum and hypotension. He has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, most likely due to a post-polypectomy bleed. The patient was transferred to the MICU and received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells. Colonoscopy was performed, which revealed a pulsatile bleeding lesion from the biopsy site that was successfully clipped.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/66 mmHg to 187/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is hemodynamically stable and has shown no signs of bleeding since the procedure yesterday.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a hemoglobin level of 14.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 38.7%, leukocyte count of 7.9 K/uL, platelet count of 364 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 129 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal ranges.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for a colonoscopy. The patient has a history of post-polypectomy bleed at 60 cm in the distal transverse colon. During the procedure, active pulsatile blood flow was observed, which was clipped and injected with epinephrine. The patient's hematocrit dropped from 30 to 24, but no evidence of bleeding was noted, and the patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the day. 

Infusions of fentanyl and midazolam were given on [**2158-3-22**] at 10:55 AM and 10:59 AM respectively. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9 C (98.5 F), heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/66 to 187/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has received a total of 1,935 mL of blood products.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 30.0 g/dL, platelet count of 364 K/uL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and glucose level of 129 mg/dL. Other lab values such as PT"

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of post-polypectomy bleed in the distal transverse colon, which resulted in a drop in hemoglobin from 30 to 24. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently hemodynamically stable. The patient underwent a colonoscopy on [**2158-3-22**] at 10:30 AM and was given fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation, respectively.

The patient's respiratory rate is 11 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent events. His flow sheet data indicates a slight drop in temperature and a decrease in blood pressure, but overall stable hemodynamics. He has received a total of 2,035 mL of fluids since midnight and has had a blood product transfusion of 1,935 mL. 

Physical examination reveals a pleasant and well-appearing man with no abnormal findings in the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, or neck.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1277**] is a 57 y/o male with a history a mitral valve fibroelastoma
   and recent screening colonoscopy on [**2158-3-7**] with polypectomy who
   presents with bright red blood per rectum x 1 day and hypotension.
   .
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Story consistent with a lower gastroinestal
   source.  Differential includes diverticular bleed vs. post-polypectomy
   vs. AVM vs. other source.  Most likely etiology related to
   post-polypectomy bleed.  Transferred to MICU with cont GI bleed and
   transient hypotensive episode to 90
s.  Since ICU transfer HD stable
   but with continued blood stool.  Given 2u PRBC on ICU transfer.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of mitral valve fibroelastoma and recent colonoscopy with polypectomy.
- He presents with bright red blood per rectum for one day and hypotension.
- The patient has been transferred to the MICU with a confirmed lower gastrointestinal bleed, likely due to a post-polypectomy bleed.
- He is currently hemodynamically stable but continues to have blood stool.
- A colonoscopy was performed, which revealed pulsatile bleeding from a biopsy site, which was successfully clipped.
- The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth), and antihypertensive agents are being held.
- If the patient rebleeds or cannot control the bleeding with interventional radiology (IR), further management options such as a red cell scan or IR angio and embolization will be considered.
- The patient's hypotension is likely due to acute blood loss, and he has received a blood transfusion.
- His hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has dropped from 30.0 to 24.3.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/66 to 187/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of mitral valve fibroelastoma and recent screening colonoscopy with polypectomy. He presented with bright red blood per rectum and hypotension. The arterial bleeding was seen and clipped during colonoscopy. He received a total of 6 PRBC transfusions and his HCT levels were monitored, showing stability at 40.7%. He has not required any blood transfusions since the night of 3/22. He is now eating a regular diet without N/V and his blood pressure is stable after restarting lisinopril. The patient should monitor himself for further bloody stools and have HCT measurement as an outpatient within the next week. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient had a recent episode of GI bleeding due to arterial bleeding during a colonoscopy. Although the bleeding was controlled, there is a risk of re-bleeding or ongoing slow bleeding. The patient should monitor himself for further bloody stools and follow up with HCT measurement.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which could be related to the GI bleeding or his underlying hypertension. The patient was restarted on home lisinopril with stable blood pressure.
3. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient has hypercholesterolemia and should continue with statin therapy.
4. History of TIAs: The patient has a history of"

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been hemodynamically stable throughout the day with an increasing hematocrit level without any intervention. The patient received zolpidem for trouble sleeping. There are no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a slight decrease in blood pressure at times. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been given blood products. Fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating potential fluid loss. The patient's respiratory support is not required as they maintain an oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination findings are not available due to not being assessed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count and hemoglobin levels, as well as slightly elevated creatinine and potassium levels. The patient has a history of bradycardia, pain control, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The plan includes ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure drops at times, which could indicate potential hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is necessary.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may suggest an underlying infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate treatment.
3. Renal impairment: Slightly elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal impairment. Close monitoring of kidney function and adjustment of medications accordingly are necessary."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a pleasant, well-appearing man in the ICU with a chief complaint of GI bleed. He has been experiencing hemodynamic stability throughout the day without any intervention. The patient received zolpidem for trouble sleeping. His vital signs are within normal range, with a slight decrease in temperature. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he is not on respiratory support. Physical examination reveals a regular rhythm with normal S1, S2, and a systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border and apex. There are no abnormalities in the lungs, abdomen, extremities, or skin. Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented, with intact cranial nerves, normal strength, and reflexes. Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, but all other values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient's initial chief complaint is a gastrointestinal bleed, which can lead to significant blood loss and potential complications such as hypotension, shock, or organ failure if not managed properly.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently low, ranging from 47-66 beats per minute. Bradycardia can lead to decreased cardiac output and inadequate tissue perfusion.
3. Pain control: The patient has been identified with both acute and chronic pain. Inadequate pain management can result in discomfort, agitation,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1277**] is a 57 y/o male with a history a mitral valve fibroelastoma
   and recent screening colonoscopy on [**2158-3-7**] with polypectomy who
   presents with bright red blood per rectum x 1 day and hypotension.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Story consistent with a lower gastroinestal
   source.  Differential includes diverticular bleed vs. post-polypectomy
   vs. AVM vs. other source.  Most likely etiology related to
   post-polypectomy bleed.  Transferred to MICU with cont GI bleed and
   transient hypotensive episode to 90
s.  Since ICU transfer HD stable
   but with continued blood stool.  Given a total of 6 units PRBCs. GI
   consulted, colonoscopy performed, noted to have pulsatile bleeding
   lesion from biopsy site.  Clipped with good hemostasis.
   - advance diet
   - holding antihypertensive agents; these can be restarted later this
   admission or on discharge
   - if has rebleed or unable to control bleeding with IR, will consider
   pursuing red cell scan vs. IR angio and embolization.
   Hypotension:  Likely from acute blood loss.  Drop from baseline of 40
   to 30.4 got a total of 6 units with HCT today of 38.7.  Stable since
   procedure yesterday.
   - transfusion goal > 30
   - IVFs as needed for MAPs > 65, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   Hypercholesterolemia:
   - continue statin
   History of TIAs:
   - holding aspirin and plavix, likely for a period of two weeks given
   recent bleed
   Tobacco Use:
   - counseling
   - nicotine patch
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: advance to clears, IVFs as needed for MAPs > 65, UOP > 30

","Summary:
- Patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of mitral valve fibroelastoma and recent colonoscopy with polypectomy.
- He presents with bright red blood per rectum for one day and hypotension, indicating a lower gastrointestinal bleed.
- The most likely etiology is a post-polypectomy bleed.
- The patient was transferred to the MICU with continuous GI bleeding and transient hypotension, but has since stabilized.
- He received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells.
- Colonoscopy was performed, revealing pulsatile bleeding from the biopsy site, which was successfully clipped.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a hematocrit level of 38.7 after receiving blood transfusions.
- The plan is to advance his diet, hold antihypertensive agents, and consider a red cell scan or IR angio and embolization if he rebleeds or cannot control bleeding with interventional radiology.
- The patient's hypotension is likely due to acute blood loss.
- The goal is to maintain a hematocrit level above 30 and monitor for mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and urine output (UOP) above 30 cc/hr.
- The patient has hypercholesterolemia, and his statin therapy will be continued.
- He has a history of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and aspirin and Plavix will be withheld for a period of two weeks due to recent bleeding.
- The patient smokes, and counseling and nicotine patch therapy will be provided.
- In the ICU, the patient will be advanced to clears, with IV fluids as needed for MAPs above 65 and UOP above 30 cc/hr, while monitoring electrolytes.
- Prophylactic measures include DVT prophylaxis with pneumatic boots and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
- The patient's wife has been informed, and the patient's code status is full code. He may be discharged to home today from the ICU."
