   87 yo f with hx of dCHF, AVR, MRV, DMII, recent bacteremia, admitted
   [**3-29**] with worsening dyspnea and concern for acute on chronic dHF; who
   then developed
   # Fever / Leukocytosis: Normotensive but with low uop and new
   arrythmias concerning for sepsis.  Differential in this patient include
   many infectious causes including recurrent Salmonella infection
   (completed ceftriaxon [**3-22**]), new bacteremia secondary to recent PICC,
   C.diff given repeated hospitalizations and abx, new PNA given increased
   dyspnea.  Also with increasing adenexal mass (abscess?  bowel fistula?)
   on CT [**2134-3-10**] with both ascites and plueural effusions, any of which
   could [**Hospital1 **] an underlying infection.
    - start vancomycin and cefepime, appreciate ID recommendations
    - continue empiric treatment of c diff with PO flagyl
    - RUQ pelvic ultrasound to evaluate pelvic mass ? mycotic aneurysm
    - CXR to evaluate for new PNA
    - u/s of abdomen
    - discuss with family diagnostic paracentesis (refused last admission)
    - consider thoracentesis if effusion persists on CXR
    - TTE vs TEE to evaluate for new vegetation, given artificial valves
   and recent PICC
    - Follow-up blood cultures, urine, stool cultures
    - Culture if febrile
    - Repeat C.diff x 3; empiric metronidazole for now
    - Hold Lasix / Metolazone for now while bP borderline; small NS
   boluses PRN to maintain MAP >60
   # Altered Mental Status: Noted in the day prior to transfer to the
   ICU.  Very likely related to new infectious process as above.  Could
   also consider worsening heart failure with dyspnea and hypoxemia or
   toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. Exam currently nonfocal.
    - Infectious work-up as above
    - Avoid sedating medication
   # Metabolic Acidosis: mixed
   - ABG with lactate
   .
   # Wide Complex Tachycardia: Day of MICU transfer, patient reportedly
   had HR to 200, then became briefly cyanotic, unresponsive and
   ?pulseless.  Review of telemetry reveals Torsades de [**Last Name (un) 11738**]. EKG after
   event without evidence of ischemia. Baseline EKG with long QT.  No
   obvious QT-prolonging medications currently, although she did recently
   complete a course of fluconazole on [**3-28**].  EP increased HR today to
   decrease QT
    - Cycle CE (first set negative)
    - repeat EKG in AM
    - ICU cardiac monitoring
    - continue Amiodarone 200 mg daily
    - hold metoprolol given long QT
    - f/u EP recs
    - Mg > 2, K > 4
   # Hypoxia: O2 requirement is 2L, unchanged from recent requirement on
   floor. Likely [**3-9**] acute on chronic diastolic heart failure with
   possibility of infectious process.  Exam difficult to assess volume
   with JVP given TR & not taking good inspiration.  LE with edema.  +
   Pleural effusion and ascites on recent imaging. Now with decreased
   urine output, ? new sepsis vs poor forward flow [**3-9**] worsened heart
   failure and volume overload.
    - Control hypertension
    - Monitor urine output
    - Urine lytes
    - Ideally would make negative but carefully in the setting of ? sepsis
    - daily weights
    - strict I/Os
   # Acute on Chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr 2 - 2.3, currently 2.4,
   above baseline. [**Month (only) 8**] be elevated due to poor forward flow vs new septic
   process. UA without e/o infection.  Per daughter, it improved with
   diuretics at rehab.
    - monitor closely
    - will renally dose meds
    - urine lytes
    - Calcium Acetate 667mg x 2 TID - hold while NPO
   # Elevated Troponin: Baseline near 0.05, now 0.08 s/p episode of
   pulseless VT vs Torsade de [**Last Name (un) 11738**].
    - Trend, check Q8
   # CAD s/p 1v CABG: Reportedly with intermittent angina per prior
   admission notes
    - Continue Statin, Isosorbide dinitrate while concern for pressure
   instability
    - ASA
    - SL NTG PRN
   # Elevated LFTs: Alk phos elevated, and AST, GGT. Pt has RUQ pain on
   exam. Recent concern for biliary process. However bili is normal, so
   unlikely obstruction
    - Mild elevation on admission, resolving, may be [**3-9**] volume overload
   # Anemia: Chronic.  Recent baseline 25, currently > 28.
    - Trend, prior evaluation [**12/2133**] consistent with iron deficiency
   anemia, no colonoscopy in OMR
    - Polysaccaride Iron Complex 150 Qday  (hold while AMS)
   # DMII: stable.  On Lantus 30U as outpatient.
    - ISS
   # History of Afib: AV paced at 60. Initially continued on home
   Amiodarone & Metoprolol.
    - Amiodarone & Metoprolol, continue as able given concern for low
   blood pressure
   - continue anticoagulation
   # Hx of AVR and MVR: INR was subtherputic on admission, goal likely 2.5
   - 3.5 due to mechanical valve.  Therapeutic today.
    - Continue Coumadin daily at current dose.
   # Hypothyroid: Stable per admission records.
    - continue Levothryroxine 37.5mcg qday  (18.75 IV if not tolerate po)
   # GERD: On both H2 / PPI as outpatient.  Unclear level of control.
    - Continue Omeprazole for now
   # Insomnia: Hold Trazodone PRN given AMS.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for AMS (will advance to Renal

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, atrioventricular valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, diabetes mellitus type II, and recurrent Salmonella infection. She was admitted with worsening dyspnea and concern for acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient developed fever, leukocytosis, new arrhythmias, and altered mental status, which are concerning for sepsis. She also has a pelvic mass that could be an abscess or bowel fistula, ascites, and pleural effusions, suggesting possible underlying infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and new arrhythmias are indicative of an infectious process. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and appropriate antibiotic therapy is essential.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's history of congestive heart failure and worsening dyspnea suggest ongoing cardiac dysfunction. Monitoring of fluid balance, blood pressure, and daily weights is important.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level has increased, indicating possible acute on chronic renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function, urine output, and electrolytes is necessary.
4. Troponin Elevation: The patient's troponin level has slightly increased, which may indicate myocardial ischemia or injury. Trending of cardiac enzymes and continuous cardiac monitoring are recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old individual with a complex cardiac history, recent admission for salmonella bacteremia, and readmission with HFPEF exacerbation. The patient was transferred to the ICU overnight after experiencing hypotension and a code blue with torsades. The patient has confirmed cdiff and chest pain this morning. The patient's vital signs are stable, and they are currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, diuretics, and cardiac medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's recent admission for salmonella bacteremia and positive cdiff indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Cardiac Issues: The patient's complex cardiac history and the code blue with torsades suggest a potential risk for further cardiac complications.
3. Chest Pain: The patient's complaint of chest pain may indicate an underlying cardiac issue or possibly a complication related to the HFPEF exacerbation.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The presence of confirmed cdiff suggests an increased risk for gastrointestinal complications such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea or colitis.
5. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance sheet indicates a negative balance, which may indicate dehydration or ongoing fluid losses.
6. Renal Function: The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating a potential risk for renal dysfunction.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show imbalances in potassium, sodium, and magnesium levels, which can affect cardiac"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old individual with a complex cardiac history. They were recently admitted for salmonella bacteremia and readmitted with a heart failure exacerbation. The patient experienced hypotension and a code blue episode due to torsades, a type of abnormal heart rhythm. The patient has also tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. They are currently in the ICU for overnight treatment.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's recent bacteremia and positive C. diff infection indicate a potential ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Torsades: The patient experienced a code blue episode due to torsades, an abnormal heart rhythm that can be life-threatening.
3. Chest pain: The patient complains of chest pain, which could be related to cardiac issues.
4. C. diff infection: The patient has tested positive for C. diff infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and abdominal pain.
5. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient was readmitted with a heart failure exacerbation, indicating worsening heart function.
6. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which can compromise blood flow to vital organs and lead to organ damage.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrioventricular replacement (AVR), mitral valve replacement (MVR), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and recent bacteremia. She was admitted on [3-29] with worsening dyspnea and concern for acute on chronic dHF. The patient then developed torsades and was found to be actively infected with Clostridium difficile (C. diff). She is currently being treated with Flagyl and vancomycin for C. diff. No other source of infection is suspected, and there is no evidence of shock.

The patient's recent events include a torsades arrest, which was successfully treated without subsequent episodes. She also has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which she was previously on amiodarone and metoprolol. However, her INR is currently elevated at 5 due to recent anticoagulation.

The patient's vital signs show tachypnea with an oxygen requirement, close to even intake and output, and an elevated heart rate of 84 bpm. Her temperature is slightly below normal, and her blood pressure is within the normal range. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation is 94% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals a sleeping and unresponsive state, with resists to eyelid opening but responding to loud voice when her"

   # Fever / Leukocytosis: Normotensive but with low uop and new
   arrythmias concerning for sepsis.  Differential in this patient include
   many infectious causes including recurrent Salmonella infection
   (completed ceftriaxon [**3-22**]), new bacteremia secondary to recent PICC,
   C.diff given repeated hospitalizations and abx, new PNA given increased
   dyspnea.  Also with increasing adenexal mass (abscess?  bowel fistula?)
   on CT [**2134-3-10**] with both ascites and plueural effusions, any of which
   could [**Hospital1 **] an underlying infection.
    - start vancomycin and cefepime, appreciate ID recommendations

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, atrioventricular valve replacement, mitral valve repair, diabetes mellitus type II, and recurrent Salmonella infection. She was admitted with worsening dyspnea and concern for acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient developed fever, leukocytosis, new arrhythmias, and low urine output, which are concerning for sepsis. She also has a pelvic mass that could potentially be an abscess or bowel fistula, ascites, and pleural effusion on imaging. The patient's current condition includes chest pain, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, wide complex tachycardia, hypoxia, acute on chronic renal failure, elevated troponin, history of coronary artery disease post one-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting, elevated liver function tests, anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, history of atrial fibrillation, history of aortic and mitral valve replacement, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease, insomnia, and fecal incontinence. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with Coumadin and bowel regimen PRN. The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate status and is currently in the ICU pending further improvement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with complaints of diffuse body aches. The patient has a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, and pain management. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 117/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation through a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals an elevated jugular venous pressure, pulsatile, with no lymphadenopathy. Lung sounds are poor, but without clear rales or rhonchi. There is a systolic murmur throughout the chest. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine. Troponin-T levels are within normal range. Other lab values such as potassium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis without organ dysfunction, chest pain, and potential respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of fever suggest an ongoing infection. If left untreated, sepsis can progress to septic shock and organ"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrioventricular replacement (AVR), mitral valve replacement (MVR), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and recent bacteremia. She was admitted with worsening dyspnea and concern for acute on chronic CHF, and later developed torsades de pointes requiring a stay in the medical intensive care unit (MICU). She also had ongoing Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. The patient's condition improved after receiving appropriate treatment, including discontinuation of metronidazole due to concern for QT prolongation. No evidence of shock was observed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's recent bacteremia and ongoing C. diff colitis suggest a potential risk for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms is essential.
2. Heart failure: The patient's history of CHF and recent worsening dyspnea indicate a risk for heart failure exacerbation. Monitoring of fluid balance, respiratory status, and adjusting diuretic therapy as needed is important.
3. Torsades de pointes: Although the patient's episode of torsades de pointes resolved spontaneously, ongoing cardiac monitoring should be continued to detect any future episodes.
4. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's baseline creatinine levels of 2-2.3 indicate chronic kidney disease. Ren"

The patient experienced an 8-second episode of torsades de pointes but it self-limited. With treatment for C. diff, the patient's leukocytosis has improved and diarrhea has resolved. The patient's blood pressure has been stable, and there have been no recurrent arrhythmias.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 79 bpm (75-85), blood pressure ranging from 130/50-70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (15-27), and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support but is adequately oxygenated.

The patient's physical examination is largely unremarkable except for the presence of a systolic murmur and mechanical clicks. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and their extremities show no edema. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

","The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a complex cardiac history, including congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and a history of valve replacement. She was admitted to the hospital with CHF symptoms and subsequently developed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to torsades de pointes, a type of ventricular tachycardia. Her current medications include Flagyl, fluconazole, lopressor, and amiodarone, all of which have been held.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 130/50 to 133/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the resolution of diarrhea associated with C. diff colitis.

Her physical examination reveals normal breath sounds and clear chest, as well as soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. There is no evidence of peripheral edema. Her neurological assessment is unchanged, with the patient being attentive, oriented to name and place, and responding appropriately.
