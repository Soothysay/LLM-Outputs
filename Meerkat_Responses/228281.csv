   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo F with metastatic pancreatic cancer fatigue, weakness and altered
   mental status, transferred to MICU for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Given CT scan findings main differential includes sepsis
   given multiple abscesses vs. decreased venous return [**3-11**] increased
   abdominal pressure from ascites/mass.  Pulmonary embolism (given bilat
   femoral venin thrombosis) and cardiac tamponade (given low voltage on
   EKG) also possible although less likely given low CVP.  Currently on
   levophed with minor BP response to 3L IVF.  Sources of sepsis include
   intrabadominal abscess, J-tube site infections, SBP.  Less likely
   causes include PNA (not seen on CXR), UTI (UA poor sample with 20
   epis), or meningitis (see differential for altered mental status
   below).
   -place central line to measure CVP; bolus IVF for CVP >[**11-19**]
   -continue vanc/ceftaz/flagyl for broad coverage given unknown cause of
   abscesses
   -continue levophed with goal MAP >65 and UOP > 30 cc/hr
   -consider diagnostic paracentesis
   -repeat UA and culture
   -still requiring levophed, add vasopressin and attempt to wean levophed
   as tolerated for MAP >65
   #Low urine output: most likely [**3-11**] combination of sepsis and increased
   intraabdominal pressure causing decreased renal blood flow.
   -will likely need paracentesis to relieve intra-abdominal pressure or
   would expect worsening renal function
   -IVF boluses for CVP >[**11-19**]
   #Bilateral lower edema: R>L, most likely [**3-11**] bilateral femoral DVT
   seen on CT scan.  Contributing factors include hypoalbuminemic state
   and obstructive pelvic mass.
   -lower extremity duplex to confirm DVT
   -start heparin gtt for now given high risk of PE
   #Pancreatic cancer
 metastatic to ovary, underlying malignancy seems
   to be progressing despite treatment.
   -Onc c/s given CT scan supporting disease progression
   #Ascites
 malignant vs exudative, has high risk for both given
   intra-abdominal ca and hepatic involvement by mass lesion.
   -diagnostic/therapeutic tap today
   -covering for sBP with ceftazidime (given ascites, AMS)\
   -IR to mark place
   # Confusion: most likely [**3-11**] hypotension +/- infection, she has had
   improvement in mental status since starting pressors/IVF
s.  Other
   possible cause is medication-related vs meningitis.
   - hold oxycodone and lyrica
   - tx hypotension as above
   - will hold off on viral cultures for now given resolution of mental
   status and identification of source for infection given abscesses on CT
   - follow Neuro-onc recs
   .
   # FTT / Weakness: Weakness and failure to thrive in setting of cancer
   and poor nutritional status.  Albumin of 2.2.
   - replete K and Phos aggressively
   - PT consult
   - continue tube feeds
   - follow Neuro-onc recs, Onc recs
   # J tube leakage/subcutaneous abscess: Pt and husband report persistent
   leakage with abscess seen in surrounding subcutaneous tissue.
   -contacting IR to determine appropriate management of abscess and J
   tube leakage
   # Anemia: Baseline Hct 25-28.  HCT 28.7 in clinic today, now 24.6 in
   setting of significant IVF
s, most likely hemodilutional.  No evidence
   of acute bleeding.
   - send active T&S
   - follow HCT QDay
   # Peripheral neuropathy:
   - hold Lyrica per neuro-onc attending
   .
   # FEN: NPO, hold tube feeds for now given likely IR procedure for J
   tube, replete lytes PRN, fluid boluses for CVP and MAP

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with metastatic pancreatic cancer, presenting with fatigue, weakness, and altered mental status. She was transferred to the MICU for hypotension. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, low urine output, bilateral lower extremity edema, ascites, and confusion. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, receiving IV fluids, vasoactive medications, antibiotics, and other supportive treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to sepsis, decreased venous return from ascites/mass, pulmonary embolism, or cardiac tamponade.
2. Sepsis: The patient has multiple abscesses in the abdomen, which could be a source of infection. Other possible sources include the jejunal feeding tube site infection and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has bilateral filling defects in the common femoral veins, indicating deep venous thrombosis, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism.
4. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's low voltage on EKG suggests the possibility of cardiac tamponade, although less likely given the low central venous pressure.
5. Low urine output: The patient's decreased renal blood flow may be due to sepsis and increased intra-abdominal pressure from ascites.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presents with hypotension and altered mental status. They have been started on a levophed infusion and have a right subclavian line placed. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed multiple probable liver abscesses, worsening splenic vein thrombosis, ascites, possible cholangitis, and collection around the J-tube. Bilateral femoral vein thrombosis was also noted. The patient received multiple fluid boluses with some improvement and has a urine output of about 20 cc/hr. Oxygen saturation levels have been good on room air, and mental status has improved on pressors.

24-hour events include the placement of an indwelling port, EKGs at different times, and the initiation of a multi-lumen line. Allergies are not reported. The patient is currently on various medications including norepinephrine, colace, MVI, PPI, flagyl, vancomycin, and heparin.

Flowsheet data shows vital signs within normal ranges, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/72 to 109/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg and bladder pressure of 35 mmHg. Fluid balance indicates a total input of 5,657 mL and output of 595 mL, with a urine output of 195 mL.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be awake, alert, and oriented. The pharynx is dry, and there is decreased breath sounds at the bases of the lungs. The abdomen is distended and tender, with decreased bowel sounds. There is also pitting edema bilaterally.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.9 g/dL, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, platelet count of 135 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 23 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL, glucose of 125 mg/dL, and sodium of 135 mEq/L. Imaging studies reveal multiple hepatic defects, large ascites, bilateral pleural effusions, and a small patchy density in the right lower lobe of the lung.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has hypotension likely due to infection, with a low CVP. They require additional fluid resuscitation and vasopressin. Poor urinary output may be due to increasing intra-abdominal pressure and decreased renal perfusion. Infection with multiple possible etiologies, including abscesses related to the J-tube, hepatic abscesses, and potential pulmonary infection, is suspected. Bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is also present"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo F with metastatic pancreatic cancer fatigue, weakness and altered
   mental status, transferred to MICU for hypotension, now with multiple
   liver abscesses, ascites and extensive LE DVT.
   #End-stage metastatic pancreatic cancer
 metastatic to ovary,
   underlying malignancy seems to be progressing despite treatment.  Seen
   by oncologist yesterday and patient and family given very poor
   prognosis with time frame likely of days.
   Currently plan seems to be moving more towards palliative/cmo rather
   than life prolonging measures.  Patient and family would no longer like
   invasive/aggressive treatment.
   # Hypotension:  most likely due to infection in setting of multiple
   liver abscesses and subcutaneous abscess surrounding J tube site.  She
   continues to be dependent on pressor support but current plan is to
   bolus with IVF and then d/c pressors and transfer to the floor with
   palliative care and focus on comfort measures.  Continue antibiotics
   for now to hold infection at bay and allow patient time to spend with
   family.
   #Bilateral lower extremity DVT/edema: continue with heparin gtt for
   time being.
   #Ascites
 transudative, no evidence of SBP, s/p paracentesis.  No
   further management planned.
   # Confusion: most likely [**3-11**] hypotension and infection.  It is possible
   that her mental status may decline once pressors d/c
d.  Will bolus
   with IVF prior to d/c to facilitate transfer to the floor.  Also
   somnolent [**3-11**] ativan which is being given for patient anxiety/comfort.
   -continue ativan prn with understanding that may make her less
   responsive
   # J tube leakage/subcutaneous abscess: s/p drainage of subcutaneous
   abscess; holding all tube feeds given suspected abscess.
   # Anemia: Baseline Hct 25-28, stable
   # Peripheral neuropathy: she continues to deny pain
   - hold Lyrica per neuro-onc attending
   .
   # FEN: holding tube feeds, ok to take by mouth whatever she would like

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with metastatic pancreatic cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for hypotension. The patient's condition has been complex, with multiple liver abscesses, ascites, and extensive lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's current vital signs show hypotension, with blood pressure readings ranging from 107/57 mmHg to 117/73 mmHg. The patient is on vasopressor support, specifically norepinephrine, and has been bolused with intravenous fluids. Oxygen saturation remains at 98% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral pitting edema, bibasilar crackles and dullness in the lungs, a soft abdomen with less distension than before paracentesis, and warm extremities. Neurologically, the patient is responsive but has altered mental status.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The ascites fluid analysis shows elevated protein, glucose, and leukocyte counts, while the microbiology results from the liver abscess indicate an infection with Gram-negative rods.

The patient's medical history includes metastatic pancreatic cancer, fatigue, weakness, and altered mental status. Imaging studies have revealed occlusive thrombus in the bilateral common femoral and superficial femoral veins, as well as the right popliteal"

 ANEMIA, OTHER
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS
   Hypotension persists requiring vasopressors. CVP still on low side;
   would give additional fluids. Would utilize lactated Ringers given the
   hyperchloremic acidosis. Antibiotics continue. Oxygenation good on
   nasal oxygen.
   Hct stable. No evidence of bleeding. Not at transfusion threshold.
   Mental status improved.
   Continues on IV heparin for DVT. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
   Patient and family discussing possible palliative care and emphasis on
   comfort measures.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU with hypotension, fever, and altered mental status. They underwent aspiration of an abdominal wall abscess, liver abscess, and ascites. The ascitic fluid gram stain showed mixed flora, and clotting was observed bilaterally. The patient has been started on vasopressin and continues to receive levophed to maintain blood pressure. Fluid boluses have been given, and central venous pressure (CVP) has been measured. The patient is afebrile now. 

24-hour events include a liver biopsy and paracentesis. The patient has a history of no known drug allergies. Antibiotics were administered, including piperacillin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The patient is receiving continuous infusions of heparin sodium, vasopressin, and norepinephrine. Other medications include colace, MVI, and PPI.

Vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring show that the patient's temperature is within normal range, heart rate is stable, and blood pressure is maintained with the use of vasopressors. Respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are normal. The patient's weight and height are documented, along with CVP measurements. Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,800 mL and output of 1,435 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,365 mL. Urine output is good at 40-50 cc"
