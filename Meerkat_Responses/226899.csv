   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 718**] is a 49 yo F with history of NSCLC s/p chemotherapy on
   [**5-9**] who presents with febrile neutropenia and altered mental status.
   1. Febrile neutropenia: Patient with decreasing WBC counts after chemo
   and new fever.  Will treated for now with Vancomycin and cefepime with
   cultures pending.  The most likely cause is pneumonia given the
   possible developing infiltrate on CXR.  However other causes including
   aspiration pneumonia, PCP pneumonia, CNS infection and fungal infection
   should be condsidered in this patient should she clinically
   decompensate as these would not be covered by her current regimen.
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime for F&N
 likely pulmonary source
   - CXR
 developing RLL PNA
   - Cultures pending
 attempt sputum culture if pt able to cooperate
   .
   2. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial.  At least in part due
   to delirium with fever and infection.  However, other causes including
   CNS infections, CNS metastases and recent EtOH and pain medication
   increases.  Patient does not currently appear to have any focal
   neurologic signs nor does she have intoxication symptoms.  It is
   possible however, that the patient may have alcohol withdrawal.  After
   discussing with the husband she may have had increased intake of
   alcohol in the last few months while he has not been able to be at home
   as much.  Given that he was home more in the last few days, it is
   possible that she is now in withdrawal of alcohol/benzodiazepines.
   Hepatic encephalopathy also a consideration given her alcohol use
   history.
   - Consider LP if infection persists
   - CT head to r/o bleed
   - LFTs and INR
   - CIWAs, consider diazepam for CIWA >10
   - Hold sedating meds otherwise including hydromorphone.
   - Ethanol
 negative, serum and urine tox pending
   - will readd standing ativan to prevent withdrawal
 pt on standing
   ativan at home
   3. NSCLC: s/p recent chemotherapy.  Patient is Stage IV and receiving
   palliative treatment.  Recent chemotherapy was only 4 days ago, thus
   she has not yet reached nadir of her myelosupression.  Await recs from
   oncology regarding treatment for neutropenia/thrombocytopenia.  Will
   hold heparin for now for DVT ppx given thrombocytopenia
   - consider neupogen given infections, await onc input.
   .
   4. Hypoxia/chest pain: As above the patient likely has pneumonia with
   CXR, fever, cough.  However other causes of hypoxia and ? pleuritic
   chest pain include PE (history of DVT) as well as Myocardia
   infarction.  At this point patient is not stable for CT and is not
   cooperating with  ABG.    Given more likely diagnoses will defer CTA
   for now.  With regards to MI risk, the patient does have ECG changes,
   but negative cardiac enzymes.  Consider CTA
   5. Electrolyte abnormalities: Consistent right now with dehydration
   improved with hydration overnight
   6. Alcohol use: will continue on CIWA and IVF PRN
   7. GERD: continue PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who has undergone chemotherapy. She is currently in the ICU with febrile neutropenia, altered mental status, hypoxia, and chest pain. The patient has a decreased white blood cell count following chemotherapy and presents with fever and possible developing infiltrate on chest X-ray. She is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime while awaiting culture results. Other potential causes of her symptoms include aspiration pneumonia, PCP pneumonia, CNS infection, and fungal infection. The patient's altered mental status may be multifactorial, with possible delirium due to fever and infection, as well as potential alcohol withdrawal or hepatic encephalopathy. Further investigations are needed to rule out CNS infections, CNS metastases, and recent ethanol intake. The patient has a history of DVT and thrombocytopenia, so heparin is being held for now. She also has electrolyte abnormalities consistent with dehydration. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: Given the possible developing infiltrate on CXR, the patient is at risk of developing pneumonia, which can worsen her respiratory status and lead to further hypoxia.
2. CNS infection: Considering the patient's altered mental status, there is a possibility of CNS infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis. This could potentially worsen her neurological condition.
3. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient's increased alcohol intake in the last few months, along with the recent changes in her husband's availability, raises the possibility of alcohol withdrawal. This can lead to severe complications like seizures and delirium tremens.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of alcohol use and current liver function test abnormalities raise the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause altered mental status and other neurological symptoms.
5. Thrombosis: The patient's history of DVT and thrombocytopenia increase her risk for thrombotic events such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis. These can be life-threatening if not promptly identified and treated.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's current electrolyte abnormalities, such as dehydration, need to be closely monitored and corrected to prevent complications like cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.

It is important to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms to promptly identify any potential complications and intervene accordingly."

   possible however, that the patient may have alcohol withdrawal.  After
   discussing with the husband she may have had increased intake of
   alcohol in the last few months while he has not been able to be at home
   as much.  Given that he was home more in the last few days, it is
   possible that she is now in withdrawal of alcohol/benzodiazepines.
   Hepatic encephalopathy also a consideration given her alcohol use
   history.
   - Consider LP if infection persists
   - CT head when able to get it
   - LFTs and INR
   - CIWAs, consider diazepam for CIWA >10
   - Hold sedating meds otherwise including hydromorphone.
   - Alcohol level
   3. NSCLC: s/p recent chemotherapy.  Patient is Stage IV and receiving
   palliative treatment.  Recent chemotherapy was only 4 days ago, thus
   she has not yet reached nadir of her myelosupression.  Await recs from
   oncology regarding treatment for neutropenia/thrombocytopenia.  Will
   hold heparin for now for DVT ppx given thrombocytopenia
   4. Hypoxia/chest pain: As above the patient likely has pneumonia with
   CXR, fever, cough.  However other causes of hypoxia and ? pleuritic
   chest pain include PE (history of DVT) as well as Myocardia
   infarction.  At this point patient is not stable for CT and is not
   cooperating with  ABG.    Given more likely diagnoses will defer CTA
   for now.  With regards to MI risk, the patient does have ECG changes,
   but negative cardiac enzymes.  Will continue to trend and get CTA when
   stable
   5. Electrolyte abnormalities: Consistent right now with dehydration.
   Will fluid challenge and recheck
   6. Alcohol use: will continue on CIWA and give banana bag
   7. GERD: continue PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presents with febrile neutropenia and altered mental status. She has been treated with chemotherapy and now has a decreased white blood cell count, along with a fever. She is currently being treated with Vancomycin and cefepime while awaiting cultures. The possible developing infiltrate on her chest X-ray suggests pneumonia as the most likely cause. However, other causes such as aspiration pneumonia, PCP pneumonia, CNS infection, and fungal infection should also be considered.

The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, including delirium with fever and infection, CNS infections, CNS metastases, and increased intake of alcohol and pain medication. It is possible that she may have alcohol withdrawal or hepatic encephalopathy given her alcohol use history.

The patient's NSCLC is stage IV and she is receiving palliative treatment. Recent chemotherapy was only 4 days ago, so she has not yet reached the nadir of her myelosuppression. Recommendations from oncology regarding treatment for neutropenia/thrombocytopenia are pending. Heparin is being held for now due to thrombocytopenia.

The patient likely has pneumonia with chest pain, fever, and cough. Other possible causes of hypoxia and pleuritic chest pain include pulmonary embolism (history of DVT) and myocardial"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 718**] is a 49 yo F with history of NSCLC s/p chemotherapy on
   [**5-9**] who presents with febrile neutropenia and altered mental status.
   1. Febrile neutropenia: Patient with decreasing WBC counts after chemo
   and new fever.  Will treated for now with Vancomycin and cefepime with
   cultures pending.  The most likely cause is pneumonia given the
   possible developing infiltrate on CXR.  However other causes including
   aspiration pneumonia, PCP pneumonia, CNS infection and fungal infection
   should be condsidered in this patient should she clinically
   decompensate as these would not be covered by her current regimen.
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime for F&N
 likely pulmonary source
   - CXR
 developing RLL PNA
   - Cultures pending
 attempt sputum culture if pt able to cooperate
   .
   2. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial.  At least in part due
   to delirium with fever and infection.  However, other causes including
   CNS infections, CNS metastases and recent EtOH and pain medication
   increases.  Patient does not currently appear to have any focal
   neurologic signs nor does she have intoxication symptoms.  It is
   possible however, that the patient may have alcohol withdrawal.  After
   discussing with the husband she may have had increased intake of
   alcohol in the last few months while he has not been able to be at home
   as much.  Given that he was home more in the last few days, it is
   possible that she is now in withdrawal of alcohol/benzodiazepines.
   Hepatic encephalopathy also a consideration given her alcohol use
   history.
   - Consider LP if infection persists
   - CT head to r/o bleed
   - LFTs and INR
   - CIWAs, consider diazepam for CIWA >10
   - Hold sedating meds otherwise including hydromorphone.
   - Ethanol
 negative, serum and urine tox pending
   - will readd standing ativan to prevent withdrawal
 pt on standing
   ativan at home
   3. NSCLC: s/p recent chemotherapy.  Patient is Stage IV and receiving
   palliative treatment.  Recent chemotherapy was only 4 days ago, thus
   she has not yet reached nadir of her myelosupression.  Await recs from
   oncology regarding treatment for neutropenia/thrombocytopenia.  Will
   hold heparin for now for DVT ppx given thrombocytopenia
   - consider neupogen given infections, await onc input.
   .
   4. Hypoxia/chest pain: As above the patient likely has pneumonia with
   CXR, fever, cough.  However other causes of hypoxia and ? pleuritic
   chest pain include PE (history of DVT) as well as Myocardia
   infarction.  At this point patient is not stable for CT and is not
   cooperating with  ABG.    Given more likely diagnoses will defer CTA
   for now.  With regards to MI risk, the patient does have ECG changes,
   but negative cardiac enzymes.  Consider CTA
   5. Electrolyte abnormalities: Consistent right now with dehydration
   improved with hydration overnight
   6. Alcohol use: will continue on CIWA and IVF PRN
   7. GERD: continue PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who has undergone chemotherapy. She presented with febrile neutropenia and altered mental status. The patient was found to have intracranial metastasis on a CT head. Her vital signs are within normal limits, except for an elevated heart rate of 117 bpm. She is receiving antibiotics for pneumonia and has been started on steroids and Neupogen per oncology recommendations. The patient's laboratory results indicate neutropenia with an ANC of 600. She is currently afebrile and her oxygen saturation is 100% on a nasal cannula. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to underlying infection and suspicion for intracranial metastasis. This can lead to further cognitive decline, difficulty with self-care activities, and potential complications related to immobility.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a right lower lobe pneumonia. If left untreated or inadequately treated, this can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of respiratory failure, and potential sepsis.
3. Neutropenia: The patient's low absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 600 increases her risk for opportunistic infections and delays wound healing. She is at an increased risk for bacterial infections, including those caused by Gram-negative organisms.

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who is currently in the ICU and is experiencing delirium. They have been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and have developed brain metastases. The patient also has a history of fever and neutropenia, as well as ethanol (EtOH) use. They are currently tachycardic, meaning their heart rate is elevated. The patient does not seem to be experiencing withdrawal symptoms or volume depletion.

24-hour events include the discovery of new brain metastases. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius (100.2 degrees Fahrenheit), current temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius (98.1 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate between 121-127 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 115/57 to 148/109 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an ABG showing pH of 7.25. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate a low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, low creatinine, elevated troponin T, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and normal electrolyte levels.

Plan:
The patient requires treatment for the newly discovered brain metastases, likely through radiation therapy (XRT). The patient's tachyc"
