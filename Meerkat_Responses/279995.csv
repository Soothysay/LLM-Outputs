   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # fevers: There are numerous possibilities for infectious sources. He
   had Strep Bovis bacteremia in [**Month (only) **] and MRSA and enterococcus bacteremia
   in [**Month (only) 1854**]. He finished a course of vancomycin the day prior to
   presentation. He could be insufficiently treated for this. In addition,
   he was started on levofloxacin a few days prior to admission for a UTI.
   His urinalysis does not suggest infection currently but he has been on
   antibiotics.  Given the imaging studies, he does appear to have an
   infiltrate in the right lung field which could be his infectious
   source. Given his history, concern for bacteremia, endocarditis,
   urosepsis if antibiotic was not sensitive, infected subdural hematomas,
   influenza or pneumonia.  CT scan of abdomen/pelvis does not show
   obvious infectious source.
   -continue vancomycin for broad coverage for MRSA given recent
   bacteremia and meropenem for gram negatives and pseudomonal coverage
   given recent UTI and for hospital associated pneumonia. (he has allergy
   to penicillins)
   -TEE to evaluate for persistent endocarditis
   -follow up blood and urine cultures
   -send nasal aspirate for influenza
   -send sputum culture
   -monitor fever curve
   -follow up final imaging reads
   -pleural effusions do not seem large enough for thoracentesis at this
   time and do not appear loculated.
   # hypotension: He is off of pressors with good blood pressures. A line
   pressure is much higher than cuff pressure, so unclear if he was really
   hypotensive in the ED for long. Lactate is and was normal so likely was
   not hypotensive for long.
   -monitor BP
   # pericardial effusion: He does not have tamponade physiology. He is
   off of pressors with good blood pressures. A line pressure is much
   higher than cuff pressure, so unclear if he was really hypotensive in
   the ED for long. Lactate was normal. No change in his aline tracing or
   CVP with respirations. No pulses.
   -check ECHO
   # altered mental status: likely secondary to infection. Also concern
   for worsening subdural hematomas given recent diagnosis. Head CT
   imaging prelim read does not suggest worsening bleed.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -follow up final CT imaging read
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection. Does appear to
   have pneumonia but oxygenating well. Has a respiratory alkylosis as his
   PaCO2 is likely lower than his baseline.
   -resend gas and change to pressure support as tolerated to allow him to
   ventilate at his own rate.
   -h/o chronic CO2 retention so keep oxygen sats around 90-92 percent.
   -nebs prn given h/o RAD.
   # h/o subdural hematomas: no acute process on head CT here, but will
   follow up final read. Neuro exam is limited given sedation but appear
   non-focal.
   # aortic stenosis: valve area reportedly 0.9cm^2. When heading towards
   extubation, will also need to be careful with fluid shifts
   # anemia: chronic for the last few months since his illness began.
   Likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency (one report of
   colonic polyps removed). Currently at baseline since transfusion a few
   days ago.
   -monitor HCT
   -given CAD, AS and other illness, consider transfusion for HCT less
   than 25.
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr at his baseline over the last
   few months.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa, statin. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now as above.
   # DM2: hold oral agents and check finger sticks and use insulin sliding
   care.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue sinemet and requip.
   # FEN: NPO for now. If not extubated later today, will need to start
   diabetic tube feeds. IVF. replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, droplet (until influenza ruled out) and MRSA
   precautions.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents with altered mental status and fevers. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently intubated for airway protection. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: Given the patient's history of bacteremia, endocarditis, urosepsis, and infected subdural hematomas, there is a concern for persistent or new infections. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for MRSA and gram-negative coverage. Further evaluation with cultures, imaging, and echocardiogram is recommended.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been observed to have low blood pressures, which may require ongoing monitoring and adjustment of fluid and medication management.
3. Pericardial effusion: The patient has a pericardial effusion, but without tamponade physiology. Close monitoring of cardiac function and echocardiogram follow-up is advised.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to infection and may also be related to worsening subdural hematomas. Regular assessment of mental status and follow-up imaging is necessary.
5. Respiratory status: The patient requires ongoing respiratory support, and adjustments to ventilation settings may be required based on gas exchange and"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male admit with altered mental status and respiratory failure.
   He has recent history notable to endocarditis (6 weeks of treatment)
   and enterococcus and MRSA found on PICC after completion of CTX
   treatment for endocarditis.  Patient finished Vanco for line sepsis on
   [**2168-11-14**].  He then had confusion and delirium evolve over three days
   and was sent to ED here for eval where fever, tachypnea noted.  He then
   evolved hypotension in the ED and Right SCL was placed and
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with compliance=40 and Resistance=9
   consistent with minimal new acute pulmonary insult
   -In the setting of altered mental status and need for further imaging
   patient was intubated.
   -He has baseline CO2 level of 50-55 likely based upon initial ABG's
   -Atovent/Albuterol
   -Move to PSV wean this morning
   -Move to extubation with procedures completed.
   2)Sepsis-
   -Concern for pulmonary source with effusion suggested on CT scan of
   chest.  He does have past history of endocarditis certainly and line
   sepsis so metastatic source is certainly possible.
   -Has been able to maintain SBP >100 on A-line trace and off pressors
   following 3 liters of IVF
   -Interestingly patient has no bands and minimal lactate elevation
   -Vanco/Meropenem
   -TEE to eval for endocarditis
   -Check for influenza
   -Sputum cultures
   -Pleural thickening is present and small effusion is noted as change in
   right sided lung volumes is significant and concern for possible
   mestastatic focus.
   2.5)Pericardial Effusion-
   --Echo today to eval for extent of effusion and possible valve
   abnormalities with TEE
   3)Acute Renal Failure-He does have elevation over baseline creatinine
   and this may be a combination of inadequate perfusion in the setting of
   acute infection resulting in ATN
   3)Altered Mental Status-
   -This is in the setting of parkinson's disease and likely acute
   infectious insults
   -Continue Ropinorole and Sinemet for Parkinson's Disease

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted with altered mental status and respiratory failure. He has a history of endocarditis and recently completed treatment for it. The patient also had line sepsis, which was treated with Vancomycin. He then developed confusion, delirium, fever, tachypnea, and hypotension, leading to his current ICU admission.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 95/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.49, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 235.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 7.8 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.0 mmol/L. Imaging studies reveal pericardial effusion, pleural effusion,"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # Fevers: Workup ongoing for infectious etiologies; no cultures thus
   far revealing.  TEE with healed vegetation on aortic valve with AR and
   aortic valve prolapse.
   -continue vancomycin and meropenem (allergy to PCN)
   -MRI to assess for septic emboli or abscess
 will obtain MRI of head
   and spine
   -U/S of upper extremities to look for septic thrombophlebitis with line
   infection
   -continue to follow cultures
   -f/u TEE results
   # altered mental status: likely secondary to infection. Head CT does
   not cause for altered mental status.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -MRI of head and spine to look for abscess
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection. Does appear to
   have pneumonia but oxygenating well.  Thoracentesis yesterday showing
   exudative process.  CXR today shows reaccumulation of fluid.  Pt was on
   PS yesterday and doing fine.
   -continue nebs PRN, will reassess and try PS today, consider extubation
   once studies complete
   # aortic stenosis: valve area reportedly 0.9cm^2. When heading towards
   extubation, will need to be careful with fluid shifts.
   # aortic regurgitation/endocarditis: will obtain Echo from outside
   hospital (being mailed here).  Possible new endocarditis vs. healed
   vegetation.  Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
   # anemia: chronic for the last few months since his illness began.
   Likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency (one report of
   colonic polyps removed). Currently at baseline since transfusion a few
   days ago.
   -monitor HCT
   -given CAD, AS and other illness, consider transfusion for HCT less
   than 25.
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr at his baseline over the last
   few months.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa, statin. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more
   hypertensive.
   # DM2: hold oral agents and check finger sticks and use insulin sliding
   care.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue sinemet and requip.
   # FEN: NPO for now. If not extubated later today, will need to start
   diabetic tube feeds. IVF. replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, droplet (until influenza ruled out) and MRSA
   precautions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He was admitted from a rehabilitation center with altered mental status and fevers. The patient has undergone several tests and interventions, including thoracentesis, TEE, MRI, and U/S of upper extremities. He is currently intubated for airway protection and is receiving respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's presentation with fevers, altered mental status, and positive findings on thoracentesis suggest a possible ongoing infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the infectious etiology.
2. Septic Thrombophlebitis: The presence of an indwelling central venous catheter increases the risk of septic thrombophlebitis. The ultrasound of the upper extremities is being performed to assess for this complication.
3. Endocarditis: The patient's history of subdural hematomas, bacteremia, and the finding of healed vegetation on the aortic valve raise the suspicion of endocarditis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered, and additional imaging and laboratory tests are planned to confirm the diagnosis.
4. Aortic Stenosis: The patient's aortic valve area is reported to be 0.9 cm^2, indicating significant aortic stenosis. Fluid shifts must be carefully managed"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of allergies to several medications and a previous episode of anaphylaxis. 

Upon admission, the patient was started on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and received O2 through an endotracheal tube. His initial vital signs included a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 111/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Physical examination revealed an obese patient with scleral edema and sluggish but reactive pupils. The patient had expiratory wheezes and course breath sounds bilaterally. There was also a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the base, trace edema in the lower extremities, and bilateral upper extremity tremor and cogwheel rigidity. 

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, mildly elevated blood glucose, and elevated troponin T levels. The rest of the lab values were within normal limits.

The patient's condition has been monitored closely with frequent assessments of vital signs, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory values.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # Fevers: Considering broad differential including bacteremia,
   endocarditis, urosepsis if antibiotic was not sensitive, infected
   subdural hematomas, influenza or pneumonia.  CT scan of abdomen/pelvis
   does not show obvious infectious source.
   -continue vancomycin for broad coverage for MRSA given recent
   bacteremia and meropenem for gram negatives and pseudomonal coverage
   given recent UTI and for hospital associated pneumonia. (he has allergy
   to penicillins)
   -TEE to evaluate for persistent endocarditis
   -follow up blood and urine cultures
   -send nasal aspirate for influenza
   -send sputum culture
   -monitor fever curve
   -consult IP for thoracentesis today
   # hypotension: He is off of pressors with good blood pressures. A line
   pressure is much higher than cuff pressure, so unclear if he was really
   hypotensive in the ED for long. Lactate is and was normal so likely was
   not hypotensive for long.
   -monitor BP
   # pericardial effusion: He does not have tamponade physiology. He is
   off of pressors with good blood pressures. A line pressure is much
   higher than cuff pressure, so unclear if he was really hypotensive in
   the ED for long. Lactate was normal. No change in his aline tracing or
   CVP with respirations. No pulses.
   -check ECHO
   # altered mental status: likely secondary to infection. Also concern
   for worsening subdural hematomas given recent diagnosis. Head CT
   imaging prelim read does not suggest worsening bleed.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -follow up final CT head imaging read
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection. Does appear to
   have pneumonia but oxygenating well. Has a respiratory alkylosis as his
   PaCO2 is likely lower than his baseline.
   -pt now on pressure support, will resend gas this AM to further
   evaluate
   -h/o chronic CO2 retention so keep oxygen sats around 90-92 percent.
   -nebs prn given h/o RAD.
   # h/o subdural hematomas: no acute process on head CT here, but will
   follow up final read. Neuro exam is limited given sedation but appear
   non-focal.
   # aortic stenosis: valve area reportedly 0.9cm^2. When heading towards
   extubation, will also need to be careful with fluid shifts
   # anemia: chronic for the last few months since his illness began.
   Likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency (one report of
   colonic polyps removed). Currently at baseline since transfusion a few
   days ago.
   -monitor HCT
   -given CAD, AS and other illness, consider transfusion for HCT less
   than 25.
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr at his baseline over the last
   few months.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa, statin. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now as above.
   # DM2: hold oral agents and check finger sticks and use insulin sliding
   care.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue sinemet and requip.
   # FEN: NPO for now. If not extubated later today, will need to start
   diabetic tube feeds. IVF. replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, droplet (until influenza ruled out) and MRSA
   precautions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, bacteremia, and congestive heart failure. He presents to the ICU with altered mental status, fevers, and hypotension. The patient is intubated for airway protection and on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of chronic CO2 retention and asthma.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers, and there is a concern for persistent bacteremia, endocarditis, and pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but further evaluation with blood and urine cultures, sputum culture, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is needed.
2. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive but is currently off pressors with good blood pressures. Monitoring of blood pressure and the use of limited sedation are recommended.
3. Pericardial effusion: Although the patient does not have tamponade physiology, an echocardiogram should be done to assess the pericardial effusion.
4. Altered mental status: This could be secondary to infection or worsening subdural hematomas. Daily wake-up trials while intubated are necessary to assess mental status, and a follow-up final CT head imaging read is required.
5. Respiratory status: The patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male with complex recent medical history with significant and
   recurrent in blood stream infection now with recurrent fever and
   concern for systemic insult with either residual enterococcal
   endocarditis in the setting of only static action of Vancomycin or
   protected focus of infection in completely cleared by previous
   antibiotic source.  Differential, however is broad.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   -Patient with persistent right sided effusion following tap.
   -He has significant chest wall restriction with obesity and pleural
   disease.
   -Will maintain A/C support through procedures
   -Move to wean as possible following evaluate and treatment for initial
   complaint
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
Remaining possibilities are
   endocarditis as patient still have valve abnormality but this does
   appear to be
healed
.  This leaves epidural space infection raised as
   a remote but possible concern and with limited exam capacities will
   pursue MRI of spine as well.
   -Vancomycin/Meropenem
   -MRI head today and would extend to CTL spine given limited exam and
   concern for metastatic focus of infection.
   -LP if head unrevealing and suspicion remains high based upon exam or
   alternative findings.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)-_Parkinson's disease and acute
   illness--
   -Continue with dopamine agonists at baseline doses
   -MRI head today
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE-
   -Improving creatinine
   -Continue to renally dose medications
   -Will have to consider contrast choices with radiology carefully
   Additional issues to be addressed as identified and considered in the
   resident note of this day with which I agree.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a complex recent medical history and significant recurrent blood stream infection. The patient is currently experiencing recurrent fever and concern for systemic insult. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Residual enterococcal endocarditis: The patient has a history of endocarditis, and there is concern for residual infection due to the static action of Vancomycin.
2. Protected focus of infection: There is a possibility of a protected focus of infection from a previously cleared source.
3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient has persistent right-sided effusion following tap, significant chest wall restriction due to obesity and pleural disease, and requires airway control support.
4. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has systemic signs of infection but without organ dysfunction.
5. Endocarditis: Although the valve abnormality appears to be healed, there is still a concern for endocarditis.
6. Epidural space infection: This is raised as a remote but possible concern, and an MRI of the spine will be pursued to evaluate.
7. Altered mental status: The patient has Parkinson's disease and acute illness, and altered mental status may be present.
8. Acute renal failure: The patient has improving creatinine levels, and medications will be renally dosed.
9. Contrast choices with radiology: Careful consideration will be given to contrast choices due to the patient's renal function.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # Fevers:  Given fevers, positive sputum, and thick secretions,
   pneumonia most likely, with hospital acquired agents at top of list.
   GN diplococci raise concern for Moraxella and Acinetobacter   Still
   cannot r/o endocarditis per imaging, but less likely, and is currently
   being covered with vanco.  Endovascular infections at site of lines
   less likely given negative imaging and lack of consistent positive
   blood cx.  CNS source (epidural or paraspinal abscess) being worked up
   by imaging.
   -Await OSH echo results to compare new and old echo.
   -MRI to assess for septic emboli or abscess
 will obtain MRI of head
   and spine
   -continue to follow daily blood cx , check sputum cx.
   -check true vanco trough at 1:30 AM before vanco
   -Check with ID re: beginning doripenem for Gram-negative pneumonia.
   -hold on LP for now given good explanation of fevers.
   # altered mental status: likely secondary to infection. Head CT does
   not explain AMS.  MRI will provide better resolution of CNS structures
   and spine.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -MRI of head and spine to look for abscess
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection. Does appear to
   have pneumonia but oxygenating well.  Thoracentesis yesterday showing
   exudative process.  CXR today shows reaccumulation of fluid.  Pt was on
   CMV.
   -Consider re-starting PSV, but fully support today, given concern for
   pneumonia.  Do not diurese due to concern for infection
   # aortic stenosis: valve area reportedly 0.9cm^2. When heading towards
   extubation, will need to be careful with fluid shifts.
   # aortic regurgitation/endocarditis: will obtain Echo from outside
   hospital (being mailed here).  Possible new endocarditis vs. healed
   vegetation.  Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
   # anemia: chronic for the last few months since his illness began.
   Likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency (one report of
   colonic polyps removed). Currently at baseline since transfusion a few
   days ago.
   -monitor HCT
   -given CAD, AS and other illness, consider transfusion for HCT less
   than 25.
   -reconcile high dose of B12 with necessary dosing.
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr at his baseline over the last
   few months.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa, statin. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more
   hypertensive.
   # DM2: hold oral agents and check finger sticks and use insulin sliding
   care.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue sinemet and requip.
   # FEN: Start diabetic tube feeds.  replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, and MRSA precautions.
   # code status: full confirmed with wife
   # Access: right subclavian placed [**2168-11-15**]; right a line placed

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents from rehabilitation with altered mental status and fevers. 

The patient is currently intubated for airway protection due to pneumonia, as evidenced by positive sputum Gram stain showing GN diplococci and thick brown secretions. He is also on invasive ventilation. 

He has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.5°F (39.2°C), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 114/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

His laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal kidney function tests. 

The patient's physical examination reveals sluggish and reactive pupils, sclera edema, anicteric conjunctiva, normal s1/s2 heart sounds, a harsh early systolic murmur best heard at the base, course breath sounds with crackles, mild tenderness in the abdomen, trace edema in both lower extremities, and bilateral upper extremity tremor and cogwheel rigidity.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. The patient presents with altered mental status and fevers from a rehabilitation facility. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, possibly hospital-acquired, and is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem. The source of infection is still being investigated, with concerns about endocarditis, central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and line-related infections being ruled out.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, as he is intubated for airway protection. There are concerns about his ability to oxygenate well and the reaccumulation of pleural fluid. 

The patient also has aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation, and there are indications of possible endocarditis or healed vegetation. 

Other medical issues include anemia, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and Parkinson's disease. 

The patient's code status is full code. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's respiratory status, development of sepsis or septic shock, further deterioration of renal function, and complications related to his underlying medical conditions such as myocardial infarction or stroke."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # Fevers: Workup ongoing for infectious etiologies; no cultures thus
   far revealing.  TEE with healed vegetation on aortic valve with AR and
   aortic valve prolapse.
   -continue vancomycin and meropenem (allergy to PCN)
   -MRI to assess for septic emboli or abscess
 will obtain MRI of head
   and spine
   -U/S of upper extremities to look for septic thrombophlebitis with line
   infection
   -continue to follow cultures
   -f/u TEE results
   # altered mental status: likely secondary to infection. Head CT does
   not cause for altered mental status.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -MRI of head and spine to look for abscess
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection. Does appear to
   have pneumonia but oxygenating well.  Thoracentesis yesterday showing
   exudative process.  CXR today shows reaccumulation of fluid.  Pt was on
   PS yesterday and doing fine.
   -continue nebs PRN, will reassess and try PS today, consider extubation
   once studies complete
   # aortic stenosis: valve area reportedly 0.9cm^2. When heading towards
   extubation, will need to be careful with fluid shifts.
   # aortic regurgitation/endocarditis: will obtain Echo from outside
   hospital (being mailed here).  Possible new endocarditis vs. healed
   vegetation.  Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
   # anemia: chronic for the last few months since his illness began.
   Likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency (one report of
   colonic polyps removed). Currently at baseline since transfusion a few
   days ago.
   -monitor HCT
   -given CAD, AS and other illness, consider transfusion for HCT less
   than 25.
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr at his baseline over the last
   few months.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa, statin. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more
   hypertensive.
   # DM2: hold oral agents and check finger sticks and use insulin sliding
   care.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue sinemet and requip.
   # FEN: NPO for now. If not extubated later today, will need to start
   diabetic tube feeds. IVF. replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, droplet (until influenza ruled out) and MRSA
   precautions.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient with complex history of endocarditis and now admitted with
   recurrent fever and transient hypotension with source remaining to be
   defined.  THis is in the setting of Vancomycin and with concerning
   evolution of fevers to 102.5F overnight.  The sources being evaluated
   do include possible para-spinal or epidural collection as a metastatic
   focus of infection.  Issues identifeid at first pass evaluation of
   pleural effusion, possible persistent endocarditis simply do not appear
   to be active infection at this time.
   1)Respiratory Failure--Acute
   -Maintain PSV support is tolerated
   -Given increased secretions will maintain CMV support today until
   secretions have decreased and improved respiratory status maintained to
   allow weaning
   2)Fever/Sepsis-
   -WIll continue with Vancomycin dosing and will continue Meropenem
   -WIll need formal MRI [**Location (un) 118**]
   -Will need to discuss with ID the role of LP here but does seem less
   likely
   -LEgionella negative
   -SPutum--showing gram negative diplococci--Moraxella, Acinetobacter are
   possible concerns and will need to consider expansion of coverage given
   persistent high fevers.
   -I would argue the pulmonary source of infection is clearly most
   likely.
   3)Parkinson's Disease-
   -Versed/Fentanyl
   -Ropinorole
   -B12
   -Sinemet
   -Sedation level is excellent and will continue to dose Parkinson
   medications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis, respiratory failure, and fever. The patient has a complex medical history including endocarditis. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and a fever of 102.5°F.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation but it was stopped at 01:00 AM on November 18th. The patient has undergone several tests including transesophageal echo, ultrasound, and MRI. The MRI head and TLS spine are completed.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and lisinopril. The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin at 02:12 AM and meropenem at 04:03 AM. The patient is also receiving midazolam, fentanyl, and heparin sodium infusions.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is overweight/obese, normocephalic, and has a distant second heart sound with a systolic murmur. The patient's extremities show 1+ edema in both right and left legs. Neurological examination shows that the patient responds to tactile stimuli and follows commands for tongue protrusion and hand squeeze.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # Fevers:  Given fevers, positive sputum, and thick secretions,
   pneumonia most likely, with hospital acquired agents at top of list.
   GN diplococci raise concern for Moraxella and Acinetobacter   Still
   cannot r/o endocarditis per imaging, but less likely, and is currently
   being covered with vanco.  Endovascular infections at site of lines
   less likely given negative imaging and lack of consistent positive
   blood cx.  CNS source (epidural or paraspinal abscess) being worked up
   by imaging.
   -Await OSH echo results to compare new and old echo.
   -MRI to assess for septic emboli or abscess
 will obtain MRI of head
   and spine
   -continue to follow daily blood cx , check sputum cx.
   -check true vanco trough at 1:30 AM before vanco
   -Check with ID re: beginning doripenem for Gram-negative pneumonia.
   -hold on LP for now given good explanation of fevers.
   # altered mental status: likely secondary to infection. Head CT does
   not explain AMS.  MRI will provide better resolution of CNS structures
   and spine.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -MRI of head and spine to look for abscess
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection. Does appear to
   have pneumonia but oxygenating well.  Thoracentesis yesterday showing
   exudative process.  CXR today shows reaccumulation of fluid.  Pt was on
   CMV.
   -Consider re-starting PSV, but fully support today, given concern for
   pneumonia.  Do not diurese due to concern for infection
   # aortic stenosis: valve area reportedly 0.9cm^2. When heading towards
   extubation, will need to be careful with fluid shifts.
   # aortic regurgitation/endocarditis: will obtain Echo from outside
   hospital (being mailed here).  Possible new endocarditis vs. healed
   vegetation.  Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
   # anemia: chronic for the last few months since his illness began.
   Likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency (one report of
   colonic polyps removed). Currently at baseline since transfusion a few
   days ago.
   -monitor HCT
   -given CAD, AS and other illness, consider transfusion for HCT less
   than 25.
   -reconcile high dose of B12 with necessary dosing.
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr at his baseline over the last
   few months.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa, statin. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more
   hypertensive.
   # DM2: hold oral agents and check finger sticks and use insulin sliding
   care.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue sinemet and requip.
   # FEN: Start diabetic tube feeds.  replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, and MRSA precautions.
   # code status: full confirmed with wife
   # Access: right subclavian placed [**2168-11-15**]; right a line placed
   [**2168-11-15**].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents with altered mental status and fevers. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.5°F, blood pressure of 119/61 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is intubated for airway protection and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, as indicated by positive sputum cultures. 

His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies have been ordered to assess for septic emboli or abscess, including an MRI of the head and spine.

The patient's medical plan includes continuous monitoring of blood cultures, sputum cultures, and daily imaging. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover potential hospital-acquired agents. Additionally, the patient is receiving limited sedation, daily wake-up trials while intubated, and will undergo an echocardiogram from an outside hospital to evaluate for endocarditis.

Other notable issues include chronic anemia, chronic renal insufficiency stage 4, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, hypertension, Parkinson's disease, and hypotension requiring vasopressor support.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening respiratory status, development of septic emboli or abscess, progression of endocarditis, renal failure, and further deterioration of mental status. Close monitoring and prompt management of these conditions are crucial for the patient's well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # Fevers:  Given fevers, positive sputum, and thick secretions,
   pneumonia most likely, with hospital acquired agents at top of list.
   Sputum positive for Acinetobacter with only intermediate sensitivity to
   imepenem.  Continued fever likely due to undertreated acinetobacter
   pulmonary infection.  Still cannot r/o active endocarditis per imaging
   and recent embolic event concerning for active endocarditis. MRI showed
   no epidural abscess, u/s showed no thrombophlebitis.
   -Await OSH echo results to compare new and old echo.
   -continue to follow daily blood cx , check sputum cx.
   -check urine Cx.
   -ID input appreciated.
   -changed antibiotics to Tobramycin and Unasyn as indicated by
   acinetobacter sensitivities from sputum culture.
   -hold on LP for now given good explanation of fevers.
   #Hypotension: Patient with episode of hypotension w/SBPs down to 70
   in am yesterday.  Gave NS initially but only minimally fluid
   responsive. Gave 2U of PRBCs.  Patient started on Levophed but
   developed a run of ventricular tachycardia.  Levophed changed to
   neosynephrine, which patient tolerated much better.  Likely etiology is
   septic shock. CE negative. CXR w/out pneumothorax. Pressors stopped at
   8pm yesterday, patient normotensive overnight.
   #CVA: acute embolic stroke on MRI
   - no heparin now as per neurology
   - carotid u/s ordered
   - neurology  to follow
   # altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection. Head CT, MRI do
   not explain AMS as per neurology.  Improving mental status
 patient
   able to follow simple commands (like moving feet).
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   - to consider LP as per neuro recs
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection. Does appear to
   have pneumonia but oxygenating well.  Thoracentesis showed exudative
   process.  CXRs since have showed a reaccumulation of fluid.
   -Consider re-starting PSV, but fully support today, given concern for
   pneumonia.  Do not diurese due to concern for infection
   # aortic stenosis: valve area reportedly 0.9cm^2. When heading towards
   extubation, will need to be careful with fluid shifts.
   # aortic regurgitation/endocarditis: will obtain Echo from outside
   hospital (being mailed here).  Possible new endocarditis vs. healed
   vegetation.  Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
   - will discuss with cardiology when would be an appropriate time to
   consult CT surgery regarding valve replacement
   # anemia: chronic for the last few months since his illness began.
   Likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency (one report of
   colonic polyps removed). Currently at baseline since transfusion a few
   days ago.
   -monitor HCT
   -given CAD, AS and other illness, consider transfusion for HCT less
   than 25.
   -reconcile high dose of B12 with necessary dosing.
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr at his baseline over the last
   few months.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa, statin. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more
   hypertensive.
   # DM2: hold oral agents and check finger sticks and use insulin sliding
   care.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue sinemet and requip.
   # FEN: Start diabetic tube feeds.  replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, and MRSA precautions. Order for pneumabed placed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents with altered mental status and fevers. The patient has been diagnosed with Acinetobacter pneumonia, which is resistant to imipenem, and has been started on tobramycin and Unasyn as per the sensitivity results. He also has aortic regurgitation with vegetation on the aortic valve, and there is concern for endocarditis. The patient has experienced an episode of hypotension, likely secondary to septic shock. He has an acute embolic stroke, and neurology is following up on this. The patient's respiratory status requires intubation for airway protection. There are concerns about chronic anemia, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, hypertension, Parkinson's disease, and feeding intolerance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing further infections due to his compromised immune system and the presence of multiple lines, tubes, and catheters.
2. Endocarditis: Given the vegetation on the aortic valve and the symptoms of fever, altered mental status, and embolic events, there is a possibility of active endocarditis.
3. Pneumonia: The patient already has Acinetobacter pneumonia, and there"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are altered mental status and respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU and has experienced several medical complications.

1. Fever: The patient has had a fever ranging from 100.9 to 102.5 degrees Celsius. This could indicate an infection or inflammatory response in the body.

2. Hypotension: The patient has shown episodes of low blood pressure, which may be related to septic shock or other causes of poor perfusion.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support due to acute respiratory failure. This indicates severe impairment in the ability to breathe independently.

4. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. Sepsis is a systemic response to infection, characterized by fever, hypotension, and abnormal laboratory findings.

5. Unknown Origin Fever: Despite efforts to identify the source of the fever, its origin remains unknown. This suggests that the underlying cause of the fever may not have been identified yet.

6. Chronic Anemia: The patient has a history of chronic anemia, which could contribute to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.

7. Acinetobacter infection: The patient's sputum culture revealed growth of Acinetobacter, a type of bacteria commonly associated with hospital-acquired infections. Antibiotic therapy has been initiated to treat this infection.

8. Right Frontal Lobe Infarct: The patient's"

   Patient with complex history of endocarditis and now admitted with
   recurrent fever and transient hypotension with source remaining to be
   defined.  THis is in the setting of Vancomycin and with concerning
   evolution of fevers to 102.5F overnight.  The sources being evaluated
   do include possible para-spinal or epidural collection as a metastatic
   focus of infection.  Issues identifeid at first pass evaluation of
   pleural effusion, possible persistent endocarditis simply do not appear
   to be active infection at this time.
   1)Respiratory Failure--Acute
   -Maintain PSV support is tolerated
   -Given increased secretions will maintain CMV support today until
   secretions have decreased and improved respiratory status maintained to
   allow weaning
   2)Fever/Sepsis-
   -WIll continue with Vancomycin dosing and will continue Meropenem
   -WIll need formal MRI [**Location (un) 118**]
   -Will need to discuss with ID the role of LP here but does seem less
   likely
   -LEgionella negative
   -SPutum--showing gram negative diplococci--Moraxella, Acinetobacter are
   possible concerns and will need to consider expansion of coverage given
   persistent high fevers.
   -I would argue the pulmonary source of infection is clearly most
   likely.
   3)Parkinson's Disease-
   -Versed/Fentanyl
   -Ropinorole
   -B12
   -Sinemet
   -Sedation level is excellent and will continue to dose Parkinson

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with a complex history of endocarditis, recurrent fever, transient hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and tidal volume (Vt) set at 600 mL. The respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube.

The patient has a history of anemia, chronic shock, septic hypotension, fever of unknown origin, respiratory failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's mental status is altered but not delirium.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and elevated troponin-T level. The blood culture is negative for growth. The sputum culture shows Acinetobacter, while the urine culture is negative. The chest X-ray reveals profound volume overload compared to yesterday.

The patient's assessment and plan include acute respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and altered mental status. The patient will continue with Vancomycin dosing and Meropenem therapy. An MRI is needed to evaluate the source of infection. The role of lumbar puncture (LP) is being discussed with the infectious disease (ID) specialist. Coverage for Mor"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of endocarditis. They were admitted with recurrent fever and transient hypotension, with the source of infection still to be determined. The patient's fever has increased to 102.5°F overnight. Possible sources of infection include para-spinal or epidural collection as a metastatic focus of infection, as well as persistent endocarditis.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is being managed with continuous mechanical ventilation support until secretions decrease and respiratory status improves. This is occurring in the setting of sepsis.
2. Fever/Sepsis: The leading differential for the patient's fever is an undertreated Acinetobacter pneumonia. The patient will continue receiving Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Tobra (with redosing). Other potential sources include endovascular infections with vegetation on the aortic valve (though no positive blood culture), lines, and urine. If persistent fevers occur, a repeat torso CT may be considered.
3. Parkinson's Disease: The patient's Parkinson's disease is being managed with Versed/Fentanyl for sedation, Ropinorole for medication, B12 supplementation, Sinemet, and other Parkinson medications. The sedation level is adequate, and Parkinson medications will continue to be dosed.

ICU Care:
The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition through Fibersource HN (Full"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several medical complications. The patient's chief complaints are altered mental status and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of endocarditis and is currently experiencing recurrent fever and transient hypotension. The source of infection remains to be defined.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1) Respiratory Failure: Acute respiratory failure is present due to sepsis. The patient will continue to receive CMV support until secretions decrease and respiratory status improves, allowing for weaning.
2) Shock: The patient required aggressive IV fluid resuscitation and vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAPS) of 65. The patient was able to wean off Neo but needs close monitoring and may require restart if MAPS fall.
3) Fever/Sepsis: The leading differential is undertreated Acinetobacter pneumonia. The patient will continue with Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Tobra (with level and redose). Other sources include endovascular with vegetation on AVR (though no positive blood culture), lines, and urine follow-up culture. If persistent fevers, a repeat torso CT may be considered.

Other issues mentioned in the note include Parkinson's disease, which requires continued dosing of Parkinson medications. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, VAP prevention, communication with the family, code status,"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # Fevers:  Given fevers, positive sputum, and thick secretions,
   pneumonia most likely, with hospital acquired agents at top of list.
   Sputum positive for Acinetobacter with only intermediate sensitivity to
   imepenem.  Continued fever likely due to undertreated acinetobacter
   pulmonary infection.  Still cannot r/o active endocarditis per imaging
   and recent embolic event concerning for active endocarditis. MRI showed
   no epidural abscess, u/s showed no thrombophlebitis.
   -Await OSH echo results to compare new and old echo.
   -continue to follow daily blood cx , check sputum cx.
   -check urine Cx.
   -ID input appreciated.
   -changed antibiotics to Tobramycin and Unasyn as indicated by
   acinetobacter sensitivities from sputum culture.
   -hold on LP for now given good explanation of fevers.
   #Hypotension: Patient with episode of hypotension w/SBPs down to 70
   in am yesterday.  Gave NS initially but only minimally fluid
   responsive. Gave 2U of PRBCs.  Patient started on Levophed but
   developed a run of ventricular tachycardia.  Levophed changed to
   neosynephrine, which patient tolerated much better.  Likely etiology is
   septic shock. CE negative. CXR w/out pneumothorax. Pressors stopped at
   8pm yesterday, patient normotensive overnight.
   #CVA: acute embolic stroke on MRI
   - no heparin now as per neurology
   - carotid u/s ordered
   - neurology  to follow
   # altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection. Head CT, MRI do
   not explain AMS as per neurology.  Improving mental status
 patient
   able to follow simple commands (like moving feet).
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   - to consider LP as per neuro recs
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection. Does appear to
   have pneumonia but oxygenating well.  Thoracentesis showed exudative
   process.  CXRs since have showed a reaccumulation of fluid.
   -Consider re-starting PSV, but fully support today, given concern for
   pneumonia.  Do not diurese due to concern for infection
   # aortic stenosis: valve area reportedly 0.9cm^2. When heading towards
   extubation, will need to be careful with fluid shifts.
   # aortic regurgitation/endocarditis: will obtain Echo from outside
   hospital (being mailed here).  Possible new endocarditis vs. healed
   vegetation.  Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
   - will discuss with cardiology when would be an appropriate time to
   consult CT surgery regarding valve replacement
   # anemia: chronic for the last few months since his illness began.
   Likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency (one report of
   colonic polyps removed). Currently at baseline since transfusion a few
   days ago.
   -monitor HCT
   -given CAD, AS and other illness, consider transfusion for HCT less
   than 25.
   -reconcile high dose of B12 with necessary dosing.
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr at his baseline over the last
   few months.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa, statin. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more
   hypertensive.
   # DM2: hold oral agents and check finger sticks and use insulin sliding
   care.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue sinemet and requip.
   # FEN: Start diabetic tube feeds.  replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, and MRSA precautions. Order for pneumabed placed.
   # code status: full confirmed with wife
   # Access: right subclavian placed [**2168-11-15**]; right a line placed
   [**2168-11-15**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic anemia, chronic shock, septic hypotension, fever of unknown origin, acute respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and altered mental status. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 148. The patient's blood pressure is stable with a mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg. The patient has been given different antibiotics including meropenem, Unasyn, and tobramycin due to a penicillin allergy. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. The patient's serum troponin T level is within normal range. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating, ranging from 116 mg/dL to 180 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are mostly within normal limits. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 363.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # Fevers:  Given fevers, positive sputum, and thick secretions,
   pneumonia most likely, with hospital acquired agents at top of list.
   Sputum positive for Acinetobacter with only intermediate sensitivity to
   imepenem.  Continued fever likely due to undertreated acinetobacter
   pulmonary infection.  Still cannot r/o active endocarditis per imaging
   and recent embolic event concerning for active endocarditis. MRI showed
   no epidural abscess, u/s showed no thrombophlebitis.
   -Await OSH echo results to compare new and old echo.
   -continue to follow daily blood cx , check sputum cx.
   -check urine Cx.
   -ID input appreciated.
   -changed antibiotics to Tobramycin and Unasyn as indicated by
   acinetobacter sensitivities from sputum culture.  Checking Tobra peak &
   trough.
   -hold on LP for now given good explanation of fevers.
   #Hypotension: Patient with episode of hypotension w/SBPs down to 70
   in am [**11-18**].  Gave NS initially but only minimally fluid responsive.
   Gave 2U of PRBCs.  Patient started on Levophed but developed a run of
   ventricular tachycardia.  Levophed changed to neosynephrine, which
   patient tolerated much better.  Likely etiology is septic shock. CE
   negative. CXR w/out pneumothorax. Pressors stopped at 8pm [**11-18**],
   patient normotensive overnight.
   #CVA: acute embolic stroke on MRI
   - no heparin now as per neurology
   - carotid u/s ordered
   - neurology  to follow
   # altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection. Head CT, MRI do
   not explain AMS as per neurology.  Improving mental status
 patient
   able to follow simple commands (like moving feet).
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   - to consider LP as per neuro recs
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection. Does appear to
   have pneumonia but oxygenating well.  Thoracentesis showed exudative
   process.  CXRs since have showed a reaccumulation of fluid.
   -Trial of PSV today.
   - Hold diuresis for now given hypotension with sedation, but will give
   Lasix if >2L + for day
   # aortic stenosis: valve area reportedly 0.9cm^2. When heading towards
   extubation, will need to be careful with fluid shifts.
   # aortic regurgitation/endocarditis: will obtain Echo from outside
   hospital (being mailed here).  Possible new endocarditis vs. healed
   vegetation.  Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
   - CT surgery consulted regarding appropriateness and timing of aortic
   valve replacement
   # anemia: chronic for the last few months since his illness began.
   Likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency (one report of
   colonic polyps removed). Currently at baseline since transfusion a few
   days ago.
   -monitor HCT
   -given CAD, AS and other illness, consider transfusion for HCT less
   than 25.
   -reconcile high dose of B12 with necessary dosing.
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier this
   year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa, statin. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more
   hypertensive.
   # DM2: hold oral agents and check finger sticks and use insulin sliding
   care; iss increased.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue sinemet and requip.
   # FEN: Start diabetic tube feeds.  replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, and MRSA precautions. Order for pneumabed placed.
   # code status: full confirmed with wife
   # Access: right subclavian placed [**2168-11-15**]; right a line placed
   [**2168-11-15**].

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, specifically Acinetobacter infection that is resistant to imipenem. There are concerns about active endocarditis, as evidenced by an embolic event and positive sputum culture for Acinetobacter. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/62 to 87/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has sluggish but reactive pupils and exhibits signs of discomfort.

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,995 mL and output of 1,590 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,405 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation, with a tidal volume set at 600 mL and respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 40%, and the respiratory system compliance is 29.7 cmH2O/mL.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.4 K/uL"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. The patient's chief complaints include respiratory distress and shock. 

The patient has a complex medical history of endocarditis and is currently admitted with recurrent fever and transient hypotension, with the source of infection still to be defined. The patient's vital signs indicate a fever, with a temperature of 37.8 C (100 F). The patient's blood pressure is 96/48 mmHg, which is below the normal range, indicating hypotension. The respiratory rate is within normal limits at 14 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95%, which is within normal range. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 236 K/uL, indicating an infection. Other lab results, such as hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolytes, are within normal limits. 

The patient's physical examination reveals altered mental status, possibly due to sepsis or other underlying conditions. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL and respiratory rate (RR) set at 14 breaths per minute. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 363, indicating adequate oxygenation. 

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, acute; sepsis without"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history, including endocarditis, who is currently admitted for recurrent fever and transient hypotension. The patient's condition is characterized by acute respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and altered mental status. The patient has multiple allergies to medications such as Tagamet, Ditropan, Penicillins, and Lisinopril. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/45 mmHg to 147/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving several medications and treatments in the ICU, including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and prophylactic antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially develop into severe ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). Close monitoring and supportive care, such as mechanical ventilation, will be crucial to manage this condition.

2. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and fever indicate the possibility of septic shock. This condition can progress rapidly and lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly and effectively with aggressive fluid resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

3. Endocarditis: The patient's history of endocard"

   Patient with complex history of endocarditis and now admitted with
   recurrent fever and transient hypotension with source remaining to be
   defined.
   1) Respiratory Failure
Acute
 now with sig. volume challenge in
   setting of sepsis. Had been doing better but dropped BP a few days ago
   and received more IVF Still he is more awake today and will try back on
   PSV and to run even to slightly negative
   2) Acinetobacter PNA: on Tobra
needs repeat level and redose
 clarify
   regimen with pharmacy (esp with his Cr 1.8)
   3) Shock
 resolved, has been normotensive. Would try to run even to
   500 cc negative before fluids begin to further impact  his respiratory
   status
   4) Fever/Sepsis- Leading differential is undertreated Acinetobacter PNA
   Will continue with Vancomycin, Meropenem, Tobra (needs level and
   redose) But considered other sources including  endovascular with
   vegetation on AVR (though no pos blood cx), lines, urine
 follow cx,
   if persistent fevers could also repeat TORSO CT for better look
   3)Parkinson's Disease- Sinemet
   -Ropinorole
   -B12
   Sedation level is adequate and will continue to dose Parkinson
   medications.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history, including endocarditis. They have been admitted for recurrent fever and transient hypotension, with the source of infection yet to be determined. The patient's condition includes acute respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and altered mental status. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected Acinetobacter pneumonia. They are also being treated for shock, which has resolved, and fever/sepsis. Other considerations include Parkinson's disease and potential sources of infection such as lines, urine, or endovascular issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure is a critical concern. The administration of appropriate ventilation support and careful management of fluid balance will be essential in preventing further deterioration.

2. Sepsis: Given the patient's recurrent fever and hypotension, sepsis is a significant concern. Timely administration of appropriate antibiotics and source control measures are crucial to managing this condition effectively.

3. Endocarditis: The patient's history of endocarditis increases the risk of recurrent infections and potential complications such as heart valve dysfunction. Close monitoring for signs of endocarditis progression or embolic events will be necessary.

4. Acinetobacter Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for suspected Acinetobacter pneumonia. Close monitoring of the patient's response to antibiotics and adjustment of the treatment regimen based on culture results and drug levels"

   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # Fevers:  Given fevers, positive sputum, and thick secretions,
   pneumonia most likely, with hospital acquired agents at top of list.
   Sputum positive for Acinetobacter with only intermediate sensitivity to
   imipenem.  Continued low-grade fever likely due to undertreated
   acinetobacter pulmonary infection (only on day 2 of appropriate
   antibiotics).  However, if patient remains febrile, will need to search
   for other sources of infection.  Other possible sources- endocarditis:
   cannot r/o active endocarditis per imaging and recent embolic event
   concerning for active endocarditis.  Thrombophlebitis- less likely
   given negative LENI/UENI.  CNS sources-MRI showed no epidural or
   intracranial abscesses.  C. diff was negative on [**11-16**], but if
   re-spikes, can consider C. diff
   -Await OSH echo results to compare new and old echo.
   -continue to follow daily blood cx
   -check urine Cx.
   -ID input appreciated.
   -changed antibiotics to Tobramycin and Unasyn as indicated by
   acinetobacter sensitivities from sputum culture.  Tobra peak was at
   goal, tobra trough was appropriate per ID.
   -Need to re-check peak and trough in [**2-7**] days or if creatinine
   clearance changes by [**5-14**] mL/hour
   -hold on LP for now given good explanation of fevers.
   #CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic
   - no heparin now as per neurology
   - carotid u/s ordered, f/u today
   - neurology  to follow
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection. Does appear to
   have pneumonia but oxygenating well, did not tolerate PSV last night.
   Probably is somewhat volume overloaded given resuscitation over the
   weekend and CXR, but need to be careful [**2-6**] recent hypotension.
   -Trial of PSV today at 15/5.
   -Lasix 10 mg IV x1 today to maintain stable volume status.
   # altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to be
   improving today.  Head CT, MRI do not explain AMS as per neurology.
   Improving mental status
 patient able to follow simple commands (like
   moving feet).
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   - to consider LP as per neuro recs
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient

   #Hypotension: Patient with episode of hypotension w/SBPs down to 70
   in am [**11-18**].  Pressures improved with NS and 2U of PRBCs.  Patient
   started on Levophed but developed a run of ventricular tachycardia.
   Levophed changed to neosynephrine, which patient tolerated much
   better.  Likely etiology is septic shock. CE negative.  CXR w/out
   pneumothorax.  CTA not yet performed to r/o PE, but less likely given
   pt
s improvement.  Pressors stopped at 8pm [**11-18**], patient normotensive
   since.
   # aortic valve disease/endocarditis: Pt has severe aortic stenosis (<1
   cm2) with aortic valve prolapse and AR.  Will obtain Echo from outside
   hospital (being mailed here).  Echo shows possible new endocarditis vs.
   healed vegetation.  Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum
   antibiotics.
   - CT surgery consulted regarding appropriateness and timing of aortic
   valve replacement
   # anemia: chronic for the last few months since his illness began.
   Likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency (one report of
   colonic polyps removed). Currently at baseline since transfusion a few
   days ago.
   -monitor HCT
   -given CAD, AS and other illness, consider transfusion for HCT less
   than 25.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents with altered mental status and fevers from a rehabilitation facility. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter, which is sensitive to imipenem. However, he remains febrile, indicating that the infection may not be fully treated yet. Other potential sources of infection include endocarditis, thrombophlebitis, and central nervous system (CNS) infections, but these have been ruled out based on imaging and negative test results.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to his intubation for airway protection and evidence of pneumonia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV). The chest X-ray shows mild increased opacities at the lung base, suggesting possible fluid overload.

In terms of cardiovascular status, the patient has severe aortic stenosis and aortic valve prolapse with aortic regurgitation. There is suspicion of endocarditis, and a cardiac ultrasound has been ordered to further evaluate the situation. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Additionally, the patient has chronic renal insufficiency stage 4, and his medication dosages need to be adjusted accordingly. He also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, bacteremia, coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, and Parkinson's disease. The patient presented from rehabilitation with altered mental status and fevers.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, most likely caused by hospital-acquired agents, and Acinetobacter infection with intermediate sensitivity to imipenem. Antibiotics have been changed to tobramycin and Unasyn based on the sensitivity results. The patient's blood cultures are being monitored, and a sputum culture is pending.

The patient also experienced an episode of hypotension with systolic blood pressure down to 70 mmHg, which was likely due to septic shock. Pressors were initiated and stopped overnight, and the patient remained normotensive.

The patient had an acute embolic stroke, as shown on MRI, and carotid ultrasound has been ordered. Neurology is following the patient's condition.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he is still intubated for airway protection. He appears to have pneumonia, and thoracentesis showed an exudative process. A trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) has been initiated, and diuresis has been held due to hypotension with sedation.

The patient has aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.9 cm^2, and careful fluid shifts will be necessary when considering extubation. There is also a suspicion of aortic regurgitation/endocarditis, and an outside echo will be obtained for comparison.

The patient's anemia is chronic and likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency. It has been stabilized since the recent transfusion. Monitoring of hematocrit (HCT) is ongoing, and consideration for transfusion is being made for HCT less than 25.

The patient has chronic renal insufficiency stage 4, and medications are being adjusted accordingly. The patient's other medical conditions, such as coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, hypertension, Parkinson's disease, and hyperglycemia, are being managed with appropriate medications and dosages.

The patient's code status is full code, and his wife has been informed and confirmed as the contact person."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male admitted with recurrent sepsis and persistent ventilatory failure. The patient also has a fever without a clear source defined. The patient's medical history includes Parkinson's disease and previous endocarditis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrence of endocarditis: The patient's history of endocarditis and current symptoms of fever and sepsis suggest a possible recurrence of the condition. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may have been caused by pneumonia. There is also an issue of volume overload due to the required fluids for transient decreases in blood pressure. The patient may need to be weaned off the ventilator with stable oxygen requirements and diuresis to manage fluid overload.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has an altered mental status, possibly due to the combination of Parkinson's disease, sedating medications, and an infectious insult. Neurological evaluation and supportive measures are recommended.
4. Fluid overload: The patient may be at risk of fluid overload due to the administration of fluids for transient decreases in blood pressure. Diuretics may be needed to manage this condition.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and implement appropriate interventions to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection.  Tolerated until
   PSV last night, when he had low lung volumes, increased RR, and ABG
   showing worsening hypercarbia.  Pt may have some muscular weakness, due
   to prolonged illness and multiple intubations.   Worsening secretions
   and continuing A-a gradient argue for potential pneumonia and CHF
   contribution.  Probably is somewhat volume overloaded given
   resuscitation over the weekend and CXR
   -Continue PSV, attempt to wean.  If patient begins to fail, switch to
   AC.
   -diurese today to net -1L.  Effusion likely not contributing to
   clinical picture and may improve with diuresis.
   -3PM lytes
   # Fevers:  Given fevers, positive sputum, and thick secretions,
   pneumonia most likely, with hospital acquired agents at top of list.
   Sputum positive for Acinetobacter with only intermediate sensitivity to
   imipenem.  Was afebrile most of the day, now that he is appropriately
   covered.  However, if patient spikes again, will need to search for
   other sources of infection.  Other possible sources- endocarditis:
   cannot r/o active endocarditis per imaging and recent embolic event
   concerning for active endocarditis.  Thrombophlebitis- less likely
   given negative LENI/UENI.  CNS sources-MRI showed no epidural or
   intracranial abscesses.  C. diff was negative on [**11-16**], but if
   re-spikes, can consider C. diff
   -Await OSH echo results to compare new and old echo.
   -continue to follow daily blood cx
   -check sputum Cx.
   -ID input appreciated.
   -changed antibiotics to Tobramycin and Unasyn as indicated by
   acinetobacter sensitivities from sputum culture.  Tobra peak was at
   goal, tobra trough was appropriate per ID.
   -Need to re-check peak and trough in [**2-7**] days or if creatinine
   clearance changes by [**5-14**] mL/hour
   -hold on LP for now given good explanation of fevers.
   -d/c metronidazole added for empiric sepsis coverage.
   -vanco trough in AM
   -If patient does well today, consider d/c
ing vanco, which was added
   for potential recurrent endocarditis, but is now less likely given
   absence of positive cultures.
   # aortic valve disease/endocarditis: Pt is being treated with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics, but no evidence of active infection.  CT
   surgery consulted, says surgery not necessary at this time.
   -Will obtain Echo from outside hospital (being mailed here)
   #CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic
   - no heparin now as per neurology
   -negative carotid ultrasound
   d/c statin, as not needed right now per neuro.
   - neurology  to follow
   # altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to be
   improving today.  Head CT, MRI do not explain AMS as per neurology.
   Improving mental status
 patient able to follow simple commands (like
   moving feet).
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   - to consider LP as per neuro recs
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   #Hypotension: Patient with episode of hypotension w/SBPs down to 70
   in am [**11-18**].  Pressures improved with NS and 2U of PRBCs.  Patient
   started on Levophed but developed a run of ventricular tachycardia.
   Levophed changed to neosynephrine, which patient tolerated much
   better.  Likely etiology is septic shock. CE negative.  CXR w/out
   pneumothorax.  CTA not yet performed to r/o PE, but less likely given
   pt
s improvement.  Pressors stopped at 8pm [**11-18**], patient normotensive
   since.
   # anemia: chronic for the last few months since his illness began.
   Likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency.  At baseline
   now.
   -monitor HCT.  Given clinical context, transfuse for Hct<25
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier this
   year.

   hypertensive.
   # HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents with altered mental status and fevers. He is intubated for airway protection and has been on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but experienced hypercarbia with low tidal volumes, so he was switched back to controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV).

The patient has an effusion likely not contributing to the clinical picture and may improve with diuresis. He has been febrile with positive sputum culture for Acinetobacter, which is sensitive to imipenem. His antibiotic regimen has been changed accordingly. The source of infection could be pneumonia, and other potential sources such as endocarditis, thrombophlebitis, and CNS sources have been ruled out.

The patient had an episode of hypotension but is now normotensive. Pressors were stopped, and he has been stable since. He has chronic anemia likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency. His renal insufficiency is stage 4, and he is on calcitriol and renally dosed medications. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), DM2, hypothyroidism, Parkinson's disease, and falls (FEN).

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely caused by hospital-acquired agents, and is being treated with antibiotics (tobramycin and Unasyn) based on the sensitivity of Acinetobacter from the sputum culture. Other possible sources of infection include endocarditis, thrombophlebitis, and CNS sources, but they have been ruled out with imaging studies. Clostridium difficile was negative on 11-16, but if the patient re-spikes, it may be considered.

The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to infection and is improving. He is able to follow simple commands and move all four limbs. The head CT and MRI do not explain the altered mental status, and a lumbar puncture has been held for now.

The patient had an episode of hypotension with systolic blood pressures down to 70 on 11-18, which improved with normal saline and 2 units of packed red blood cells. He was started on levophed but developed ventricular tach"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection.  Tolerated until
   PSV last night, when he had low lung volumes, increased RR, and ABG
   showing worsening hypercarbia.  Pt may have some muscular weakness, due
   to prolonged illness and multiple intubations.   Worsening secretions
   and continuing A-a gradient argue for potential pneumonia and CHF
   contribution.  Probably is somewhat volume overloaded given
   resuscitation over the weekend and CXR, but need to be careful [**2-6**]
   recent hypotension.
   -Trial of PSV today at 15/5.
   -Lasix 10 mg IV x1 today to maintain stable volume status.
   # Fevers:  Given fevers, positive sputum, and thick secretions,
   pneumonia most likely, with hospital acquired agents at top of list.
   Sputum positive for Acinetobacter with only intermediate sensitivity to
   imipenem.  Continued low-grade fever likely due to undertreated
   acinetobacter pulmonary infection (only on day 2 of appropriate
   antibiotics).  However, if patient remains febrile, will need to search
   for other sources of infection.  Other possible sources- endocarditis:
   cannot r/o active endocarditis per imaging and recent embolic event
   concerning for active endocarditis.  Thrombophlebitis- less likely
   given negative LENI/UENI.  CNS sources-MRI showed no epidural or
   intracranial abscesses.  C. diff was negative on [**11-16**], but if
   re-spikes, can consider C. diff
   -Await OSH echo results to compare new and old echo.
   -continue to follow daily blood cx
   -check urine Cx.
   -ID input appreciated.
   -changed antibiotics to Tobramycin and Unasyn as indicated by
   acinetobacter sensitivities from sputum culture.  Tobra peak was at
   goal, tobra trough was appropriate per ID.
   -Need to re-check peak and trough in [**2-7**] days or if creatinine
   clearance changes by [**5-14**] mL/hour
   -hold on LP for now given good explanation of fevers.
   -decrease metronidazole that was added for empiric coverage
   # aortic valve disease/endocarditis: Pt has severe aortic stenosis (<1
   cm2) with aortic valve prolapse and AR.  Echo shows possible new
   endocarditis vs. healed vegetation.  Pt is being treated with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics. CT surgery consulted, says surgery not
   necessary at this time.
   -Will obtain Echo from outside hospital (being mailed here
   #CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic
   - no heparin now as per neurology
   - carotid u/s ordered, f/u today
   - neurology  to follow
   -d/c statin, as not needed right now per neuro.
   # altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to be
   improving today.  Head CT, MRI do not explain AMS as per neurology.
   Improving mental status
 patient able to follow simple commands (like
   moving feet).
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   - to consider LP as per neuro recs
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   #Hypotension: Patient with episode of hypotension w/SBPs down to 70
   in am [**11-18**].  Pressures improved with NS and 2U of PRBCs.  Patient
   started on Levophed but developed a run of ventricular tachycardia.
   Levophed changed to neosynephrine, which patient tolerated much
   better.  Likely etiology is septic shock. CE negative.  CXR w/out
   pneumothorax.  CTA not yet performed to r/o PE, but less likely given
   pt
s improvement.  Pressors stopped at 8pm [**11-18**], patient normotensive
   since.
   # anemia: chronic for the last few months since his illness began.
   Likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency (one report of
   colonic polyps removed). Currently at baseline since transfusion a few
   days ago.
   -monitor HCT
   -given CAD, AS and other illness, consider transfusion for HCT less
   than 25.
   -reconcile high dose of B12 with necessary dosing.
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier this
   year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa, statin. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more
   hypertensive.
   # HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # DM2: using ISS; will increase for hyperglycemia.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue carbidopa/levodopa and requip.
   # FEN: Start diabetic tube feeds.  replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, and MRSA precautions. Order for pneumabed placed.
   # code status: full confirmed with wife
   # Access: right subclavian placed [**2168-11-15**]; right a line placed

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia, who presents from a rehabilitation facility with altered mental status and fevers. The patient is intubated for airway protection and has been on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's respiratory status has been a concern, with episodes of hypercarbia and low tidal volumes while on pressure support ventilation (PSV). He was switched back to conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) due to these issues. The patient's chest X-ray shows possible pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF) contribution, indicating potential volume overload.

The patient's fevers are attributed to a suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia, with Acinetobacter species identified in the sputum culture. The patient is being treated with appropriate antibiotics, but remains febrile. Other potential sources of infection, such as endocarditis and central nervous system (CNS) infections, have been ruled out through imaging and negative cultures.

The patient's aortic valve disease/endocarditis is severe, with a new echo showing possible new endocarditis versus healed vegetation. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and cardiac surgery consultation indicates that surgery is not necessary at this time.

The patient also experienced hypotension, which improved with fluid resuscitation and packed red blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # Fevers:  Given fevers, positive sputum, and thick secretions,
   pneumonia most likely, with hospital acquired agents at top of list.
   Sputum positive for Acinetobacter with only intermediate sensitivity to
   imipenem.  Continued low-grade fever likely due to undertreated
   acinetobacter pulmonary infection (only on day 2 of appropriate
   antibiotics).  However, if patient remains febrile, will need to search
   for other sources of infection.  Other possible sources- endocarditis:
   cannot r/o active endocarditis per imaging and recent embolic event
   concerning for active endocarditis.  Thrombophlebitis- less likely
   given negative LENI/UENI.  CNS sources-MRI showed no epidural or
   intracranial abscesses.  C. diff was negative on [**11-16**], but if
   re-spikes, can consider C. diff
   -Await OSH echo results to compare new and old echo.
   -continue to follow daily blood cx
   -check urine Cx.
   -ID input appreciated.
   -changed antibiotics to Tobramycin and Unasyn as indicated by
   acinetobacter sensitivities from sputum culture.  Tobra peak was at
   goal, tobra trough was appropriate per ID.
   -Need to re-check peak and trough in [**2-7**] days or if creatinine
   clearance changes by [**5-14**] mL/hour
   -hold on LP for now given good explanation of fevers.
   #CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic
   - no heparin now as per neurology
   - carotid u/s ordered, f/u today
   - neurology  to follow
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection. Does appear to
   have pneumonia but oxygenating well, did not tolerate PSV last night.
   Probably is somewhat volume overloaded given resuscitation over the
   weekend and CXR, but need to be careful [**2-6**] recent hypotension.
   -Trial of PSV today at 15/5.
   -Lasix 10 mg IV x1 today to maintain stable volume status.
   # altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to be
   improving today.  Head CT, MRI do not explain AMS as per neurology.
   Improving mental status
 patient able to follow simple commands (like
   moving feet).
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   - to consider LP as per neuro recs
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   #Hypotension: Patient with episode of hypotension w/SBPs down to 70
   in am [**11-18**].  Pressures improved with NS and 2U of PRBCs.  Patient
   started on Levophed but developed a run of ventricular tachycardia.
   Levophed changed to neosynephrine, which patient tolerated much
   better.  Likely etiology is septic shock. CE negative.  CXR w/out
   pneumothorax.  CTA not yet performed to r/o PE, but less likely given
   pt
s improvement.  Pressors stopped at 8pm [**11-18**], patient normotensive
   since.
   # aortic valve disease/endocarditis: Pt has severe aortic stenosis (<1
   cm2) with aortic valve prolapse and AR.  Will obtain Echo from outside
   hospital (being mailed here).  Echo shows possible new endocarditis vs.
   healed vegetation.  Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum
   antibiotics.
   - CT surgery consulted regarding appropriateness and timing of aortic
   valve replacement
   # anemia: chronic for the last few months since his illness began.
   Likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency (one report of
   colonic polyps removed). Currently at baseline since transfusion a few
   days ago.
   -monitor HCT
   -given CAD, AS and other illness, consider transfusion for HCT less
   than 25.
   -reconcile high dose of B12 with necessary dosing.
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier this
   year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa, statin. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more
   hypertensive.
   # HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # DM2: hold oral agents and check finger sticks and use insulin sliding
   care; iss increased.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue carbidopa/levodopa and requip.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents with altered mental status and fevers from a rehabilitation facility. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and has pneumonia but is oxygenating well. He is also on mechanical ventilation in assist/pressure support mode. His vital signs are stable, but he had an episode of hypotension that responded to fluid resuscitation and packed red blood cell transfusion. The patient has been diagnosed with Acinetobacter pneumonia and is being treated with appropriate antibiotics. There are concerns about endocarditis, but imaging has not shown any epidural or intracranial abscesses. The patient's respiratory status, altered mental status, and hypotension are being closely monitored. Other potential sources of infection are being considered, and further investigations are planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has Acinetobacter pneumonia, which is a hospital-acquired infection. It is important to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy to prevent worsening of the infection.
2. Endocarditis: There is a concern for endocarditis given the patient's history of bacteremia and the presence of new heart murmurs on examination. Further evaluation with echocardiography is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
3. Stroke: The patient had an embolic"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection.  Tolerated until
   PSV last night, when he had low lung volumes, increased RR, and ABG
   showing worsening hypercarbia.  Pt may have some muscular weakness, due
   to prolonged illness and multiple intubations.   Worsening secretions
   and continuing A-a gradient argue for potential pneumonia and CHF
   contribution.  Probably is somewhat volume overloaded given
   resuscitation over the weekend and CXR
   -Continue PSV, attempt to wean.  If patient begins to fail, switch to
   AC.
   -diurese today to net -1L.  Effusion likely not contributing to
   clinical picture and may improve with diuresis.
   # Fevers:  Given fevers, positive sputum, and thick secretions,
   pneumonia most likely, with hospital acquired agents at top of list.
   Sputum positive for Acinetobacter with only intermediate sensitivity to
   imipenem.  Was afebrile most of the day, now that he is appropriately
   covered.  However, if patient spikes again, will need to search for
   other sources of infection.  Other possible sources- endocarditis:
   cannot r/o active endocarditis per imaging and recent embolic event

   -d/c metronidazole added for empiric sepsis coverage.
   -vanco trough in AM
   -If patient does well today, consider d/c
ing vanco, which was added
   for potential recurrent endocarditis, but is now less likely given
   absence of positive cultures.
   # aortic valve disease/endocarditis: Pt is being treated with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics, but no evidence of active infection.  CT

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presented from rehabilitation with altered mental status and fevers. The patient is intubated for airway protection due to respiratory status issues. He has been on mechanical ventilation (CMV) but had low lung volumes, increased respiratory rate, and worsening hypercarbia when switched to pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient may have muscular weakness due to prolonged illness and multiple intubations. There are concerns about pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF) contributing to his condition, with worsening secretions and an ongoing A-a gradient.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, glucose levels, and troponin-T levels. Other lab results are within normal limits. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, blood pressure ranging from 103/49 to 152/81 mmHg, heart rate between 69 and 111 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals an early systolic murmur best heard at the base, coarse breath sounds bilaterally with some crackles, and trace edema in both upper and lower extremities.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection.  Tolerated until
   PSV last night, when he had low lung volumes, increased RR, and ABG
   showing worsening hypercarbia.  Pt may have some muscular weakness, due
   to prolonged illness and multiple intubations.   Worsening secretions
   and continuing A-a gradient argue for potential pneumonia and CHF
   contribution.  Probably is somewhat volume overloaded given
   resuscitation over the weekend and CXR
   -Continue PSV, attempt to wean.  If patient begins to fail, switch to
   AC.
   -diurese today to net -1L.  Effusion likely not contributing to
   clinical picture and may improve with diuresis.
   -3PM lytes
   # Fevers:  Given fevers, positive sputum, and thick secretions,
   pneumonia most likely, with hospital acquired agents at top of list.
   Sputum positive for Acinetobacter with only intermediate sensitivity to
   imipenem.  Was afebrile most of the day, now that he is appropriately
   covered.  However, if patient spikes again, will need to search for
   other sources of infection.  Other possible sources- endocarditis:
   cannot r/o active endocarditis per imaging and recent embolic event
   concerning for active endocarditis.  Thrombophlebitis- less likely
   given negative LENI/UENI.  CNS sources-MRI showed no epidural or
   intracranial abscesses.  C. diff was negative on [**11-16**], but if
   re-spikes, can consider C. diff
   -Await OSH echo results to compare new and old echo.
   -continue to follow daily blood cx
   -check sputum Cx.
   -ID input appreciated.
   -changed antibiotics to Tobramycin and Unasyn as indicated by
   acinetobacter sensitivities from sputum culture.  Tobra peak was at
   goal, tobra trough was appropriate per ID.
   -Need to re-check peak and trough in [**2-7**] days or if creatinine
   clearance changes by [**5-14**] mL/hour
   -hold on LP for now given good explanation of fevers.
   -d/c metronidazole added for empiric sepsis coverage.
   -vanco trough in AM
   -If patient does well today, consider d/c
ing vanco, which was added
   for potential recurrent endocarditis, but is now less likely given
   absence of positive cultures.
   # aortic valve disease/endocarditis: Pt is being treated with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics, but no evidence of active infection.  CT
   surgery consulted, says surgery not necessary at this time.
   -Will obtain Echo from outside hospital (being mailed here)
   #CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic
   - no heparin now as per neurology
   -negative carotid ultrasound
   d/c statin, as not needed right now per neuro.
   - neurology  to follow
   # altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to be
   improving today.  Head CT, MRI do not explain AMS as per neurology.
   Improving mental status
 patient able to follow simple commands (like
   moving feet).
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   - to consider LP as per neuro recs
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   #Hypotension: Patient with episode of hypotension w/SBPs down to 70
   in am [**11-18**].  Pressures improved with NS and 2U of PRBCs.  Patient
   started on Levophed but developed a run of ventricular tachycardia.
   Levophed changed to neosynephrine, which patient tolerated much
   better.  Likely etiology is septic shock. CE negative.  CXR w/out
   pneumothorax.  CTA not yet performed to r/o PE, but less likely given
   pt
s improvement.  Pressors stopped at 8pm [**11-18**], patient normotensive
   since.
   # anemia: chronic for the last few months since his illness began.
   Likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency.  At baseline
   now.
   -monitor HCT.  Given clinical context, transfuse for Hct<25
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier this
   year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications, including vanco and tobra
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa, statin. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more
   hypertensive.
   # HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # DM2: using ISS; will increase for hyperglycemia.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue carbidopa/levodopa and requip.
   # FEN: Start diabetic tube feeds.  replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, and MRSA precautions.
   # code status: full confirmed with wife
   # Access: right subclavian placed [**2168-11-15**]; right a line placed

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection.  Tolerated until
   PSV last night, when he had low lung volumes, increased RR, and ABG
   showing worsening hypercarbia.  Pt may have some muscular weakness, due
   to prolonged illness and multiple intubations.   Worsening secretions
   and continuing A-a gradient argue for potential pneumonia and CHF
   contribution.  Probably is somewhat volume overloaded given
   resuscitation over the weekend and CXR, but need to be careful [**2-6**]
   recent hypotension.
   -Continue PSV, attempt to wean.  If patient begins to fail, switch to
   AC.
   -diurese today to net -1L.  Effusion likely not contributing to
   clinical picture and may improve with diuresis.
   # Fevers:  Given fevers, positive sputum, and thick secretions,
   pneumonia most likely, with hospital acquired agents at top of list.
   Sputum positive for Acinetobacter with only intermediate sensitivity to
   imipenem.  Was afebrile most of the day, now that he is appropriately
   covered.  However, if patient spikes again, will need to search for
   other sources of infection.  Other possible sources- endocarditis:
   cannot r/o active endocarditis per imaging and recent embolic event
   concerning for active endocarditis.  Thrombophlebitis- less likely
   given negative LENI/UENI.  CNS sources-MRI showed no epidural or
   intracranial abscesses.  C. diff was negative on [**11-16**], but if
   re-spikes, can consider C. diff
   -Await OSH echo results to compare new and old echo.
   -continue to follow daily blood cx
   -check urine Cx.
   -ID input appreciated.
   -changed antibiotics to Tobramycin and Unasyn as indicated by
   acinetobacter sensitivities from sputum culture.  Tobra peak was at
   goal, tobra trough was appropriate per ID.
   -Need to re-check peak and trough in [**2-7**] days or if creatinine
   clearance changes by [**5-14**] mL/hour
   -hold on LP for now given good explanation of fevers.
   -d/c metronidazole added for empiric sepsis coverage.
   -vanco trough in AM
   -If patient does well today, consider d/c
ing vanco, which was added
   for potential recurrent endocarditis, but is now less likely given
   absence of positive cultures.
   # aortic valve disease/endocarditis: Pt is being treated with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics, but no evidence of active infection.  CT
   surgery consulted, says surgery not necessary at this time.
   -Will obtain Echo from outside hospital (being mailed here)
   #CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic
   - no heparin now as per neurology
   -negative carotid ultrasound
   d/c statin, as not needed right now per neuro.
   - neurology  to follow
   # altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to be
   improving today.  Head CT, MRI do not explain AMS as per neurology.
   Improving mental status
 patient able to follow simple commands (like
   moving feet).
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   - to consider LP as per neuro recs
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   #Hypotension: Patient with episode of hypotension w/SBPs down to 70
   in am [**11-18**].  Pressures improved with NS and 2U of PRBCs.  Patient
   started on Levophed but developed a run of ventricular tachycardia.
   Levophed changed to neosynephrine, which patient tolerated much
   better.  Likely etiology is septic shock. CE negative.  CXR w/out
   pneumothorax.  CTA not yet performed to r/o PE, but less likely given
   pt
s improvement.  Pressors stopped at 8pm [**11-18**], patient normotensive
   since.
   # anemia: chronic for the last few months since his illness began.
   Likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency.  At baseline
   since transfusion a few days ago.
   -monitor HCT.  Given clinical context, transfuse for Hct<25
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier this
   year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications, including vanco and tobra
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa, statin. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more
   hypertensive.
   # HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # DM2: using ISS; will increase for hyperglycemia.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue carbidopa/levodopa and requip.
   # FEN: Start diabetic tube feeds.  replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, and MRSA precautions.
   # code status: full confirmed with wife
   # Access: right subclavian placed [**2168-11-15**]; right a line placed

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia who presents with altered mental status and fevers. He was admitted from a rehabilitation facility with these symptoms. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and has been on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but had hypercarbic respiratory failure with low tidal volumes, so the mode was switched back to controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV).

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, most likely caused by hospital-acquired agents, and is being treated with antibiotics sensitive to Acinetobacter. There are concerns about potential endocarditis, but imaging and blood cultures have not shown any evidence of active infection. The patient had a recent embolic stroke, likely secondary to endocarditis or atheroembolic disease, but a carotid ultrasound showed no lesions.

The patient experienced an episode of hypotension, which was treated with fluids and red blood cell transfusion. Pressors were started, but the patient developed ventricular tachycardia and had to be changed to neosynephrine. The likely etiology is septic shock, and further investigation is needed to rule out pulmonary embolism.

The patient has chronic anemia related to chronic illness and iron deficiency. His renal function is impaired, with a baseline creatinine level of 1.3-1.4 earlier this year. Medications are being adjusted accordingly, and close monitoring of renal function is essential.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, Parkinson's disease, and hypernatremia. His nutritional status is being addressed with tube feeds and repletion of electrolytes. Precautions are in place for MRSA and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. The patient's code status is confirmed as full code.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple complications including respiratory failure, pneumonia, potential endocarditis, embolic stroke, hypotension, anemia, chronic renal insufficiency, and multiple comorbidities. Close monitoring and management of his condition are crucial."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male with recurrent endocarditis admitted with altered mental
   status and recurrent fevers with infectious source yet to be fully
   defined.  He has had TEE without significant vegitation, no evidence of
   epidural collection, exudative effusion without active infection in
   pleural space and and possible pneumonia as leading diagnosis given
   pulmonary infiltrates.  In addition he had findings on MRI of embolic
   CVA as a new finding.
   Sepsis-Acenetobacter from pulmonary source remains leading differential
   diagnosis
   -Will continue with Rx with Unasyn/Tobramycin for VAP
   -Will continue Vanco for concern for recurrent endocarditis
   -Patient started on flagyl for possible C. Diff but will D/C with
   negative findings
   -LP frequently discussed but patient presentation not consistent and
   current course has been one of decreased fever with treatment of known
   pathogens.  Will bring discussion with ID team to conclusion at this
   time.
   -Would consider D/C of Vanco with TEE findings and negative blood
   cultures
   Resipratory Failure-Patient with worsening respiratory distress with
   change to PSV mode of support--He has significant hypoxemia noted and
   recurrent difficulty with tolerance of PSV.  His barriers to extubation
   all do relate to what is poor compliance as relates to pneumonia,
   pleural effusion, obesity and volume overload.  Of note patient with
   NIF -18 concerning for overlying weakness which may make compensation
   for poor compliance difficult
   Will-->
   -Diurese as possible
   -Check NIF to rule out possible NM weakness
   -Continue PNA Rx
   -Drainage of effusion considered but unlikely to result in significant
   advantage in regards to pulmonary mechanics
   CVA-
   -No anticoagulation
   -Evaluation negative to date for active issues such as vegitation,
   carotid stenosis as contribor

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with recurrent endocarditis admitted for altered mental status and recurrent fevers. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, pleural effusion, and possible embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He is currently experiencing respiratory failure and sepsis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and significant hypoxemia indicate a high risk of respiratory failure. Factors such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, obesity, and volume overload contribute to poor compliance with positive pressure ventilation (PSV) mode.

2. Sepsis: The patient's recurrent fevers and infectious source suggest ongoing sepsis. Acinetobacter from a pulmonary source is considered the leading differential diagnosis. Treatment with Unasyn/Tobramycin for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and Vancomycin for recurrent endocarditis is ongoing.

3. CVA: The patient has findings on MRI indicating an embolic CVA. This increases the risk of further neurological complications, such as stroke or cognitive impairment.

4. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive net fluid intake, indicating fluid overload. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications related to heart failure.

5. Potential NM Weakness: The patient's negative inspiratory force (NIF) of -18 is concerning for underlying neuromuscular (NM) weakness"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: intubated for airway protection but
   complicated by acinetobater pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Pt may have
   some muscular weakness, due to prolonged illness and multiple
   intubations.   Not able to tolerate PS 10/5 yesterday and unable to
   wean further.  Other workup for fevers negative thus far.  Can consider
   LP if persistent fevers and mental status changes.
   - Will rest today, continue diuresis and plan for weaning trial
   tomorrow.  Currently stable on [**12-9**].
   -diurese today to net -1L.  Effusion may improve with diuresis.
   -3PM lytes
   - treat with Tobramcyin and Unasyn for 8 day course, started [**2168-11-18**]
   (today is day 5 of 8)
   - Tobra peak with PM dose tonight
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Endocarditis with AR: Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum
   antibiotics, but no evidence of active infection.  CT surgery consulted
   and  surgery not necessary at this time.
   -Will obtain Echo from outside hospital (being mailed here)
   - vancomycin for 3 week course per ID
   #CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic. U/S of carotids negative.
   - aspirin (no heparin or statin needed)
   - neurology  to follow
   .
   # altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to be
   improving today.  Head CT and MRI do not explain AMS as per neurology.
   Improving mental status
 patient able to answer questions today.  Have
   considered LP; however MS improving.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   .
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier this
   year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications, including vanco and tobra
   -monitor Cr as Lasix given
   # CAD: continue asa. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more hypertensive.
   # hx HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # DM2: using ISS; will increase for hyperglycemia.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue carbidopa/levodopa and requip.
   # FEN: Diabetic tube feeds.  replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, and MRSA precautions.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia, and a history of heart disease such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and endocarditis. The patient presents with altered mental status, fevers, pneumonia, and failure to wean from mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been intubated for airway protection due to pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The pneumonia is complicated by an infection with Acinetobacter species. The patient's recent blood cultures have shown no evidence of active infection. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including tobramycin and Unasyn, for 8 days.

The patient also has evidence of endocarditis with aortic regurgitation (AR). Cardiac surgery consultation has been obtained, and surgery is not necessary at this time. An echocardiogram from an outside hospital is being mailed to the hospital for further evaluation.

The patient has had a likely embolic stroke, possibly secondary to endocarditis or atheroembolic disease. Carotid ultrasound was negative. Aspirin therapy has been started, and neurology follow-up has been arranged.

The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to infection, but it appears to be improving. Head CT and MRI do not explain the altered mental status, so lumbar"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # respiratory status: intubated for airway protection.  Tolerated until
   PSV last night, when he had low lung volumes, increased RR, and ABG
   showing worsening hypercarbia.  Pt may have some muscular weakness, due
   to prolonged illness and multiple intubations.   Worsening secretions
   and continuing A-a gradient argue for potential pneumonia and CHF
   contribution.  Probably is somewhat volume overloaded given
   resuscitation over the weekend and CXR
   -Continue PSV, attempt to wean.  If patient begins to fail, switch to
   AC.
   -diurese today to net -1L.  Effusion likely not contributing to
   clinical picture and may improve with diuresis.
   -3PM lytes
   # Fevers:  Given fevers, positive sputum, and thick secretions,
   pneumonia most likely, with hospital acquired agents at top of list.
   Sputum positive for Acinetobacter with only intermediate sensitivity to
   imipenem.  Was afebrile most of the day, now that he is appropriately
   covered.  However, if patient spikes again, will need to search for
   other sources of infection.  Other possible sources- endocarditis:
   cannot r/o active endocarditis per imaging and recent embolic event
   concerning for active endocarditis.  Thrombophlebitis- less likely
   given negative LENI/UENI.  CNS sources-MRI showed no epidural or
   intracranial abscesses.  C. diff was negative on [**11-16**], but if
   re-spikes, can consider C. diff
   -Await OSH echo results to compare new and old echo.
   -continue to follow daily blood cx
   -check sputum Cx.
   -ID input appreciated.
   -changed antibiotics to Tobramycin and Unasyn as indicated by
   acinetobacter sensitivities from sputum culture.  Tobra peak was at
   goal, tobra trough was appropriate per ID.
   -Need to re-check peak and trough in [**2-7**] days or if creatinine
   clearance changes by [**5-14**] mL/hour
   -hold on LP for now given good explanation of fevers.
   -d/c metronidazole added for empiric sepsis coverage.
   -vanco trough in AM
   -If patient does well today, consider d/c
ing vanco, which was added
   for potential recurrent endocarditis, but is now less likely given
   absence of positive cultures.
   # aortic valve disease/endocarditis: Pt is being treated with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics, but no evidence of active infection.  CT
   surgery consulted, says surgery not necessary at this time.
   -Will obtain Echo from outside hospital (being mailed here)
   #CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic
   - no heparin now as per neurology
   -negative carotid ultrasound
   d/c statin, as not needed right now per neuro.
   - neurology  to follow
   # altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to be
   improving today.  Head CT, MRI do not explain AMS as per neurology.
   Improving mental status
 patient able to follow simple commands (like
   moving feet).
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   - to consider LP as per neuro recs
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   #Hypotension: Patient with episode of hypotension w/SBPs down to 70
   in am [**11-18**].  Pressures improved with NS and 2U of PRBCs.  Patient
   started on Levophed but developed a run of ventricular tachycardia.
   Levophed changed to neosynephrine, which patient tolerated much
   better.  Likely etiology is septic shock. CE negative.  CXR w/out
   pneumothorax.  CTA not yet performed to r/o PE, but less likely given
   pt
s improvement.  Pressors stopped at 8pm [**11-18**], patient normotensive
   since.
   # anemia: chronic for the last few months since his illness began.
   Likely related to chronic illness and iron deficiency.  At baseline
   now.
   -monitor HCT.  Given clinical context, transfuse for Hct<25
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier this
   year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications, including vanco and tobra
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa, statin. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more
   hypertensive.
   # HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # DM2: using ISS; will increase for hyperglycemia.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue carbidopa/levodopa and requip.
   # FEN: Start diabetic tube feeds.  replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, and MRSA precautions.
   # code status: full confirmed with wife
   # Access: right subclavian placed [**2168-11-15**]; right a line placed

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic anemia, chronic shock, septic hypotension, fever of unknown origin, respiratory failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's mental status is altered, but not delirium. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various antibiotics. The patient has experienced episodes of elevated CO2 levels and has an arterial line that stopped.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and the use of corticosteroids increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance indicates a negative balance, which could lead to dehydration. However, careful monitoring is required to prevent fluid overload.
5. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is still receiving antibiotics, indicating ongoing efforts to manage and prevent sepsis.
6. Fever: The patient's temperature has been consistently elevated, suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.
7. Delirium: Although the patient's mental status is described as altered,"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male with recent history of significant endocarditis now admitted
   with recurrent fevers and findings consistent with sepsis.  Source has
   remained to be fully defined but certainly pneumonia appears to be
   leading diagnosis.  He has had difficulty with wean from mechanical
   ventilatory support in the setting of what may well be volume overload,
   residual pulmonary secretions and neuromuscular weakness.
   1)Sepsis-Rx primarily for Acinetobacter pneumonia and likely residual
   endocarditis and will continue to treat for likely co-existing gram
   positive infection.
   Tobra/Unasyn to continue x 8 day course (are 5 days done)
   Vancomycin x 4 week total with presumptive enterococcus as source for
   endocarditis.
   2)Respiratory Failure-Sources as noted above
   -Will need to control metabolic alkalosis
   -Will need to move to diruresis today as tolerated and will have to be
   careful with acid/base status
   -Will need optimal altertness
   -Will need to actively wean PSV support
   -Secretions improved somewhat today
   3)Altered Mental Status
   -Continue with dopamine agonists
   -Versed/Fentanyl to wean as possible.
   -Patient with modest improvement in altertness and responsiveness today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male admitted with recurrent fevers and findings consistent with sepsis. The source of infection has not been fully defined, but pneumonia appears to be the leading diagnosis. The patient also has a history of significant endocarditis.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, altered mental status, chronic anemia, chronic shock, septic hypotension, fever of unknown origin, acute respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and fluid overload.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for Acinetobacter pneumonia and likely residual endocarditis. Antibiotics such as Tobramycin and Unasyn are being administered for an 8-day course, while Vancomycin will be given for a total of 4 weeks due to presumptive enterococcus as the source of endocarditis.

For respiratory failure, the patient needs to control metabolic alkalosis, move to diuresis today as tolerated, be cautious with acid/base status, optimize alertness, actively wean PSV support, and continue managing secretions.

In terms of altered mental status, dopamine agonists will be continued, and Versed/Fentanyl will be weaned as possible.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilatory support, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
2. Organ dysfunction: Although the patient"

   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: intubated for airway protection but
   complicated by acinetobater pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Pt may have
   some muscular weakness, due to prolonged illness and multiple
   intubations.   Not able to tolerate PS 10/5 yesterday and unable to
   wean further.  Other workup for fevers negative thus far.  Can consider
   LP if persistent fevers and mental status changes.
   - Will rest today, continue diuresis and plan for weaning trial
   tomorrow.  Currently stable on [**12-9**].
   -diurese today to net -1L.  Effusion may improve with diuresis.
   -3PM lytes
   - treat with Tobramcyin and Unasyn for 8 day course, started [**2168-11-18**]

   # altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to be
   improving today.  Head CT and MRI do not explain AMS as per neurology.
   Improving mental status
 patient able to answer questions today.  Have
   considered LP; however MS improving.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male with history of recurrent endocarditis and now re-admitted
   with sepsis and subsequent respiratory failure with concerning picture
   of continued ventilator associated pneumonia.  We have tried to
   maintain negative fluid balance to facilitate ventilatory weaning but
   patient has had repeated cultures showing persistent acinetobacter on
   culture of [**11-22**] and in the setting of significant evidence of
   contraction alkalosis patient has had recurrent hypotension with good
   response to IVF administration.
   1)Respiratory Failure
Patient with favorable pulmonary mechanics, he
   has maximal diuresis, he has improving mental status this morning even
   with Versed/Fentanyl going.  The concerning issues are that he has
   weakness documented on NIF testing, some continued secretions described
   as moderate and persistent acinetobacter.
   -SBT x 30 minutes
   -Extubation if patient able to have trend down in sputum volume will
   continue to move to extubation
   -Trial scopolamine patch to minimize oral secretions
   -Will work towards extubation as soon as sputum volume has decreased
   2)Sepsis
Patient with recurrent hypotension noted this morning.  He had
   excellent response to IVF given
   -Hold diuresis this morning
   -Continue with antibiotics
   -Vanco
endocarditis
   -Tobra
Acinetobacter
   -Will discuss with ID the role of Bactrim or alternative antibiotics
   for pneumonia and work to achieve therapeutic levels of Tobra.
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined and described in the
   housestaff note of this date.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of recurrent endocarditis. He was admitted with sepsis and subsequent respiratory failure, showing a concerning picture of continued ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has been on diuretics and has had repeated cultures showing persistent Acinetobacter infection.

The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, sepsis, altered mental status, and fluid overload. The respiratory failure is characterized by favorable pulmonary mechanics but with weakness documented on NIF testing, continued secretions, and persistent Acinetobacter infection. The sepsis is indicated by recurrent hypotension that responds well to intravenous fluid administration. The altered mental status is mentioned but without further details. Fluid overload is also noted as an issue.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening respiratory failure due to persistent Acinetobacter infection and ventilator-associated pneumonia. There is also a risk of septic shock if the sepsis is not effectively managed. Fluid overload may lead to further complications such as acute kidney injury or worsening of heart failure.

Further management should focus on aggressively treating the Acinetobacter infection with appropriate antibiotics, minimizing oral secretions, and working towards extubation once the sputum volume has decreased. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes is crucial to prevent fluid overload and its associated complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: intubated for airway protection but
   complicated by acinetobater pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Pt may have
   some muscular weakness, due to prolonged illness and multiple
   intubations.   Was difficult to wean secondary to agitation,
   discomfort, secretions.
   - SBT this morning with plan to rest on PS for the day due to
   secretions, attempt further weaning tomorrow
   -considering recent episode of hypotension, will not attempt further
   diuresis today
   - treat with Tobramcyin and Unasyn for 8 day course, started [**2168-11-18**]
   (today is day 6 of 8)
   - f/u with ID regarding Tobra dosing and next peak level
   .
   # Endocarditis with AR: Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum
   antibiotics, but no evidence of active infection.  CT surgery consulted
   and  surgery not necessary at this time.
   - vancomycin for 4 week course per ID, today is 9 of 28.
   #CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic. U/S of carotids negative.
   - aspirin (no heparin or statin needed)
   - neurology  to follow
   .
   # altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to be
   improving today.  Head CT and MRI do not explain AMS as per neurology.
   Improving mental status
 patient able to answer questions today.  Have
   considered LP; however MS improving.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   .
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier this
   year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications, including vanco and tobra
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more hypertensive.
   # hx HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # DM2: using ISS; will increase for hyperglycemia.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue carbidopa/levodopa and requip.
   # FEN: Diabetic tube feeds.  replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presented to the ICU with altered mental status and fevers. The patient has been intubated for airway protection due to pneumonia and pulmonary edema. He is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected endocarditis. The patient also has a likely embolic stroke, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, Parkinson's disease, and is receiving tube feeds. He is on multiple medications and has a code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: The patient's current condition of pneumonia and pulmonary edema may complicate extubation and weaning from mechanical ventilation.
2. Endocarditis with AR: Although the patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is still a risk of ongoing infection and potential complications related to endocarditis.
3. CVA (Stroke): The patient has a likely embolic stroke, which can lead to neurological deficits and require ongoing monitoring and management.
4. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's pre-existing chronic renal insufficiency may worsen during his ICU stay due to various factors such as medications, infections, or fluid management.
5. CAD (Coronary"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: intubated for airway protection but
   complicated by acinetobater pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Pt may have
   some muscular weakness, due to prolonged illness and multiple
   intubations.   Was difficult to wean secondary to agitation,
   discomfort, secretions.
   - SBT this morning with plan to rest on PS for the day due to
   secretions, attempt further weaning tomorrow
   -diurese today to net -1L.  Effusion may improve with diuresis.
   -3PM lytes
   - treat with Tobramcyin and Unasyn for 8 day course, started [**2168-11-18**]
   (today is day 5 of 8)
   - Tobra peak with PM dose tonight
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Endocarditis with AR: Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum
   antibiotics, but no evidence of active infection.  CT surgery consulted
   and  surgery not necessary at this time.
   -Will obtain Echo from outside hospital (being mailed here)
   - vancomycin for 3 week course per ID
   #CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic. U/S of carotids negative.
   - aspirin (no heparin or statin needed)
   - neurology  to follow
   .
   # altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to be
   improving today.  Head CT and MRI do not explain AMS as per neurology.
   Improving mental status
 patient able to answer questions today.  Have
   considered LP; however MS improving.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   .
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier this
   year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications, including vanco and tobra
   -monitor Cr as Lasix given
   # CAD: continue asa. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more hypertensive.
   # hx HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # DM2: using ISS; will increase for hyperglycemia.
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue carbidopa/levodopa and requip.
   # FEN: Diabetic tube feeds.  replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, and MRSA precautions.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents with altered mental status, fevers, and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation due to agitation, discomfort, and copious secretions. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, endocarditis, and a possible embolic stroke. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and surgery for endocarditis is not necessary at this time. The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to infection but is improving. 

The patient has chronic renal insufficiency stage 4, and his medications are being adjusted accordingly. Other medical conditions include coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, Parkinson's disease, and feeding tube nutrition. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory status due to pneumonia and pulmonary edema, further embolic events, persistent infection leading to sepsis, and complications related to chronic renal insufficiency. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and renal function. Frequent reassessment of mental status should be performed to ensure improvement."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   #1 Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: intubated for airway protection but
   complicated by acinetobater pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Pt may have
   some muscular weakness, due to prolonged illness and multiple
   intubations.   SBT yesterday tolerated well but needs rest on PS until
   secretions ease up, may attempt further weaning tomorrow
   - scopolamine patch to decrease secretions
   - treat with Tobramcyin and Unasyn for 14 day course as per ID, started
   [**2168-11-18**] (today is day 7 of 14)
   - Increased Tobra dose to 300mg, will re-check trough after 3 doses and
   follow Cr closely.
   .
   #2 Endocarditis with AR: Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum
   antibiotics, but no evidence of active infection.  CT surgery consulted
   and  surgery not necessary at this time.  Unclear whether ID feels that
   this has already been adequately treated already, and ECHO does not
   clearly show persistent endocarditis.
   - vancomycin for 2 v 4 week course per ID
 will follow ID recs.  Today
   is 10 of vancomycin at [**Hospital1 5**].
   #3 CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic. U/S of carotids negative.
   - aspirin (no heparin or statin needed)
   - neurology  to follow
   .
   #4  altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to
   be improving today.  Head CT and MRI do not explain AMS as per
   neurology.  Improving mental status
 patient able to answer questions
   today.  Have considered LP; however MS improving.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   .

   -renally dose medications, including vanco and tobra
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more hypertensive.
   # hx HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents from rehabilitation with altered mental status and fevers. The patient has been intubated for airway protection but is complicated by Acinetobacter pneumonia and pulmonary edema. There may be some muscular weakness due to prolonged illness and multiple intubations.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 121/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 442 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 56.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including pneumonia/failure to wean, endocarditis with aortic regurgitation, cerebrovascular accident (likely embolic stroke), and altered mental status. The pneumonia/failure to wean is being treated with Tobramycin and Unasyn for a 14-day course. The endocarditis with AR is being treated with vancomycin for a 2-week course."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents from rehabilitation with altered mental status and fevers. The patient has been intubated for airway protection but developed Acinetobacter pneumonia and pulmonary edema. There may be some muscular weakness due to prolonged illness and multiple intubations. The patient had difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation secondary to agitation, discomfort, and secretions. He underwent a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning and will rest on pressure support (PS) throughout the day due to secretions. Further weaning attempts will be made tomorrow. The patient's recent episode of hypotension will not allow for further diuresis today. He is being treated with Tobramycin and Unasyn for 8 days, started on [2168-11-18] (day 6 of 8). The Infectious Disease (ID) team will be consulted regarding Tobramycin dosing and the next peak level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: The patient may experience respiratory complications due to Acinetobacter pneumonia and pulmonary edema. Failure to wean from mechanical ventilation can lead to further respiratory distress.
2. Endocarditis with AR (aortic regurgitation): Although the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   # Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: intubated for airway protection but
   complicated by acinetobater pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Pt may have
   some muscular weakness, due to prolonged illness and multiple
   intubations.   Was difficult to wean secondary to agitation,
   discomfort, secretions.
   - SBT this morning with plan to rest on PS for the day due to
   secretions, attempt further weaning tomorrow
   -considering recent episode of hypotension, will not attempt further
   diuresis today
   - treat with Tobramcyin and Unasyn for 8 day course, started [**2168-11-18**]
   (today is day 6 of 8)
   - f/u with ID regarding Tobra dosing and next peak level
   .
   # Endocarditis with AR: Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum
   antibiotics, but no evidence of active infection.  CT surgery consulted
   and  surgery not necessary at this time.
   - vancomycin for 4 week course per ID, today is 9 of 28.
   #CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic. U/S of carotids negative.
   - aspirin (no heparin or statin needed)
   - neurology  to follow
   .
   # altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to be
   improving today.  Head CT and MRI do not explain AMS as per neurology.
   Improving mental status
 patient able to answer questions today.  Have
   considered LP; however MS improving.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   .
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier this
   year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications, including vanco and tobra
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more hypertensive.
   # hx HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents from rehabilitation with altered mental status and fevers. The patient has been intubated for airway protection but has complicated pneumonia and pulmonary edema. He was difficult to wean secondary to agitation, discomfort, and secretions. The patient is currently on a ventilator in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: The patient's condition is complicated by Acinetobacter pneumonia and pulmonary edema, making it challenging to wean him off the ventilator.
2. Endocarditis with AR: Although the patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is still a possibility of active infection. Surgery may be considered if the infection persists.
3. CVA (likely embolic stroke): The patient has a likely embolic stroke, possibly caused by endocarditis or atheroembolic disease. He is on aspirin, and neurology will follow up on his condition.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to infection. It appears to be improving, but daily wake-up trials while intubated will assess mental status.
5. Chronic Renal Insufficiency Stage 4: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, and medications need to be adjusted accordingly"

   66 yo male with initial admission with recurrent fevers in the setting
   of treated endocarditis.  He has evolved a significant pneumonia with
   Acinetobacter as likely source of ongoing fevers and has shown
   reasonable evidence of improvement or clearing of the endocarditis
   based on TEE and blood cultures.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient has continued excellent control of volume
   overload--with weaning of lasix dosing required in the setting of
   hyptension and severe contraction alkalosis which has been controlled
   -Patient with continued secretions limiting move to extubation
   primarily
   -Will Rx Acinetobacter Pneumonia
   -Tobramycin to continue with increased dosing given low peaks
   -Will continue with Sopalamine patch to continue to control secretion
   as possible--would hold on TCA Rx as well
   -Hope to move to extubation but will need Trach as needed based on
   progress over weekend
   2)Sepsis-
   -Continue wtih antibiotics--for endocarditis
   -BP stable
   -Temp controlled of late
   Additional notes as per housestaff note of this date to continue
   management of additional active issues and will continue to treat

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of recurrent fevers, treated endocarditis, and Acinetobacter pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, sepsis, and other complications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with controlled temperature and blood pressure. He is intubated and on CPAP/PSV ventilation, with good oxygenation and respiratory support. Fluid balance is maintained, and there are no signs of shock or severe contraction alkalosis. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but elevated creatinine, glucose, and lactic acid levels. The patient is being treated for Acinetobacter pneumonia and endocarditis with appropriate antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which is likely due to the Acinetobacter pneumonia. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the infection does not respond to treatment or if the patient develops any complications related to the endotracheal tube or mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's vital signs are currently stable, there is still a risk of sepsis-related complications due to the ongoing infection. Close monitoring for signs of organ dysfunction is necessary.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has shown improvement in fluid overload management, but careful monitoring of fluid balance is essential to prevent fluid overload and subsequent complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   #1 Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: intubated for airway protection but
   complicated by acinetobater pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Pt may have
   some muscular weakness, due to prolonged illness and multiple
   intubations.   SBT yesterday tolerated well but needs rest on PS until
   secretions ease up, may attempt further weaning tomorrow
   - scopolamine patch to decrease secretions
   - treat with Tobramcyin and Unasyn for 14 day course as per ID, started
   [**2168-11-18**] (today is day 7 of 14)
   - Increased Tobra dose to 300mg, will re-check trough after 3 doses and
   follow Cr closely.
   .
   #2 Endocarditis with AR: Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum
   antibiotics, but no evidence of active infection.  CT surgery consulted
   and  surgery not necessary at this time.  Unclear whether ID feels that
   this has already been adequately treated already, and ECHO does not
   clearly show persistent endocarditis.
   - vancomycin for 2 v 4 week course per ID
 will follow ID recs.  Today
   is 10 of vancomycin at [**Hospital1 5**].
   #3 CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic. U/S of carotids negative.
   - aspirin (no heparin or statin needed)
   - neurology  to follow
   .
   #4  altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to
   be improving today.  Head CT and MRI do not explain AMS as per
   neurology.  Improving mental status
 patient able to answer questions
   today.  Have considered LP; however MS improving.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   .
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier this
   year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications, including vanco and tobra
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more hypertensive.
   # hx HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # DM2: using ISS
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue carbidopa/levodopa and requip.
   # FEN: Diabetic tube feeds.  replete lytes
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, and MRSA precautions.
   # code status: full confirmed with wife
   # Access: right subclavian placed [**2168-11-15**]. To consider PICC

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. The patient presented from rehabilitation with altered mental status and fevers. 

The patient is currently intubated for airway protection due to pneumonia and pulmonary edema. He may have some muscular weakness due to prolonged illness and multiple intubations. The patient tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday but needs rest on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) until secretions ease up. The healthcare team plans to attempt further weaning tomorrow. 

The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (tobramycin and Unasyn) for 14 days as per the Infectious Disease (ID) consultant, started on [**2168-11-18**]. The dose of tobramycin has been increased to 300mg, and the healthcare team will re-check the trough level after three doses while closely monitoring creatinine (Cr) levels.

The patient is also being treated for endocarditis with AR (aortic regurgitation) with vancomycin for a two-week course per ID. However, there is no evidence of active infection, and cardiac surgery has been consulted. Surgery is not necessary at this time, and it is unclear whether the ID feels that this has already been adequately treated. An echocardi"

   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   #1 Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: intubated for airway protection but
   complicated by acinetobater pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Pt may have
   some muscular weakness, due to prolonged illness and multiple
   intubations.  Tolerating SBT well but still w/copious secretions.
   Character of secretions has changed: now more pink/frothy, less
   thick/yellow. In setting of AR, could represent pulmonary edema.
   - scopolamine patch to decrease secretions
   - treat with Tobramcyin and Unasyn for 14 day course as per ID, started
   [**2168-11-18**] (today is day 7 of 14)
   - Increased Tobra dose to 300mg, will re-check trough after 3 doses and
   follow Cr closely.
   - lasix boluses over weekend (following Cr closely), if does not
   improve secretions, consider repeat echo, re-eval by CT surgery for
   AVR.

   #2 Endocarditis with AR: Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum
   antibiotics, but no evidence of active infection.  CT surgery consulted
   and  surgery not necessary at this time.  Unclear whether ID feels that
   this has already been adequately treated already, and ECHO does not
   clearly show persistent endocarditis. Last note from ID states they are
   following up with echo attending to review echo results regarding
   chronicity of infection vs old healed endocarditis.
   - vancomycin for 2 v 4 week course per ID
 will follow ID recs.  Today
   is 11 of vancomycin at [**Hospital1 5**].
   #3 CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic. U/S of carotids negative.
   - aspirin (no heparin or statin needed)
   - neurology  to follow
   .
   #4  altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to
   be improving today.  Head CT and MRI do not explain AMS as per
   neurology.  Improving mental status
 patient able to answer questions
   today.  Have considered LP; however MS improving.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents from rehabilitation with altered mental status and fevers. The patient is intubated for airway protection but has developed acinetobacter pneumonia and pulmonary edema. He tolerates spontaneous breathing trials well but still has copious secretions. 

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: The patient has pneumonia and is having difficulty weaning off the ventilator. His secretions have changed to pink/frothy, which could indicate pulmonary edema.
2. Endocarditis with AR: The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is no evidence of active infection. Surgery is not necessary at this time, as the ID is following up with an echo attending to review the echo results regarding the chronicity of infection vs old healed endocarditis.
3. CVA: The patient likely had an embolic stroke on MRI, possibly due to endocarditis or atheroembolic disease. A carotid ultrasound was negative.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to infection. It appears to be improving today.
5. Chronic Renal Insufficiency Stage 4: The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.3-1.4 earlier this year. Renal dosing of medications, including vancomycin and tobramycin, should be continued, and creatinine levels should be monitored.
6. CAD: Continue ASA. Hold BB and [Last Name (un)] for now unless more hypertensive.
7. Hx HTN: Hold losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as needed.
8. DM2: Using ISS.
9. Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
10. Parkinson's Disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and requip.
11. FEN: Diabetic tube feeds. Replete lytes.
12. PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen, aspiration, fall, and MRSA precautions.

Note: The patient's code status is confirmed as full code."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   #1 Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: intubated for airway protection but
   complicated by acinetobater pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Pt may have
   some muscular weakness, due to prolonged illness and multiple
   intubations.  Tolerating SBT well and secretions are decreasing, now
   more pink/frothy, less thick/yellow, may represent pulmonary edema.
   - treat with Tobramcyin and Unasyn for 14 day course as per ID, started
   [**2168-11-20**] (through [**2168-12-4**])
   - Increased Tobra dose to 300mg, will re-check peak & trough tonight
   and follow Cr closely.
   - good response to lasix gtt on [**11-26**], will continue.
   - CHF consult on Monday
   - will consider extubation tomorrow if able to diurese further &
   secretions continue to improve
   .
   #2 Endocarditis with AR: Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum
   antibiotics, but no evidence of active infection.  CT surgery consulted
   and  surgery not necessary at this time.  ID recommends 6 week course
   of vanco following positive blood culture with [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 46**]. Enterococcus
   with Day 1 = [**2168-11-9**].
   - vancomycin for 6 week course D1 = [**2168-11-9**]
   - ECHO to re-eval valve given CHF/pulmonary edema
   #3 CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic. U/S of carotids negative.
   - aspirin (no heparin or statin needed)
   - neurology  to follow
   .
   #4  altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to
   be improving today.  Head CT and MRI do not explain AMS as per
   neurology.  Improving mental status
 patient able to answer questions
   today.  Have considered LP; however MS improving.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   .
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier this
   year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications, including vanco and tobra
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more hypertensive.
   # hx HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # DM2: using ISS
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue carbidopa/levodopa and requip.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents with altered mental status, fevers, and is intubated for airway protection. The patient has pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter and pulmonary edema. He is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials well and has decreased secretions.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: The patient has been treated with tobramycin and Unasyn for 14 days as per Infectious Disease (ID) recommendations. The dose of tobramycin has been increased to 300mg, and the peak and trough levels will be re-checked tonight. Close monitoring of creatinine (Cr) levels is important.

2. Endocarditis with AR: The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is no evidence of active infection. Cardiothoracic (CT) surgery was consulted, and surgery is not necessary at this time. ID recommends a 6-week course of vancomycin following positive blood culture with Enterococcus species. An echocardiogram (ECHO) will be done to re-evaluate the valve due to congestive heart failure (CHF) and pulmonary edema.

3. CVA: The patient likely has an embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis or"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   #1 Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: intubated for airway protection but
   complicated by acinetobater pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Pt may have
   some muscular weakness, due to prolonged illness and multiple
   intubations.  Tolerating SBT well but still w/copious secretions.
   Character of secretions has changed: now more pink/frothy, less
   thick/yellow. In setting of AR, could represent pulmonary edema.
   - scopolamine patch to decrease secretions
   - treat with Tobramcyin and Unasyn for 14 day course as per ID, started
   [**2168-11-18**] (today is day 7 of 14)
   - Increased Tobra dose to 300mg, will re-check trough after 3 doses and
   follow Cr closely.
   - lasix boluses over weekend (following Cr closely), if does not
   improve secretions, consider repeat echo, re-eval by CT surgery for
   AVR.
   .
   #2 Endocarditis with AR: Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum
   antibiotics, but no evidence of active infection.  CT surgery consulted
   and  surgery not necessary at this time.  Unclear whether ID feels that
   this has already been adequately treated already, and ECHO does not
   clearly show persistent endocarditis. Last note from ID states they are
   following up with echo attending to review echo results regarding
   chronicity of infection vs old healed endocarditis.
   - vancomycin for 2 v 4 week course per ID
 will follow ID recs.  Today
   is 11 of vancomycin at [**Hospital1 5**].
   #3 CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic. U/S of carotids negative.
   - aspirin (no heparin or statin needed)
   - neurology  to follow
   .
   #4  altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to
   be improving today.  Head CT and MRI do not explain AMS as per
   neurology.  Improving mental status
 patient able to answer questions
   today.  Have considered LP; however MS improving.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -as patient
s infection is adequately treated, will be able to better
   assess patient
s mental status
   .
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier this
   year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications, including vanco and tobra
   -monitor Cr
   # CAD: continue asa. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more hypertensive.
   # hx HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.
   # DM2: using ISS
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # Parkinsons Disease: continue carbidopa/levodopa and requip.

   line begins to look infected or if blood cultures come up positive.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   #1 Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: intubated for airway protection but
   complicated by acinetobater pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Pt may have
   some muscular weakness, due to prolonged illness and multiple
   intubations.  Tolerating SBT well and secretions are decreasing, now
   more pink/frothy, less thick/yellow, may represent pulmonary edema.
   Was diuresed effectively yesterday w/lasix.
   - treat with Tobramcyin and Unasyn for 14 day course as per ID, started
   [**2168-11-20**] (through [**2168-12-4**])
   - Tobra peak/trough high
 d/w pharmacy, to change dosing to Q48h
   - good response to lasix gtt on [**11-26**], will continue.
   - CHF consult today
   - will consider extubation today if secretions allow and patient
   tolerates sbt well.  Bipap by bedside for respiratory distress
   post-extubation, ABG 3-4 hours post-extubation to evaluate adequacy of
   ventilation.
   .
   #2 Endocarditis with AR: Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum
   antibiotics, but no evidence of active infection.  CT surgery consulted
   and  surgery not necessary at this time.  ID recommends 6 week course
   of vanco following positive blood culture with [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 46**]. Enterococcus
   with Day 1 = [**2168-11-9**].
   - vancomycin for 6 week course D1 = [**2168-11-9**]
   - ECHO to re-eval valve given CHF/pulmonary edema
   #3 CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic. U/S of carotids negative.
   - aspirin (no heparin or statin needed)
   - neurology  to follow
   .
   #4  altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to
   be improving daily.  Head CT and MRI do not explain AMS as per
   neurology.  Improving mental status
 patient able to answer questions
   today.  Have considered LP; however MS improving.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -re-assess MS once patient is extubated.
   .
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier this

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents from rehabilitation with altered mental status and fevers. The patient was intubated for airway protection but developed Acinetobacter pneumonia and pulmonary edema. He is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials well and has decreased secretions, indicating possible improvement. 

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1. Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: The patient has Acinetobacter pneumonia and pulmonary edema. He is being treated with tobramycin and Unasyn for a 14-day course as recommended by the ID physician. The dosing of tobramycin needs to be adjusted due to peak and trough levels being high. The patient responded well to Lasix gtt yesterday and will continue with it. A CHF consult has been ordered, and the patient may be considered for extubation today if he tolerates SBT well. Bipap will be used post-extubation for respiratory distress, and an ABG will be obtained 3-4 hours post-extubation to evaluate ventilation.
2. Endocarditis with AR: The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is no evidence of active infection. Cardiac surgery has been consulted, and surgery is not necessary at this time. The ID physician recommends a 6-week"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents from rehabilitation with altered mental status and fevers. The patient is intubated for airway protection but has complicated by Acinetobacter pneumonia and pulmonary edema. He is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials well, with decreasing secretions that are now pink/frothy, suggesting possible pulmonary edema. The patient is being treated with tobramycin and Unasyn for a 14-day course as per ID, starting on November 20th. The Tobra dose has been increased to 300mg, and peak and trough levels will be rechecked tonight with close monitoring of creatinine. The patient is responding well to Lasix gtt on November 26th, and this will continue. A CHF consult has been ordered for Monday, and the patient may be considered for extubation tomorrow if he can diurese further and secretions continue to improve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: The patient's pneumonia is being treated with antibiotics, but he may have some muscular weakness due to prolonged illness and multiple intubations. He is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials well, but there is a risk of failure to wean from the ventilator.
2. Endocarditis with AR: The patient is being treated with"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   #1 Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: intubated for airway protection but
   complicated by acinetobater pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Pt may have
   some muscular weakness, due to prolonged illness and multiple
   intubations.  Tolerating SBT well and secretions are decreasing, now
   more pink/frothy, less thick/yellow, may represent pulmonary edema.
   Was diuresed effectively yesterday w/lasix.
   - treat with Tobramcyin and Unasyn for 14 day course as per ID, started
   [**2168-11-20**] (through [**2168-12-4**])
   - Tobra peak/trough high
 d/w pharmacy, to change dosing to Q48h
   - good response to lasix gtt on [**11-26**], will continue.
   - CHF consult today
   - will consider extubation today if secretions allow and patient
   tolerates sbt well.  Bipap by bedside for respiratory distress
   post-extubation, ABG 3-4 hours post-extubation to evaluate adequacy of
   ventilation.
   .
   #2 Endocarditis with AR: Pt is being treated with broad-spectrum
   antibiotics, but no evidence of active infection.  CT surgery consulted
   and  surgery not necessary at this time.  ID recommends 6 week course
   of vanco following positive blood culture with [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 46**]. Enterococcus
   with Day 1 = [**2168-11-9**].
   - vancomycin for 6 week course D1 = [**2168-11-9**]
   - ECHO to re-eval valve given CHF/pulmonary edema
   #3 CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic. U/S of carotids negative.
   - aspirin (no heparin or statin needed)
   - neurology  to follow
   .
   #4  altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection.  Appears to
   be improving daily.  Head CT and MRI do not explain AMS as per
   neurology.  Improving mental status
 patient able to answer questions
   today.  Have considered LP; however MS improving.
   -use limited sedation
   -daily wake up trials while intubated to assess mental status
   -re-assess MS once patient is extubated.
   .
   # chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier this
   year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications, including vanco and tobra
   -monitor Cr, especially with diuresis.
   # CAD: continue asa. Hold BB and [**Last Name (un) **] for now unless more hypertensive.
   # hx HTN: holding losartan and metoprolol for now. Will add back as
   needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presented to the ICU with altered mental status and fevers. The patient has been intubated for airway protection due to pneumonia and pulmonary edema. He is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials well and has decreasing secretions. There is a possibility of extubation today if the patient continues to do well. Bipap will be used post-extubation for respiratory distress, and an ABG will be taken 3-4 hours post-extubation to evaluate ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/Failure to Wean: The patient's recent subdural hematomas, prolonged illness, and multiple intubations may have contributed to muscular weakness, making weaning from the ventilator challenging.
2. Endocarditis with AR: The patient has positive blood cultures for Enterococcus, indicating a possible endocarditis. Antibiotic treatment is ongoing, but no evidence of active infection has been found. A cardiac surgery consult has been done, and surgery is not necessary at this time.
3. CVA (likely embolic stroke): The patient may have had an embolic stroke, either from endocarditis or atheroembolic disease. Carotid ultrasound results were negative.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental"

   ECHO:The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the
   distal half of the septum. The remaining segments contract normally
   (LVEF = 50 %).Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. A
   vegetation is suggested but cannot be confirmed due to suboptimal image
   quality. There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
   seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   #1 Pneumonia: intubated for airway protection but complicated by
   acinetobater pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Prolonged intubation due
   to secretions, PNA, pulmonary edema and likely some respiratory muscle
   weakness, but was extubated successfully on [**2168-11-28**].   Was diuresed
   effectively yesterday w/lasix gtt.
   - treat PNA with Tobramcyin and Unasyn for 14 day course as per ID,
   started [**2168-11-20**] (through [**2168-12-4**])
   - Tobra dosing changed to q48H per pharmacy
   - good response to lasix gtt yesterday, will continue with goal as
   negative as possible
   - will hold on CHF consult as pt has been improving clinically with
   diuresis
   .
   #2 Echo with focal wall motion abnormalities: These are new from prior
   echo (TEE on [**2168-11-17**]) although per cardiology this was a poor study.
   Likely ischemic in origin but unknown exactly when this occurred.
   - pt is on aspirin, will start statin and low-dose b-blocker
   (metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID) for CAD and likely NSTEMI
   - continue supportive care with medical management and secondary
   prevention of CAD
   .
   #3 Endocarditis with AR: CT surgery consulted and  surgery not
   necessary at this time however pt will need cardiology follow-up and
   likely surgery in the future once recovered from acute illness.  ID
   recommends 6 week course of vanco following positive blood culture with
   [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 46**]. Enterococcus with Day 1 = [**2168-11-9**].
   - vancomycin for 6 week course D1 = [**2168-11-9**], last day = [**2168-12-21**]
   #4 CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic. U/S of carotids negative.
   - aspirin per neurology
   .
   #5  altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection and medical
   delirium from being in ICU.  Appears to be improving.  Head CT and MRI
   do not explain AMS as per neurology.  Have considered LP; however MS
   improving.  Pt is not on sedating medication.
   -continue to manage medical and monitor
   - limit any sedating medications (pt currently not getting any)
   .
   #6 chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier
   this year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications, including vanco and tobra
   -monitor Cr, especially with diuresis.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presented with altered mental status and fevers from a rehabilitation facility.

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions:

1. Pneumonia: The patient was intubated for airway protection but developed Acinetobacter pneumonia and pulmonary edema. He was successfully extubated on [**2168-11-28**].

2. Endocarditis with AR: The patient has moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation, and significant pulmonic regurgitation. A vegetation is suggested but cannot be confirmed due to suboptimal image quality. He will need cardiology follow-up and likely surgery in the future once recovered from the acute illness.

3. Ischemic Heart Disease: The patient has focal wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram, likely of ischemic origin. He is on aspirin and will start a statin and low-dose beta-blocker for CAD and likely NSTEMI.

4. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.3-1.4 earlier this year. He will continue with calcitriol and renally dose medications, including vancomycin and tobramycin. His creatinine levels will be monitored, especially with di"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been through several medical events and complications. The note mentions the patient being on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated and is now on a face mask with stable oxygen saturation levels. The patient also has a history of pulling out lines, so restraints have been applied to their arms.

The echocardiogram shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and focal hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum. The left atrium is mildly dilated, and there is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis with mild (1+) aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse, and there is mild (1+) mitral regurgitation. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is also observed. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

The patient has allergies to various medications, including cimetidine, oxybutynin chloride, penicillins, and heparin sodium. The last dose of antibiotics given was ampicillin/sulbactam on 11/29 at 4:20 AM.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/72 to 192/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with recent endocarditis, respiratory failure, and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He was intubated and on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated yesterday and is doing well. The patient has multiple allergies, including anaphylaxis to penicillins. He received antibiotics including tobramycin, vancomycin, and ampicillin/sulbactam. The patient is receiving several medications in the ICU, including furosemide, levoxyl, calcitriol, FeSO4, ASA, prevacid, and tobramycin. His vital signs are stable, but he has a slightly elevated heart rate and low oxygen saturation. His hemodynamic monitoring shows an increased fluid balance since midnight. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory alkalosis. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, with diminished breath sounds at the bases and mild rhonchi bilaterally. The patient is alert, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately. Neurologic assessment is not complete due to limited movement and tone assessment. Lab results show anemia and elevated white blood cell count. Radiology images are included. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of endocarditis and HAP, which can increase the risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and signs of infection are necessary.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's acute"

   BCx all negative so far [**Date range (1) 2907**]
   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   #1 Pneumonia: initially intubated for airway protection but complicated
   by acinetobater pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Prolonged intubation
   due to secretions, PNA, pulmonary edema and likely some respiratory
   muscle weakness, but was extubated successfully on [**2168-11-28**].   Was
   diuresed effectively yesterday w/lasix gtt.
   - treat PNA with Tobramcyin and Unasyn for 14 day course as per ID. D/w
   ID, last dose for both is tomorrow
   - Tobra dosing changed to q48H per pharmacy due to high peaks and
   troughs
   - good response to lasix gtt yesterday, will continue with goal as
   negative as possible. Will d/c on PO lasix.
   .
   #2 Echo with focal wall motion abnormalities: These are new from prior
   echo (TEE on [**2168-11-17**]) although per cardiology this was a poor study.
   Likely ischemic in origin but unknown exactly when this occurred.  Pt
   is on aspirin, started statin and low-dose b-blocker (metoprolol 12.5
   mg PO BID) yesterday for CAD and likely NSTEMI.
   - increase metoprolol as BP allows (start with 25mg PO BID).
   - continue supportive care with medical management and secondary
   prevention of CAD
   .
   #3 Endocarditis with AR: CT surgery consulted and  surgery not
   necessary at this time however pt will need cardiology follow-up and
   likely surgery in the future once recovered from acute illness.  ID
   recommends 6 week course of vanco following positive blood culture with
   [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 46**]. Enterococcus with Day 1 = [**2168-11-9**].
   - vancomycin for 6 week course D1 = [**2168-11-9**], last day = [**2168-12-21**]
   #4 CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic. U/S of carotids negative.
   - aspirin per neurology
   .
   #5  altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection and medical
   delirium from being in ICU.  Appears to be improving.  Head CT and MRI
   do not explain AMS as per neurology.  Have considered LP; however MS
   improving.  Pt is not on sedating medication.
   -continue to manage medical and monitor
   - limit any sedating medications (pt currently not getting any)
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with PMH of DM2, CRI, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia
   who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers.
   #1 Pneumonia: intubated for airway protection but complicated by
   acinetobater pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Prolonged intubation due
   to secretions, PNA, pulmonary edema and likely some respiratory muscle
   weakness, but was extubated successfully on [**2168-11-28**].   Was diuresed
   effectively yesterday w/lasix gtt.
   - treat PNA with Tobramcyin and Unasyn for 14 day course as per ID,
   started [**2168-11-20**] (through [**2168-12-4**])
   - Tobra dosing changed to q48H per pharmacy
   - good response to lasix gtt yesterday, will continue with goal as
   negative as possible
   - will hold on CHF consult as pt has been improving clinically with
   diuresis
   .
   #2 Echo with focal wall motion abnormalities: These are new from prior
   echo (TEE on [**2168-11-17**]) although per cardiology this was a poor study.
   Likely ischemic in origin but unknown exactly when this occurred.
   - pt is on aspirin, will start statin and low-dose b-blocker
   (metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID) for CAD and likely NSTEMI
   - continue supportive care with medical management and secondary
   prevention of CAD
   .
   #3 Endocarditis with AR: CT surgery consulted and  surgery not
   necessary at this time however pt will need cardiology follow-up and
   likely surgery in the future once recovered from acute illness.  ID
   recommends 6 week course of vanco following positive blood culture with
   [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 46**]. Enterococcus with Day 1 = [**2168-11-9**].
   - vancomycin for 6 week course D1 = [**2168-11-9**], last day = [**2168-12-21**]
   #4 CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic. U/S of carotids negative.
   - aspirin per neurology
   .
   #5  altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection and medical
   delirium from being in ICU.  Appears to be improving.  Head CT and MRI
   do not explain AMS as per neurology.  Have considered LP; however MS
   improving.  Pt is not on sedating medication.
   -continue to manage medical and monitor
   - limit any sedating medications (pt currently not getting any)
   .
   #6 chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier
   this year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications, including vanco and tobra
   -monitor Cr, especially with diuresis.

   #8 hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   #9 Parkinsons Disease: continue carbidopa/levodopa and requip.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), chronic renal insufficiency stage 4, recent subdural hematomas and bacteremia, who presents from rehab with altered mental status and fevers. The patient has multiple medical complications, including pneumonia, focal wall motion abnormalities on echo (likely ischemic in origin), endocarditis with aortic regurgitation, CVA (likely embolic stroke), altered mental status, chronic renal insufficiency, DM2, hypothyroidism, Parkinson's Disease, and feeding tube in place.

The patient has been treated for acetaminophen overdose and sepsis, and he has been on various medications including metoprolol, atorvastatin, diuretics, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 131/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving IV fluids and has been diuresed effectively with Lasix.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal ranges.

The patient's imaging studies reveal focal wall motion"

   to secretions, PNA, pulmonary edema and likely some respiratory muscle
   weakness, but was extubated successfully on [**2168-11-28**].   Was diuresed
   effectively yesterday w/lasix gtt.
   - treat PNA with Tobramcyin and Unasyn for 14 day course as per ID,
   started [**2168-11-20**] (through [**2168-12-4**])
   - Tobra dosing changed to q48H per pharmacy
   - good response to lasix gtt yesterday, will continue with goal as
   negative as possible
   - will hold on CHF consult as pt has been improving clinically with
   diuresis
   .
   #2 Echo with focal wall motion abnormalities: These are new from prior
   echo (TEE on [**2168-11-17**]) although per cardiology this was a poor study.
   Likely ischemic in origin but unknown exactly when this occurred.
   - pt is on aspirin, will start statin and low-dose b-blocker
   (metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID) for CAD and likely NSTEMI
   - continue supportive care with medical management and secondary
   prevention of CAD
   .
   #3 Endocarditis with AR: CT surgery consulted and  surgery not
   necessary at this time however pt will need cardiology follow-up and
   likely surgery in the future once recovered from acute illness.  ID
   recommends 6 week course of vanco following positive blood culture with
   [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 46**]. Enterococcus with Day 1 = [**2168-11-9**].
   - vancomycin for 6 week course D1 = [**2168-11-9**], last day = [**2168-12-21**]
   #4 CVA: likely embolic stroke on MRI, either from endocarditis, or
   atheroembolic. U/S of carotids negative.
   - aspirin per neurology
   .
   #5  altered mental status: Likely secondary to infection and medical
   delirium from being in ICU.  Appears to be improving.  Head CT and MRI
   do not explain AMS as per neurology.  Have considered LP; however MS
   improving.  Pt is not on sedating medication.
   -continue to manage medical and monitor
   - limit any sedating medications (pt currently not getting any)
   .
   #6 chronic renal insufficiency stage 4: Cr baseline 1.3-1.4 earlier
   this year.
   -continue calcitriol
   -renally dose medications, including vanco and tobra
   -monitor Cr, especially with diuresis.
   #7 DM2: using ISS
   #8 hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   #9 Parkinsons Disease: continue carbidopa/levodopa and requip.
   #10 FEN: per nutrition, ground solids, nectar thickened liquids, speech
   and swallow to re-evaluate on friday
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen,
   aspiration, fall, and MRSA precautions.

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal insufficiency, recent subdural hematomas, and bacteremia. He presents from rehabilitation with altered mental status and fevers. The patient was intubated for airway protection but developed acetaminophen pneumonia and pulmonary edema. He was successfully extubated on 11/28/2168.

The patient's current medications include metoprolol and atorvastatin, which were started recently. Diuresis is being continued with Lasix gtt, as it showed a good response yesterday. The antibiotic regimen consists of Tobramycin and Unasyn for a 14-day course, as per the Infectious Disease consultant, started on 11/20/2168.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues:
1. Pneumonia: Being treated with antibiotics.
2. Echo with focal wall motion abnormalities: These are new findings from prior echo, although the quality of the study was poor. They are likely ischemic in origin but unknown exactly when this occurred. The patient is on aspirin and will start a statin and low-dose beta-blocker (metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID) for CAD and likely NSTEMI. Supportive care with medical management and secondary prevention of CAD will continue.

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of acute valvular endocarditis, presenting with respiratory failure and diagnosed with Acinetobacter pneumonia. He was extubated and had a successful CPAP titration during a portable sleep study. The patient has allergies to certain medications and was on various infusions and ICU medications. He has multiple comorbidities and is currently receiving treatment for several conditions including respiratory failure, Acinetobacter pneumonia, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, endocarditis, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient's current vital signs are within normal range, but he is experiencing poor clearance of sputum and poor cough. His lab results show normal levels for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count, but slightly elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's history of respiratory failure and Acinetobacter pneumonia, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Cardiac complications: The patient's acute on chronic systolic heart failure may lead to complications such as worsening heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.

3. Infection-related complications: With a history of endocarditis and recent pneumonia, the patient is at risk for developing new infections or having existing infections wors"
