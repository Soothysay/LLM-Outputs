","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a diagnosis of shock and sepsis. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/56 mmHg to 66/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.3°C (99.2°F). 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates an insertion of an 18-gauge line on September 28th and a multi-lumen line on September 29th. The patient experienced a small run of ventricular tachycardia (VT) when the multi-lumen line was being placed, but it stopped after the line was re-inserted. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,400 mL and output of 630 mL, with an overall positive balance of 2,770 mL. Urine output is 230 mL, and NG drainage is 700 mL.

Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 95%. The ABG results show a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 27 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 103, and HCO3- of 72 mEq/L. 

Physical examination findings include altered mental status, anemia,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate cancer, and recent ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension, consistent with sepsis. He is known to be bacteremic with gram-positive cocci (GPCs). The CT abdomen/pelvis shows ""early small bowel obstruction"" (SBO) but without signs of inflammation or abscess. Liver function tests (LFTs) are normal. The patient has anemia with a baseline hematocrit (HCT) of 23-27, now at 23.5. There are no overt signs of bleeding, but the patient is mildly positive for guaiac. There is also elevated troponin likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension and anemia. The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with a baseline creatinine (Cr) of 0.9, now at 1.3, which is likely prerenal. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate (HR) 80 bpm, blood pressure (BP) 103/56 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) 95% on nasal"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   [**Known lastname 3002**] 80M recent ventral hernia surgery, now with UTI and ?pna and
   diarrhea and SBO, altered mental status, anemia, hypotension overnight
   though did not need pressors
   Exam notable for Tm 100.6   HR  80  BP 108/58  RR 27  with 99 sat on

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate cancer, and recent ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status, and hypotension, which are consistent with sepsis. The patient is bacteremic with gram-positive cocci and may have a new right upper lobe pneumonia. A CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis shows early small bowel obstruction without signs of inflammation or abscess. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated troponin levels, acute kidney injury, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is also experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fevers, hypoxia, and hypotension suggest sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level of 0.9 has increased to 1.3, indicating a decline in kidney function. This could be due to prerenal causes such as dehydration or hypotension.

3. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The elevated troponin level indicates cardiac muscle damage, although the EKG findings are non-specific. It is important to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. This"

Vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 96/41 mmHg to 127/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure (CVP) of 5 mmHg and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2%) of 66. Fluid balance shows a total input of 5,519 mL and total output of 5,325 mL. Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through an aerosol-cool device with an ABG result of 7.43/29/86/17/-3 and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 172. Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 197 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 171 K/uL, and elevated troponin-T levels at 0.10 ng/mL. The patient's condition remains unstable, and multiple interventions have been implemented.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate cancer, and recent discharge after ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status, and hypotension consistent with sepsis. He is bacteremic with Gram-positive cocci and has a new right upper lobe pneumonia. The patient's condition is complicated by acute kidney injury, anemia, elevated troponin levels, and early small bowel obstruction. He also has a history of depression and is currently on venlafaxine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fevers, hypotension, and bacteremia suggests sepsis. This condition can progress to septic shock if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level of 0.9 has increased to 1.3, indicating possible prerenal AKI. This could be due to hypotension and dehydration.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 8.9 g/dL, and his hematocrit is 23.5%. This anemia may contribute to his altered mental status and could be exacerbated by ongoing blood loss or inadequate red blood cell production.
4. Elevated Troponin Levels: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible myocardial ischemia or injury. However, the EKG"

2. Multi-organ dysfunction: Given the presence of bacteremia with MRSA and potential sources of infection, there is a risk of systemic involvement and failure of multiple organs such as the kidneys, liver, and lungs.
3. Acute kidney injury: The baseline creatinine was 0.9 and has now increased to 1.2, indicating a decline in renal function. This may be due to prerenal causes or intrinsic renal injury.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has mild guaiac-positive stool and elevated troponin levels, which could indicate gastrointestinal bleeding or ischemia.
5. Bowel obstruction: The CT scan shows signs of early small bowel obstruction, which may require further evaluation and management.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate cancer, and recent ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension, suggestive of sepsis. The patient has been bacteremic with gram-positive cocci (GPCs) and has an elevated lactate level of 2.0. A CT abdomen/pelvis shows ""early small bowel obstruction"" (SBO) but without signs of inflammation or abscess. Liver function tests (LFTs) are normal.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient is febrile, hypoxic, and hypotensive, responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF). Lactate level is 2.0. The patient is known to be bacteremic with GPCs. There is a question of new right upper lobe pneumonia (RUL PNA). CT abdomen/pelvis shows early SBO without inflammation or abscess. LFTs are normal.

   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - Surveillance cultures

2. Altered Mental Status (AMS): Likely multifactorial with hypoxia, infection, fevers, and anemia. Will continue to treat underlying cause.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate cancer, and recent discharge after ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status, and hypotension, consistent with sepsis. The patient has bacteremia with MRSA and staph aureus in the sputum. His lactate level has trended down from 2.0 to 0.9. The patient's condition is multifactorial, with infection, AMS, anemia, elevated troponin, acute renal failure, early small bowel obstruction, and history of depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's febrile, hypoxic, and hypotension symptoms indicate sepsis, likely caused by MRSA and staph aureus bacteremia. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial to manage this condition.
2. AMS (Altered Mental Status): The patient's AMS could be due to various factors such as infection, hypoxia, or underlying medical conditions. Ensuring adequate oxygenation, treating the underlying cause, and providing supportive care are essential in managing AMS.
3. Anemia: The patient's baseline HCT (hematocrit) is 23-27%, which is trending down. Close monitoring for bleeding and regular transfusion may be necessary to maintain an adequate Hb (hemoglobin) level.
4. Elevated Troponin: The elevated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, septic shock, altered mental status, anemia, and fever. The patient has a history of chronic pain and acute pain. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 112/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on high-flow nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and other abnormal values in liver function tests and electrolytes. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, diuretics, pain management, and nutritional support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheter use.
3. Nosocomial infection or healthcare-associated infection due to prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening renal function due to septic shock and use of nephrotoxic medications.
5. Delirium or worsening mental status due to sepsis, medication effects, or underlying cognitive impairment"

   A/P: 80 year old male with hx, CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, recently
   discharged after ventral hernia repair who presents with fevers, AMS
   and hypotension c/w sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: Febrile, hypoxic, hypotension now responsive to IVF c/w
   sepsis. Lactate 2.0 has now trended down to 0.9. Has bacteremia with
   MRSA. Possibel sources include UTI given MRSA in urine, PNA given
   hypoxia, ? new RUL PNA ([**Month (only) 51**] have aspirated as well), or GI source given
   recent surgery although translocation would be unlikely cause MRSA
   bacteremia.  CT abd/pelvis shows ""early SBO"" but without inflammation
   or abcess. LFT's nl.
   - IVF boluses to keep MAP >65

   # AMS: Likely multifactorial [**1-7**] infection, fever. Also unclear
   baseline since surgery
   - Will continue to tx underlying cause
   - haldol PRN as needed for agitation
   # Anemia: Baseline HCT 23-27. Now stable at 25.7. No sign of overt
   bleeding w/o hematemasis, melena or tender abdomen. However, mildly
   Guiac +.Last transfused [**9-29**] 2am. HCT stable since.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   - transfuse for Hb<7 or HCT < 25 or active bleed
   - PPI IV BID for ? GIB
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Likely  demand ischemia in the setting of
   hypotension and anemia. No known hx of CAD or MI. EKG reassuring,
   although some non-specific Twave changes.
   - cycled enzymes, Trop down
   - improve BP
   - transfuse for Hb<7, HCT <25

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), small bowel obstructions (SBOs), prostate cancer, and recent discharge after ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension consistent with sepsis. The patient has bacteremia with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Possible sources include urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia (PNA), or gastrointestinal (GI) source due to recent surgery.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: Febrile, hypoxic, hypotension now responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF) consistent with sepsis. Lactate has trended down from 2.0 to 0.9. Bacteremia with MRSA. Possible sources include UTI given MRSA in urine, PNA given hypoxia, or GI source given recent surgery although translocation would be unlikely cause MRSA bacteremia. CT abdomen/pelvis shows ""early SBO"" but without inflammation or abscess. Liver function tests (LFTs) are normal.

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, and recent discharge after ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension, which are consistent with sepsis. His lactate level has trended down from 2.0 to 0.9, indicating improvement in tissue perfusion. He also has bacteremia with MRSA and staph aureus in the sputum.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's febrile, hypoxic, and hypotensive state is indicative of sepsis. His lactate level has improved, and he has bacteremia with MRSA and staph aureus in the sputum. The plan includes IV fluids to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg, discontinuation of Zosyn and Levo, continuation of Vancomycin for SA in blood and sputum, and follow-up blood and urine cultures, C. diff, fecal cultures, and sensitivities.

2. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient's AMS may be multifactorial, likely due to infection and post-surgery baseline confusion. The plan includes treating the underlying cause and administering Haldol PRN for agitation.

3. Anemia: The patient's HCT is trending down from baseline, currently at 24.9. There"

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate cancer, and recently discharged after ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status, and hypotension consistent with sepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA sepsis and is currently receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment. 

The patient's hypoxia is likely due to a combination of MRSA pneumonia and pleural effusions. Bedside ultrasound today will be performed to assess the pleural effusions, and if large, thoracentesis may be considered. Elevating the head of the bed and chest PT will also be continued. Diuresis will continue with a goal of -1 to 1.5 L today.

The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, including infection and fever. It is unclear if this is the baseline since surgery. The underlying cause will continue to be treated, and haloperidol (Haldol) will be given PRN for agitation.

The patient has anemia with a baseline HCT of 23-27, trending down to 24.9. There are no signs of overt bleeding, but the patient is mildly guaiac positive. The last transfusion was on [**9-29**] at 2am. The patient's HCT will continue to be monitored.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, small bowel obstructions, prostate cancer, and recent discharge after ventral hernia repair.
- He presented with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension consistent with sepsis.
- He has been diagnosed with MRSA sepsis, and his lactate levels have trended down from 2.0 to 0.9.
- Current treatment includes continuing vancomycin for MRSA in the blood and sputum, IV fluid boluses to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, and follow-up blood and urine cultures, as well as C. difficile and fecal cultures with sensitivities.
- The patient also has hypoxia, which may be due to a combination of MRSA pneumonia and pleural effusions. A bedside ultrasound is planned today to assess the pleural effusions, and a thoracentesis may be considered if large effusions are present.
- The patient is being kept in the ICU for further monitoring and management.
- Other conditions being addressed include anemia, elevated troponin levels, acute renal failure (ARF), early small bowel obstruction (SBO), and a history of depression.
- The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition remains in the ICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate cancer, and recent ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status, and hypotension, consistent with sepsis. The patient has been on vancomycin for MRSA sepsis and recently stopped on Zosyn and Levofloxacin. Sputum gram stain continues to show gram-positive cocci (GPCs). An echocardiogram shows aortic valve thickening, and cardiology recommends transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). The patient's WBC count is trending up with a differential pending today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for MRSA sepsis with vancomycin. There is a risk of ongoing infection and potential spread to other organ systems.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be due to MRSA pneumonia and pleural effusions. There is a risk of worsening respiratory status and possible need for intubation.
3. Anemia: The patient's HCT is trending down, indicating possible ongoing blood loss or inadequate production of red blood cells. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and considering transfusion if HCT falls below 21.
4. Elevated Troponin: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which may indicate myocardial ischemia or infarction. Continued monitoring and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate cancer, and recently discharged after ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension consistent with sepsis. The patient has been on vancomycin for MRSA sepsis and had stopped on Zosyn and Levofloxacin. His recent sputum continues to show GPCs on gram stain. An echo shows aortic valve thickening, and cardiology recommends a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with MRSA sepsis and is being treated with vancomycin. It is important to continue the appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of infection or worsening sepsis.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be due to MRSA pneumonia and pleural effusions. Continuing vancomycin treatment is essential, and further evaluation of pleural effusions through bedside ultrasound and thoracentesis if necessary should be considered.

3. AMS: The cause of the patient's altered mental status is multifactorial, including infection and fever. Treating the underlying cause and providing supportive care are important in managing this complication.

4. Anemia: The patient has a decreasing hemoglobin level, which needs to be monitored closely"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate cancer, and recent discharge after ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension consistent with sepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA sepsis, hypoxia, and anemia. His condition has improved with continued vancomycin treatment, IV fluid boluses, and close monitoring of blood and urine cultures. Other concerns include possible pneumonia and pleural effusions, multifactorial AMS, elevated troponin levels indicating possible demand ischemia, acute renal failure, early small bowel obstruction, and history of depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current diagnosis of MRSA sepsis needs to be closely monitored and managed with appropriate antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and supportive care.
2. Hypoxia: The combination of MRSA pneumonia and pleural effusions may contribute to the patient's hypoxia. Further evaluation with a bedside ultrasound to assess pleural effusions and consider thoracentesis if large is necessary.
3. AMS: The patient's altered mental status may be multifactorial due to infection, fever, and unclear baseline since surgery. Continued treatment of underlying causes and management of agitation with haloperidol as needed are recommended.
4. Anemia: The patient's baseline hematocrit (HCT) is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. Here is a summary of the information:

1. The patient has been receiving 800cc of urine output (UOP) after administering 20mg of Lasix, with a subsequent decrease in oxygen requirement. Another 20mg of Lasix was added, and the UOP goal was almost achieved.

2. The patient underwent an echocardiogram (echo) and increased free water flushes. An internal jugular (IJ) line was also discontinued, and a multi-lumen central venous catheter (CVC) was placed successfully without significant complications.

3. The patient had a small run of ventricular tachycardia (VT) when the CVC was being placed, but it stopped once the line was re-inserted.

4. A sputum culture was taken on [**2192-10-2**] at 05:45 PM.

5. The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Levofloxacin on [**2192-9-30**], Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on [**2192-10-1**], and Vancomycin on [**2192-10-2**].

","The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer, MRSA sepsis, and volume overload. He has had persistently poor mental status during this admission. The patient presented with respiratory distress and was found to have multi-lumen central venous catheter placement without difficulty, but experienced a small run of ventricular tachycardia when the line was being placed. A sputum culture was obtained at 05:45 PM on 10/2/2192.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was Levofloxacin on 09/30/2192 at 05:11 PM, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 10/01/2192 at 08:00 AM, and Vancomycin on 10/02/2192 at 08:00 PM.

The patient is receiving various ICU medications, including Furosemide (Lasix), Pantoprazole (Protonix), SSI, Lasix, midodrine, Effexor, Protonix, Haldol, and vitamin D/calcium.

   A/P: 80 year old male with hx, CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, recently
   discharged after ventral hernia repair who presents with fevers, AMS
   and hypotension c/w sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: MRSA sepsis with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension.  Had been
   on Zosyn, Levofloxacin and Vancomycin, but Zosyn and Levo stopped on
   [**9-30**], now just Vancomycin given source of sepsis.  Day #8 of
   Vancomycin.  Recent sputum continues to show GPCs on gram stain.  Echo
   shows aortic valve thickening and cardiology recommends TEE.  As
   patient will require prolonged antibiotics, and would not tolerate this
   procedure well currently (would likely require intubation), will wait
   on TEE until clinical status improves.  WBC count continues to trend up
   and patient still spiking fevers.  Source of ongoing infection unclear
 empyema vs. heart valve vs. small bowel vs. joint?  Thoracentesis
   yesterday c/w transudate and not exudate or empyema, though pt. does
   have another pleural effusion on the opposite side.
   - Repeat CXR this morning.
   - Request ID consult with question of switching to linezolid for better
   lung penetration given MRSA pneumonia; or switching to another more
   bacteriocidal drug.
   - Continue surveillance cx, no growth from [**9-30**] on

   #. Hypoxia: [**Month (only) 51**] be a combination of MRSA pneumonia and plural
   effusions.  Likely not pulmonary edema given CXR after thoracentesis.
   Not likely to be cardiogenic given that pt has good systolic function
   on recent echo.  Hypoxia improved after thoracentesis.
   - Thoracentesis on left-sided pleural effusion
   - Elevate head of bed and chest PT
   - Cont. diuresis with goal of net even today, PM lytes

   bleeding, however, mildly Guiac + a few days ago.  Last transfused

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, and recent ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension consistent with sepsis. The patient has been on vancomycin for MRSA sepsis since day #8, and recent sputum continues to show GPCs on gram stain. An echocardiogram shows aortic valve thickening, and cardiology recommends transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) but will wait until the patient's clinical status improves. The patient's white blood cell count is trending up, and he is still spiking fevers. The source of ongoing infection is unclear, with possibilities including empyema, heart valve infection, small bowel infection, or joint infection. A thoracentesis yesterday was consistent with transudate and not exudate or empyema, although the patient has another pleural effusion on the opposite side. Repeat chest X-ray was ordered, and an infectious disease consult was requested to consider switching antibiotics for better lung penetration given MRSA pneumonia. Thoracentesis was performed on the left-sided pleural effusion, and gram stain, culture, and fluid analysis were conducted. The patient's hypoxia is likely due to a combination of MRSA pneumonia and pleural effusions. It is unlikely to be pulmonary edema or cardiogenic in nature. The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, recently discharged after ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension consistent with sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with MRSA sepsis, and there is a continued trend of fever and elevated WBC count, indicating ongoing infection.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's SpO2 is 94%, and the ABG shows a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 253, indicating some degree of respiratory compromise. This could be due to MRSA pneumonia and pleural effusions.

3. Anemia: The patient's HCT is trending down from 23-27%, suggesting ongoing blood loss or inadequate production of red blood cells. There are signs of occult bleeding, as indicated by a mildly positive guaiac test.

4. Cardiac issues: Elevated troponin levels suggest myocardial ischemia or injury. Although the EKG is reassuring, further evaluation with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is recommended due to the aortic valve thickening seen on echo.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's initial renal function tests were abnormal, but they have since resolved.

   A/P: 80 year old male with hx, CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, recently
   discharged after ventral hernia repair who presents with fevers, AMS
   and hypotension c/w sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: MRSA sepsis with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. Lactate 2.0
   has now trended down to 0.9.  Had been on Zosyn, Levofloxacin and
   Vancomycin, but Zosyn and Levo stopped on [**9-30**], now just Vancomycin
   given source of sepsis.  Day #7 of Vancomycin.  Recent sputum continues
   to show GPCs on gram stain.  Echo shows aortic valve thickening and
   cardiology recommends TEE.  WBC trending up with differential pending
   today.
   - Cont. Vancomycin for MRSA in blood and sputum
   - Surveillance cx
   - Hold off on TEE for now, given poor respiratory status and likely
   need for intubation with TEE, also may not change course of therapy
   given MRSA bactermia.
   .
   #. Hypoxia: [**Month (only) 51**] be a combination of MRSA pneumonia and plural
   effusions.  Pt continues to be febrile, CXR not improved overall.
   ?parapneumonic effusion; although bilateral.  Not likely to be
   cardiogenic given that pt has good systolic function on recent echo.
   - Cont. vancomycin as above
   - Bedside ultrasound today to assess pleural effusions; consider
   thoracentesis if large
   - Elevate head of bed and chest PT
   - Cont. diuresis with goal -1L today, PM lytes

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate cancer, and recent discharge after ventral hernia repair. The patient presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension, which are consistent with sepsis. 

The patient has been on vancomycin for MRSA sepsis in the blood and sputum, and surveillance cultures have been ordered. The source of sepsis is still being managed with vancomycin. An echocardiogram shows aortic valve thickening, and cardiology recommends a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for further evaluation. 

The patient also has hypoxia, likely due to MRSA pneumonia and pleural effusions. Chest X-ray has not shown significant improvement, and a bedside ultrasound is planned to assess the pleural effusions. Thoracentesis may be considered if the effusions are large. The patient's head of bed has been elevated, and chest physiotherapy has been initiated.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing altered mental status (AMS), possibly due to infection or fever. The underlying cause is being treated, and haloperidol is given as needed for agitation.

The patient has anemia, with a baseline hematocrit (HCT) of 23-27% that is trending down. There are no signs of overt bleeding, but the patient is mildly guaiac"

   Vancomycin.  Recent sputum continues to show GPCs on gram stain.  Echo
   shows aortic valve thickening and cardiology recommends TEE.  As
   patient will require prolonged antibiotics, and would not tolerate this

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, and recent ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension, which are consistent with sepsis. He has been on Vancomycin for MRSA sepsis but still has ongoing fevers and a trend of increasing WBC count. The source of infection is unclear, with possibilities including empyema, heart valve infection, small bowel infection, or joint infection. Thoracentesis was performed yesterday, showing transudate and not exudate or empyema. Repeat CXR is requested, and an ID consult is requested for consideration of switching to linezolid for better lung penetration or another more bacteriocidal drug. Thoracentesis is planned today on the left-sided pleural effusion, gram stain, culture, and fluid analysis. TEE is on hold due to the patient's poor respiratory status and likely need for intubation. Hypoxia is likely due to MRSA pneumonia and pleural effusions, not pulmonary edema or cardiogenic causes. AMS is likely multifactorial, including infection and baseline confusion since surgery. Anemia is stable at HCT 24.9, and there is no sign of overt bleeding. Elevated troponin is likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension and anemia. ARF has resolved. Early S"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 80 year old male with hx, CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, recently
   discharged after ventral hernia repair who presents with fevers, AMS
   and hypotension c/w sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: MRSA sepsis with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension.  Had been
   on Zosyn, Levofloxacin and Vancomycin, but Zosyn and Levo stopped on
   [**9-30**], now just Vancomycin given source of sepsis.  Day #9 of
   Vancomycin.  Recent sputum continues to show GPCs on gram stain.  Echo
   shows aortic valve thickening and cardiology recommends TEE.  As
   patient will require prolonged antibiotics, and would not tolerate this
   procedure well currently (would likely require intubation), will wait
   on TEE until clinical status improves.  WBC count continues to trend up
   and patient still spiking fevers.  Source of ongoing infection unclear
 empyema vs. heart valve vs. small bowel vs. joint?  Thoracentesis
   yesterday c/w transudate, though pt. does have another pleural effusion
   on the opposite side.
   - ID consult: of the recommendations given by the ID team, the tests
   that can be done safely include the blood and stool cultures,  prostate
   exam, a bedside RUQ ultrasound looking for pathology that would require
   a formal study, changing the A-line and culturing the tip.
   - Will re-address issue of treating with Linezolid with the ID team.
   - Continue to follow cultures and gram stains.
   - Re-considering thoracentesis and will reassess with bedside
   ultrasound.
   - Hold off on TEE for now, given poor respiratory status and likely
   need for intubation with TEE, also may not change course of therapy
   given MRSA bacteremia.
   .
   #. Hypoxia: [**Month (only) 51**] be a combination of MRSA pneumonia and plural
   effusions.  Likely not pulmonary edema given CXR after thoracentesis.
   Not likely to be cardiogenic given that pt has good systolic function
   on recent echo.  Hypoxia improved after thoracentesis.
   - Reconsider thoracentesis with bedside ultrasound.
   - Elevate head of bed and chest PT
   - Cont. diuresis with net even goal, PM lytes
   - Will rpt CXR if respiratory status changes in the AM.
   .
   # AMS: Likely multifactorial [**1-7**] infection, fever. Also unclear
   baseline since surgery
   - Will continue to tx underlying cause
   - haldol PRN as needed for agitation
   # Anemia: Baseline HCT 23-27. Stable at 24.9 today. No sign of overt
   bleeding, however, mildly Guiac + a few days ago.  Last transfused
   [**9-29**] 2am.
   - will continue to monitor for bleeding and trend HCT
   - maintain active T&S and transfuse of <21
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Likely  demand ischemia in the setting of
   hypotension and anemia. No known hx of CAD or MI. EKG reassuring,
   although some non-specific Twave changes.  Holding BB, aspirin in
   setting of acute illness, hypotension, guiac positive. Troponin cycled
   and decreasing.
   - improve BP, transfuse for HCT<21

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, and recently discharged after ventral hernia repair. The patient presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension consistent with sepsis. He has been on vancomycin for MRSA sepsis, but other antibiotics were stopped on 9/30. The patient has ongoing fevers and an increasing white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection. The source of the infection is unclear, with possibilities including empyema, heart valve infection, small bowel infection, or joint infection. A thoracentesis performed yesterday showed transudate, although the patient has another pleural effusion on the opposite side.

The patient's respiratory support includes high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery. His vital signs show a temperature of 101.1°F, blood pressure ranging from 101/40-63 mmHg, heart rate between 81-119 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, coarse bilateral crackles in the lungs, soft and mildly tender abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds, and trace bilateral edema.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1-15.4 thousand/mm3, decreased hemoglobin of 6.9-7.0 g/dL, slightly low platelet count of 125-130 thousand/mm3, normal creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, low potassium of 3.0-3.1 mEq/L, normal magnesium of 2.0 mg/dL, and low phosphate of 2.7 mg/dL. The patient's blood cultures are positive for MRSA.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for MRSA sepsis, consideration of a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to evaluate for endocarditis, re-evaluation of thoracentesis due to the presence of another pleural effusion, and monitoring of the patient's respiratory status. The patient's other medical issues include hypoxia likely due to MRSA pneumonia and pleural effusions, altered mental status potentially related to infection and baseline confusion, anemia with a baseline hematocrit of 23-27%, and elevated troponin levels indicating possible myocardial ischemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening sepsis, development of organ failure, progression of pneumonia or pleural effusions, further decline in mental status, and potential complications from any procedures performed, such as thoracentesis or a TEE if pursued in the future."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 80 year old male with hx, CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, recently
   discharged after ventral hernia repair who presents with fevers, AMS
   and hypotension c/w sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: MRSA sepsis with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension.  Had been
   on Zosyn, Levofloxacin and Vancomycin, but Zosyn and Levo stopped on
   [**9-30**], now just Vancomycin given source of sepsis.  Day #10 of
   Vancomycin.  Recent blood and sputum continues to show GPCs on gram
   stain.  WBC count continues to trend up and patient still spiking
   fevers.  Source of ongoing infection unclear
 empyema vs. heart valve
   vs. small bowel vs. joint?  Thoracentesis yesterday c/w transudate,
   though pt. does have another pleural effusion on the opposite side.
   - ID consult: of the recommendations given by the ID team, the tests
   that can be done safely include the blood and stool cultures,  prostate
   exam, a bedside RUQ ultrasound looking for pathology that would require
   a formal study, changing the A-line and culturing the tip.
   - Continue to follow cultures and gram stains.
   - Re-considering thoracentesis
   - Hold off on TEE for now, given poor respiratory status and likely
   need for intubation with TEE, also may not change course of therapy
   given MRSA bacteremia.
   - If pt remains afebrile and condition improves, will wait for cultures
   of lines to return.  If however, he spikes a temperature or if his
   conditions worsens, will perform LP and CT scan his torso with
   contrast.
   .
   #. Hypoxia: [**Month (only) 51**] be a combination of MRSA pneumonia and plural
   effusions.  Likely not pulmonary edema given CXR after thoracentesis.
   Not likely to be cardiogenic given that pt has good systolic function
   on recent echo.  Hypoxia improved after thoracentesis.
   - Elevate head of bed and chest PT
   - Cont. diuresis with net goal of -1-1.5L, PM lytes
   - Will rpt CXR if respiratory status changes in the AM.
   .
   # AMS: Likely multifactorial [**1-7**] infection, fever. Also unclear
   baseline since surgery
   - Will continue to tx underlying cause
   - haldol PRN as needed for agitation
   # Anemia: Baseline HCT 23-27. Stable at 24.9 today. No sign of overt
   bleeding, however, mildly Guiac + a few days ago.  Last transfused
   [**9-29**] 2am.
   - will continue to monitor for bleeding and trend HCT
   - maintain active T&S and transfuse of <21
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Likely  demand ischemia in the setting of
   hypotension and anemia. No known hx of CAD or MI. EKG reassuring,
   although some non-specific Twave changes.  Holding BB, aspirin in
   setting of acute illness, hypotension, guiac positive. Troponin cycled
   and decreasing.
   - improve BP, transfuse for HCT<21

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, and recent ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension consistent with sepsis. He has been on Vancomycin for 10 days, but his blood and sputum cultures continue to show GPCs on gram stain. The source of the ongoing infection is unclear, with possibilities including empyema, heart valve infection, small bowel infection, or joint infection. Thoracentesis was performed yesterday, which showed transudate but the patient has another pleural effusion on the opposite side. 

Potential Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition suggests ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Organ Failure: The patient's hypotension and altered mental status may indicate potential organ dysfunction, including renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or respiratory failure.
3. Anemia: The patient's HCT is stable at 24.9, but there is a positive guaiac test indicating possible bleeding. Monitoring for bleeding and trending HCT is necessary to prevent further anemia.
4. Ischemia: Elevated troponin levels suggest possible demand ischemia, especially in the setting of hypotension and anemia. Improving blood pressure and transfusing for HCT <21 may help prevent further ischemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of wound infection, anemia, and chronic pain. Upon admission, the patient's arterial line and PICC line were stopped due to issues. The patient received a blood transfusion with a post-transfusion hemoglobin concentration (HCT) of 23.5%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/37 to 94/22 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and is not on mechanical ventilation. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.1 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and decreased platelet count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for low magnesium levels. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine level. The patient's liver function tests are normal, but there are elevated levels of troponin-T and CK-MB, suggesting myocardial injury. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis reveals respiratory acidosis with an elevated TCO2 level. The patient's skin integrity is impaired, and there are signs"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 80 year old male with hx, CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, recently
   discharged after ventral hernia repair who presents with fevers, AMS
   and hypotension c/w sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: MRSA sepsis with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension.  Had been
   on Zosyn, Levofloxacin and Vancomycin, but Zosyn and Levo stopped on
   [**9-30**], now just Vancomycin given source of sepsis.  Day #9 of
   Vancomycin.  Recent sputum continues to show GPCs on gram stain.  Echo
   shows aortic valve thickening and cardiology recommends TEE.  As
   patient will require prolonged antibiotics, and would not tolerate this
   procedure well currently (would likely require intubation), will wait
   on TEE until clinical status improves.  WBC count continues to trend up
   and patient still spiking fevers.  Source of ongoing infection unclear
 empyema vs. heart valve vs. small bowel vs. joint?  Thoracentesis
   yesterday c/w transudate, though pt. does have another pleural effusion
   on the opposite side.
   - ID consult: of the recommendations given by the ID team, the tests
   that can be done safely include the blood and stool cultures,  prostate
   exam, a bedside RUQ ultrasound looking for pathology that would require
   a formal study, changing the A-line and culturing the tip.
   - Will re-address issue of treating with Linezolid with the ID team.
   - Continue to follow cultures and gram stains.
   - Re-considering thoracentesis and will reassess with bedside
   ultrasound.
   - Hold off on TEE for now, given poor respiratory status and likely
   need for intubation with TEE, also may not change course of therapy
   given MRSA bacteremia.
   .
   #. Hypoxia: [**Month (only) 51**] be a combination of MRSA pneumonia and plural
   effusions.  Likely not pulmonary edema given CXR after thoracentesis.
   Not likely to be cardiogenic given that pt has good systolic function
   on recent echo.  Hypoxia improved after thoracentesis.
   - Reconsider thoracentesis with bedside ultrasound.
   - Elevate head of bed and chest PT
   - Cont. diuresis with net even goal, PM lytes
   - Will rpt CXR if respiratory status changes in the AM.
   .
   # AMS: Likely multifactorial [**1-7**] infection, fever. Also unclear
   baseline since surgery
   - Will continue to tx underlying cause
   - haldol PRN as needed for agitation
   # Anemia: Baseline HCT 23-27. Stable at 24.9 today. No sign of overt
   bleeding, however, mildly Guiac + a few days ago.  Last transfused
   [**9-29**] 2am.
   - will continue to monitor for bleeding and trend HCT
   - maintain active T&S and transfuse of <21
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Likely  demand ischemia in the setting of
   hypotension and anemia. No known hx of CAD or MI. EKG reassuring,
   although some non-specific Twave changes.  Holding BB, aspirin in
   setting of acute illness, hypotension, guiac positive. Troponin cycled
   and decreasing.
   - improve BP, transfuse for HCT<21
   .
   # ARF: resolved
   .
   # Early SBO: Tender abdominal this morning.  Tolerating tube feeds.  C.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate cancer, and recent discharge after ventral hernia repair.
- The patient presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension consistent with sepsis.
- He has been on vancomycin for MRSA sepsis since day #9.
- Recent sputum continues to show gram-positive cocci (GPCs) on gram stain.
- An echocardiogram (echo) shows aortic valve thickening, and cardiology recommends transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), but it will be delayed until the patient's clinical status improves.
- The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is trending up, and he is still experiencing fevers.
- The source of the ongoing infection is unclear, with possibilities including empyema, heart valve infection, small bowel infection, or joint infection.
- Thoracentesis yesterday showed transudate, although the patient has another pleural effusion on the opposite side.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with prostate cancer and MRSA sepsis, who is experiencing ongoing bacteremia and volume overload. He is in a tenuous respiratory state and has a history of altered mental status. The patient has a sacral ulcer, cool skin, and is unable to stand. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/34 mmHg to 127/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is receiving various medications and infusions, including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitor, midodrine, haloperidol, vitamin D, calcium carbonate, B6, fish oil, and diuretics. The patient has undergone several procedures and tests, including arterial line and PICC line placement, blood cultures, chest X-rays, and lab work.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing bacteremia and fever indicate an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is described as tenuous, suggesting a risk of respiratory failure.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an excess intake of 2,257 mL and an output of only 1,240 mL, indicating fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema, hypertension,"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 80 year old male with hx, CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, recently
   discharged after ventral hernia repair who presents with fevers, AMS
   and hypotension c/w sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: MRSA sepsis with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension.  Had been
   on Zosyn, Levofloxacin and Vancomycin, but Zosyn and Levo stopped on
   [**9-30**], now just Vancomycin given source of sepsis.  Day #10 of
   Vancomycin.  Recent blood and sputum continues to show GPCs on gram
   stain.  WBC count continues to trend up and patient still spiking
   fevers.  Source of ongoing infection unclear
 appears to be persistent
   bacteremia despite vancomycin, possible endovascular source.
   - ID recs appreciated, suggesting TEE, MRI spine, Chest CT, repeat
   thoracentesis
   - will obtain CT Torso today to assess lung parenchyma and ?abdominal
   source of sepsis
   - will check ECG for PR prolongation or conduction abnormalities
   suggesting valvular abscess
   - obtain CT head today to assess for MS changes
   - will discuss with cardiology regarding utility of repeat TTE given
   poor image quality and recent L thoracentesis
   - Continue to follow cultures and gram stains.
   - Re-considering thoracentesis; although per CXR does not appear to be
   re-expanding
   - Hold off on TEE for now, given poor respiratory status and likely
   need for intubation with TEE
   - Consider adding back Zosyn depending on CT results
   - Consider LP if no other source identified given MS changes
   .
   #. Hypoxia: [**Month (only) 51**] be a combination of MRSA pneumonia and plural
   effusions.  Likely not pulmonary edema given CXR after thoracentesis.
   Not likely to be cardiogenic given that pt has good systolic function
   on recent echo.  Hypoxia briefly improved after thoracentesis; however
   pt
s respiratory status continues to decline.
   - Elevate head of bed and chest PT
   - Cont. diuresis with net goal of -1-1.5L as tolerated by BP
   - f/u CT torso

   # AMS: Likely multifactorial [**1-7**] infection, fever. Also unclear
   baseline since surgery
   - Will continue to tx underlying cause
   - f/u CT head
   - haldol PRN as needed for agitation
   # Anemia: Baseline HCT 23-27. Stable at 24.9 today. No sign of overt
   bleeding, however, mildly Guiac + a few days ago.  Last transfused
   [**9-29**] 2am.
   - will continue to monitor for bleeding and trend HCT
   - maintain active T&S and transfuse of <21

   # Elevated Troponin: Likely  demand ischemia in the setting of
   hypotension and anemia. No known hx of CAD or MI. EKG reassuring,
   although some non-specific Twave changes.  Holding BB, aspirin in
   setting of acute illness, hypotension, guiac positive. Troponin cycled

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), small bowel obstructions (SBOs), prostate cancer (prostate CA), and recently discharged after ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension, which are consistent with sepsis. The source of infection appears to be persistent bacteremia despite vancomycin therapy, suggesting a possible endovascular source. The patient has been on vancomycin for 10 days, and recent blood and sputum cultures show gram-positive cocci (GPCs) on gram stain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition indicates ongoing infection and sepsis, as evidenced by persistent bacteremia, fevers, hypoxia, and hypotension. Immediate attention should be given to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate treatment.
2. Endovascular Source: Given the persistent bacteremia despite vancomycin therapy, there is a concern for an endovascular source of infection. Further investigations such as a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), MRI spine, chest CT, and repeat thoracentesis should be considered to identify the source.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to a combination of MRSA pneumonia and pleural effusions. It is important to rule out other causes such as pulmonary edema and cardiogenic"

   A/P: 80 year old male with hx, CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, recently
   discharged after ventral hernia repair who presents with fevers, AMS
   and hypotension c/w sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: MRSA sepsis with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension.  Had been
   on Zosyn, Levofloxacin and Vancomycin, but Zosyn and Levo stopped on
   [**9-30**], now just Vancomycin given source of sepsis.  Day #10 of
   Vancomycin.  Recent blood and sputum continues to show GPCs on gram
   stain.  WBC count continues to trend up and patient still spiking
   fevers.  Source of ongoing infection unclear
 empyema vs. heart valve
   vs. small bowel vs. joint?  Thoracentesis yesterday c/w transudate,
   though pt. does have another pleural effusion on the opposite side.
   - ID consult: of the recommendations given by the ID team, the tests
   that can be done safely include the blood and stool cultures,  prostate
   exam, a bedside RUQ ultrasound looking for pathology that would require
   a formal study, changing the A-line and culturing the tip.
   - Continue to follow cultures and gram stains.
   - Re-considering thoracentesis
   - Hold off on TEE for now, given poor respiratory status and likely
   need for intubation with TEE, also may not change course of therapy
   given MRSA bacteremia.
   - If pt remains afebrile and condition improves, will wait for cultures
   of lines to return.  If however, he spikes a temperature or if his
   conditions worsens, will perform LP and CT scan his torso with
   contrast.
   .
   #. Hypoxia: [**Month (only) 51**] be a combination of MRSA pneumonia and plural
   effusions.  Likely not pulmonary edema given CXR after thoracentesis.
   Not likely to be cardiogenic given that pt has good systolic function
   on recent echo.  Hypoxia improved after thoracentesis.
   - Elevate head of bed and chest PT
   - Cont. diuresis with net goal of -1-1.5L, PM lytes
   - Will rpt CXR if respiratory status changes in the AM.
   .
   # AMS: Likely multifactorial [**1-7**] infection, fever. Also unclear
   baseline since surgery
   - Will continue to tx underlying cause
   - haldol PRN as needed for agitation
   # Anemia: Baseline HCT 23-27. Stable at 24.9 today. No sign of overt
   bleeding, however, mildly Guiac + a few days ago.  Last transfused
   [**9-29**] 2am.
   - will continue to monitor for bleeding and trend HCT
   - maintain active T&S and transfuse of <21
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Likely  demand ischemia in the setting of
   hypotension and anemia. No known hx of CAD or MI. EKG reassuring,
   although some non-specific Twave changes.  Holding BB, aspirin in
   setting of acute illness, hypotension, guiac positive. Troponin cycled
   and decreasing.
   - improve BP, transfuse for HCT<21
   .
   # ARF: resolved
   .
   # Early SBO: Tender abdominal this morning.  Tolerating tube feeds.  C.
   diff neg.
   - KUB today
   - surgery  following,
   .
   # Hx depression:
   - stop  venlaflaxine as above

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, who was recently discharged after ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension, consistent with sepsis. The patient has been on vancomycin for MRSA sepsis, but his blood and sputum cultures continue to show GPCs on gram stain, indicating ongoing infection. The source of the infection is unclear, with possible locations including empyema, heart valve, small bowel, or joint. 

The patient also has other medical issues such as hypoxia, likely due to MRSA pneumonia and pleural effusions, anemia, elevated troponin levels suggestive of demand ischemia, acute renal failure (ARF) which has resolved, early small bowel obstruction (SBO), depression, and feeding tube in place (FEN). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, respiratory failure, cardiovascular collapse, organ dysfunction (e.g., renal, hepatic), further episodes of gastrointestinal obstruction, and possible complications related to the feeding tube. 

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate assessment and appropriate management of the patient's condition."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer, MRSA sepsis, fluid overload, and tenuous respiratory status. He is currently in the ICU and requires high-flow oxygen. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/41 (58) to 80/29 (41) mmHg, a respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has been hypotensive and required intravenous fluids overnight. He has no known drug allergies and is receiving various medications including furosemide, pantoprazole, midodrine, vitamin D, calcium, B6, fish oil, and SSI.

24-hour events include blood culturing, hypotension requiring IVF, and the administration of vancomycin. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, high platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels. His arterial blood gas results indicate respiratory acidosis. The patient's physical examination reveals general well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds, presence of bilateral rhonchi in the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, and trace edema in both extremities.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Impaired skin integrity.
2. Alteration in nutrition.
3. Hypotension ("

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer, MRSA sepsis, fluid overload, and tenuous respiratory status. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/41 to 80/29 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient has been receiving various medications, including furosemide, pantoprazole, midodrine, vitamin D/calcium, B6, fish oil, and antibiotics for MRSA sepsis. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and lactate levels. The blood cultures were drawn on 10/6/2192 at 10:45 AM. 

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished and overweight/obese appearance, normal heart sounds, rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both extremities, and unassessed skin. 

The patient's neurological status is described as follows: responds to verbal stimuli, movement not assessed, tone not assessed, and follows some commands but not interactive. 

The assessment and plan include impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypotension (not in shock), intermittent development of sepsis, potential expansion of antibiotic coverage, addition of Zosyn, hold on further Lasix, hypoxemia/respiratory distress, altered mental status (not delirium), MRSA bacteremia, and consideration for a pan CT scan to look for abscesses. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory status, development of septic shock, worsening of renal function, worsening of nutritional status, and potential development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)."

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fevers. The patient has been febrile and received Zosyn, but continued to have persistent fevers despite Tylenol. The patient became hypotensive at 10 pm and received 2 liters of normal saline with some effect. A central line was placed in the right internal jugular vein. A full-body CT scan was performed. The patient's ECG showed no conduction delays indicating abscess - normal. The patient is on multiple medications including norepinephrine, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 119/37 mmHg (58/24-38), respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula with oxygen and has an ABG result of ///27. Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, neurologic assessment not assessed, and other assessments not completed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient's blood cultures were drawn. Assessment and plan include fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypotension, hypoxemia, altered mental status, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient is being provided with ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include but are not limited to:

1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis. This condition can cause organ dysfunction and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU. Prophylactic measures such as heparin sodium are being administered, but close monitoring for signs of thrombosis is essential.

3. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is on pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Stress ulcers can occur in critically ill patients, and prophylaxis is important to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.

4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula with oxygen, which puts them at risk for VAP. Regular assessment of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent this complication.

5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 80 year old male with hx, CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, recently
   discharged after ventral hernia repair who presents with fevers, AMS
   and hypotension c/w sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: MRSA sepsis with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension.  Had been
   on Zosyn, Levofloxacin and Vancomycin, but Zosyn and Levo stopped on
   [**9-30**], now just Vancomycin given source of sepsis.  Day #11 of
   Vancomycin.  Recent blood and sputum continues to show GPCs on gram
   stain.  WBC count continues to trend up and patient still spiking
   fevers.  Source of ongoing infection unclear
 appears to be persistent
   bacteremia despite vancomycin, possible endovascular source.  ECG
   showing no conduction abnormalities to suggest valvular abscess.  Also
   CT showing proctitis and many prostate mets.  Hypotension appears to be
   worsening.  Patient is persistently febrile and hypoxic.
   - ID recs appreciated
   - will discuss with cardiology regarding utility of repeat TTE given
   poor image quality and recent L thoracentesis. However, unsure whether
   this would change management.
   - Continue to follow cultures and gram stains.
   - Hold off on TEE for now, given poor respiratory status and likely
   need for intubation with TEE
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for now
   - maintain BPs with fluids and if necessary pressors
   - will consider prostate u/s to look for MRSA abscess.
   .
   #. Hypoxia: [**Month (only) 51**] be a combination of MRSA pneumonia and plural
   effusions.  Likely not pulmonary edema given CXR after thoracentesis.
   Not likely to be cardiogenic given that pt has good systolic function
   on recent echo.  Hypoxia briefly improved after thoracentesis; however
   now reaccumulated. Pt
s respiratory status continues to slowly decline.
   - Elevate head of bed and chest PT
   - Will hold off on diuresis today given hypotension
   .
   # AMS: Likely multifactorial [**1-7**] infection, fever. Also unclear
   baseline since surgery. Head CT negative.
   - Will continue to tx underlying cause
   - haldol PRN as needed for agitation
   # Anemia: Baseline HCT 23-27. Stable at 24.9 today. No sign of overt
   bleeding, however, mildly Guiac + a few days ago.  Last transfused
   [**9-29**] 2am.
   - will continue to monitor for bleeding and trend HCT
   - maintain active T&S and transfuse of <21
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Likely  demand ischemia in the setting of
   hypotension and anemia. No known hx of CAD or MI. EKG reassuring,
   although some non-specific Twave changes.  Holding BB, aspirin in
   setting of acute illness, hypotension, guiac positive. Troponin cycled
   and decreasing.
   - improve BP, transfuse for HCT<21
   .
   # ARF: resolved
   .
   # Early SBO:  Tolerating tube feeds.  C. diff neg.  Having regular BMs.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hx depression:
   - venlaflaxine stopped
   .
   # FEN: Tolerating tube feeds (started [**9-30**]) / Replete lytes PRN/ no

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, small bowel obstructions, prostate cancer, and recent ventral hernia repair. He presented with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension, which are consistent with sepsis. The patient has been on vancomycin for the past 11 days, but continues to have persistent fevers and an increasing white blood cell count, suggesting ongoing bacteremia. There is a possibility of an endovascular source of infection. The patient's hypotension is worsening, and he remains febrile and hypoxic.

The ECG shows no conduction abnormalities, ruling out valvular abscess. A CT scan reveals proctitis and multiple prostate metastases. The patient's respiratory status is declining, and there is reaccumulation of pleural effusions despite thoracentesis.

The patient's other medical issues include anemia, elevated troponin levels indicating possible myocardial ischemia, acute renal failure (resolved), early small bowel obstruction, history of depression, and fecal incontinence. He is currently receiving tube feeds, prophylactic medications, and has two peripheral IV lines.

Overall, the potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include ongoing sepsis with a possible endovascular source, worsening hypotension, respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia and pleural effusions, multi-organ dysfunction, and"

   A/P: 80 year old male with hx, CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, recently
   discharged after ventral hernia repair who presents with fevers, AMS
   and hypotension c/w sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis [**1-7**] MRSA bacteremia and aortic valve vegatation: MRSA sepsis
   with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension.  Had been on Zosyn, Levofloxacin
   and Vancomycin, but Zosyn and Levo stopped on [**9-30**], now just
   Vancomycin given source of sepsis.  Day #12 of Vancomycin.  TTE
   confirms large vegetation on valve.  Gentamycin added for synergy.  Pt
   has been hypotensive but responds to fluids, 3L positive yesterday.  Pt
   is not a surgical candidate.  Will discuss with family regarding
   further management.
   - ID recs appreciated
   - Continue Vanc and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] check [**First Name3 (LF) **] peak and trough, d/c Cefepime
   and Cipro
   - continue surveillance cultures once a day
   - will discuss with family regarding further care and potential for
   surgery
   - if hypotensive will start levophed as pt is currently fluid
   resuscitated
   .
   #. Hypoxia: [**Month (only) 51**] be a combination of MRSA pneumonia and plural
   effusions.  Likely not pulmonary edema given CXR after thoracentesis.
   Not likely to be cardiogenic given that pt has good systolic function
   on recent echo.  Hypoxia briefly improved after thoracentesis; however
   now reaccumulated. Pt
s respiratory status continues to slowly decline.
   - Elevate head of bed and chest PT
   - will start nebs today
   .
   # RLE Edema: R>L edema concerning for clot.  Pt is on DVT prophylaxis
   with SC heparin and pneumoboots
   - LENI RLE

   # AMS: Likely multifactorial [**1-7**] infection, fever. Also unclear
   baseline since surgery. Head CT negative.
   - Will continue to tx underlying cause
   - haldol PRN as needed for agitation
   # Anemia: Baseline HCT 23-27. Stable at 24.9 today. No sign of overt
   bleeding, however, mildly Guiac + a few days ago.  Last transfused
   [**9-29**] 2am.
   - will transfuse 1 unit PRBCs for symptomatic benefit
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Likely  demand ischemia in the setting of
   hypotension and anemia. No known hx of CAD or MI. EKG reassuring,
   although some non-specific Twave changes.  Holding BB, aspirin in
   setting of acute illness, hypotension, guiac positive. Troponin cycled
   and decreasing.
   - improve BP, transfuse for HCT<21

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate cancer, and recently discharged after ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension consistent with sepsis. He has been diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and aortic valve vegetation. The patient has been on vancomycin, but gentamicin was added for synergy. He remains hypotensive but responds to fluids. The patient is not a surgical candidate, and further management options will be discussed with the family.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis due to MRSA bacteremia and aortic valve vegetation. This is evidenced by fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient has been on vancomycin but still requires further management.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status continues to decline, which may be due to MRSA pneumonia and pleural effusions. Elevating the head of the bed and administering chest PT has been recommended.

3. Right Lower Extremity (RLE) Edema: The patient has R>L edema, which is concerning for clot formation. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are already in place, including subcutaneous heparin and pneumatic boots.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of fever, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with infective endocarditis and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including cefepime and gentamicin. The patient's condition has been fluctuating with episodes of fluid-responsive hypotension and an increase in the severity of aortic regurgitation. The patient's left ventricular systolic dysfunction has also worsened, suggesting possible emboli to the coronary arteries.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and altered mental status may indicate the development of sepsis secondary to infective endocarditis.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The worsening aortic regurgitation and left ventricular systolic dysfunction can lead to cardiogenic shock, characterized by poor tissue perfusion and hypotension.
3. Myocardial Infarction: Emboli to the coronary arteries can cause myocardial ischemia and potentially lead to myocardial infarction.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The use of nephrotoxic antibiotics (gentamicin) and potential hypotension may compromise renal function, leading to acute kidney injury.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemia and altered mental status may progress to respiratory failure if oxygenation and ventilation parameters are not closely monitored and managed.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 80 year old male with hx, CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, recently
   discharged after ventral hernia repair who presents with fevers, AMS
   and hypotension c/w sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: MRSA sepsis with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension.  Had been
   on Zosyn, Levofloxacin and Vancomycin, but Zosyn and Levo stopped on
   [**9-30**], now just Vancomycin given source of sepsis.  Day #11 of
   Vancomycin.  Recent blood and sputum continues to show GPCs on gram
   stain.  WBC count continues to trend up and patient still spiking
   fevers.  Source of ongoing infection unclear
 appears to be persistent
   bacteremia despite vancomycin, possible endovascular source.  ECG
   showing no conduction abnormalities to suggest valvular abscess.  Also
   CT showing proctitis and many prostate mets.  Hypotension appears to be
   worsening.  Patient is persistently febrile and hypoxic.
   - ID recs appreciated
   - will discuss with cardiology regarding utility of repeat TTE given
   poor image quality and recent L thoracentesis. However, unsure whether
   this would change management.
   - Continue to follow cultures and gram stains.
   - Hold off on TEE for now, given poor respiratory status and likely
   need for intubation with TEE
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for now
   - maintain BPs with fluids and if necessary pressors
   - will consider prostate u/s to look for MRSA abscess.
   .
   #. Hypoxia: [**Month (only) 51**] be a combination of MRSA pneumonia and plural
   effusions.  Likely not pulmonary edema given CXR after thoracentesis.
   Not likely to be cardiogenic given that pt has good systolic function
   on recent echo.  Hypoxia briefly improved after thoracentesis; however
   now reaccumulated. Pt
s respiratory status continues to slowly decline.
   - Elevate head of bed and chest PT
   - Will hold off on diuresis today given hypotension
   .
   # AMS: Likely multifactorial [**1-7**] infection, fever. Also unclear
   baseline since surgery. Head CT negative.
   - Will continue to tx underlying cause
   - haldol PRN as needed for agitation
   # Anemia: Baseline HCT 23-27. Stable at 24.9 today. No sign of overt
   bleeding, however, mildly Guiac + a few days ago.  Last transfused
   [**9-29**] 2am.
   - will continue to monitor for bleeding and trend HCT
   - maintain active T&S and transfuse of <21
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Likely  demand ischemia in the setting of
   hypotension and anemia. No known hx of CAD or MI. EKG reassuring,
   although some non-specific Twave changes.  Holding BB, aspirin in
   setting of acute illness, hypotension, guiac positive. Troponin cycled
   and decreasing.
   - improve BP, transfuse for HCT<21

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate cancer, and recent ventral hernia repair. He presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension consistent with sepsis. The patient has been on vancomycin for MRSA sepsis but continues to show GPCs on gram stain, indicating persistent bacteremia. There is suspicion of an endovascular source of infection. The patient's hypotension is worsening, and he remains febrile and hypoxic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension suggest ongoing sepsis, possibly due to MRSA infection. This can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially multiple organ failure if not promptly managed.
2. Endovascular source of infection: The presence of GPCs on gram stain and persistent bacteremia indicate a possible endovascular source of infection. This could include endocarditis or a prosthetic device infection, which can be serious and require surgical intervention.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status is declining, leading to hypoxia. This may be due to MRSA pneumonia and pleural effusions. Adequate oxygenation should be maintained, and further investigation into the cause of hypoxia is warranted.
4. Anemia: The patient's HCT level is stable at 24.9"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate cancer, and recently discharged after ventral hernia repair. The patient presents with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension, which are consistent with sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. MRSA bacteremia and aortic valve vegetation: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and aortic valve vegetation, leading to sepsis. This can result in further spread of infection, worsening septic shock, and potential heart failure due to valve damage.

2. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, which may be due to MRSA pneumonia and pleural effusions. This can lead to respiratory failure and inadequate oxygen supply to vital organs.

3. RLE Edema: The patient has right lower extremity edema, which is concerning for a possible blood clot. If confirmed, it could result in complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

4. AMS: The patient is showing signs of altered mental status, which can be attributed to various causes including infection, fever, and baseline confusion due to age or underlying medical conditions. This can potentially progress to severe confusion or delirium.

   Assessment and Plan
 A/P: 80 year old male with hx, CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, recently
   discharged after ventral hernia repair who presented with fevers, AMS
   and hypotension c/w sepsis, found to have aortic valve endocarditis.
   .
   # Sepsis [**1-7**] MRSA bacteremia and aortic valve vegatation: MRSA sepsis
   with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension.  Had been on Zosyn, Levofloxacin
   and Vancomycin, but Zosyn and Levo stopped on [**9-30**], now just
   Vancomycin given source of sepsis.  Day #13 of Vancomycin.  Gentamycin
   day #2 for synergy.  Pt has been hypotensive, now intubated, on
   Levophed for BP.  Per cardiac surgery.
   - Continue Vanc/Gent
 Vanc dose held today for trough of 30.  Will
   recheck trough in AM and redose then
   - continue surveillance cultures once a day
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - plan for AVR surgery in AM, cardiac cath today for evaluation of
   coronaries and valve
   .
   #. Hypoxia: Multifactorial with pleural effusions, pulmonary edema,
   possible infectious etiology.  Intubated last night for worsening
   respiratory status.
   - continue to support with mechanical ventilation, will continue for
   surgery tomorrow
   .
   # RLE Edema: R>L edema was concerning for clot but LENIs negative.  Pt
   is on DVT prophylaxis with SC heparin and pneumoboots.
   .
   # AMS: Likely multifactorial [**1-7**] infection, fever. Also unclear
   baseline since surgery. Head CT negative.
   - Will continue to tx underlying cause
   - haldol PRN as needed for agitation
   # Anemia: Baseline HCT 23-27. Stable at 24.9 today. No sign of overt
   bleeding, however, mildly Guiac + a few days ago.  Received 2 units
   PRBCs last night.  Getting additional 2 units this AM in anticipation
   for surgery.
   - continue to transfuse in anticipation for surgery
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Troponins continuing to rise, no clear ECG changes
   although some T wave flattening on ECGs.  Pt may have septic emboli to
   coronaries given new wall motion abnormalities and reduced EF on recent
   echo.
   - hold off on aspirin, plavix, heparin in anticipation of surgery
   tomorrow
   - continue to monitor clinical picture
   - cardiac cath prior to surgery
   .
   # ARF: creatinine increased to 1.4 today, like from hypotension, poor
   perfusion
   - renal protective therapy with sodium bicarb and mucomyst
   - stop gent for now with cardiac cath pending, will restart post-op
   .
   # Early SBO:  Tolerating tube feeds.  C. diff neg.  Having regular BMs.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hx depression:
   - venlaflaxine stopped
   .
   # FEN: Tolerating tube feeds, held in anticipation of surgery/ Replete
   lytes PRN/ no more free water boluses.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: SC Heparin, PPI, Bowel regimen

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, and recently discharged after ventral hernia repair. He presented with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension consistent with sepsis. He was found to have aortic valve endocarditis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently on vancomycin and gentamicin for MRSA bacteremia and aortic valve vegetation. Due to his hypotension, he is intubated and on Levophed for blood pressure support. This indicates a severe infection that can lead to septic shock if not managed appropriately.

2. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, which may be multifactorial including pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and possible infectious etiology. Intubation and mechanical ventilation will continue to support respiratory function during surgery.

3. RLE Edema: The patient has right lower extremity edema, which was concerning for clot but a ultrasound showed no deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is on DVT prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin and pneumatic boots.

4. AMS: The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, including infection and fever. Further evaluation and treatment of underlying causes will continue.

5. Anemia: The patient has a baseline"

   Assessment and Plan
 A/P: 80 year old male with hx, CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, recently
   discharged after ventral hernia repair who presented with fevers, AMS
   and hypotension c/w sepsis, found to have aortic valve endocarditis.
   .
   # Sepsis [**1-7**] MRSA bacteremia and aortic valve vegatation: MRSA sepsis
   with fever, hypoxia, and hypotension.  Had been on Zosyn, Levofloxacin
   and Vancomycin, but Zosyn and Levo stopped on [**9-30**], now just
   Vancomycin given source of sepsis.  Day #13 of Vancomycin.  Gentamycin
   day #2 for synergy.  Pt has been hypotensive, now intubated, on
   Levophed for BP.  Per cardiac surgery.
   - Continue Vanc/Gent
 Vanc dose held today for trough of 30.  Will
   recheck trough in AM and redose then
   - continue surveillance cultures once a day
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - plan for AVR surgery in AM, cardiac cath today for evaluation of
   coronaries and valve
   .
   #. Hypoxia: Multifactorial with pleural effusions, pulmonary edema,
   possible infectious etiology.  Intubated last night for worsening
   respiratory status.
   - continue to support with mechanical ventilation, will continue for
   surgery tomorrow
   .
   # RLE Edema: R>L edema was concerning for clot but LENIs negative.  Pt
   is on DVT prophylaxis with SC heparin and pneumoboots.
   .
   # AMS: Likely multifactorial [**1-7**] infection, fever. Also unclear
   baseline since surgery. Head CT negative.
   - Will continue to tx underlying cause
   - haldol PRN as needed for agitation
   # Anemia: Baseline HCT 23-27. Stable at 24.9 today. No sign of overt
   bleeding, however, mildly Guiac + a few days ago.  Received 2 units
   PRBCs last night.  Getting additional 2 units this AM in anticipation
   for surgery.
   - continue to transfuse in anticipation for surgery
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Troponins continuing to rise, no clear ECG changes
   although some T wave flattening on ECGs.  Pt may have septic emboli to
   coronaries given new wall motion abnormalities and reduced EF on recent
   echo.
   - hold off on aspirin, plavix, heparin in anticipation of surgery
   tomorrow
   - continue to monitor clinical picture
   - cardiac cath prior to surgery
   .
   # ARF: creatinine increased to 1.4 today, like from hypotension, poor
   perfusion
   - renal protective therapy with sodium bicarb and mucomyst
   - stop gent for now with cardiac cath pending, will restart post-op
   .
   # Early SBO:  Tolerating tube feeds.  C. diff neg.  Having regular BMs.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hx depression:
   - venlaflaxine stopped
   .
   # FEN: Tolerating tube feeds, held in anticipation of surgery/ Replete

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, who presented with fevers, altered mental status (AMS), and hypotension, consistent with sepsis. He was recently discharged after ventral hernia repair. The patient has been diagnosed with aortic valve endocarditis and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been experiencing fevers, AMS, and hypotension, which are consistent with sepsis. He has MRSA bacteremia and aortic valve vegetation, making him at risk for sepsis complications such as organ dysfunction or failure.

2. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, which could be due to pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, or an infectious etiology. Intubation and mechanical ventilation are being used to support his respiratory status.

3. Right Lower Extremity Edema: The patient has edema in his right lower extremity, which was initially concerning for a clot. However, a lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENS) was negative, ruling out deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is on DVT prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin and pneumatic boots.

4. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient's AMS may be multifactorial, including infection, fever, and unclear baseline since surgery."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3002**] is an 80 year old male with PMH of CVA, SBO's, prostate CA
   with aortic valve endocarditis, now s/p aortic valve replacement with
   persistant delirium post-operatively.
   .
   #Aortic Valve Endocarditis - now s/p aortic valve replacement with
   porcine valve.  All blood cultures since surgery are without any
   growth.
   -continue linezolid for VISA/dapto intermed sensitivity staph
   -discuss w/ID course of abx therapy
   -follow serial blood cultures
   .
   # Delirium: likely multifactorial due to combination of significant
   persistnat bacteremia and fevers prior to surgery as well as open heart
   surgery.  Constipation is also a likely contributing factor as well as
   pain post operatively.  Other possible concern could be persistent
   focus of infection although he has been afebrile and WBC stable.  He is
   not on any sedating medications.
   -treat pain with tylenol standing, low dose oxycodone if appears to be
   in pain
   -continue to hold other sedating medications
   -f/u culture data
   -continue with bowel regimen
   -consider head ct vs MRI to evaluate further if no improvement
   .
   #Lower extremity stiffness - according to ID notes there is concern
   that he could have epidural abscess [**1-7**] seeding from his endocarditis
   because has not been moving his lower extremitites independently.  He
   does not appear to have any evidence of cord involvement on exam
   although unable to do full neurological exam [**1-7**] delirium.  No evidence
   of continued infection based on blood cultures or other lab data
   although he is certainly at high risk given his persistent bacteremia
   preoperatively.
   -follow neuro exam daily
   -low threshold for MRI spine to eval for abscess
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation - he had Afib with RVR post-operatively for which
   he was started on amiodarone.  He is currently in NSR with rate in the
   60-70's.  He is also on low dose metoprolol.  LFT's have been stable
   since.  He has no h/o afib prior to surgery therefore may have been
   isolated event in setting of open heart surgery.
   -check TSH
   -will need PFT's as outpatient
   -continue amiodarone 400mg daily
   -monitor on tele
   -discuss with CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] likelihood of Afib returning
   .
   #Volume Overload - he is about 18L + over his length of stay with
   significant pleural effusions and lower extremity edema.
   -continue with diuresis with goal -1-2L daily as tolerated by blood
   pressure
   -consider lasix gtt if hypotensive with bolus lasix
   .
   #Abdominal discomfort - unclear etiology, he has had KUB and abdominal
   ultrasound which were unrevealing.  Possibly do to constipation and
   delayed gi transit.
   -follow LFT's
   -bowel regimen
   .
   #Decubitus Ulcer - located on coccyx, followed by wound consult service
   with full recommendations in chart
   -continue w/wound care per recommendations
   -[**Doctor First Name 372**] air mattress
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 22 on admission with guaiac positive stools concerning
   for slow GI bleed.  He was transfused 9 units PRBC preoperatively.  HCT
   has been stable ~30 post op.
   -daily HCT
   -further GI workup as indicated once improved
   .
   #Depression - has not been getting effexor during this admission
   .
   # FEN: Tube feeds, replete lyts

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of CVA, SBO's, prostate CA with aortic valve endocarditis, and s/p aortic valve replacement. He is currently in the ICU with persistent delirium post-operatively. The patient's chief complaint is abdominal discomfort, but other significant findings include lower extremity stiffness, volume overload, atrial fibrillation, decubitus ulcer, anemia, and depression.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 60-70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/58 mmHg to 101/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms.

The patient's physical examination reveals pupils that are slightly asymmetric but reactive to light bilaterally, coarse breath sounds with no significant wheezing, a midline sternotomy with a clean, dry bandage in place, well-healed midline scar, and diffuse tenderness with grimacing on exam. There is also warm skin with 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities.

Laboratory results show normal WBC count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Blood cultures have been negative since surgery. Other notable lab values include elevated potassium levels and low bicarbonate levels. Imaging studies, such"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3002**] is an 80 year old male with PMH of CVA, SBO's, prostate CA
   with aortic valve endocarditis, now s/p aortic valve replacement with
   persistant delirium post-operatively.
   .
   # Delirium: Now that infection has cleared and the patient is on a
   stripped down medication regimen, delirium is most likely due to his
   prolonged ICU stay and critical illness.  Pain could also be
   contributing.  Does not appear to currently be infected.
   -treat pain with tylenol standing, low dose oxycodone if appears to be
   in pain.  He could have also flipped septic emboli off of his AV prior
   to AVR.
   -continue to hold other sedating medications
   -f/u culture data
   -continue with bowel regimen
   -consider head ct vs MRI.
   .
   #Aortic Valve Endocarditis - now s/p aortic valve replacement with
   porcine valve.  All blood cultures since surgery are without any
   growth.
   -continue linezolid for VISA/dapto intermed sensitivity staph
   -discuss w/ID course of abx therapy
   -follow serial blood cultures
   .
   #Lower extremity stiffness - according to ID notes there is concern
   that he could have epidural abscess [**1-7**] seeding from his endocarditis
   because has not been moving his lower extremitites independently.  He
   does not appear to have any evidence of cord involvement on exam
   although unable to do full neurological exam [**1-7**] delirium.  No evidence
   of continued infection based on blood cultures or other lab data
   although he is certainly at high risk given his persistent bacteremia
   preoperatively.
   -follow neuro exam daily
   -Check MRI spine and brain to eval for abscess/septic emboli
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation - he had Afib with RVR post-operatively for which
   he was started on amiodarone.  He is currently in NSR with rate in the
   60-70's.  He is also on low dose metoprolol.  LFT's have been stable
   since.  He has no h/o afib prior to surgery therefore may have been
   isolated event in setting of open heart surgery.
   - TSH pending
   -will need PFT's as outpatient
   -continue amiodarone 400mg daily  and decrease to 200 mg daily when
   loaded with 10 mg.
   -monitor on tele
   -discuss with CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] likelihood of Afib returning
   .
   #Volume Overload - he is about 18L + over his length of stay with
   significant pleural effusions and lower extremity edema.  Creatinine
   has been gradually creeping upward over the last several days.
   - will stop standing lasix and switch to a lasix drip for better
   ability to titrate diuresis.
   .
   #Abdominal discomfort - unclear etiology, he has had KUB and abdominal
   ultrasound which were unrevealing.  Possibly do to pain from stretching
   of his median sternotomy or pressure on his sacral decub with abdominal
   pressure.  Constipation and delayed gi transit also possible, though
   less likely given prior work-up.
   - continue bowel regimen
   - follow serial abdominal exams
   - low threshold to re-image abdomen
   .
   #Decubitus Ulcer - located on coccyx, followed by wound consult service
   with full recommendations in chart
   -continue w/wound care per recommendations
   -[**Doctor First Name 372**] air mattress
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 22 on admission with guaiac positive stools concerning
   for slow GI bleed.  He was transfused 9 units PRBC preoperatively.  HCT
   has been stable ~30 post op but dropped 3 units today.
   -check pm HCT
   - transfuse to keep hct > 25
   -further GI workup as indicated once improved
   .
   #Depression - Effexor stopped previously during this admission
   .
   # FEN: Replace dubhoff, resume tube feeds, replete lytes
   .
   # Access: R IJ, PICC line requested, will need to be performed by IR as
   IV team unable to place
   .
   # Dispo: Will consider call out to [**Hospital Ward Name 289**] 3 where lasix drip can be
   performed.

   persistnat bacteremia and fevers prior to surgery as well as open heart
   surgery.  Constipation is also a likely contributing factor as well as
   pain post operatively.  Other possible concern could be persistent

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing persistent delirium post-operatively, which may be due to a combination of factors such as significant persistent bacteremia and fevers prior to surgery, open heart surgery, constipation, pain post-operatively, and possible persistent focus of infection.

2. Lower extremity stiffness: There is concern about the possibility of an epidural abscess seeding from his endocarditis, as he has not been moving his lower extremities independently. However, there is no evidence of cord involvement on exam, and blood cultures do not show continued infection.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response post-operatively and was started on amiodarone. He is currently in normal sinus rhythm with a rate in the 60-70's. It is important to monitor his TSH levels, discuss the likelihood of Afib returning with the cardiologist, and perform pulmonary function tests as an outpatient.

4. Volume overload: The patient has significant pleural effusions and lower extremity edema, indicating volume overload. Diuretics should be continued with the goal of -1-2L daily as tolerated by blood pressure, and lasix gtt may be considered if hypotensive with bolus lasix.

5. Abdominal discomfort: The etiology of the abdominal discomfort is unclear, but"
