   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 15 yesterday from 19 on admission that morning, but is
   increasing again to 16 this AM.  Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung
   and head and neck are known to produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin
   could possibly produce this.  This could also be secondary to bony mets
   ; she does have elevated Alk Phos.  Another possibility on differential
   is sarcoidosis because of increased peri-hilar densities.  PTH is
   normal level, but should be lower with such high calcium
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - lasix [**Hospital1 **] to lessen overall edema and fluid in lungs, possibly to
   help w Ca as well
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction, but ask endo about
   premedicating for calcitonin
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   - consider Hemodialysis if Ca cannot be decreased
   - f/u w Renal recs
   .
   # Perihilar densities:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be malignant spread to lymph nodes or sarcoidosis.
   - Chest CT today to evaluate perihilar areas
   - ACE level
   - f/u [**1-22**]-OH and 25-OH Vit D levels
   - speak w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who knows pt from previously
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 today from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).  [**Month (only) 8**] still
   be prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**] showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes. Pt also
   has left knee pain.
   - need Bone Scan this week to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine for pain control
 consider switching to a different PO med,
   though pt feels that she had recently been having more difficulty
   swallowing recently
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.  Improving slowly
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - advance diet slowly
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for
   reoccurance of her squamous cell carcinoma.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about his perspective regarding her cancer status

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed her hospital course, labs,
   and imaging, and I was present for the key portions of the services
   provided.  I have also reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9313**]
s note and agree with her
   findings and plan of care.  The patient remains hypercalcemic to Ca=16,
   and Ringers has been switched to NS to eliminate all Ca from IV
   We
ll continue to give vigorous IV NS and use lasix to avoid further
   edema and third spacing elsewhere.   Her CXR looks quite suspicious for
   sarcoid with bilateral and mediastinal adenopathy, and this might also
   explain her hypercalcemia.  We will further evaluate this with chest CT
   and serum ACE, but at some point she may come to node biopsy for
   definitive dx and rx.  Meanwhile her hip pain will be further evaluated
   with pelvic CT.  However she would seem to merit a reevaluation of the
   status of her squamous cell skin cancer (?PET-CT?), and we will contact
   Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name (NI) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] of whom know her well for this problem.  The
   patient is stable enough to continue her IV fluids on the floor and
   we
ll call her out to an onc floor.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh who was admitted with hypercalcemia. She has a history of excision in July and has been experiencing increasing calcium levels despite treatment.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 160/84 mmHg to 191/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals alertness, dry mucus membranes, clear oropharynx, supple neck, no jugular venous distention, regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, moderately distended abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds, non-tender abdomen, Foley catheter in place, warm and well-perfused extremities with increased non-pitting edema in lower extremities, and a well-appearing scar from a previous surgery.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of calcium (16.0 mg/dL), phosphorus (4.3 mg/dL), magnesium (1.6 mg/dL), potassium (24 mEq/L), and slightly elevated white blood cell count (12.2 K/uL). Other lab values are within normal range.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh, who underwent excision in July. She was admitted with hypercalcemia and has been experiencing increasing calcium levels despite treatment. Her current calcium level is 16.0 mg/dL. The patient's medical history includes a recent excision of a baseball-sized mass from her left mid medial thigh, chronic iron-deficiency anemia, and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.1°C (97%), heart rate 80 bpm (78-91 bpm), blood pressure 160/84 mmHg (108/67-191/88 mmHg), respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute (13-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation 94% on nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals dry mucus membranes, oropharynx clear, supple neck, no jugular venous distention, no murmurs, rubs, gallops, inspiratory crackles bilaterally at the bases, moderately distended abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds, nontender abdomen, warm well-perfused extremities with increased nonpitting lower extremity edema, and a well-healed scar from the excision of a mass on her left mid medial thigh. No spinal tenderness or masses are palpated.

   field of view.
   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 15 yesterday from 19 on admission that morning, but is
   increasing again to 16 this AM.  Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung
   and head and neck are known to produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin
   could possibly produce this.  This could also be secondary to bony mets
   ; she does have elevated Alk Phos.
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u PTH  , PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 today from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).  Likely
   prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**]  showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - Volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Check Urine lytes
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   - need Bone Scan
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine 2-4 mg IV q6h prn for pain control.
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - NPO for now with IVF.
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for
   reoccurance of her squamous cell carcinoma.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh, previously excised in July 2006. She was admitted with hypercalcemia, which initially decreased to 15 but is now increasing again to 16. The patient has a history of squamous cell carcinomas of the lung and head and neck, which are known to produce parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rP). This could be the cause of her hypercalcemia, or it could be secondary to bony metastases.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Hypercalcemia: Despite initial improvement, calcium levels are increasing again. The patient is receiving IV fluid hydration and will start normal saline today for a few liters, then return to lactated Ringer's solution. Once she appears euvolemic, the goal is to achieve a urine output of 100-150 cc/hr. Calcitonin administration is avoided due to an allergic reaction. Further endocrine recommendations are pending.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved from 3.2 to 2.2 today. This is likely prerenal, possibly due to volume depletion and the direct renal vasoconstrictive effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney. Management includes volume repletion and treatment of hypercalcemia.

   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 14.1 yesterday evening, patient refused labs overnight
   and this morning nursing and IV nurse were unable to draw labs or place
   a new peripheral, put patient in for a PICC.  CT scan showed concern
   for progression of malignancy with innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar
   masses, bony lesions in the iliac bones bilaterally and left inguinal
   enlarging LAD.  Given new CT scan findings the most likely etiology is
   recurrence of her metastatic disease, especially with the bony mets
   seen in her pelvis on CT.  Prior to the CT scan based on CXR findings,
   there was concern for possible Sarcoid, which seems less likely now,
   but will follow up final CT scan read.

   be prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**] showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes. Pt also
   has left knee pain.
   - need Bone Scan this week to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine for pain control
 consider switching to a different PO med,
   though pt feels that she had recently been having more difficulty
   swallowing recently
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.  Improving slowly
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - advance diet slowly
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for
   reoccurance of her squamous cell carcinoma.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about his perspective regarding her cancer status

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh who was admitted with hypercalcemia. The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hypercalcemia: The patient initially had a high calcium level of 19.8, which has decreased to 14.1. The cause of hypercalcemia is likely recurrence of her metastatic disease.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved from 3.2 to 2.2. The cause of acute renal failure could be prerenal due to volume depletion or direct renal vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia.

3. Right posterior hip pain: The patient has focal iliac crest pain, and X-rays have not been helpful. The pain may be secondary to metastases or positional changes. A bone scan is needed to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions, and a pelvis CT should be done to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for the source of pain.

4. Elevated LFTs/lipase: The patient has mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase. Pancreatitis is a possible side effect of hypercalcemia, but other causes should also be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 14.1 yesterday evening, patient refused labs overnight
   and this morning nursing and IV nurse were unable to draw labs or place
   a new peripheral, put patient in for a PICC.  CT scan showed concern
   for progression of malignancy with innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar
   masses, bony lesions in the iliac bones bilaterally and left inguinal
   enlarging LAD.  Given new CT scan findings the most likely etiology is
   recurrence of her metastatic disease, especially with the bony mets
   seen in her pelvis on CT.  Prior to the CT scan based on CXR findings,
   there was concern for possible Sarcoid, which seems less likely now,
   but will follow up final CT scan read.
   - Have been continuing NS with 20meq of K+ at 300cc/hr with lasix [**Hospital1 **],
   having difficulty drawing labs and were unable to get another
   periptheral IV, so put patient in for an urgent PICC.  If repeat
   morning labs show decreasing calcium then will decrease IVF rate to
   200cc/hr as patient is fluid overloaded with bilateral pleural
   effusions.  If Ca continues to decrease will discontinue lasix with
   decrease in IVF rate.
   -F/U morning labs
   - F/U with oncology about further plans for possible bx of lung
   lesions, pt. scheduled for bone scan today
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP ,  Vit D, ACE level
   - Increased bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   - f/u  Renal recs
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 yesterday from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).
   Likely due to hypercalcemia, patient currently putting out large
   volumes of urine.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - [**Hospital1 **] Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
No NSAIDS
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, has lytic lesions on CT
   scan
   - follow up Bone Scan to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Morphine for pain control, small doses have currently been working
   well.
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient had a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.  Both
   improving, patient currently tolerating a regular diet without
   difficulty, appears to have currently resolved.
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids, and has
   remained stable.  She is a Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not
   want tranfusion of any type of blood products.
   - Continue to [**Last Name (LF) 1940**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hold iron supplements for now given

   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  Hypercalcemia and imaging are
   very concerning for metastatic disease, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is aware and will
   stop by sometime today.  Will f/u with oncology recs about the need for
   possible biopsy of one of the pulmonary nodules.  Will f/u with

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 15 yesterday from 19 on admission that morning, but is
   increasing again to 16 this AM.  Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung
   and head and neck are known to produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin
   could possibly produce this.  This could also be secondary to bony mets
   ; she does have elevated Alk Phos.  Another possibility on differential
   is sarcoidosis because of increased peri-hilar densities.  PTH is
   normal level, but should be lower with such high calcium
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - lasix [**Hospital1 **] to lessen overall edema and fluid in lungs, possibly to
   help w Ca as well
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction, but ask endo about
   premedicating for calcitonin
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   - consider Hemodialysis if Ca cannot be decreased
   - f/u w Renal recs

   - Chest CT today to evaluate perihilar areas
   - ACE level
   - f/u [**1-22**]-OH and 25-OH Vit D levels
   - speak w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who knows pt from previously

   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 today from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).  [**Month (only) 8**] still
   be prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**] showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes. Pt also
   has left knee pain.
   - need Bone Scan this week to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine for pain control
 consider switching to a different PO med,
   though pt feels that she had recently been having more difficulty
   swallowing recently
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.  Improving slowly
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - advance diet slowly
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for
   reoccurance of her squamous cell carcinoma.

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, presenting with hypercalcemia and acute renal failure (ARF). She has innumerable lung nodules, a large pelvic mass, and lytic lesions on imaging. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 115 bpm and elevated blood pressure ranging from 168/68 mmHg to 196/102 mmHg. Respiratory rate is within normal limits at 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Temperature is slightly low at 35.6°C (96.1°F).

Fluid balance indicates an intake of 6,933 mL and output of 9,100 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of 2,167 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids and lasix for aggressive diuresis, which has improved calcium levels.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of calcium (14.1 mg/dL), magnesium (2.1 mg/dL), and phosphorus (2.8 mg/dL). Kidney function is impaired with an elevated creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL. Liver function tests are within normal limits, while electrolytes show mild hyponatremia and hypokalemia. 

Imaging reveals chest X-ray findings of left pleural effusion, CT scan showing multiple lung nodules,"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - double lumen PICC line placed morning of [**10-10**]
   - still very anxious ; responds well to ativan
   - Bone Scan today by Nuclear Medicine
   - Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] stopped by in evening.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] told her it is
   most likely metastatic cancer.  He thinks we need a tissue biopsy,
   possibly just from medial leg (which he thinks is likely the same as
   what is in the lungs)
   - was called out to OMED ---> but we kept her b/c of her very elevated
   BPs and HRs
   - intensified bowel regimen --> patient had multiple BM
   - Patient has been having increasing tachycardia all night, up to 130s,
   appears to be in sinus rhythm -- tried fluid boluses, tried
   anti-anxiety (ativan), which have not improved it ; consider also PE,
   though not strong enough suspicion to start heparin (cannot give her
   contrast for scan); consider also SVT? though looks like sinus rhythm
   - also has been having increasing BPs, consistently around 190/100-->
   gave IV hydralazine acutely; PO hydral did not seem to have much
   effect, so started labetalol low-dose (200mg [**Hospital1 **]) which helped both HR
   and BP... though the concern was not to mask whatever was causing the
   tachycardia
   - pt does have dropping O2 sat to low 90s when sleeping; patient
   snoring so concern for sleep apnea

   new subcutaneous left lower quadrant and left inguinal nodules, all
   indicative of marked progression of metastatic disease.
   2. Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
   3. Diverticulosis
   CT Chest: IMPRESSION: 1. Marked progression of extensive bilateral
   pulmonary nodules with large hilar masses inseparable from mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy as well as numerous ossesous lytic lesions. Overall,
   these findings are new since [**Month (only) 1646**] and concerning for rapid progression

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 11.8 today with continued IV hydration at a lower rate,
   she continues to have brisk urine output, even with the discontinuation
   of the lasix.  CT scan concerning for progression of malignancy with
   innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar masses, bony lesions in the iliac
   bones bilaterally and left inguinal enlarging LAD, which is the most
   likely cause of her hypercalcemia.
   - Decreased IVF rate to 150cc/hr since her calcium has been improving
   and she is LOS up about 9L of fluid, also discontinued lasix as her
   urine output has remained brisk and calcium is down to 11.8.
   - Renal function improving with IVF and decreasing calcium
   - Bone Scan: shows known bony mets, but also with concern for possible
   mets to the chest wall, possible skull mets, and femoral hypertrophic
   pulmonary osteoarthropathy.
   - Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] came by to see the patient, and spoke with
   her about her metastatic disease, patient will go to the oncology floor
   when she leaves the ICU for further management
   - constipation related to hypercalcemia has resolved with aggressive
   bowel regimen, will continue bowel regimen as patient also continues to
   receive narcotics
   - Mildly elevated Alk Phos from her bony mets
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP , Vit D, ACE level
   - Renal and Endocrine following, appreciate recs
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 1.9 today from 3.2 on admission (her baseline is
   0.6-0.7), most likely due to her hypercalemia, renal function is
   improving with decreased calcium and continued hydration
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
No NSAIDS
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia: initially thought to be due to anxiety/pain
   and dehydration, which may still be playing a role, however ativan has
   not really helped, and patient has been aggressively hydrated with
   IVF
s.  In discussion with her husband, it sounds like she was
   hypertensive prior to admission (SBP
s in the 150
s) but not on any
   medications, which may be exacerbated by the stress of the hospital.
   - EKG showed Sinus Tachycardia
 no response to ativan, morhpine, IVF
   - Started labetalol for BP and HR control with some effect, BP may also
   improve with decrease in total body volume
   # Right posterior hip pain:  The patient has focal iliac crest pain on
   exam, has lytic lesions on CT scan
   - Morphine for pain control, small doses have currently been working
   well but will transition to po oxycodone liquid as patient has
   difficulty swallowing pills
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids, and has
   remained stable.  She is a Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not
   want tranfusion of any type of blood products.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  Hypercalcemia and imaging are
   very concerning for worsening metastatic disease,  per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will
   consult IR for biopsy of one of the lesions in her iliac bones
   - patient for transfer to OMED when she leaves ICU for further

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh, who was admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8. She has been aggressively hydrated with IV fluids and her calcium levels have improved. However, her renal function was initially impaired, but has now improved with continued hydration and decreased calcium levels.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate in the 130s, elevated blood pressure around 190/100, and an oxygen saturation in the low 90s when sleeping. She has been receiving treatment for hypertension and tachycardia, which has shown some effect with the use of labetalol.

Her physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the bases, bilaterally, with more prominence on the left side. She also has a moderately distended abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds and non-tender abdomen. Extremity edema is present in both upper and lower extremities, with more pronounced edema in the left lower extremity.

Her imaging studies reveal multiple pulmonary nodules with large hilar masses inseparable from mediastinal lymphadenopathy, numerous ossesous lytic lesions, and a vertebral body lesion. These findings are indicative of marked progression of metastatic disease.

The patient has a history of previous malignancy and her bone scan shows known bony metastases, possible chest wall metastasis, skull metastasis, and femoral hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthrop"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - double lumen PICC line placed morning of [**10-10**]
   - still very anxious ; responds well to ativan
   - Bone Scan today by Nuclear Medicine
   - Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] stopped by in evening.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] told her it is
   most likely metastatic cancer.  He thinks we need a tissue biopsy,
   possibly just from medial leg (which he thinks is likely the same as
   what is in the lungs)
   - was called out to OMED ---> but we kept her b/c of her very elevated
   BPs and HRs
   - intensified bowel regimen --> patient has been stooling all
   afternoon/evening
   - Patient has been having increasing tachycardia all night, up to 130s,
   appears to be in sinus rhythm -- tried fluid boluses, tried
   anti-anxiety (ativan), which have not improved it ; consider also PE,
   though not strong enough suspicion to start heparin (cannot give her
   contrast for scan); consider also SVT? though looks like sinus rhythm
   - also has been having increasing BPs, consistently around 190/100-->
   gave IV hydralazine acutely; PO hydral did not seem to have much
   effect, so started labetalol low-dose (200mg [**Hospital1 **]) which helped both HR
   and BP... though the concern was not to mask whatever was causing the
   tachycardia
   - pt does have dropping O2 sat to low 90s when sleeping; may be related
   to orthopnea, pleural effusions, ?sleep apnea
