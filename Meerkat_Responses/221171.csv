","The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU for hypertensive crisis and acute respiratory failure. The patient has a history of uncontrolled hypertension and presents with symptoms such as elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Upon admission, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 181/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on face tent with FiO2 of 30%. The patient is receiving heparin sodium and furosemide infusions.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but normal creatinine and electrolyte levels. The troponin-T level is below the detection limit, indicating no evidence of myocardial injury.

The chest X-ray shows a small pericardial effusion and evidence of pulmonary congestion. The echocardiogram reveals left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis, and a dilated thoracic aorta. These findings suggest a primary pulmonary process.

The patient's fluid balance reveals a net fluid loss of 2,741 mL over the past 24 hours. The respiratory support includes a face"

   hypertension. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall

   etc.).
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 6036**] is a 53yo morbidly obese male with h/o
   ETOH abuse who presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely
   due to a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid
   overload.
   1)Hypoxia: Likely components of both central and obstructive sleep
   apnea.  Continues to have episodes of hypoxia during the night while
   sleeping, gases demonstrate respiratory acidosis during that time.  In
   addition, continues to be fluid overloaded.  Physical exam findings
   suggest some mild volume overload as well.  Diuresis along with sleep
   study and possible therapeutic trach may be necessary.
   - BiPAP
 consider trach placement
   - Cont. to check ABG
   - ECHO to assess systolic/diastolic function and pulmonary pressures
   - Continue nebs
   - Cont. diuresis, net negative 2.7 L overnight, will suggest goal of
   -1.5-2L
   - F/U ED BCx
   2)Hypertension: Pt. with BP in 180, likely contributing to apneic
   spells as echo demonstrates pulmonary hypertension.
   - Start hydrochlorothiazide, contine IV lasix diuresis
   - Cont. to monitor PM lytes
   3)Renal insufficiency: Cr at 1.3 on admission, now down to 1.0
   - Continue to monitor considering that pt. is being actively diuresed.
   4)ETOH abuse: Patient reports drinking 6 beers/day. No evidence of
   withdrawal at this time.
   - Consider CIWA scale if develops symptoms of withdrawal.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity and ethanol abuse. He presented with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid overload. The patient has been diagnosed with left ventricular hypertrophy, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis, and dilated thoracic aorta. The patient continues to have episodes of hypoxia during the night while sleeping and is also experiencing fluid overload. Physical exam findings suggest mild volume overload as well. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypoxia: The patient is likely experiencing both central and obstructive sleep apnea, leading to episodes of hypoxia during sleep. The patient is also fluid overloaded. Diuresis, sleep study, and possible therapeutic tracheostomy may be necessary.
2) Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high, contributing to apneic spells as indicated by the echocardiogram showing pulmonary hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide and continued IV lasix diuresis should be started. Monitoring for post-myocardial infarction (PM) electrolyte imbalances is important.
3) Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level was initially elevated at 1.3 but has now decreased to 1.0. Continued monitoring is necessary due to active diuresis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of alcohol abuse. He presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid overload. The patient is currently in the ICU, where he has been receiving diuretics, nebulizers, and CPAP therapy at night. His blood pressure is still high, and he has evidence of renal insufficiency. He also has a history of ETOH abuse but currently shows no signs of withdrawal.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient continues to experience episodes of hypoxia during the night while sleeping, along with respiratory acidosis. Proper management of sleep apnea through CPAP therapy and diuresis is crucial to prevent further complications.
2. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure contributes to apneic spells and pulmonary hypertension. Aggressive treatment with antihypertensive medications, such as hydrochlorothiazide, is necessary to control his blood pressure and reduce the strain on his heart.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level was elevated on admission but has improved since starting diuretic therapy. Close monitoring of renal function is essential to prevent further deterioration.
4. ETOH abuse: Although the patient is currently asymptomatic, his history of alcohol abuse should be addressed, and consideration should be given to using the CIWA scale"

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxia, hypertension, fluid overload, and possible renal insufficiency. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hypoxia, further increase in blood pressure, worsening fluid overload, and potential worsening of renal function. 

Based on the progress note, the patient has already undergone some interventions such as diuresis, nebulizer treatments, and monitoring of vital signs. However, it is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent any complications. This may include continuing diuresis, considering tracheostomy placement, monitoring for signs of ETOH withdrawal, and ensuring glycemic control."

   ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
   biventricular systolic function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
   hypokinesis. Dilated thoracic aorta.  These findings are c/w a primary
   pulmonary process (e.g., sleep apnea, COPD, chronic pulmonary embolism,
   etc.).
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 6036**] is a 53yo morbidly obese male with h/o
   ETOH abuse who presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely
   due to a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid
   overload.
   1)Hypoxia: Likely components of both central and obstructive sleep
   apnea.  Continues to have episodes of hypoxia during the night while
   sleeping, gases demonstrate respiratory acidosis during that time.  In
   addition, continues to be fluid overloaded.  Physical exam findings
   suggest some mild volume overload as well.  Diuresis along with sleep
   study and possible therapeutic trach may be necessary.
   - BiPAP
 consider trach placement
   - Cont. to check ABG
   - ECHO to assess systolic/diastolic function and pulmonary pressures
   - Continue nebs
   - Cont. diuresis, net negative 2.7 L overnight, will suggest goal of
   -1.5-2L
   - F/U ED BCx
   2)Hypertension: Pt. with BP in 180, likely contributing to apneic
   spells as echo demonstrates pulmonary hypertension.
   - Start hydrochlorothiazide, contine IV lasix diuresis
   - Cont. to monitor PM lytes
   3)Renal insufficiency: Cr at 1.3 on admission, now down to 1.0
   - Continue to monitor considering that pt. is being actively diuresed.
   4)ETOH abuse: Patient reports drinking 6 beers/day. No evidence of
   withdrawal at this time.
   - Consider CIWA scale if develops symptoms of withdrawal.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of ETOH abuse who presented with severe hypoxia and hypertension. He likely has a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea along with fluid overload. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 181/91 mmHg to 135/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. He is on various medications including heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), and others. The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral injection of lateral conjunctiva, clear oropharynx, supple neck, regular heart rhythm, and clear lungs with expiratory wheezes in the upper lung fields anteriorly. His neurological examination is normal, and his blood tests show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and potassium levels, as well as decreased hematocrit and platelet count. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. An echocardiogram shows left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis, and a dilated thoracic aorta. The assessment and plan involve managing hypoxia, hypertension, fluid overload, renal insufficiency, and E"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of ETOH abuse. He presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid overload. The patient is currently in the ICU, where he is being treated for multiple medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's severe hypoxia could be attributed to both central and obstructive sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy may be necessary at night to maintain adequate oxygenation. Close monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABGs) is essential.
2. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be managed to prevent any potential complications. Continuing hydrochlorothiazide and IV lasix diuresis may help in controlling the blood pressure levels. Regular monitoring of potassium levels is necessary due to the use of diuretics.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level has improved from 1.3 on admission to 0.9 currently. Close monitoring of renal function is required, especially since the patient is being actively diuresed.
4. ETOH abuse: The patient reports drinking six beers per day. It is important to consider the possibility of alcohol withdrawal if symptoms arise, and the use of the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA) scale may be helpful in this regard.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of alcohol abuse. He presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid overload. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving treatment for hypoxia, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and alcohol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient may continue to experience episodes of low oxygen levels, which can lead to further respiratory distress and organ dysfunction.
2. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure may persist, increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and there is a risk of worsening renal insufficiency due to ongoing diuresis and fluid management.
4. Alcohol abuse: The patient's history of alcohol abuse increases the risk of withdrawal symptoms, liver damage, and other complications associated with chronic alcohol consumption.

Overall, close monitoring and appropriate management of these potential complications are necessary to ensure the patient's well-being and improve his health outcomes."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity and alcohol abuse. He presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to an underlying pulmonary process and a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid overload. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 120/89 mmHg, heart rate of 92 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. He has a history of ETOH abuse and reports drinking 6 beers per day. No evidence of withdrawal symptoms is observed at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's severe hypoxia may be attributed to both central and obstructive sleep apnea. The physical exam findings suggest mild volume overload, indicating ongoing fluid retention. Diuretics will be continued to manage fluid balance, and CPAP therapy will be initiated at night.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, with a systolic blood pressure of 120 mmHg. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and IV lasix. Blood pressure should continue to be monitored, and the diuretic regimen may need adjustment if necessary.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels have improved from 1.3 on admission to 0.9. Active diuresis will be continued to monitor renal function.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of alcohol abuse.
- He presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to an underlying pulmonary process and a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid overload.
- The patient has been receiving diuretics, CPAP at night, and medication for his respiratory condition.
- His blood pressure is currently stable, but he still shows signs of mild volume overload.
- The patient's renal function has improved since admission.
- He reports drinking six beers per day, but currently shows no symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.
- The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's severe hypoxia could lead to further respiratory distress and inadequate oxygenation of vital organs.
2. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as heart attack or stroke.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient's mild volume overload suggests a risk of developing pulmonary edema or worsening of his respiratory condition.
4. Renal Insufficiency: Although the patient's creatinine level has improved, there is still a risk of renal dysfunction due to ongoing diuresis and underlying conditions.
5. Alcohol Withdrawal: Despite no current symptoms, the patient's alcohol abuse history puts him at risk for withdrawal symptoms if he stops drinking. Monitoring for withdrawal signs and considering the use of the CIWA scale for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of alcohol abuse. He presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to an underlying pulmonary process and a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid overload. The patient is currently being treated with diuretics, CPAP at night, and medication for blood pressure management. His renal function has improved since admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is at risk of continued episodes of hypoxia due to underlying sleep apnea. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and ABG will be necessary to adjust CPAP settings and ensure adequate oxygenation.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite current treatment. Close monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive medications may be required to achieve target blood pressure levels.

3. Fluid Overload: The patient shows signs of mild volume overload based on physical exam findings. Continuous diuresis should be maintained to manage fluid balance and prevent further complications associated with fluid overload.

4. Renal Insufficiency: Although the patient's creatinine level has improved since admission, close monitoring of renal function is essential during active diuresis. Adjustments to diuretic dosages or additional interventions may be necessary to maintain adequate renal function.

5. ETOH Abuse: The patient reports daily alcohol consumption. Monitoring for signs of alcohol withdrawal and consideration of CIWA scale use if symptoms develop is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of alcohol abuse. He presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to an underlying pulmonary process and a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid overload. The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypoxia, but these have decreased since starting CPAP at night. He continues to be fluid overloaded. Physical exam findings suggest mild volume overload as well. The patient is currently on diuresis, CPAP, and various medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypoxia: The patient's underlying pulmonary process and combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid overload can lead to further episodes of hypoxia. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and ABG analysis is necessary. Diuretic therapy and CPAP treatment should be continued.
2) Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be managed with antihypertensive medication (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, IV lasix diuresis). Regular monitoring of blood pressure is required.
3) Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level was elevated on admission but has decreased since then. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary, considering the patient is being actively diuresed.
4) ETOH abuse: The patient reports drinking alcohol regularly. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal and considering the use of CIWA scale if necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of ETOH abuse. He presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to an underlying pulmonary process and a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid overload. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxia, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and ETOH abuse. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's severe hypoxia could lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not adequately treated. Oxygen supplementation through CPAP at night has been initiated, but close monitoring of the patient's oxygen levels and ABG is necessary to ensure proper oxygenation.
2. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure may increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke or heart attack. Aggressive management of hypertension with medications like hydrochlorothiazide and IV lasix diuresis is recommended.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level was elevated on admission but has improved to normal range. However, close monitoring of renal function is crucial as the patient is being actively diuresed. Any worsening of renal function should be promptly addressed.
4. ETOH abuse: The patient reports drinking 6 beers/day, indicating a history of alcohol abuse. Withdrawal symptoms may occur if alcohol consumption is abruptly stopped. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal and considering CIWA scale if necessary is important.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an obese male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and central sleep apnea. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PPS mode. The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure range of 124-186 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, respiratory rate of 18-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient has diffuse expiratory wheezes on chest examination and significant edema on extremity examination. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and glucose, as well as low levels of sodium, calcium, and magnesium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is challenging to ventilate and oxygenate, especially at night. This indicates the need for further intervention and optimization of the ventilator settings.

2. Hypertension: The patient has malignant hypertension with blood pressure readings ranging from 124-186 mmHg. This condition requires immediate medical attention to prevent complications such as stroke, heart attack, or organ damage.

3. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance with high levels of potassium (K+), glucose (Glu), and creatinine (Cr), along with low levels of sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca++), and magnesium (Mg++). This imbalance needs to be corrected to maintain proper bodily functions.

4. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Central Sleep Apnea: The patient's history of OSA and central sleep apnea may contribute to nocturnal respiratory difficulties. Proper management of these conditions is necessary to improve oxygenation and ventilation during sleep.

5. Obesity: The patient's obesity can complicate respiratory management and increase the risk of pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and other associated comorbidities.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of respiratory failure, hypertension, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, sleep apnea, and obesity-related complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill obese male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and central sleep apnea. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving various treatments and interventions.

From the review of systems, the patient has been experiencing desaturation events, particularly when on 16 PEEP, with oxygen saturation levels in the 70s while being asymptomatic. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 75-93 bpm, blood pressure between 147/86 mmHg and 124/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%.

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse expiratory wheezes, obesity, soft abdomen, and pronounced edema. Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 17.8 g/dL, elevated potassium levels at 19 mg/dL, and normal sodium and chloride levels. Other lab values such as white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, CPAP/PS mode on the ventilator, set tidal volume of 0 mL, spontaneous tidal volume of 253-560 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6036**] is a 53yo morbidly obese male with h/o ETOH abuse who
   presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to an
   underlying pulmonary process and a combination of obstructive and
   central sleep apnea with fluid overload.
   1)Hypoxia: Likely components of both central and obstructive sleep
   apnea.  Has episodes of apnea and  hypoxia overnight.  Continues to be
   fluid overloaded.  Net 1.8 L negative over past 24 hours.
   - CPAP o/n
   - Continue combivent MDI
   - Continue aggressive diuresis will goal at least 2 L net negative
   - F/U ED BCx
   2)Hypertension: secondary to sleep apnea. Will treat daytime
   hypertension, but hypertension while asleep can be corrected by
   treating underlying sleep apnea.
   - Cont. hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, continue IV lasix diuresis
   - Cont. to monitor PM lytes
   3)Renal insufficiency: Cr at 1.3 on admission, now 1.0.
   - Continue to follow
   4)ETOH abuse: Patient reports drinking 6 beers/day. No evidence of
   withdrawal at this time.
   - Consider CIWA scale if develops symptoms of withdrawal.

The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation overnight, requiring assist control mode to maintain ventilation. He tolerated it well but had a brief rest off, resulting in a drop in SaO2. He was placed back on vent for 4 hours and remained stable while on NIV, sleeping. 

The patient received a total of -1.8 liters of IV lasix over the last 24 hours. His oxygenation remained stable overnight, and he did not have any new events. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate 87 bpm (range 75-93 bpm), blood pressure 111/68 mmHg (range 79-186/110 mmHg), respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute (range 15-25 breaths per minute), and SpO2 90%. 

The patient's ABG results show pH 7.45, PCO2 35 mmHg, PO2 65 mmHg, HCO3- 22 mEq/L, and Base excess -2 mEq/L.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6036**] is a 53yo morbidly obese male with h/o ETOH abuse who
   presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to an
   underlying pulmonary process and a combination of obstructive and
   central sleep apnea with fluid overload.
   1)Hypoxia: Likely components of both central and obstructive sleep
   apnea.  Has episodes of apnea and  hypoxia overnight.  Continues to be
   fluid overloaded.  Net 1.8 L negative over past 24 hours.
   - CPAP o/n
   - Continue combivent MDI
   - Continue aggressive diuresis with goal 1-2 L net negative
   - F/U ED BCx
   2)Hypertension: secondary to sleep apnea. Will treat daytime
   hypertension, but hypertension while asleep can be corrected by
   treating underlying sleep apnea.
   -D/c HCTZ and lisinopril given that with diuresis, and
   antihypertensives, SBPs drop to 80s-90s.
   - continue IV lasix diuresis
   - Cont. to monitor PM lytes
   3)Renal insufficiency: Cr at 1.3 on admission, now 1.0.
   - Continue to follow
   4)ETOH abuse: Patient reports drinking 6 beers/day. No evidence of
   withdrawal at this time.
   - Consider CIWA scale if develops symptoms of withdrawal.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of alcohol abuse. He presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to an underlying pulmonary process and a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid overload. The patient has been placed on non-invasive ventilation to maintain oxygenation, which he tolerated well. He required assistance in mode to maintain ventilation and had a brief rest off, resulting in a drop in oxygen saturation. He was back on vent for 4 hours. Oxygenation remained stable overnight while on NIV, and the patient slept. He received a dose of IV lasix twice, resulting in a net negative fluid balance of 1.8 L over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypoxia: The patient continues to experience episodes of apnea and hypoxia, likely due to central and obstructive sleep apnea. He is still fluid overloaded. The plan is to continue with CPAP, Combivent MDI, aggressive diuresis with a goal of 1-2 L net negative, and follow-up with an external balance check.
2) Hypertension: The patient has hypertension secondary to sleep apnea. Treating daytime hypertension may not be necessary as hypertension while asleep can be corrected by treating underlying sleep apnea. The patient is currently on HCTZ and lisinopril, which will be discontinued due to diuresis and antih"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old obese man admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV) multiple times during the stay, including last evening and this morning. Blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 90/65 mmHg to 159/89 mmHg. Oxygen saturation has been maintained at around 92% on a nasal cannula with supplemental oxygen. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,020 mL and output of 2,960 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,940 mL. Respiratory support is provided through continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode with a tidal volume set at 300 mL. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, PaO2 of 65 mmHg, and HCO3- of 22 mEq/L. Lab values indicate an elevated glucose level of 167 mg/dL and slightly low calcium level of 9.0 mg/dL. The patient's WBC count has been within normal range throughout the stay, while platelet count has shown a slight decrease. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial chief complaint and ongoing need for NIPPV indicate a continued struggle with respiratory"

","The patient is a 69-year-old obese man admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He has been on non-invasive ventilation multiple times, including BiPAP and CPAP, with good effect. However, there was a need for actual AC mode for persistent apnea. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 90/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for worsening NIPPV for almost 5-6 hours last evening.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 18.0 g/dL, white blood cell count of 11.0 K/uL, sodium level of 135 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride level of 20 mg/dL, and magnesium level of 1.0 mg/dL. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 45 mEq/L, creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, and glucose level is 167 mg/dL. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, lactic acid, calcium, and phosphate levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals an obese man sitting up in bed, with clear air movement in the chest, soft abdomen, decreased edema,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV) for extended periods throughout the day. The vital signs show a heart rate within normal range, but the blood pressure is low. The respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and the oxygen saturation is at 92%. 

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated blood glucose level and a slightly low calcium level. The complete blood count (CBC) shows within normal limits, and the coagulation profile (PT/INR, PTT) is slightly elevated. 

The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed in various areas such as peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and others. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, hypotension, infection due to prolonged NIPPV use, and possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility. 

Further assessment and management should focus on optimizing oxygenation, maintaining adequate blood pressure, monitoring for signs of infection, and implementing appropriate prophylactic measures to prevent complications like DVT."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6036**] is a 53yo morbidly obese male with h/o ETOH abuse who
   presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to an
   underlying pulmonary process and a combination of obstructive and
   central sleep apnea with fluid overload.
   1)Hypoxia: Likely components of both central and obstructive sleep
   apnea with underlying pulmonary process.  Has episodes of apnea and
   hypoxia overnight.  Continues to be fluid overloaded.  Creatinine bump
   to 1.5 with diuresis.
   - CPAP o/n
   - Continue combivent MDI
   - Continue aggressive diuresis with goal 1-2 L net negative
   - F/U ED BCx
   2)Hypertension: secondary to sleep apnea. Will treat daytime
   hypertension, but hypertension while asleep can be corrected by
   treating underlying sleep apnea.
   -D/c HCTZ and lisinopril given that with diuresis, and
   antihypertensives, SBPs drop to 80s-90s.
   - continue IV lasix diuresis
   - Cont. to monitor PM lytes
   3)Renal insufficiency: Cr at 1.3 on admission, now 1.0.
   - Continue to follow
   4)ETOH abuse: Patient reports drinking 6 beers/day. No evidence of
   withdrawal at this time.
   - Consider CIWA scale if develops symptoms of withdrawal.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of alcohol abuse. He presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to an underlying pulmonary process and a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid overload. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90-150 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. He is alert and oriented, with clear lungs and no evidence of jugular venous distention or leg edema. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels at 1.5 mg/dL and potassium levels at 5.4 mEq/L. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxia, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and alcohol abuse. He is currently receiving CPAP, Combivent MDI, aggressive diuresis, and IV lasix. His blood pressure is being managed by discontinuing HCTZ and lisinopril, and close monitoring of his electrolytes is ongoing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's underlying pulmonary process could progress to pneumonia, especially considering his hypoxia and fluid overload.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction. Continued fluid overload and use of nephrotoxic medications could worsen"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6036**] is a 53yo morbidly obese male with h/o ETOH abuse who
   presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to an
   underlying pulmonary process and a combination of obstructive and
   central sleep apnea with fluid overload.
   1)Hypoxia: Likely components of both central and obstructive sleep
   apnea with underlying pulmonary process.  Has episodes of apnea and
   hypoxia overnight.  Continues to be fluid overloaded.  LOS negative
   12.6 L.  Creatinine bump to 1.5 with diuresis.  Only negative 300cc
   overnight.
   - CPAP o/n
   - Continue combivent MDI
   - UA/Urine Lytes
   - Hold lasix
   - F/U Sleep Consult
   2)Hypertension: secondary to sleep apnea. Will treat daytime
   hypertension, but hypertension while asleep can be corrected by
   treating underlying sleep apnea.
   -Cont. to hold HCTZ and lisinopril given that with diuresis, and
   antihypertensives, SBPs drop to 80s-90s, currently in the 150
s but
   ranging to 90
s overnight.
   3)Renal insufficiency: Cr at 1.3 on admission, now up to 1.5 with
   diuresis.
   - Hold all diuresis and ACE-I, avoid any other nephrotoxic agents
   4)ETOH abuse: Patient reports drinking 6 beers/day. No evidence of
   withdrawal at this time.
   - Consider CIWA scale if develops symptoms of withdrawal.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity and ETOH abuse. He presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to an underlying pulmonary process and a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid overload. The patient has episodes of apnea and hypoxia overnight and continues to be fluid overloaded. His creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 1.5 with diuresis. The patient's blood pressure is in the 150s but ranging to 90s overnight. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's episodes of apnea and hypoxia overnight indicate a potential risk for further respiratory distress and compromised oxygenation.
2. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure readings, especially during sleep, suggest uncontrolled hypertension, which may lead to cardiovascular complications.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate a decline in renal function, which could progress to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's ongoing fluid overload puts him at risk for pulmonary edema, heart failure, and other complications related to excess fluid accumulation.
5. ETOH abuse: The patient's reported alcohol consumption raises concerns about withdrawal symptoms and potential complications associated with chronic alcohol use.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's vital signs show hypertension with a blood pressure ranging from 90/55 mmHg to 150/73 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is low at 92% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rate is within normal range, and respiration rate is also normal.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated creatinine level of 1.4, potassium level of 5.4, and low calcium level of 8.9 mg/dL. The white blood cell count is slightly elevated, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are within normal range, and platelet count is also normal. Glucose levels have been fluctuating but mostly within normal range.

The patient has received various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, furosemide (Lasix) for fluid management, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's lab results show abnormal levels of creatinine, potassium, and calcium, indicating an electrolyte imbalance. This can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently high, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. If left untreated, this can result in end-organ damage and increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, or kidney disease.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6036**] is a 53yo morbidly obese male with h/o ETOH abuse who
   presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to an
   underlying pulmonary process and a combination of obstructive and
   central sleep apnea with fluid overload.
   1)Hypoxia: Likely components of both central and obstructive sleep
   apnea with underlying pulmonary process.  Has episodes of apnea and
   hypoxia overnight.  Continues to be fluid overloaded.  LOS negative
   12.6 L.  Creatinine bump to 1.5 with diuresis.  Only negative 300cc
   overnight.
   - CPAP o/n
   - Continue combivent MDI
   - Continue aggressive diuresis with goal 1-2 L net negative
   - F/U ED BCx
   2)Hypertension: secondary to sleep apnea. Will treat daytime
   hypertension, but hypertension while asleep can be corrected by
   treating underlying sleep apnea.
   -Cont. to hold HCTZ and lisinopril given that with diuresis, and
   antihypertensives, SBPs drop to 80s-90s, currently in the 150
s but
   ranging to 90
s overnight.
   3)Renal insufficiency: Cr at 1.3 on admission, now up to 1.5 with
   diuresis.
   - Hold all diuresis and ACE-I, avoid any other nephrotoxic agents
   4)ETOH abuse: Patient reports drinking 6 beers/day. No evidence of
   withdrawal at this time.
   - Consider CIWA scale if develops symptoms of withdrawal.

","The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of alcohol abuse who presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to an underlying pulmonary process and a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid overload.

1) Hypoxia: The patient likely has both central and obstructive sleep apnea along with an underlying pulmonary process. He experiences episodes of apnea and hypoxia overnight. The patient continues to be fluid overloaded, with a negative fluid balance of 12.6 liters. His creatinine level has increased to 1.5 due to diuresis, and he only had a negative fluid balance of 300cc overnight.
   - The patient should be placed on CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) therapy.
   - He should continue using the Combivent MDI (metered-dose inhaler).
   - Aggressive diuresis should be continued with the goal of achieving a net negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters.
   - The patient should be followed up with an elective bed-side chest X-ray.

2) Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is secondary to sleep apnea. Treating the underlying sleep apnea can correct hypertension while asleep. However, daytime hypertension should also be treated.
   - The use of HCTZ (hydrochlorothiazide) and lisinopril should be held because these medications, along with diuretics, cause the patient's blood pressure to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity and ETOH abuse. He presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to an underlying pulmonary process and a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea with fluid overload. The patient has been experiencing episodes of apnea and hypoxia overnight. He is currently on bipap support and continues to be fluid overloaded. The patient's blood pressure is labile and he has a history of renal insufficiency, which has now resolved. He is also a reported ETOH abuser but shows no evidence of withdrawal at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's severe hypoxia may lead to further respiratory distress and inadequate oxygenation of vital organs.
2. Hypertension: The patient's labile blood pressure may indicate uncontrolled hypertension, which could increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
3. Renal insufficiency: Although the patient's renal function has improved, there is still a possibility of recurrence if not properly managed.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's ongoing fluid overload can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.
5. ETOH withdrawal: Although the patient does not show signs of withdrawal at the moment, monitoring should continue as the patient reports drinking 6 beers/day.
6. Infection: The patient's underlying pulmonary process increases the risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-inch tall individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of 24-hour events. The patient has a urinary output of 900cc in the afternoon, with a net negative balance of 1.2L by 9pm. No lasix has been given today. The patient is scheduled for a sleep study at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] this Wednesday night. The urine electrolytes suggest an indeterminate etiology between prerenal and intrinsic renal disease, with a FeNa of 1.27% and FeUrea of 42%. The patient was given 40meq KCl for hypochloremia. The patient has no known drug allergies and has received infusions and other ICU medications. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flowsheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, physical examination, and labs/radiology. The patient's blood pressure has been ranging from 154/74 to 183/100 mmHg, with a heart rate between 77 and 94 bpm. The patient's oxygen saturation is at 91% and the respiratory support includes a bipap mask. The physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, and neurologic assessment. The labs/radiology results show various values for potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, glucose, and other parameters. The assessment and plan indicate several problems including electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypertension, and respiratory failure. The ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute respiratory failure due to the low oxygen saturation levels and the need for respiratory support.
2. Hypertensive crisis or emergency due to the consistently high blood pressure readings.
3. Renal dysfunction or failure indicated by the urine output and the abnormal renal function tests.
4. Electrolyte imbalance indicated by the abnormal values of potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate.
5. Infection or sepsis due to the presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count.
6. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and risk factors.
7. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of prophylaxis.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.

Please note that these are potential complications based on the provided information and further evaluation would be required for confirmation."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6036**] is a 53yo morbidly obese male with h/o ETOH abuse who
   presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension, likely due to an
   underlying pulmonary process and a combination of obstructive and
   central sleep apnea with fluid overload.
   1)Hypoxia: Likely components of both central and obstructive sleep
   apnea with underlying pulmonary process.  Has episodes of apnea and
   hypoxia overnight.  Continues to be fluid overloaded.  LOS negative
   12.6 L.  Now autodiuresing 1.7 L negative, 1.5 since midnight.
   Scheduled for sleep study on Wednesday at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**].
   - CPAP o/n
   - Continue combivent MDI
   - Hold lasix
   - F/U Sleep Consult
   2)Hypertension: secondary to sleep apnea. Will treat daytime
   hypertension, but hypertension while asleep can be corrected by
   treating underlying sleep apnea.
   -Cont. to hold HCTZ and lisinopril given that with diuresis, and
   antihypertensives, SBPs drop to 80s-90s, currently in the 150
s but
   ranging to 90
s overnight.
   3)Renal insufficiency: Cr peaked at 1.5 with diuresis, FeUrea 42%. Now
   resolved, Cr 1.0.
   - Hold all diuresis and ACE-I, avoid any other nephrotoxic agents
   4)ETOH abuse: Patient reports drinking 6 beers/day. No evidence of
   withdrawal at this time.
   - Consider CIWA scale if develops symptoms of withdrawal.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of alcohol abuse who presents with severe hypoxia and hypertension. He has episodes of apnea and hypoxia overnight, and is experiencing fluid overload. The patient's current medications include CPAP, combivent MDI, and holds lasix. He is scheduled for a sleep study on Wednesday. The patient's blood pressure ranges from the 150s to the 90s overnight. His renal function has improved, with creatinine levels returning to normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's severe hypoxia is likely due to central and obstructive sleep apnea with an underlying pulmonary process. It is crucial to continue using CPAP and treat the underlying sleep apnea to correct the hypoxia, especially during sleep.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is secondary to sleep apnea. Treating the underlying sleep apnea can help correct the hypertension. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure, especially during diuretic therapy.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient initially had elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal insufficiency. However, his renal function has since improved. It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's renal function and avoid any nephrotoxic agents.
4. Alcohol abuse: The patient reports drinking 6 beers per day. Although there are currently no symptoms of withdrawal, it is important"
