   This is an 84M with multiple medical problems including severe systolic
   heart failure and afib on coumadin who presents from his NH with
   evidence of acute GI bleeding in the setting of slightly
   supratherapeutic INR.
   # GI bleed - Hct this am 28.1 down from 30.6 (21 on admission).  Goal
   hct >30 given hemodynamic instability. Source likely lower given
   negative NG lavage in ED. INR reversed at 1.7 this morning.
   -- GI aware, for EGD this morning
   -- no FFP, goal of <1.7
   -- continue PPI gtt
   -- serial Hcts q6h, transfuse to goal HCT of 30
   -- NPO, maintain active T+C
   -- access with CVL and 1 PIV currently
   # Shock -  Maintaining MAP's >60 on levophed.   Pt had SBPs dipping
   into the 70s in ER, started on norepinephrine in that setting. Likely
   hypovolemic shock, but other etiologies include cardiogenic and
   distributive/septic
   -- blood as above
   -- continue norepinephrine for now, goal to wean as volume reexpansion
   occurs
   -- hold on antibiotics as no evidence of infection/sepsis
   -- no evidence for cardiogenic etiology on clinical exam or CXR
   # Respiratory Failure - Inubtated, sating well on current settings. Was
   noted to have hypoxemia prior to transfer from NH, and confirmed on ED
   triage. In ED was intubated for airway protection in the setting of
   vomiting. However, concern for worsening of CHF s/p extensive blood
   product transfusions.  He is 8L positive since admission and will
   likely need diuresis prior to extubation.
   - will try on pressure support this afternoon to determine if ready for
   diuresis
 if pressures increase and tidal volumes decrease, this
   indicates need for diuresis
 would also tx with nitro gtt prior to
   extubation to decrease preload as extubation increases preload at
   baseline

   -- after hemodynamically stable, will begin to diurese to goal dry

   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - Likely prerenal from hypovolemia in
   the setting of ongoing diuresis with GIB. Cr unchanged at 3.5 from
   admission.  FeNa 0.3% indicated pre renal etiology, no eos

   -- holding rate control agents (carvedilol) given GIB as well as ARF
   -- monitor on tele
   -- CHADS2 = 6, merits anticoagulation based on this but will have to

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation, presenting from a nursing home with evidence of acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the setting of slightly supratherapeutic INR. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic systolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is experiencing lower gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by hematochezia, bradybasin, and a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 30.6 to 28.1. The source of the bleeding is likely the lower gastrointestinal tract, given the negative nasogastric lavage in the emergency department. INR has been reversed to 1.7, and the patient will undergo an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to identify the source of bleeding. The plan includes maintaining a high hematocrit level above 30, continuing pantoprazole (protonix) infusion, serial hemoglobin checks every six hours, transfusion to achieve a hematocrit goal of 30, NPO (nothing by mouth), and maintaining active temperature control.
2. Shock: The patient is in hypovolemic shock, with systolic blood pressures dipping into the 70s in the emergency department. Norepinephrine has been started to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 60. Blood"

   Critical Care time 60 minutes for respiratory failure, ventilator
   management and heart failure management as well as ongoing managment of
   GI bleeding.

   on:[**2110-5-5**] 10:28 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with multiple medical problems including severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation. He presents with evidence of acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, likely lower GI bleed given the negative nasogastric (NG) lavage in the emergency department (ED). The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has decreased from 30.6 on admission to 28.1 this morning, indicating ongoing blood loss. The goal Hct is above 30 due to hemodynamic instability. 

The patient's INR is supratherapeutic at 18.4, which increases the risk of bleeding. Coumadin, a blood thinner, is likely contributing to this elevated INR. The INR has been reversed to 1.7 this morning to reduce the risk of further bleeding. 

The patient is experiencing hypovolemic shock, as evidenced by the need to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 60 on levophed. The patient had systolic blood pressures dipping into the 70s in the ED and was started on norepinephrine in that setting. Other potential causes of shock include cardiogenic and distributive/septic.

The patient is intubated for airway protection due to vomiting and confirmed hypoxemia prior to transfer from the nursing home (NH). There is concern for worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) following extensive blood product transfusions. The patient"

   This is an 84M with multiple medical problems including severe systolic
   heart failure and afib on coumadin who presents from his NH with
   evidence of acute GI bleeding in the setting of slightly
   supratherapeutic INR.
   # GI bleed - Hct this am 28.1 down from 30.6 (21 on admission).  Goal
   hct >30 given hemodynamic instability. Source likely lower given
   negative NG lavage in ED. INR reversed at 1.7 this morning.
   -- GI aware, for EGD this morning
   -- no FFP, goal oif <1.7
   -- continue PPI gtt
   -- serial Hcts q6h, transfuse to goal HCT of 30
   -- NPO, maintain active T+C
   -- access with CVL and 1 PIV currently
   # Shock -  Maintaining MAP's >60 on levophed.   Pt had SBPs dipping
   into the 70s in ER, started on norepinephrine in that setting. Likely
   hypovolemic shock, but other etiologies include cardiogenic and
   distributive/septic
   -- blood as above
   -- continue norepinephrine for now, goal to wean as volume reexpansion
   occurs
   -- hold on antibiotics as no evidence of infection/sepsis
   -- no evidence for cardiogenic etiology on clinical exam or CXR
   # Respiratory Failure - Inubtated, sating well on current settings. Was
   noted to have hypoxemia prior to transfer from NH, and confirmed on ED
   triage. In ED was intubated for airway protection in the setting of
   vomitting. However, concern for worsening of CHF s/p extensive blood
   product transfusions.
   -- gas 7.41/34/184/22
   -- will try to wean to PSV after EGD
   # Chronic Systolic CHF - Recent echo [**3-20**] with global process affecting
   LV and RV. Underlying etiology of cardiomyopathy is unclear. Had normal
   coronaries on cath in [**2103**].
   -- continue holding diuresis, BB, and [**Last Name (un) 239**] in setting of hypovolemia
   -- after hemodynamically stable, will begin to diurese to goal dry
   weight (165)
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - Likely prerenal from hypovolemia in
   the setting of ongoing diuresis with GIB. Cr unchanged at 3.5 from
   admission.  FeNa 0.3% indicated pre renal etiology, no eos
   -- volume re-expansion with blood products [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 9149**]
   -- trend Cr
   -- renally dose meds
   -- hold calcitriol and cochicine until renal fxn normalizes
   # Afib - reversed anticoagulation in ER with factor IX, vit K, and FFP.
   Currently in slow fib.
   -- holding rate control agents (carvedilol) given GIB as well as ARF
   -- monitor on tele
   -- CHADS2 = 6, merits anticoagulation based on this but will have to
   re-assess given current presentation
   # ? Head bleed - felt unlikely per NSurg
   -- will formally see in this morning, hold sedation prior to this
   -- INR reversed at 1.7 this morning
   -- serial neuro exams, no focal deficits currently but exam limited by
   sedation and intubation

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is an 84-year-old male with multiple medical problems including severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation. He presents with evidence of acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the setting of slightly supratherapeutic INR. The source of the bleeding is likely lower gastrointestinal given the negative nasogastric lavage in the emergency department. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased from 30.6 g/dL on admission to 28.1 g/dL this morning, indicating ongoing blood loss. The goal hemoglobin concentration should be maintained above 30 due to hemodynamic instability. The INR has been reversed at 1.7 this morning, and the patient is scheduled for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to identify the source of bleeding.

The patient is also in shock, likely hypovolemic in nature, as indicated by the need to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 60 on levophed. The patient had systolic blood pressures dipping into the 70s in the emergency department, prompting the initiation of norepinephrine. Other potential etiologies of shock include cardiogenic and distributive/septic, but these are less likely based on the clinical examination and chest X-ray. Blood products have been transfused, and the goal is to wean off norepinephrine as volume reexpansion occurs. Antibiotics have been withheld since there is no evidence of infection/sepsis"

   Assessment and Plan
   84M with severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation on
   coumadin transferred from OSH with acute GI bleeding in the setting of
   supratherapeutic INR
   #. Respiratory failure:  Intubated in ED given hypoxic respiratory
   failure and for airway protection due to vomiting. Hypoxic respiratory
   failure may be related to decompensated heart failure given large
   volume fluid resuscitation. CT chest on admission also comments on
   likely aspiration pneumonia. Over past 24 hours was weaned to pressure
   support, [**4-15**] FiO2 40%. Limiting factors for extubation were (1) apnea
   and (2) poor diuresis raising concern for worsened pulmonary edema once
   PEEP is removed.
        Reason for apnea is not clear. Differential includes medications
   (fentanyl, midazolam), Cheynne-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations due to severe
   systolic heart failure, and CNS process given concern for recent
   intracranial hemorrhage.
        Patient was given Lasix 40mg IV overnight with minimal diuresis.
   -          Management of ?intracranial hemorrhage as below
   -          Wean sedation medications to see if apnea improves
   -          Diuresis with Lasix 100mg IV x1
   -          Only marker of infection is left-shift; given lack of
   secretions and fever, will hold off on treating for pneumonia at this
   time
   #. Shock:  Initially attributed to hypovolemic shocks given large
   hematocrit drop from baseline and melanotic stools at outside hospital.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also be a component of cardiogenic shock given that patient was off
   of diuretics and has known poor systolic function. In addition, CT
   chest/abd/pelvis from admission comments on likely aspiration pneumonia
   and right-sided colitis, raising concern for sepsis
 this is less
   likely given lack of fever, leukocytosis, and infectious symptoms.
        Over past 24 hours patient was weaned off of pressors.
   -          Continue to hold on antibiotics as patient does not appear
   to have active infection (keeping in mind that he may not be able to
   mount fever or leukocytosis)
   -          Maintain MAP>55; successful for 12+ hours off of pressors
   #. GI bleed:  Hematocrit stable. Upper endoscopy with evidence of
   gastritis but no evidence of active bleeding. Patient recently had
   colonoscopy that showed a polyp but was otherwise normal (ie no
   hemorrhoids, diverticulosis).
   -          Per GI, if patient has active bleeding, consider capsule
   study
   -          Continue PPI IV daily
   -          Check hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]; maintain active T+C
   -          Maintain 2 PIVs in case of large volume resuscitation
   #. ?Head bleed:  Initially felt by neurosurgery to be non-acute.
   -          Contact neurosurgery regarding apnea, restarting
   anticoagulation (for atrial fibrillation), and need for reimaging to
   assess for change
   #. Systolic heart failure:  Recent echo [**3-20**] with global process
   affecting LV and RV. Underlying etiology of cardiomyopathy is unclear.
   Had normal coronaries on cath in [**2103**].
   -          Diuresis as above
   -          Restart beta-blocker at low dose
   -          Continue holding [**Last Name (un) 239**] given renal failure
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Likely prerenal from hypovolemia.
   FeNa 0.3% on admission indicated pre renal etiology, no eos
   - Renally dose medications
   - Hold calcitriol and cochicine until renal fxn normalizes
   - Expect improvement with improve perfusion of kidneys
   #. Afib - reversed anticoagulation in ER with factor IX, vit K, and
   FFP. Currently in slow fib.
   - Restart beta-blocker, as above
   - Monitor on telemetry

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred from another hospital with acute gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR. The patient has been intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and for airway protection due to vomiting. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's recent CT chest/abd/pelvis shows likely aspiration pneumonia and right-sided colitis, raising concern for sepsis. His hematocrit levels have stabilized, and an upper endoscopy showed evidence of gastritis but no active bleeding. The patient's recent colonoscopy was normal except for polyps in the ascending colon. The neuro exam is nonfocal, and there is no acute bleed according to neurosurgery. The patient's renal function is likely prerenal from hypovolemia, and his blood cultures are pending. The patient's code status is DNR, confirmed with his healthcare proxy. The patient's family has been contacted and informed about the situation. The patient will stay in the ICU today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support, indicating respiratory failure. Limiting factors for extubation include apnea, poor diuresis, and concern for worsened pulmonary edema once PEEP is removed.
2. Shock:"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has multiple medical complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, hypovolemic shock, chronic heart failure, chronic renal failure, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has signs of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to anemia and hypotension.
2. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated heart rate suggest hypovolemic shock, which can be caused by gastrointestinal bleeding or other fluid losses.
3. Chronic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, which can lead to fluid retention and shortness of breath.
4. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate chronic renal failure, which can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm that can increase the risk of blood clots and stroke.
6. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe consolidation on CT scan, suggesting aspiration pneumonia, which can occur due to impaired swallowing or decreased consciousness.
7. Colitis: The patient's CT scan shows bowel wall thickening, indicating colitis, which can be caused by infections, inflammation, or ischemia.

The patient recently had a colonoscopy that showed polyps in the ascending colon. The EGD was negative for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient's PPI was changed from continuous to once daily due to no evidence of UGIB.

The CT head shows an evolution of the right parietal infarct with development of cortical serpiginous hemorrhage (laminar necrosis) and near-complete opacification of the nasopharynx. The CT chest/abd/pelvis reveals bowel wall thickening along the right hemi-colon, which is compatible with colitis. There is also an increase in moderate right and small left pleural effusion with right lower lobe consolidation, likely due to aspiration. Anasarca is noted as well.

The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been decreasing over time, indicating ongoing blood loss or poor renal function. The patient's electrolytes are relatively stable, but there have been attempts to manage fluid balance and urine output.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but they show signs of respiratory distress with an increased respiratory rate and decreased respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation"

   Assessment and Plan
   84M with severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation on
   coumadin transferred from OSH with acute GI bleeding in the setting of
   supratherapeutic INR
   #. Respiratory failure:  Intubated in ED given hypoxic respiratory
   failure and for airway protection due to vomiting. Hypoxic respiratory
   failure may be related to decompensated heart failure given large
   volume fluid resuscitation. CT chest on admission also comments on
   likely aspiration pneumonia. Over past 24 hours was weaned to pressure
   support, [**4-15**] FiO2 40%. Limiting factors for extubation were (1) apnea
   and (2) poor diuresis raising concern for worsened pulmonary edema once
   PEEP is removed.
        Reason for apnea is not clear. Differential includes medications
   (fentanyl, midazolam), Cheynne-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations due to severe
   systolic heart failure, and CNS process given concern for recent
   intracranial hemorrhage.
        Patient was given Lasix 40mg IV overnight with minimal diuresis.
   -          Management of ?intracranial hemorrhage as below
   -          Wean sedation medications to see if apnea improves
   -          Diuresis with Lasix 100mg IV x1
   -          Only marker of infection is left-shift; given lack of
   secretions and fever, will hold off on treating for pneumonia at this
   time
   #. Shock:  Initially attributed to hypovolemic shocks given large
   hematocrit drop from baseline and melanotic stools at outside hospital.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also be a component of cardiogenic shock given that patient was off
   of diuretics and has known poor systolic function. In addition, CT
   chest/abd/pelvis from admission comments on likely aspiration pneumonia
   and right-sided colitis, raising concern for sepsis
 this is less
   likely given lack of fever, leukocytosis, and infectious symptoms.
        Over past 24 hours patient was weaned off of pressors.
   -          Continue to hold on antibiotics as patient does not appear
   to have active infection (keeping in mind that he may not be able to
   mount fever or leukocytosis)
   -          Maintain MAP>55; successful for 12+ hours off of pressors
   #. GI bleed:  Hematocrit stable. Upper endoscopy with evidence of
   gastritis but no evidence of active bleeding. Patient recently had
   colonoscopy that showed a polyp but was otherwise normal (ie no
   hemorrhoids, diverticulosis).
   -          Per GI, if patient has active bleeding, consider capsule
   study
   -          Continue PPI IV daily
   -          Check hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]; maintain active T+C
   -          Maintain 2 PIVs in case of large volume resuscitation

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who was admitted with acute gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR. He was intubated in the emergency department due to hypoxic respiratory failure and for airway protection due to vomiting. The patient has been weaned to pressure support, with FiO2 40%. Limiting factors for extubation were apnea and poor diuresis, raising concerns for worsened pulmonary edema once PEEP is removed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be related to decompensated heart failure given large volume fluid resuscitation. There is also a concern for likely aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by the CT chest on admission.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 5702**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Continues with tenuous hemodynamics on and off pressors.  Respiratory
   failure with abnormal breathing pattern.  Will continue to investigate
   central process for this and determine if anticoagulation is safe at
   this point.  Volume status is difficult to manage give renal failure.
   No plan for extubation yet.  Critical care time 60 minutes for
   respiratory failure and tenuous hemodynamics.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The patient was transferred from another hospital with acute GI bleeding in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR. The patient has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and for airway protection. The cause of respiratory failure may be related to decompensated heart failure given large volume fluid resuscitation. There is also a concern for aspiration pneumonia, as mentioned in the CT chest findings.

2. Shock: Initially attributed to hypovolemic shock due to large hematocrit drop from baseline and melanotic stools. However, there is also a possibility of cardiogenic shock given the patient's known poor systolic function. The patient has been weaned off of pressors.

3. GI bleed: Hematocrit is stable, and an upper endoscopy showed evidence of gastritis but no active bleeding. A recent colonoscopy showed a polyp but was otherwise normal.

4. Head bleed: Neurosurgery initially felt that the bleed was non-acute, but there is a need for reimaging to assess for any changes.

5. Systolic heart failure: Recent echo shows global process affecting LV and RV. The underlying etiology of cardiomyopathy is unclear. The patient had normal coronaries on cath in [**210"

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with severe systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, acute gastrointestinal bleeding, hypoxic respiratory failure, and chronic renal failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to his critical condition.

Summary of Progress Notes:
- The patient has been intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and airway protection due to vomiting.
- He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 6, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 18.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 93/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 4 insp/min, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's physical examination reveals good air movement with right basilar crackles, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, prominent S2, early systolic murmur, soft non-distended abdomen, and 1+ pitting edema at ankles.
- Laboratory results show a WBC count of 9.6 K/uL, Hct of 28.1%, Plt of 179 K/uL, Cr of 3.5 mg/dL, TCO2 of 25 mmol/L, Glucose of 118 mg/dL, and other lab results within normal ranges.
- The patient's blood culture is negative.
- The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, lasix, diuril, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. Limiting factors for extubation are apnea and fluid overload, which raise concern for worsened pulmonary edema once PEEP is removed.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has evidence of gastritis without active bleeding. Upper endoscopy showed no evidence of active bleeding, but there was a polyp present. Colonoscopy showed no abnormalities.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal failure, likely prerenal from hypovolemia. FeNa 0.3% on admission indicated pre-renal etiology.
4. Shock: The patient initially had hypovolemic shock due to large hematocrit drop from baseline and melanotic stools at the outside hospital. Cardiogenic shock is also a concern given the patient's known poor systolic function.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is currently in slow fib. Anticoagulation has been held for 2 weeks.

   84M with severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation on
   coumadin transferred from OSH with acute GI bleeding in the setting of
   supratherapeutic INR, still somewhat wet and with worsening renal
   failure.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Intubated in ED given hypoxic respiratory
   failure and for airway protection due to vomiting. Hypoxic respiratory
   failure may be related to decompensated heart failure given large
   volume fluid resuscitation. CT chest on admission also comments on
   likely aspiration pneumonia. Over past 24 hours was weaned to pressure
   support, [**4-15**] FiO2 40%. Limiting factors for extubation were (1) apnea
   and (2) poor diuresis raising concern for worsened pulmonary edema once
   PEEP is removed.
        Reason for apnea is not clear. Differential includes medications
   (fentanyl, midazolam), Cheynne-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations due to severe
   systolic heart failure, and CNS process given concern for recent
   intracranial hemorrhage.
        Patient was given Lasix 40mg IV overnight with minimal diuresis.
   -          Management of ?intracranial hemorrhage as below
   -          Wean sedation medications to see if apnea improves
   -          Diuresis with Lasix drip and Diuril
   -          Only marker of infection is left-shift; given lack of
   secretions and fever, will hold off on treating for pneumonia at this
   time
   #. Shock:  Initially attributed to hypovolemic shocks given large
   hematocrit drop from baseline and melanotic stools at outside hospital.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also be a component of cardiogenic shock given that patient was off
   of diuretics and has known poor systolic function. In addition, CT
   chest/abd/pelvis from admission comments on likely aspiration pneumonia
   and right-sided colitis, raising concern for sepsis
 this is less
   likely given lack of fever, leukocytosis, and infectious symptoms.
        Over past 24 hours patient was weaned off of pressors.
   -          Continue to hold on antibiotics as patient does not appear
   to have active infection (keeping in mind that he may not be able to
   mount fever or leukocytosis)
   -          Maintain MAP>55; successful for 12+ hours off of pressors
   #. GI bleed:  Hematocrit stable. Upper endoscopy with evidence of
   gastritis but no evidence of active bleeding. Patient recently had
   colonoscopy that showed a polyp but was otherwise normal (ie no
   hemorrhoids, diverticulosis).
   -          Per GI, if patient has active bleeding, consider capsule
   study
   -          Continue PPI IV daily
   -          Change to QD HCT checks; maintain active T+C
   -          Maintain 2 PIVs in case of large volume resuscitation
   #. ?Head bleed:  Initially felt by neurosurgery to be non-acute.
   -          Contact neurosurgery regarding apnea, restarting
   anticoagulation (for atrial fibrillation), and need for reimaging to
   assess for change
   #. Systolic heart failure:  Recent echo [**3-20**] with global process
   affecting LV and RV. Underlying etiology of cardiomyopathy is unclear.
   Had normal coronaries on cath in [**2103**].
   -          Diuresis as above goal negative 500 to 1 L; re-check PM
   creatinine
   -          Restart beta-blocker at low dose
   -          Continue holding [**Last Name (un) 239**] given renal failure
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Likely prerenal from hypovolemia.
   FeNa 0.3% on admission indicated pre renal etiology, no eos
   - Renally dose medications
   - Hold calcitriol and cochicine until renal fxn normalizes
   - Expect improvement with improve perfusion of kidneys
   - Check PM creatinine
   - Renal consult
   #. Afib - reversed anticoagulation in ER with factor IX, vit K, and

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with severe systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and acute gastrointestinal bleeding. He was intubated in the emergency department due to hypoxic respiratory failure and for airway protection. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic systolic heart failure, and recent intracranial hemorrhage. He is currently being managed for possible shock, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, atrial fibrillation, and acute on chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory failure due to decompensated heart failure, aspiration pneumonia, and the need for airway protection.
2. Shock: The patient initially had hypovolemic shock due to large hematocrit drop and melena, but there is also a possibility of cardiogenic shock given the patient's known poor systolic function.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleed: Although the patient's hematocrit is stable, and no active bleeding was found during the upper endoscopy, there is still a risk of further gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation and requires anticoagulation, which carries the risk of intracranial hemorrhage if restarted.
5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is likely pre-renal due to hypovolemia, but there is a risk of worsening renal failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with severe systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, acute gastrointestinal bleeding, and chronic renal failure. He was intubated in the emergency department for hypoxic respiratory failure and airway protection due to vomiting. The patient has been weaned off of pressors and his respiratory support has been reduced to CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and a spontaneous tidal volume of 1335 mL. His PEEP is set at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) at 18.

The patient's physical examination reveals good air movement with right basilar crackles, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, and cool feet with palpable pulses. He has a JVP of approximately 8 cm, early systolic murmur along the left lower sternal border, nonradiating, and 1+ pitting edema at the ankles. The patient's mental status is altered, but not delirious.

Labs show a white blood cell count of 9.6-11.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 28.1-29.3%, platelet count of 179-200 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 25-26 mg/dL, creatinine of 3.5-4.1 mg/dL, glucose of 118-150 mg/dL, and potassium of 4.1-4.5 mEq/L. The patient's electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range. His PT/PTT/INR levels are elevated, likely due to the use of Coumadin for atrial fibrillation.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Altered mental status (not delirium)
2. Gastrointestinal bleed, lower (hematochezia, BRBPR, GI bleed, GIB)
3. Shock, hypovolemic or hemorrhagic
4. Heart failure (CHF), systolic, chronic
5. Renal failure, chronic (chronic renal failure, CRF, chronic kidney disease)
6. Atrial fibrillation (AFib)

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to his underlying severe systolic heart failure and the risk of worsening pulmonary edema after extubation.
2. GI bleed: Although the patient's hematocrit is stable, there is still a risk of re-bleeding, especially if the polyp found during colonoscopy is the source.
3. Shock: The patient may experience hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock if there is ongoing bleeding or fluid loss.
4. Heart failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may worsen if his diuresis is inadequate or if he develops further complications.
5. Renal failure: The patient's"

   supratherapeutic INR, still somewhat wet and with worsening renal
   failure.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Intubated in ED given hypoxic respiratory
   failure and for airway protection due to vomiting. Hypoxic respiratory
   failure may be related to decompensated heart failure given large
   volume fluid resuscitation. CT chest on admission also comments on
   likely aspiration pneumonia. Limiting factors for extubation are (1)
   apnea and (2) fluid overload raising concern for worsened pulmonary
   edema once PEEP is removed.
        Reason for apnea is not clear. Differential includes medications
   (fentanyl, midazolam), Cheynne-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations due to severe
   systolic heart failure, and CNS process given concern for recent
   intracranial hemorrhage. Neurosurgery did not feel that apnea was
   related to ICH.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred from another hospital with acute gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic systolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and for airway protection due to vomiting. The patient has been diuresed overnight with Lasix and Diuril. Neurology and renal consults have been requested. The patient's current medical conditions include altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleed, hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock, chronic renal failure, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. Limiting factors for extubation include apnea and fluid overload, which raise concerns for worsened pulmonary edema once PEEP is removed.
2. Apnea: The reason for the patient's apnea is not clear. Differential includes medications (fentanyl, midazolam), Cheyne-Stokes respirations due to severe systolic heart failure, and a CNS process given concern for recent intracranial hemorrhage.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient likely has pre-renal acute kidney injury from hypovolemia. Renal dosing of medications is required, and the patient should be"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with severe systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic renal failure. He was transferred from another hospital with hypovolemic shock likely secondary to acute GI bleed in the setting of supratherapeutic INR. The patient is currently intubated in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and airway protection due to vomiting. He has several medical complications including respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, shock, GI bleed, and possible head bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and may face challenges with extubation due to apnea and fluid overload. Close monitoring and careful assessment will be required before considering extubation.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function has improved, but ongoing management is needed to monitor kidney injury and adjust medications accordingly.
3. Shock: Although the patient is now hemodynamically stable and off of pressors for several days, there is a history of hypovolemic and possibly cardiogenic shock. Monitoring for any signs of recurrence is essential.
4. GI bleed: The patient has had a gastrointestinal bleed, and although hematocrit levels are stable, ongoing monitoring is necessary. Further interventions such as capsule study may be considered if active bleeding persists.
5. Head bleed: Initially thought to be non-acute, further evaluation by neurology is warranted to assess the need for any interventions or changes in"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleed, and hypovolemic shock. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including diuretics, antibiotics, anticoagulants, and supportive care.

From the progress note, it appears that the patient has been stable overall with no major complications. However, there are a few potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Renal failure: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and the use of nephrotoxic medications could potentially worsen his renal function. Monitoring kidney function through lab tests such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels would be important.

2. Infection: Although not explicitly mentioned in the progress note, infections are common in critically ill patients. Monitoring vital signs, white blood cell count, and other laboratory markers can help identify any potential infections early on.

3. Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed is a significant concern, especially considering his use of anticoagulants. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status, blood pressure, and coagulation parameters is crucial to prevent further bleeding.

4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and chronic heart failure increases the risk of cardiac complications. Continuous monitoring of heart rate, rhythm, and cardiac enzymes is important to detect any"

   84M with severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation on
   coumadin transferred from OSH with acute GI bleeding in the setting of
   supratherapeutic INR, still somewhat wet and with worsening renal
   failure.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Intubated in ED given hypoxic respiratory
   failure and for airway protection due to vomiting. Hypoxic respiratory
   failure may be related to decompensated heart failure given large
   volume fluid resuscitation. CT chest on admission also comments on
   likely aspiration pneumonia. Limiting factors for extubation are (1)
   apnea and (2) fluid overload raising concern for worsened pulmonary
   edema once PEEP is removed.
        Reason for apnea is not clear. Differential includes medications
   (fentanyl, midazolam), Cheynne-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations due to severe
   systolic heart failure, and CNS process given concern for recent
   intracranial hemorrhage. Neurosurgery did not feel that apnea was
   related to ICH.
        Patient was diuresed overnight with Lasix drip and one dose of
   Diuril.
   -          Neurology consult re: apnea, unresponsiveness off of
   sedatives
   -          Wean sedation medications to see if apnea improves
   -          Diuresis with Lasix drip and Diuril
   -          Only marker of infection is left-shift; given lack of
   secretions and fever, will hold off on treating for pneumonia at this
   time
   -          Given apnea, was transitioned back to assist control

   -          Hold calcitriol, cochicine, [**Last Name (un) 239**]
   -          Check PM electrolytes
   -          Renal consult
   -          Phos binder
   #. Shock:  Initially attributed to hypovolemic shocks given large
   hematocrit drop from baseline and melanotic stools at outside hospital.
   [**Month (only) 60**] also be a component of cardiogenic shock given that patient was off
   of diuretics and has known poor systolic function. In addition, CT
   chest/abd/pelvis from admission comments on likely aspiration pneumonia
   and right-sided colitis, raising concern for sepsis
 this is less
   likely given lack of fever, leukocytosis, and infectious symptoms. Has
   not required pressors for >24 hours.
   -          Continue to hold on antibiotics as patient does not appear
   to have active infection (keeping in mind that he may not be able to
   mount fever or leukocytosis)
   -          Maintain MAP>55
   #. GI bleed:  Hematocrit stable. Upper endoscopy with evidence of
   gastritis but no evidence of active bleeding. Patient recently had
   colonoscopy that showed a polyp but was otherwise normal (ie no
   hemorrhoids, diverticulosis).
   -          Per GI, if patient has active bleeding, consider capsule
   study
   -          Continue PPI IV daily
   -          Change to QD HCT checks; maintain active T+C
   -          Maintain 2 PIVs in case of large volume resuscitation
   #. ?Head bleed:  Initially felt by neurosurgery to be non-acute.
   -          Neurosurgery recs
   -          Neurology consult, as above
   #. Systolic heart failure:  Recent echo [**3-20**] with global process
   affecting LV and RV. Underlying etiology of cardiomyopathy is unclear.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old male with severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred from another hospital with acute gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and is currently experiencing worsening renal failure. He is also suffering from respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonia and decompensated heart failure. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is on long-term oxygen therapy. He also has a history of diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleed, shock (hypovolemic or hemorrhagic), heart failure (systolic, chronic), renal failure (chronic), and atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to his underlying chronic conditions such as COPD and heart failure. There is a risk of further aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
2. Gastrointestinal bleed: There is a risk of re-bleeding or worsening of the current gastrointestinal bleed. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.
3. Shock: The patient may continue to experience shock due to hypovolemia or hemorrhage. It is crucial to maintain adequate fluid balance and monitor for signs of shock.
4. Heart failure: The patient's heart failure may worsen due to fluid overload or exacerbation of underlying"

   to acute GI bleed in the setting of supratherapeutic INR
   #. Respiratory failure:  Intubated in ED given hypoxic respiratory
   failure and for airway protection due to vomiting. Hypoxic respiratory
   failure may have been related to decompensated heart failure in the
   setting of large volume fluid resuscitation.  His two hurdles for
   extubation
 apnea and fluid overload
  were overcome by 5.27 and the
   patient was extubated. He has had excellent respiratory status since
   extubation. Appears approx. euvolemic.

   -          Phos binder
   #. Shock:  Now hemodynamically stable, off of pressors for several days
   now. Initially attributed to hypovolemic shocks given large hematocrit
   drop from baseline and melanotic stools at outside hospital. [**Month (only) 60**] also
   be a component of cardiogenic shock given that patient was off of
   diuretics and has known poor systolic function. In addition, CT
   chest/abd/pelvis from admission comments on likely aspiration pneumonia
   and right-sided colitis, raising concern for sepsis
 this is less
   likely given lack of fever, leukocytosis, and infectious symptoms. Has
   not required pressors for greater than 48 hours.
   #. GI bleed:  Hematocrit stable, trending up to 31 from 28.4 yesterday.
   Upper endoscopy with evidence of gastritis but no evidence of active
   bleeding. Patient recently had colonoscopy that showed a polyp but was
   otherwise normal (ie no hemorrhoids, diverticulosis).
   -          Per GI, if patient has active bleeding, consider capsule
   study
   -          Transition IV PPI to PO today
   -          Monitor hematocrit
 stable for several days now
   #. ?Head bleed: Epidural Hematoma.  Initially felt by neurosurgery to
   be non-acute. Patient is s/p R MCA stroke on [**3-29**], thought to be
   embolic in the setting of A fib without anti-coagulation. At that time,
   Coumadin and ASA were re-started, with plan to stop ASA when IRN was
   therapeutic given GI polyps.  Per neurology, would hold on re-starting
   anticoagulation for now. The patient is indeed at high risk for
   recurrent stroke given his risk factors of CHF, DM, and atrial
   fibrillation, coumadin and aspirin use should be carefully weighed in
   this patient given and should optimally be held until the bleeding
   source is identified. Neurosurg rec starting anti-coag on [**5-18**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including respiratory failure, altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleed, shock, heart failure, renal failure, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, which was temporarily stopped on 05/08/2110 at 10:08 AM. The patient has received various medications, including antibiotics, and has undergone several interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxemia and hypercapnia if not properly managed. This can result in further deterioration of the patient's condition.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status, likely due to delirium, can progress to severe confusion or even coma if not addressed promptly. This can make it challenging to assess and manage the patient's pain, anxiety, or other symptoms.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient is presenting with signs of lower gastrointestinal bleed, which can lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability. This may require urgent endoscopic intervention or surgery to control the bleeding.

4. Shock: The patient is at risk of experiencing shock due to hypovolemia or hemorrhage. Rapid fluid resuscitation and identification of the underlying cause are crucial in managing this condition.

5. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, which can worsen with the current respiratory"

   84M with severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation on
   coumadin transferred from OSH with hypovolemic shock likely secondary
   to acute GI bleed in the setting of supratherapeutic INR
   #. Respiratory failure:  Intubated in ED given hypoxic respiratory
   failure and for airway protection due to vomiting. Hypoxic respiratory
   failure may have been related to decompensated heart failure in the
   setting of large volume fluid resuscitation.  His two hurdles for
   extubation
 apnea and fluid overload
  were overcome by 5.27 and the
   patient was extubated. He has had excellent respiratory status since
   extubation. Appears approx. euvolemic.
   -          Continue Lasix 80, goal negative 1L
   -          Con
t to monitor
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Improved. Patient autodiuresing.
   Creatinine trending down nicely at 3.5 today from max 4.1. Likely
   etiology for kidney injury was ATN.
   -          Renally dose medications
   -          Hold calcitriol, cochicine, [**Last Name (un) 239**]

   -          Phos binder
   #. Shock:  Now hemodynamically stable, off of pressors for several days
   now. Initially attributed to hypovolemic shocks given large hematocrit
   drop from baseline and melanotic stools at outside hospital. [**Month (only) 60**] also
   be a component of cardiogenic shock given that patient was off of
   diuretics and has known poor systolic function. In addition, CT
   chest/abd/pelvis from admission comments on likely aspiration pneumonia
   and right-sided colitis, raising concern for sepsis
 this is less
   likely given lack of fever, leukocytosis, and infectious symptoms. Has
   not required pressors for greater than 48 hours.
   #. GI bleed:  Hematocrit stable, trending up to 31 from 28.4 yesterday.
   Upper endoscopy with evidence of gastritis but no evidence of active
   bleeding. Patient recently had colonoscopy that showed a polyp but was
   otherwise normal (ie no hemorrhoids, diverticulosis).
   -          Per GI, if patient has active bleeding, consider capsule
   study
   -          Transition IV PPI to PO today
   -          Monitor hematocrit
 stable for several days now
   #. ?Head bleed: Epidural Hematoma.  Initially felt by neurosurgery to
   be non-acute. Patient is s/p R MCA stroke on [**3-29**], thought to be
   embolic in the setting of A fib without anti-coagulation. At that time,
   Coumadin and ASA were re-started, with plan to stop ASA when IRN was
   therapeutic given GI polyps.  Per neurology, would hold on re-starting
   anticoagulation for now. The patient is indeed at high risk for
   recurrent stroke given his risk factors of CHF, DM, and atrial
   fibrillation, coumadin and aspirin use should be carefully weighed in
   this patient given and should optimally be held until the bleeding
   source is identified. Neurosurg rec starting anti-coag on [**5-18**].
         -        Restart ASA and Coumadin in [**5-18**]

   expect correction with free water and now that he is s/p extubation off
   benzos/sedatives. If continues without improvement, MR [**First Name (Titles) 303**] [**Last Name (Titles) **].

   FFP. Currently in slow fib.
   -          Low dose beta-blocker, as above

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with severe systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, and acute gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus. He was intubated in the emergency department for hypoxic respiratory failure and airway protection due to vomiting. The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory status: The patient was extubated successfully and has had excellent respiratory status since then. He is expected to continue Lasix therapy to maintain negative fluid balance.
- Renal function: The patient's acute renal failure has improved, with autodiuresis and a decreasing creatinine level from 4.1 to 3.5. Renal dosing of medications is recommended, and phosphate binders should be considered.
- Shock: The patient is now hemodynamically stable and off of pressors for several days. Initial hypovolemic shock is likely secondary to acute GI bleed. There may also be a component of cardiogenic shock due to poor systolic function.
- GI bleed: Hematocrit is stable and trending up. Upper endoscopy showed evidence of gastritis but no active bleeding. The patient recently had a colonoscopy that showed a polyp but was otherwise normal.
-?Head bleed: The patient has an epidural hematoma. Neuros"
