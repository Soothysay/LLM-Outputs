","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of right lower lobe mass and left atrial disease. She underwent a rigid bronchoscopy for biopsy and developed hypoxemia afterward, requiring nonrebreather oxygen therapy in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Due to her oxygen needs, she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 93/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is awake, alert, but somewhat unintelligible, with mild respiratory distress. Physical examination reveals bronchial breath sounds at the right base, regular heart rhythm, and no edema. Laboratory results and a chest X-ray are pending. The patient is receiving supportive care, including empiric antibiotics and weaning off oxygen as tolerated. The assessment suggests that the hypoxemia could be due to volume loss, aspiration, or hemorrhage, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, emphysema, and is critically ill. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's recent bronchoscopy procedure and the presence of emphysema, she may be at risk of aspirating secretions or food particles into"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and a necrotizing lung mass consistent with non-small cell carcinoma. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and has experienced several episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) that resolved with amiodarone. The patient required intubation due to respiratory decompensation and has been placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate (HR) of 80 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 90/44 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. Her troponin levels have increased from 0.07 to 0.25, indicating a possible troponin leak likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of tachyarrhythmia and hypoxia. Her white blood cell (WBC) count is elevated at 19.8 K/uL.

The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, for suspected pneumonia. Bronchial washings were positive for malignant cells consistent with non-small cell carcinoma. The patient's chest x-ray showed a necrotizing lung mass.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient experienced four episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), which were resolved with amiodarone. The patient was loaded with 150mg of amiodarone and started on an amiodarone drip.
- The patient required intubation due to respiratory distress and broadened antibiotics to include vancomycin and cefepime.
- An arterial line and central venous line were placed, and the patient was started on phenylephrine for hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 80s.
- Troponin levels increased from 0.07 to 0.25 and then down-trended to 0.19, suggesting a troponin leak. However, CK and CK-MB levels remained low.
- The patient was started on heparin and a statin.
- The patient has known diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). These conditions should be managed accordingly.
- The patient's hypertension is currently moderately low, with systolic blood pressures in the 90s. Lisinopril and inderol should be held.
- The patient has chronic pain and now experiences right-sided pleuritic pain from the procedure. Pain management with low-dose morphine should be continued.
- GERD and anxiety should be addressed appropriately.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia, which were resolved with amiodarone. The patient required intubation due to respiratory distress and broadened antibiotics to include vancomycin and cefepime. A central venous line (CVL) was placed, and the patient was started on phenylephrine for hypotension. Troponins increased from 0.07 to 0.25, and then decreased to 0.19. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were levofloxacin, ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn), vancomycin, and cefepime on 03/23/2151. 

Infusions include midazolam, fentanyl, phenylephrine, amiodarone, and heparin sodium. Other ICU medications include amiodarone, morphine sulfate, midazolam, and fentanyl. Heparin sodium was started at 01:30 AM on 03/24/2151. 

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the episodes of sustained VT. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/44 to 85/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is 73.7 kg, and fluid balance shows a total intake of 4,492 mL, including 416 mL of blood products. Output includes 1,190 mL of urine and 165 mL of stool. 

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 480 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (Crs) of 43.6 cmH2O/mL. ABG results show pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 49 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 97%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 24 mEq/L. 

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic status. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 19.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 29.9%, platelet count (Plt) of 66 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.0 mg/dL, troponin T level of 0.19, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 29 mmHg, and blood glucose levels ranging from 100 to 129 mg/dL.

   81 year old woman with hx of CAD, MI, HTN, hyperlipidemia and a
   necrotizing lung mass with path consistent with non-small cell
   carcinoma with hospital course complicated by sustained VT with
   respiratory decompensation requiring intubation
   # Respiratory Failure. Volume overload vs. post-obstructive PNA.
   Increased work of breathing yesterday associated with VT. Patient was
   intubated by anaesthesia and did well on ventilator overnight. ABx were
   broadened (from levo), A-line and CVL were placed. Bedside bronch done,
   BAL negative for PMNs or organisms.  Patient extubated [**2151-3-25**] but with
   respiratory decompensation requiring re-intubation
   - Continue vanco/cefepime (day 1 = [**3-23**]) for duration of 14 days
   - Monitor on spontaneous breathing trial (RSBI < 100 this morning) and
   move towards extubation today
   #Hypercalcemia:
   - check parathyroid hormone related protein (cannot add on)
   # VT. Possibly triggered by hypoxia/respiratory distress. 4 episodes
   over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone (150 x 2 and then 0.5
   mg/min drip) and respiratory support.  Was intubated and started on
   amiodarone drip with no more episodes. Completed amiodarone drip,
   monitored off PO with no more episodes.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   # Troponin leak. Likely demand ischemia in setting of tachyarrhythmia,
   hypoxia. No significant increase in CK, CK-MB. Troponins now
   down-trending.
   - d/c heparin
   - Trend EKG
   # RLL mass:  Pathology consistent with non-small cell carcinoma
   - hypercalcemia work-up
   .
   # CAD: stable, is on aspirin
   - continue aspirin and statin
   - check CEs to make sure ischemia not cause of respiratory distress
   .
   # CHF: has known diastolic CHF
   - diurese as above, cycle CEs as above
   - no need to repeat echo at this time
   .
   # HTN: hypertensive at baseline, now with moderately low BPs with
   systolics in the 90s.
   - hold lisinopril and inderol
   .
   # Chronic pain: has chronic pain and now R sided pleuritic pain from
   the procedure.  Is on lyrica and darvacet and a small dose benzo at
   home.  Will hold at this time.
   - codeine for the cough
   - low dose morphine for pain control

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and a necrotizing lung mass consistent with non-small cell carcinoma. She was admitted with respiratory decompensation and required intubation. The patient had difficulty tolerating oxygen by face mask and developed increased work of breathing with sinus tachycardia. She was re-intubated after experiencing increased work of breathing and diaphoresis. Bronchial brushings confirmed the presence of malignant cells consistent with non-small cell carcinoma. Hypercalcemia work-up was initiated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had episodes of respiratory failure requiring intubation. She also experienced respiratory decompensation during extubation, necessitating re-intubation.
2. Volume Overload vs. Post-obstructive Pneumonia: The patient had increased work of breathing associated with volume overload or post-obstructive pneumonia.
3. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient had episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) which were treated with amiodarone.
4. Troponin Leak: The patient experienced a troponin leak likely due to demand ischemia during tachyarrhythmia and hypoxia.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia, which needs further evaluation and management.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has chronic kidney disease, and her electrolytes should be monitored.
7. GERD: The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and protonix should be continued daily.
8. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety should be managed while her respiratory status is compromised.
9. Chronic Pain: The patient has chronic pain, and pain control measures should be implemented.
10. DVT Prophylaxis: The patient should receive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.
11. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient should receive stress ulcer prophylaxis.

   - Extubated in the AM after successful breathing trial. However,
   patient had difficulty tolerating O2 by face mask and developed
   increased work of breathing with sinus tach to 110s-120s for most of
   afternoon. HR not responsive to  IVF or morphine/xanax.
   - Non-invasive trial attempted and patient initially able to tolerate,
   but later very uncomfortable and pulling at mask. Converted to NRB and
   O2 sats 100%; then to 5 L by NC with sats in mid-90s.
   - Re-intubated at ~5:30 AM on [**2151-3-25**] after increased work of breathing,
   diaphoresis
   - Bronchial brushings returned positive for malignant cells consistent
   with non-small cell carcinoma.

- However, the patient had difficulty tolerating oxygen by face mask and developed increased work of breathing with sinus tachycardia in the afternoon. Heart rate was unresponsive to IV fluids or morphine/xanax.
- A non-invasive ventilation trial was attempted, but the patient became uncomfortable and pulled at the mask. Converted to NRB and O2 with sats in mid-90s.
- The patient was then re-intubated at around 5:30 AM after experiencing increased work of breathing and diaphoresis.
- Bronchial brushings returned positive for malignant cells consistent with non-small cell carcinoma.
- Hypercalcemia workup was initiated.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- Infusions of fentanyl and midazolam were given.
- Other medications include morphine sulfate.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 96/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support information are provided.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - ONC: start zometa (gave pamidronate, which is formulary equivalent;
   per pharmacy this can be given qweek max)
   - CT/CTA chest: no PE, large asymmetric R sided effusion suspicious for
   malignant effusion, compressive atelectasis and masses in R lung
   - Rad Onc: No emergent XRT unless there is proximal airway compression.
   Will need repeat Chest CT (completed).  Could consider thoracentesis to
   help with extubation.
   - Echo: EF 34%, worrisome for new LAD infarct.  Cards c/s called,
   thinking about cath maybe Monday.  Recommended transfuse to Hct > 30%.
   No BB if we think she has acute heart failure right now.  Consider amio
   gtt if she goes back into VT.
   - transfused 2u pRBC
   - tried to gently diurese this PM with IV lasix 20 mg IV x 2 but
   patient became hypotensive with SBP dropping to high 70s and 80s.  Gave
   500 cc NS bolus and pressures improved.  Patient also appears to be
   having runs of Afib and NSVT on telemetry.
   - EKG obtained this AM, shows Q waves inferiorly and poor R wave
   progression consistent with new anterior infarct

   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  PNA
   cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad
   Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in
   improving oxygenation
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D4/8
   - pleural effusion could be [**1-26**] acute heart failure; less likely to be
   malignant or parapneumonic in nature
   - diuresis as tolerated; goal diuresis -500 cc
 1L; use lasix drip to
   avoid venodilatory effect of boluses,
   - continue aspirin, also reduces venodilation of lasix
   - restart amio
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if patient continues to be
   difficult to wean off vent
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   - f/u Cards recs
   - goal Hct > 30
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by recent ischemic event
   +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4 episodes over
   ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.  Completed amio
   gtt with no further dosing.
   - continue to monitor; consider amio gtt vs. PO if ectopy or VT
   continues

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer presenting with respiratory failure. She has undergone an elective bronchoscopy and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient also has new systolic heart dysfunction, worrisome for a left anterior descending artery infarct.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors. First, she has a large asymmetric right-sided effusion suspicious for malignant effusion, compressive atelectasis, and masses in the right lung. This could contribute to her respiratory failure.

Second, the patient's heart function appears to be compromised with an ejection fraction of 34%, indicating systolic dysfunction. This may be related to the new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending artery.

Third, the patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL. She has been transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells.

Fourth, the patient's electrolytes show hypercalcemia with a corrected calcium level >12. This is likely due to malignancy-related tumor factors. She has been dosed with pamidronate yesterday.

Fifth, the patient has hyperlipidemia with a recent ischemic event. Her statin has been changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day.

The patient's medical team is considering various interventions, including diures"

   - ONC: start zometa (gave pamidronate, which is formulary equivalent;
   per pharmacy this can be given qweek max)
   - CT/CTA chest: no PE, large asymmetric R sided effusion suspicious for
   malignant effusion, compressive atelectasis and masses in R lung
   - Rad Onc: No emergent XRT unless there is proximal airway compression.
   Will need repeat Chest CT (completed).  Could consider thoracentesis to
   help with extubation.
   - Echo: EF 34%, worrisome for new LAD infarct.  Cards c/s called,
   thinking about cath maybe Monday.  Recommended transfuse to Hct > 30%.
   No BB if we think she has acute heart failure right now.  Consider amio
   gtt if she goes back into VT.
   - transfused 2u pRBC
   - tried to gently diurese this PM with IV lasix 20 mg IV x 2 but
   patient became hypotensive with SBP dropping to high 70s and 80s.  Gave
   500 cc NS bolus and pressures improved.  Patient also appears to be

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer. She is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has experienced multiple medical complications, including a large asymmetric right-sided pleural effusion suspicious for malignant effusion, compressive atelectasis, and masses in the right lung. She also has evidence of new left anterior descending artery infarction with reduced ejection fraction, acute heart failure, and ventricular tachycardia.

The patient's recent events include the initiation of zometa (pamidronate) therapy for hypercalcemia, which is likely related to malignancy. She received a blood transfusion yesterday and experienced hypotension after diuresis with lasix. The patient has runs of atrial fibrillation and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on telemetry.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities due to malignancy, which worsened by pleural effusion. Pneumonia cannot be excluded but is less likely. Pulmonary embolism was not appreciated on the CT angiogram. Radiation therapy is not recommended at this time to improve oxygenation.
- Empiric treatment with antibiotics (vanc/cefepime), D4/8.

   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  PNA
   cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad
   Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in
   improving oxygenation
   - pleural effusion could be [**1-26**] acute heart failure; less likely to be
   malignant or parapneumonic in nature
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D4/8
   - diuresis as tolerated; goal diuresis -500 cc
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if patient continues to be
   difficult to wean off vent
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   - f/u Cards recs

   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by recent ischemic event
   +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4 episodes over
   ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.  Completed amio
   gtt with no further dosing.
   - continue to monitor; consider amio gtt vs. PO if ectopy or VT
   continues
   # hypercalcemia - Albumin only 2.2 so corrected calcium actually >12.
   With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy related tumor
   factors.  Dosed with pamidronate yesterday.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She presented with elective bronchoscopy complications leading to respiratory failure. There are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has likely baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities due to malignancy worsened by a pleural effusion. This could be acute heart failure or pneumonia, but pleural effusion is less likely to be malignant or parapneumonic in nature. Empiric treatment with antibiotics (vanc/cefepime) and diuresis as tolerated are recommended. Therapeutic thoracentesis may be considered if the patient continues to be difficult to wean off the ventilator.

2. Acute Heart Failure: The patient appears to have new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed. Follow-up cardiac recommendations are advised.

3. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia likely triggered by the recent ischemic event and/or hypoxia/respiratory distress. Amiodarone was given initially, and the patient completed amio gtt without further dosing. Continuous monitoring is recommended"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted for elective bronchoscopy but developed respiratory failure, likely due to worsening lung parenchymal abnormalities and pleural effusion. There is also evidence of acute heart failure with anterior wall motion abnormalities suggestive of a left anterior descending (LAD) artery infarct. The patient's cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed. She has been diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia, which is likely triggered by the recent ischemic event. Transaminitis is present, possibly related to poor forward flow and new medications. The patient also has hypercalcemia, which is likely from malignancy-related tumor factors, and anemia, which is being managed with red blood cell transfusion. She has been started on amiodarone for ventricular ectopy and is being treated with diuretics for pleural effusion and heart failure. The patient has made decisions regarding her care, including being do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities and pleural effusion may contribute to ongoing respiratory failure. 
2. Ventricular Tachycardia:"

   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  PNA
   cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad
   Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in
   improving oxygenation. pleural effusion could be [**1-26**] acute heart
   failure; less likely to be malignant or parapneumonic in nature.
   Patient made DNR/DNI
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D5/8
   - diuresis as tolerated, limited by low BP; goal diuresis -500 cc
 1L;
   use lasix drip to avoid venodilatory effect of boluses,
   - wean sedation to raise pressures
   - repeat SBT
   - consider milrinone drip if low pressure
   - continue aspirin, also reduces venodilation of lasix

   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis if patient continues to be
   difficult to wean off vent and in line with goals
   - f/u Rad Onc recs, if any
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   - avoiding bb
   - on lasix gtt, consider milrinone prn

   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by recent ischemic event
   +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4 episodes over
   ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.  Completed amio
   gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back [**Month/Day (2) 864**] and vtach has ceased

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She presented with respiratory failure due to a pleural effusion, which was likely caused by acute heart failure. Cardiac enzymes indicate a new anterior wall motion abnormality consistent with a left anterior descending (LAD) artery infarction. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia. She also has transaminitis, hypercalcemia, anemia, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including potential pulmonary embolism, acute heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, and hypercalcemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to a pleural effusion. This could be due to underlying lung cancer or acute heart failure.
2. Acute Heart Failure: The patient shows evidence of new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD. This may indicate acute heart failure.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which were likely triggered by recent ischemic events or hypoxia/respiratory distress.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated AST and ALT"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated
   on CTA.  Rad Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be
   helpful in improving oxygenation. pleural effusion could be [**1-26**] acute
   heart failure; less likely to be malignant or parapneumonic in nature.
   Overnight on [**3-27**], patient had labile SBP that was bolused repeatedly.
   Pressures are an issue
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D6/8
   - diuresis as tolerated, limited by low BP; goal diuresis -500 cc
 1L;
   use lasix drip to avoid venodilatory effect of boluses,
   - wean sedation to raise pressures
   - repeat SBT
   - consider milrinone drip if low pressure, or levophe
   - continue aspirin, also reduces venodilation of lasix
   - continue amio
   - f/u Rad Onc recs, if any
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   - avoiding bb
   - on lasix gtt, consider milrinone prn
   - f/u Cards recs
   - goal Hct > 30
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by recent ischemic event
   +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4 episodes over
   ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.  Completed amio
   gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back [**Month/Day (4) 864**] and vtach has ceased
   - continue to monitor; consider amio gtt vs. PO if ectopy or VT
   continues
   .
   Transaminitis
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI, poor
   forward flow and several new medications.
   - trend
   .
   # hypercalcemia - Albumin only 2.2 so corrected calcium actually >12.
   With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy related tumor
   factors.  Dosed with pamidronate 4.2, improving.
   - Follow up parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**] and stable [**3-26**]
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - patient DNR/DNI, continue to dynamically assess goals of care
   .
   # hyperlipidemia
 Statin changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of
   recent ischemic event.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure after undergoing an elective bronchoscopy. The patient has made a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.2°F (39°C), blood pressure ranging from 61/42 mmHg to 163/94 mmHg, heart rate between 83-125 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several medical complications, including acute heart failure with evidence of new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a left anterior descending (LAD) artery infarct. The cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed. 

The patient also experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) likely triggered by the recent ischemic event or hypoxia/respiratory distress. She was treated with amiodarone bolus and continuous infusion, which helped to control the VT.

The patient has hypercalcemia likely from malignancy-related tumor factors. She was dosed with pamidronate 4.2, improving her condition"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer. She presented with respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing labile blood pressure, fevers, and new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a myocardial infarction. She also had episodes of ventricular tachycardia, transaminitis, hypercalcemia, anemia, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, diuretics, low-dose pressors, and medications for pain management. She is on a ventilator and has a nasogastric tube in place. The patient has been given a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities, likely due to her malignancy, have worsened by pleural effusion. This could lead to further respiratory distress and potential need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent myocardial infarction increases the risk of future cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or recurrent myocardial infarction.
3. Infection: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient continues to have fevers, indicating a possible ongoing infection. This could lead to sepsis and septic shock.
4. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient was admitted with acute respiratory failure and is currently ventilator-dependent. 

The patient has developed several complications during his ICU stay. These include nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) +/- sepsis, new-onset atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and acute kidney injury. 

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 102.2°F, heart rate (HR) of 84 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 102/54-140/73 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%, and central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.8 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) levels, and decreased total bilirubin (TBili) at 0.3 mg/dL. Other lab values, such as hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), blood glucose (Glucose), and electrolytes (Na+, K+, Cl-, HCO3-, Ca++, Mg++, PO4), are within normal ranges.

The patient's chest X-ray shows no infiltrates, and sputum cultures have been negative for organisms. The patient's condition remains critical, and the family has decided against reintubation, opting for comfort measures only.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis secondary to VAP, further cardiac dysfunction, and potential complications related to the patient's advanced age and underlying comorbidities."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient underwent an elective bronchoscopy that led to respiratory failure. There are concerns about a possible left anterior descending (LAD) infarct.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her respiratory status is stable, but she has a high respiratory secretions volume, making extubation challenging. The patient remains do not resuscitate (DNR) but can be reintubated if necessary.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 97 beats per minute, hypotension with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 92% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels.

The patient's cardiac enzymes show a flat creatine kinase (CK) and downtrending troponin levels, indicating a past acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in the LAD territory. The patient has been on low-dose norepinephrine to support blood pressure and is also receiving furosemide for fluid management.

The patient experienced ventricular tachycardia, which was successfully treated with amiodarone. She is now"

   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated
   on CTA.  Rad Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be
   helpful in improving oxygenation. pleural effusion could be [**1-26**] acute
   heart failure; less likely to be malignant or parapneumonic in nature.
   Overnight on [**3-27**], patient had labile SBP that was bolused repeatedly.
   Pressures are an issue.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D7/8
 consider switching
   to zosyn if continues to have fevers

   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.

   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by recent ischemic event
   +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4 episodes over
   ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.  Completed amio

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient underwent elective bronchoscopy but developed respiratory failure. There are concerns about a possible pulmonary embolism (PE) and pneumonia (PNA), but these have been ruled out based on computed tomography angiography (CTA) and other investigations.

The patient has been intubated and sedated, and her condition remains unstable with labile blood pressure and poor oxygenation. She has been receiving empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and cefepime, which may be switched to zosyn if she continues to have fevers.

There are concerns about acute heart failure, as the patient shows signs of new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed. The patient is being monitored for any signs of recurrent ventricular tachycardia, which was initially treated with amiodarone.

The patient also has hypercalcemia, likely due to malignancy-related tumor factors, and has received treatment with pamidronate. Anemia has been addressed with a recent transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC). Hyperlipidemia has been managed by changing"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient was admitted for an elective bronchoscopy and subsequently developed respiratory failure. She also has new systolic heart dysfunction, which is worrisome for a left anterior descending (LAD) infarct.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for pneumonia, but it is less likely given the presence of a pleural effusion. The effusion could be due to acute heart failure or malignancy-related causes.
2. Acute heart failure: The patient has shown labile blood pressure and has new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the LAD territory. Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
3. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which were likely triggered by the central venous line or recent ischemic events. The episodes resolved after pulling back the CVL and administering amiodarone.
4. Transaminitis: The patient had elevated AST and ALT levels, which resolved as of [**3-29**]. This was likely due to recent myocardial inf"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted for elective bronchoscopy but developed respiratory failure. The patient has made a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decision. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, likely due to worsening lung parenchymal abnormalities caused by malignancy and a pleural effusion.
2. Acute Heart Failure: The patient appears to have new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced episodes of VT, which were likely triggered by the recent ischemic event or hypoxia/respiratory distress. VT was initially managed with amiodarone bolus and continuous infusion, and the central venous line was pulled back, resulting in cessation of VT.
4. Transaminitis: The patient had elevated AST and ALT levels, which resolved as of [**3-29**]. This may be attributed to recent myocardial infarction, poor forward flow, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient underwent elective bronchoscopy due to respiratory failure and showed new systolic heart dysfunction, which was worrisome for a left anterior descending (LAD) infarct. 

The patient has multiple medical complications and potential medical issues that need to be addressed. Here are some potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities worsened by pleural effusion. It is important to continue pulmonary toilet, monitor oxygenation, and evaluate for any interval changes on repeat CT of the chest.

2. Acute Heart Failure: The patient appears to have new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD. Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed. The patient should continue to be monitored for cardiac function, and an echo should be repeated to evaluate for ejection fraction, intracardiac shunt, etc.

   .
   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely.  PE not appreciated
   on CTA.  Rad Onc, at this time, does not feel that radiation would be
   helpful in improving oxygenation. pleural effusion could be [**1-26**] acute
   heart failure; less likely to be malignant or parapneumonic in nature.
   Overnight on [**3-27**], patient had labile SBP that was bolused repeatedly.
   Pressures are an issue.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime), D8, continue for 10 day
   course for treatment of post-obstructive pnemonia
   - monitor CVP

   - pulmonary toilet
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   - continue amiodarone
   - f/u Rad Onc recs, if any
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed.

   - on lasix gtt, on pressors --> consider milrinone prn
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/up with cardiology regarding management/adding milrinone

   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - on PO amiodarone

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient underwent an elective bronchoscopy that led to respiratory failure. There are concerns about a possible left anterior descending (LAD) infarct.

The patient has multiple medical complications including acute respiratory failure, acute heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, hypercalcemia, anemia, hyperlipidemia, and transaminitis. The acute respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia or pleural effusion. The acute heart failure is suggested by new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD. The ventricular tachycardia is likely triggered by central venous lines or recent ischemic events. Hypercalcemia is likely from malignancy-related tumor factors, and anemia may be related to recent transfusion.

The patient's current treatment includes antibiotics for suspected post-obstructive pneumonia, diuretics for fluid management, cardiac enzymes monitoring, and adjustments in cardiac support medications. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, further deterioration of cardiac function, electrolyte imbalances, and infections. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, which is likely due to baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities exacerbated by pleural effusion and malignancy. The patient also presented with acute heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, transaminitis, hypercalcemia, anemia, hyperlipidemia, and a recent myocardial infarction (MI) in the territory of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. She has been on multiple medications and treatments, including antibiotics, blood thinners, and cardiac support. The patient's condition has shown some improvement with interventions such as pigtail catheter placement, sedation weaning, pulmonary toilet, and cardiac enzyme monitoring. However, she remains in the ICU pending clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate further due to underlying lung cancer and pleural effusion.
2. Cardiac complications: Given the recent MI and pre-existing CAD, there is a risk of recurrent cardiac events, including arrhythmias, heart failure, or another MI.
3. Infection: Despite antibiotic therapy, there is a possibility of developing a healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Bleeding: Due to antico"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. This could be due to the underlying lung cancer worsening, pleural effusion, or post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a FiO2 of 40%.

2. Cardiac Complications: The patient appears to have new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). This indicates a potential heart attack. The cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, suggesting that the acute episode has passed. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has improved to 45% on repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).

3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion, which is exudative and likely to be malignant or parapneumonic in nature. A pigtail catheter has been placed, and the CT chest shows a significantly reduced size of the pleural effusion.

4. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced episodes of VT, which were likely triggered by the central venous line (CVL) in the right ventricle or recent ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respir"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and showed signs of acute renal failure, hypotension, and ventricular tachycardia. The patient has undergone several interventions including extubation, arterial line placement, central venous line placement, pigtail catheter placement, and transfusion of packed red blood cells. She is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, diuretics, and statins. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 115/48 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging studies reveal a resolving pleural effusion and anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct. The patient's ejection fraction has improved to 45% on repeat echocardiogram. The patient's conditions include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, ventricular tachycardia, transaminitis, hypercalcemia, anemia, non-small cell lung cancer, and hyperlipidemia. She is currently on a DNR/DNI status and will have a family meeting to clarify code status."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  Given WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less
   likely to cause resp failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. PLeural effusion is exudative; likely to be malignant or
   parapneumonic in nature.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the
   right. CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, none of which is c/w
   a cardiogenic cause
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D11 of ABX, D3 of [**Last Name (un) **] (will need ID
   approval)
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   -  monitor pigtail output.
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, check RISB
   - continue aspirin
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses
   - Avoid increasing pressors
   - avoid bolusing with sedation
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - holding off digoxin
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/up with cardiology regarding management
   - I/O keep even for now
   - Balance lasix rate with creatinine
   - check pm lytes
   - consider SWAN for better assessment of hemodynamics.
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/c amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # Transaminitis
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   - trend and resolved
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Improving though still elevated (corrected for
   albumin). With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy
   related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**], improving.
   - f/u parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**] and stable [**3-26**]
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc
   .
   # hyperlipidemia
 Statin changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of
   recent ischemic event.

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presenting with respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated and is expected to continue weaning off sedation. 

The patient's arterial line was stopped and restarted multiple times, indicating fluctuations in her condition. She received a bolus of fluids and increased pressors for hypotension. 

The patient is on several medications including midazolam (Versed), fentanyl (Concentrate), norepinephrine, furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and others. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 115/48 mmHg to 137/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and lactate levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, suggesting improvement from an acute heart event. 

The patient has a history of new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for left anterior descending (LAD)"

   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient underwent an elective bronchoscopy which resulted in respiratory failure, likely due to baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities exacerbated by pleural effusion. The pleural effusion was exudative but cytology negative for malignancy.

The patient also has acute renal failure with unclear etiology, possibly contrast-induced or pre-renal, and good urine output. There is concern about avoiding fluid overload due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's serum creatinine levels are stable.

Additionally, the patient has shown signs of acute heart failure with new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI) in the territory of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has improved to 45% on repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).

The patient experienced an episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT), which was likely triggered by the central venous line (CVL) in the right ventricle (RV) or recent ischemic event. This VT has ceased since pulling back the CVL and completing amiod"

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted for an elective bronchoscopy but developed respiratory failure, likely due to baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities worsened by pleural effusion. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) did not reveal any pulmonary embolism (PE), and radiation therapy was deemed not necessary for improving oxygenation. The pleural effusion was found to be exudative but cytology negative for malignancy. 

The patient also had an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement and pigtail placement on the right side. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed improving left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and mitral regurgitation (MR), as well as a mixed venous saturation of 78%, which is less consistent with a cardiogenic cause. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.1°F, heart rate (HR) of 110 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 125/52 mmHg to 140/56 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% on supplemental oxygen. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with white blood cell (WBC) counts ranging from 19.1 to 22.6 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and mixed electrolyte abnormalities. Cardiac enzymes show flat creatine kinase (CK) levels and downtrending troponin-T levels, indicating that the acute episode of myocardial infarction has passed. The patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is stable at 27.5 mL/min.

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia have led to endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The underlying cause is likely baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities worsened by pleural effusion. Post-obstructive pneumonia cannot be excluded but is less likely to cause respiratory failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient has mean arterial pressures (MAPs) around 60 mmHg while on vasopressors. This indicates septic shock, and the patient's blood pressure remains unstable. Fluid boluses should be avoided due to acute renal failure, and increasing pressors should be avoided as well.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and reduced eGFR. The etiology of acute renal failure is unclear but may be related to contrast-induced nephropathy, pre-renal causes, or intrinsic renal injury. Good urine output has been observed, and the goal is to keep the patient's fluid balance even to avoid causing pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory failure.

4. Acute heart failure: The patient appears to have new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Cardiac enzymes show flat CK levels and downtrending troponin-T levels, indicating that the acute episode of myocardial infarction has passed. The patient's LVEF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.

5. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT), which were likely triggered"

   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D12 of ABX, D4 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine stable this AM.
   - goal is to keep patient near even to avoid causing pulmonary edema
   and thereby worsening respiratory failure
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now

   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/ced amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line

   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She underwent elective bronchoscopy, which led to respiratory failure. The patient also has new systolic heart dysfunction, worrisome for a left anterior descending (LAD) infarct. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities, along with malignancy and pleural effusion, could worsen her respiratory status.
2. Hypotension: The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) is around 60 while on pressors, indicating possible hypotension.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has unclear etiology for acute renal failure, possibly contrast-induced or pre-renal. Good urine output is noted.
4. Acute Heart Failure: The patient shows new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD. Cardiac enzymes are flat, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
5. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia likely triggered by the central venous line or recent ischemic event. 
6. Hypercalcemia: The patient had hypercalcemia resolved, likely from malignancy-related tumor factors. She was treated with pamidronate and is improving.
7. Anemia: The patient had a"

   # respiratory failure
Patient made DNR/DNI.  Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung
   parenchymal abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion
   (R>L).  Given WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less
   likely to cause resp failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. PLeural effusion is exudative; likely to be malignant or
   parapneumonic in nature.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the
   right. CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, none of which is c/w
   a cardiogenic cause
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D11 of ABX, D3 of [**Last Name (un) **] (will need ID
   approval)
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics

   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Avoid increasing pressors
   - avoid bolusing with sedation due to vasoactive effects, recommend
   haldol for agitation and taper off midazolam

   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - holding off digoxin
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/up with cardiology regarding management
   - I/O keep even for now
   - Balance lasix rate with creatinine
   - check pm lytes
   - consider SWAN for better assessment of hemodynamics.

   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/c amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line

   # hypercalcemia
 Improving though still elevated (corrected for
   albumin). With appropriately low PTH this is likely from malignancy
   related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**], improving.
   - f/u parathyroid related peptide
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presenting with elective bronchoscopy complicated by respiratory failure. The patient has also shown new systolic heart dysfunction, which is worrisome for a left anterior descending (LAD) infarct.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including right lower lobe (RLL) lung cancer, right pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atelectasis, and underlying pulmonary edema from recent myocardial infarction (MI) and depressed left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction.

The patient has made a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) decision. The likely baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities, along with malignancy worsening the pleural effusion (R>L), have contributed to respiratory failure. Post-obstructive pneumonia cannot be excluded but is less likely to cause respiratory failure. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is not appreciated on computed tomography angiography (CTA). Radiation oncology does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving oxygenation.

The pleural effusion is exudative and likely to be malignant or parapneumonic in nature. The patient underwent an indwelling pleural (IP) tap and pigtail placement on the right. A CT chest showed"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a critically ill 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
- The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature.
- The patient had a right pleural effusion that was tapped and a pigtail catheter was placed, which has now been discontinued.
- The patient is being treated empirically for pneumonia related to lung cancer.
- The patient was agitated and received antipsychotics for agitation.
- The patient's hypotension has resolved, but blood pressure should be monitored, and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be maintained above 60 mmHg.
- The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TF).
- The patient experienced acute renal failure, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy, and is maintaining lasix drip while monitoring urine output (UO), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels.
- The patient had a new anterior wall motion abnormality consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF) has improved to 45% on repeat transthoracic"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo F h/o CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC p/w elective bronchoscopy c/b
   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D13 of ABX, D5 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol/zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine shows mild improvement this AM.
   - goal is to keep patient near even to avoid causing pulmonary edema
   and thereby worsening respiratory failure
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/ced amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],
   improving.
   - PTHrP WNL
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**].  Stable since that time.
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc

   # hyperlipidemia
 Statin changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of
   recent ischemic event.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient underwent elective bronchoscopy and subsequently developed respiratory failure, which is likely due to baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities exacerbated by a pleural effusion. The effusion was exudative but cytology negative for malignancy. The patient received intravenous (IV) antibiotics for potential post-obstructive pneumonia and had a pigtail catheter placed in the right pleural space.

The patient also presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, and new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with an inferior wall myocardial infarction. Cardiac enzymes showed flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has improved to 45% on repeat transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).

Additionally, the patient experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) likely triggered by central venous catheterization (CVL) or the recent ischemic event. The VT episodes resolved after pulling back the CVL and administering amiodarone.

Other medical conditions noted in the progress note include hypercalcemia, which has resolved with appropriate low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and treatment with pamidronate, anemia, hyperlipidemia, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, which is likely due to lung parenchymal abnormalities and a pleural effusion. The patient has undergone several interventions, including bronchoscopy, insertion of a pigtail catheter, and placement of a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC).

The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues. She has been treated for hypotension, acute renal failure (possibly contrast-induced and pre-renal), hypercalcemia, ventricular tachycardia (VT), and anemia. The hypercalcemia was managed with pamidronate, and the VT was controlled with amiodarone. The patient also has a history of an ischemic heart event, for which she is receiving beta-blockers.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 118/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her current medications include furosemide, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, midazolam, heparin, haloperidol, and fentanyl.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient underwent an elective bronchoscopy which resulted in respiratory failure. There are also concerns about a possible left anterior descending (LAD) infarct. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure likely due to baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities and a pleural effusion. The effusion is exudative but cytology-negative for malignancy. The patient received an IP tap and pigtail placement on the right side, and a CT chest showed resolving effusion. 

The patient is also experiencing hypotension with mean arterial pressures (MAPs) around 60 while on pressors. Fluid boluses are avoided due to acute renal failure, thought to be contrast-induced or pre-renal in etiology. 

The patient has acute renal failure with unclear etiology, but good urine output and mild improvement in creatinine levels. The goal is to keep the patient's fluid balance even to avoid pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory failure. 

Additionally, the patient has acute heart failure with new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the LAD.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Trials of IPS mode, hopefully work towards
   SBT, and eventually extubation trial if possible.  However, limited
   progress to date.  Monitor
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p IP tap and pigtail placement on the right
   --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin/meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BuN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENT TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent ischemic
   event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue PO amio.
   Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC on [**2151-3-25**].  Stable. Continue to trend Hct.
   LUNG CA
 No plans for intervention while in MICU.  Chemotherapy to be
   considered if patient able to tolerate extubation.  Outpatient f/u with

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who is currently experiencing respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU.

The patient's condition is multifactorial, including right lower lobe (RLL) lung cancer, right pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atelectasis, underlying pulmonary edema from a recent myocardial infarction (MI), and depressed left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation, with trials of intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) mode, potentially progressing towards spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and eventual extubation if possible. However, the patient has had limited progress to date.

The patient has a history of right pleural effusion, which was managed with an indwelling pleural catheter (IP tap) and pigtail placement. The catheter has been discontinued, but the patient will be monitored for re-accumulation of the effusion.

The patient also has pneumonia related to lung cancer and is receiving empiric treatment with antibiotics (vancomycin/meropenem).

Agitation has been observed and is being managed with antipsychotics.

The patient's hypotension is improving but slowly. Blood pressure should be closely monitored, and vasopressors may be required to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP)"

   MICU Attending:
   Family meeting today, including HCP.  Updated medical condition,
   answered all questions.  Discussed poor progress on mechanical
   ventilator over past 13 days.  Underlying RLL malignancy without
   treatment options at this time.  Considering possibility of trach/PEG
   if no further progress.  HCP and [**Name2 (NI) 11864**] members express unnanimous
   decision that patient would NOT want trach and chronic mechanical
   ventilation.  Desire to assess over next few days, optimize medical
   condition in preparation of extubation trial (with no plans for
   reintubation).  Also, all agree on DNR in the event that patient
   experiences cardiac or further respiratory arrest.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a recent improvement in wakefulness and tolerance of lower doses of sedatives. The patient remains on vasopressor but is tolerating a gradual reduction in dose.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The respiratory failure is multifactorial, including right lower lobe lung cancer, right pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atelectasis, and underlying pulmonary edema from a recent myocardial infarction (MI) and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. These include agitation, hypotension, acute renal failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), and ventricular tachycardia. The patient also has liver function test (LFT) abnormalities and anemia.

The plan of care includes continuing mechanical ventilation and trials of pressure-controlled ventilation mode (IPS mode) to work towards spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and eventually an extubation trial if possible. The right pleural effusion has been drained and a pigtail catheter placed, which has been discontinued. The pneumonia is being treated empirically with antibiotics (vancomycin/meropenem).

   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D14 of ABX, D6 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol/zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine shows mild improvement this AM.
   - goal is to keep patient near even to avoid causing pulmonary edema
   and thereby worsening respiratory failure
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/ced amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],
   improving.
   - PTHrP WNL
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**].  Stable since that time.
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer. The patient underwent elective bronchoscopy and subsequently developed respiratory failure, which was likely worsened by pleural effusion. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed, but no pulmonary embolism (PE) was appreciated. The patient also has a new systolic heart dysfunction, concerning for a left anterior descending (LAD) infarct.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 110 bpm (within normal range), blood pressure of 89/42 mmHg (hypotensive), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (within normal range), oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen, and a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.

The patient is intubated and responding appropriately to questions. She moves all limbs purposefully. Physical examination reveals tachycardia, regular rhythm, rhonchi on anterior examination, and clubbing without edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin concentration, and normal platelet count. Renal function tests indicate mild improvement in creatinine levels. Other laboratory values are within normal limits or do not show significant abnormalities.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, likely due to baseline lung paren"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer. She was admitted for elective bronchoscopy and subsequently developed respiratory failure. The patient also has new systolic heart dysfunction, which is worrisome for a left anterior descending (LAD) infarct. She has been treated with antibiotics, antipsychotics, and aspirin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities, along with malignancy and pleural effusion, have worsened her respiratory function. Oxygenation may be compromised due to post-obstructive pneumonia or pleural effusion.
2. Hypotension: The patient has a mean arterial pressure (MAP) around 60 while on pressors, indicating low blood pressure. This could be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or acute renal failure. It is important to avoid fluid boluses in this case due to acute renal failure.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has unclear etiology of acute renal failure, possibly contrast-induced or pre-renal. Good urine output has been observed, but creatinine shows mild improvement. Close monitoring of renal function and maintaining even fluid balance is crucial.
4. Acute Heart Failure: The patient has new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the LAD territory. Cardiac enzymes show flat"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Tolerating IPS mode this AM, hopefully work
   towards SBT, and eventually extubation trial if possible.  However,
   limited progress to date.  Monitor.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin/meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BuN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC on [**2151-3-25**].  Stable. Continue to trend Hct.
   LUNG CA
 No plans for intervention while in MICU.  Chemotherapy to be
   considered if patient able to tolerate extubation.  Outpatient f/u with
   Oncology.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of chronic atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer. He presented to the ICU with respiratory failure, which is multifactorial including right lower lobe lung cancer, right pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atelectasis, underlying pulmonary edema from recent myocardial infarction, and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, tolerating intermittent spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation, work towards successful SBT, and eventually attempt extubation if possible. However, there has been limited progress to date. Other conditions include right pleural effusion, pneumonia related to lung cancer, agitation, hypotension, acute renal failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), and ventricular tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and requires close monitoring and management.
2. Lung cancer: The patient has a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer, which may require further intervention and treatment once he is stable.
3. Right pleural effusion: The patient had a right pleural effusion that was drained and a pigtail catheter was placed. Monitoring for re-accumulation is necessary.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia related to lung cancer, and empiric antibiotic"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Tolerating IPS mode this AM, hopefully work
   towards SBT, and eventually extubation trial if possible.  However,
   limited progress to date.  Monitor.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin/meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BuN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC on [**2151-3-25**].  Stable. Continue to trend Hct.
   LUNG CA
 No plans for intervention while in MICU.  Chemotherapy to be
   considered if patient able to tolerate extubation.  Outpatient f/u with
   Oncology.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, tolerating intermittent spontaneous breathing trials. His current medications include fentanyl, furosemide, vancomycin, meropenem, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to several factors including right lower lobe lung cancer, right pleural effusion, pneumonia, atelectasis, and underlying pulmonary edema from a recent myocardial infarction (MI) and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction.
2. Right Pleural Effusion: The patient had a thoracentesis and pigtail placement on the right side, which has been discontinued. Monitoring for re-accumulation of the effusion is necessary.
3. Pneumonia: The pneumonia is related to lung cancer and is being treated empirically with antibiotics (vancomycin/meropenem).
4. Agitation: The patient is receiving antipsychotics to manage agitation.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is improving but slowly. Close monitoring of blood pressure and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg is essential. Vasopressors may be required as"

   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better

   Assessment and Plan

   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D15 of ABX, D7 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   - pending family meeting for goals of care (preped for extubation)
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol/zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine worsened this AM.  Lytes are due to contraction alk,
   hypernatremia is noted.
   - gentle hydration (0.5L NS over an hr)
   - received free water
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE.
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/ced amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],
   improving.
   - PTHrP WNL
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN
   .
   # anemia
 s/p transfusion of 2u pRBC on [**3-25**].  Stable since that time.
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   #. Non-small Cell CA: Biopsy results confirmed this diagnosis.
   - outpatient f/u with Onc

   # hyperlipidemia
 Statin changed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in light of

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, likely secondary to baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities worsened by pleural effusion. The pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for malignancy. The patient underwent an elective bronchoscopy that led to respiratory failure.

The patient has been treated with antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and cefepime, which were later changed to vancomycin and meropenem. She is also receiving fentanyl for pain management and antipsychotics for agitation.

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 116 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 119/56 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient has experienced several medical complications including acute renal failure, hypotension, and a possible inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI) with anterior wall motion abnormalities. Her cardiac enzymes initially showed an elevated CK level but have since downtrended, indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her ejection fraction (EF) has improved to 45% on repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.  Overall
   limited progress.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Unfavorable RSBI, poor tolerace of SBT.  Poor
   progress, limited progress to date.  Monitor.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin & meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BUN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, HTN, and new diagnosis of NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure.
- The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.
- He has had limited progress in the ICU, with ongoing respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes including RLL lung cancer, right pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atelectasis, and underlying pulmonary edema from recent MI (myocardial infarction) and depressed LV ejection fraction.
- The patient underwent thoracentesis and pigtail placement for right pleural effusion, which has been discontinued.
- He is being treated empirically for pneumonia related to lung cancer with antibiotics (vancomycin & meropenem).
- The patient is experiencing agitation, which is being managed with antipsychotics.
- His hypotension is improving but slowly, and efforts are being made to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg with vasopressors as needed.
- The patient's nutritional support is at goal.
- He has acute renal failure due to contrast-induced nephropathy, and lasix drip is being continued. His UO (urine output), BUN (blood urea nitrogen), and Creatinine levels are being monitored for gradual improvement.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU due to respiratory failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Right pleural effusion: The patient had a pleural effusion that was drained via thoracentesis and pigtail placement. The effusion has been discharged, but monitoring for re-accumulation is necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia related to lung cancer. Empiric antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and meropenem should be continued.
3. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, which is being managed with antipsychotics.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and efforts are being made to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. Vasopressors may be needed to achieve this.
5. Nutritional support: The patient is receiving tube feeding (TF) at goal.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient has developed contrast-induced acute renal failure. Lasix drip should be maintained, and close monitoring of urine output (UO), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine is required.

   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal

   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She underwent an elective bronchoscopy due to respiratory failure, which was worsened by a pleural effusion. The effusion was exudative but cytology negative for malignancy. She received an IP tap and pigtail placement on the right side, and a CT chest showed resolving effusion.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. ABG results show ///32/ with Ve of 11.2 L/min. RSBI deferred due to agitation.
2. Anemia: The patient has guaiac positive stool and a modest response to transfusion.
3. Hypotension: The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) is around 60 while on pressors. Fluid boluses are avoided due to acute renal failure (ATN).
4. Acute renal failure: The etiology is unclear, but thought to be contrast-induced +/- pre-renal. Creatinine worsened this AM, and the patient received gentle hydration.
5. Acute heart failure: The patient has new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending (LAD)"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient underwent an elective bronchoscopy but developed respiratory failure, which is likely due to baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities worsened by pleural effusion. The pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for malignancy. The patient also has hypotension with mean arterial pressure (MAP) around 60 while on pressors, indicating septic shock. The patient's acute renal failure is unclear in etiology, possibly contrast-induced or pre-renal, but with good urine output. The patient also has acute heart failure with new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has improved to 45% on repeat transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).

Other medical conditions include hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, anemia, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's recent ischemic event prompted a change in statin therapy to atorvastatin 80 mg/day. The patient's malignancy-related tumor factors likely caused the hypercalcemia, which has been treated with pamidronate. The"

   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D15 of ABX, D7 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation

   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol/zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine worsened this AM.  Lytes are due to contraction alk,
   hypernatremia is noted.
   - gentle hydration (0.5L NS over an hr)
   - received free water
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE.
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/ced amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],
   improving.
   - PTHrP WNL
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presenting with elective bronchoscopy complicated by respiratory failure. She also has new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for left anterior descending (LAD) infarct. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, acute renal failure, acute heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, hypercalcemia, anemia, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities and malignancy worsened by pleural effusion may contribute to respiratory failure. Post-obstructive pneumonia cannot be excluded but is less likely to cause respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient has mean arterial pressures (MAPs) around 60 while on pressors. Avoid fluid boluses due to acute renal failure (ATN), wean pressors as able, and consider Haldol/Zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The etiology of acute renal failure is unclear, possibly contrast-induced or pre-renal. Good urine output, creatinine worsened this AM, and hyponatremia is noted. Gentle hydration (0.5L NS over an hr) received free water, and PM"

   respiratory failure, new systolic heart dysfunction worrisome for LAD
   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D15 of ABX, D7 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   - pending family meeting for goals of care (preped for extubation)
   .
   Anemia
 guiac positive stool, modest response to transfusion
   - trend
   - family meeting

   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol/zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine worsened this AM.  Lytes are due to contraction alk,
   hypernatremia is noted.
   - gentle hydration (0.5L NS over an hr)
   - received free water
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to
   45% on repeat TTE.
   - continue BB as per cardiology recommendations.
   - goal Hct > 30
   - f/u cardiology recs (if any)
   - I/O keep even for now
   .
   # ventricular tachycardia
 Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  She initially had 4
   episodes over ~30 minutes which broke with amiodarone bolus + gtt.
   Completed amio gtt, continue PO amio. Pulled back CVL and VT has ceased
   - continue to monitor
   - d/ced amiodarone given no further events since adjusting central line
   .
   # hypercalcemia
 Resolved.  With appropriately low PTH this is likely
   from malignancy related tumor factors.  Dosed with pamidronate [**2151-3-26**],
   improving.
   - PTHrP WNL
   - Treat with lasix +/- fluids PRN

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer. She presented with elective bronchoscopy complicated by respiratory failure, and there are concerns for left anterior descending artery infarction.

The patient has several medical complications that require close monitoring and management:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 40%, and PEEP 5 cmH2O. ABG results show a respiratory acidosis (pCO2 32 mmHg). The plan is to continue pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated, and wean sedation.

2. Anemia: The patient had a positive guaiac test indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells and responded well to the transfusion. Hct levels are now appropriate.

3. Hypotension: The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) is around 60 while on pressors. The plan is to avoid fluid boluses due to acute renal failure and difficulty removing volume. Pressors should be weaned as able.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have worsened, indicating possible contrast-induced nephropathy or pre-renal etiology. Urine output is good, and the plan is to provide gentle hydration with 0.5L normal saline over an hour.

   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin & meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BUN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC more.  Continue to trend Hct.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent
   GI bleed, although NG aspirate with only TF.

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, which is multifactorial and includes right lower lobe (RLL) lung cancer, right pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atelectasis, and underlying pulmonary edema from a recent myocardial infarction (MI) and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. He received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) for worsening anemia. He also required vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure control.

Other notable findings and assessments include:
- Right pleural effusion: Thoracentesis and pigtail placement were performed, and the patient is now discharged from the procedure. Monitoring for re-accumulation is recommended.
- Pneumonia: Empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and meropenem is continued, as it is related to lung cancer.
- Agitation: Antipsychotics are prescribed to manage agitation.
- Hypotension: Blood pressure monitoring and vasopressor support are maintained to keep the mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.  Overall
   limited progress.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Unfavorable RSBI, poor tolerace of SBT.  Poor
   progress, limited progress to date.  Monitor.  Will discuss direction
   of care
 HCP states patient would not want trach.  [**Month (only) 11**] move to
   extubation attempt
 will discuss further with HCP.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin & meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BUN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC more.  Continue to trend Hct.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent
   GI bleed, although NG aspirate with only TF.
   LUNG CA
 No plans for intervention while in MICU.  Chemotherapy to be
   considered if patient able to tolerate extubation.  Outpatient f/u with
   Oncology.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure. The main medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying pulmonary edema from a recent myocardial infarction (MI) and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction contribute to the respiratory failure. Continuous mechanical ventilation is planned to support the patient's breathing.

2. Right Pleural Effusion: The patient had a thoracentesis and pigtail placement on the right side to manage the pleural effusion. However, it was subsequently discontinued. Monitoring for re-accumulation is necessary.

3. Pneumonia: The pneumonia is related to the lung cancer. Empiric antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and meropenem is being continued.

4. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, which is being managed with antipsychotics.

5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is slowly improving but requires close monitoring of blood pressure. Vasopressor support may be necessary to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

6. Nutritional Support: The patient's nutritional support includes tube feeding at goal.

7. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely"

   infarct
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**1-26**] baseline lung parenchymal
   abnormalities [**1-26**] malignancy worsened by pleural effusion (R>L).  Given
   WBC, post-obstructive PNA cannot be excluded but is less likely to
   cause respiratory failure.  PE not appreciated on CTA.  Rad Onc, at
   this time, does not feel that radiation would be helpful in improving
   oxygenation. Pleural effusion is exudative but cytology negative for
   malignancy.   S/P IP tap and pigtail placement on the right (D/C
   [**4-2**]). CT chest shows resolving effusion. Repeat TTE on [**3-31**] shows
   improving EF and MR, and mixed venous sat is 78%, which is less
   consistent with a cardiogenic cause.
   - empiric treatment with abx (vanc/cefepime --> vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for better
   coverage of post-obstructive pna), D15 of ABX, D7 of [**Last Name (un) **]
   - tx agitation with antipsychotics
   - repeat CXR s/p pigtail removal
   - monitor CVP, continue to wean sedation
   - pulmonary toilet, PSV as tolerated
   - continue aspirin
   - pending family meeting for goals of care (preped for extubation)
   .
   Anemia
 guiac positive stool, modest response to transfusion

   # Hypotension: Patient with MAPs around 60 while on pressors
   - Avoid fluid boluses, difficult to remove volume given acute renal
   failure [**1-26**] ATN
   - Wean pressors as able
   - Recommend haldol/zyprexa for agitation and taper off midazolam
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Unclear etiology.  Thought to be
   contrast-induced +/- pre-renal etiology.  Good urine output.
   Creatinine worsened this AM.  Lytes are due to contraction alk,
   hypernatremia is noted.
   - gentle hydration (0.5L NS over an hr)
   - received free water
   - PM lytes/creatinine
   .
   # acute heart failure
 Patient appears to have new anterior wall
   motion abnormalities consistent with a new infarct in the territory of
   the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and downtrending troponins,
   indicating that the acute episode has passed. Her EF has improved to

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She was admitted for elective bronchoscopy but developed respiratory failure, which may be attributed to baseline lung parenchymal abnormalities, malignancy, or a pleural effusion. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) did not reveal any pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient underwent an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement due to contraindications for anticoagulation.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including acute renal failure (possibly contrast-induced or pre-renal), anemia, hypotension, ventricular tachycardia (VT), hypercalcemia, and hyperlipidemia. Her cardiac function has improved, as indicated by an improved ejection fraction (EF) on repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The VT episodes were likely triggered by the central venous line (CVL) in the right ventricle (RV) or recent ischemic event.

The patient's electrolytes show hypernatremia and hypokalemia, which are likely due to contraction alkalosis and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Her blood glucose levels are within normal range, and she has a positive guaiac test indicating gastrointestinal bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yof CAD, HTN, new dx of NSCLC c/b respiratory failure.  Overall
   limited progress.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including RLL lung cancer, right
   pleural effusion, right pneumonia, atalectasis, underlying pulmonary
   edema from recent MI and depressed LV ejection fraction.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Unfavorable RSBI, poor tolerace of SBT.  Poor
   progress, limited progress to date.  Plam move to extubation attempt
   will discuss further with HCP.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSSION
 s/p thoracentesis and pigtail placement on
   the right --> now D/C'd.  Monitor for re-accumulation.
   PNEUMONIA
 related to lung CA.  Continue empiric treatment with abx
   (vancomycin & meropenem)
   AGGITATION -- Rx agitation with antipsychotics.
   HYPOTENSION -- improving, but slowly.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF at goal.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- contrast induced.  Maintain lasix drip. Monitor
   UO, BUN, Creatinine.  Gradual improvemennt.
   CHF -- new anterior wall motion abnormalities consistent with a new
   infarct in the territory of the LAD.  Cardiac enzymes show flat CKs and
   downtrending troponins, indicating that the acute episode has passed.
   LV EF has improved to 45% on repeat TTE.  Continue b-blocker as per
   Cardiology recommendations.
   VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA -- Likely triggered by CVL in RV or recent
   ischemic event +/- hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Resolved.  Continue
   PO amio. Pulled back CVL.
   LFT abnormalities
 AST, ALT ~ 100 with AST>ALT in the context of MI,
   poor forward flow and several new medications. Resolved as of [**3-29**]
   ANEMIA -- received 2U PRBC more.  Continue to trend Hct.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent
   GI bleed, although NG aspirate with only TF.
   LUNG CA
 No plans for intervention while in MICU.  Chemotherapy to be
   considered if patient able to tolerate extubation.  Outpatient f/u with
   Oncology.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer, presenting with respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient has several medical complications, including right pleural effusion, pneumonia related to lung cancer, agitation, hypotension, acute renal failure, congestive heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, liver function test abnormalities, anemia, and lung cancer.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 124/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The patient's general appearance is well-nourished and not in acute distress. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the cardiovascular, respiratory, or musculoskeletal systems, but there is evidence of peripheral edema and muscle wasting.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, indicating that the recent myocardial infarction has passed.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing mechanical ventilation, monitoring for re-accumulation of right pleural effusion, continuation of antibiotic treatment for pneumonia, management of agitation, maintenance of blood pressure, and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hypertension (HTN). She has been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient also has new systolic heart dysfunction, which is worrisome for a left anterior descending (LAD) infarct. Despite two weeks of therapy, the patient showed no improvement or ability to wean off the ventilator. Due to her condition and after discussing with the healthcare provider (HCP) and the patient's family, it was decided to perform terminal extubation and provide comfort measures only (CMO). The patient is now extubated and on morphine for pain relief.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current condition of respiratory failure may continue or worsen due to the underlying NSCLC and possible acute heart failure.
2. Exudative effusion: The patient has an exudative effusion of presumed malignant vs. infectious etiology. This could potentially lead to further respiratory complications.
3. Infection: The presence of an exudative effusion increases the risk of infection, which can lead to pneumonia or sepsis.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's new systolic heart dysfunction indicates a possible LAD infarct. This could result in worsening heart function and contribute to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythm"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She underwent an elective bronchoscopy but developed respiratory failure, which is likely due to her NSCLC, possibly in combination with acute heart failure and an exudative effusion of presumed malignant versus infectious etiology. Despite two weeks of therapy, the patient showed no improvement or ability to wean off the ventilator. The healthcare team and the patient's family agreed to perform terminal extubation and make the patient comfort measures only (CMO). The patient was extubated last night and is currently on morphine gtt for comfort measures only.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and bed rest can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
3. Stress ulcers: Prolonged critical illness and mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of acquiring other nosocomial infections.
5. Pulmonary embolism: If the patient develops DVT and the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been experiencing respiratory distress. 

The patient was extubated last night and appears comfortable. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 92/41 mmHg to 160/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 85%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient has received various medications, including morphine sulfate for pain management and lorazepam for agitation. He has also been receiving antibiotics for pneumonia related to his lung cancer. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has a history of right lower limb edema, but it is absent at the moment. Physical examination reveals normal cardiovascular findings, except for distant S2 heart sound. Respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds without any abnormalities. Neurological examination shows the patient to be attentive, oriented, and purposeful in movement.

Assessment and plan include multifactorial respiratory failure due to right lower lobe lung cancer, right pleural effusion"
