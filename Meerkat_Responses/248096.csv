   - Hypernatremia:  Goal correction from 156->150 in AM.  Pt's free water
   deficit 5L, started on 1/2D5 at 150 cc/hr. 2230 Na --.
   - Curbsided ID re: antibiotic coverage of ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE (and
   concern for inducing resistance), as well as pt's cont'd fevers x 6
   days and increased secretions in last day despite being on broad
   spectrum abx (vanc, zosyn). ID rec'ed: 1) pan-culturing the pt again
   (sputum, urine, blood) to see if pt grows the same organism, if that
   organism has become resistant, or if he grows a new organism. 2)also,
   given concerns about treatment failure, rec'd broadening abx coverage
   by changing from zosyn to meropenem AFTER pt cultured.

 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
   46M with ESLD c/b ascites, varices and encephalopathy; course
   complicated by intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy and
   current hypoxemia.
   .
   # Hypoxemia, fevers: Likely pneumonia.  Patient growing enterobacter
   cloacae which is pan-sensitive.  Continues to spike, however, despite
   broad coverage with antibiotics.  ABG demonstrates respiratory acidosis
   with metabolic alkalosis.  Acute incident today was in the context of
   worsening secretions; could have had mucous plugging.  In addition
   enterobacter has inducible resistance, perhaps the patient is no longer
   responding to the therapy.
   - ID consult
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl at this time
   - Intubated
   - Suction secretions
   - Place a-line
   # Hypernatremia:  Free water deficit of 4.8 liters.  D5

   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: Occurred on [**2156-11-11**] and in setting of liver
   disease-related coagulopathy. Repeat scans show no significant changes
   ([**11-13**] and [**11-16**]) and neuro exam stable as above.
   - cont dilantin for seizure ppx
   - daily neurology exams
   - fall precautions, low bed
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission. Now
   holding off on repleting coagulation factors and blood products given
   stable over several days.
   - daily INR
   - FFP given bleeding with suctioning and INR 2.3.
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hypoxia Improving. Was
   secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and hepatic encephalopathy.
   The patient has known decompensated liver disease with a previous
   history of encephalopathy.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day)
   .
   #. ESLD: No viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is currently 26. In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - cont thiamine, folate, MVI
   - trend MELD scores
   .
   #. Transverse Process Fractures: Per neurosurgery are non-operative.
   Does not need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 363**] in 4 weeks with a non-contrast head  CT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and a history of alcohol abuse. He presented with altered mental status, fever, and respiratory failure. The patient has been treated for pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics but continues to have fevers. He is also experiencing hypernatremia and has a shallow toe ulcer. The patient has a history of falls, including one that resulted in a subdural hemorrhage, and he is currently on antiseizure prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient continues to have fevers, indicating a possible ongoing infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, suggesting acute respiratory failure.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a free water deficit of 4.8 liters, which needs to be addressed to correct the hypernatremia.
4. Shallow toe ulcer: This could potentially lead to cellulitis or other complications if not properly managed.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of liver disease-related coagulopathy and is at risk for bleeding, especially with an INR of 2.3.
6. Subdural hemorrhage: The patient has a history of a fall resulting in a subdural hemorrhage, which could potentially worsen if not monitored closely.
7. ESLD: The patient's liver disease"

   complicated by intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy and
   current hypoxemia.
   .
   # Hypoxemia, fevers: Likely pneumonia.  Patient growing enterobacter
   cloacae which is pan-sensitive.  Continues to spike, however, despite
   broad coverage with antibiotics.  ABG demonstrates respiratory acidosis
   with metabolic alkalosis.  Acute incident today was in the context of
   worsening secretions; could have had mucous plugging.  In addition
   enterobacter has inducible resistance, perhaps the patient is no longer
   responding to the therapy.
   - ID consult
   - Continue Vanc
   - Start Meropenem
   - D/C Zosyn/Flagyl
   - Wean off ventilator and extubate today
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  Free water deficit of 4.8 liters [**11-20**], given D5
   @ 150cc/hr x 1500cc.  Free water deficit 3.9L [**11-21**] and given 1L D5W.
   - 1L D5W today, re-check Na in the morning
   .
   #. Head Bleed s/p Fall: Occurred on [**2156-11-11**] and in setting of liver
   disease-related coagulopathy. Repeat scans show no significant changes
   ([**11-13**] and [**11-16**]) and neuro exam stable as above.
   - cont dilantin for seizure ppx
   - daily neurology exams, follow INR and CBC daily
   - fall precautions, low bed
   .
   # Coagulopathy: [**1-12**] hepatic dysfunction, mild DIC on admission. Now
   holding off on repleting coagulation factors and blood products given
   stable over several days.  Minimal bleeding with suctioning
   - daily INR
   - hold on FFP for now, as INR not significantly elevated.
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hypoxia Improving. Was
   secondary to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and hepatic encephalopathy.
   The patient has known decompensated liver disease with a previous
   history of encephalopathy.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin ([**2-12**] BM per day)
   .
   #. ESLD: No viral etiologies per OSH records. Most likely related to
   EtOH. Patient had EtOH level on admission. Pt also has long standing
   ductal dilitation. MELD is currently 26. In records that has varices
   though unclear what or if esophageal.
   - cont lactulose and rifaximin
   - D/C thiamine, folate, MVI
   - trend MELD scores

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 46-year-old man with cirrhosis, intracranial hemorrhage following a fall, and recurrent respiratory failure.
- He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has a fever of 101.7°F.
- His blood pressure is 111/54 mmHg, heart rate is 86 bpm, respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%.
- He has edema in both lower extremities.
- Laboratory results show elevated levels of sodium, potassium, liver enzymes, and bilirubin, as well as low albumin levels.
- The patient's condition remains critical, and he is currently being treated for respiratory failure, hypernatremia, and intracranial hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's repeated episodes of respiratory failure indicate a high risk of continued respiratory distress or worsening of his condition.
2. Intracranial Hemorrhage: With the patient's history of intracranial hemorrhage, there is a risk of further bleeding or expansion of the hemorrhage, which could lead to neurological deterioration.
3. Infection: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count suggests the possibility of an infection, which could worsen the patient's overall condition and complicate his recovery.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: As the patient has cirrhosis, there is a"

   Code status: Full code
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and a history of alcohol abuse. He has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, subdural hemorrhage (SDH), fever of unknown origin (FUO), and hypernatremia.

The patient's current condition shows improvement in hypoxemia and altered mental status. However, he continues to spike fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for an infection caused by Enterobacter cloacae. The ABG demonstrates respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis.

The patient has a history of intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy, and ascites. He has been extubated on [**11-21**]. His labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profile.

The patient's care plan includes ongoing antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and meropenem. He is being given D5W to address hypernatremia, with re-checking of sodium levels in the morning. Dilantin is continued for seizure prophylaxis, and daily neurology exams, follow-up of INR and CBC are recommended. Fall precautions and a low bed are also implemented due to the patient's history of falls and head bleed.

Coagulopathy management involves daily INR monitoring, holding off on repleting coagulation factors"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old man with cirrhosis, intracranial hemorrhage, and recurrent respiratory failure. The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of recurrent respiratory failure, and there is an increasing effusion seen on his chest X-ray. This indicates a potential risk for worsening respiratory function and the possibility of developing further respiratory complications.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated (Na 156). Aggressive fluid repletion is being continued to address this issue. If not properly managed, hypernatremia can lead to neurological complications and dehydration.

3. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient has an intracranial hemorrhage, which can result in increased intracranial pressure and neurological deterioration. Close monitoring and management of intracranial pressure are necessary to prevent further complications.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile shows abnormalities (PTT 54.8, INR 2.9). This indicates an increased risk of bleeding and potential clotting disorders. Close monitoring and appropriate management of coagulation parameters are essential.

5. Liver cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, which puts him at risk for complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and hepatorenal syndrome. These complications can further deteriorate the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), acute respiratory failure, and a subdural hematoma. He has a history of alcohol abuse and has experienced complications such as ascites, varices, encephalopathy, intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, and hypoxemia. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics. His sodium levels are elevated, and he requires free water administration to correct the hypernatremia. He also has a shallow toe ulcer, which is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's mental status is altered due to hypoxia and hepatic encephalopathy. He has a history of falls and has sustained transverse process fractures, which are being managed conservatively. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has signs of infection, including fever and elevated white blood cell count. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment. It is important to monitor his response to the antibiotics and ensure adequate oxygenation.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia. This condition can lead to dehydration and may contribute to altered mental status. Frequent monitoring of sodium levels and administration of free water are necessary to correct the hypernatremia.
3. Subdural Hematoma: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease), respiratory failure, and a subdural hematoma. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and has decompensated liver disease with ascites, varices, and encephalopathy. He also has an intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, and hypoxemia. The patient's current condition includes fever, altered mental status, hypernatremia, anemia, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia and possibly mucous plugging. Continuous monitoring and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics are necessary.
2. Subdural hematoma: The patient has a history of a fall and head injury leading to a subdural hematoma. Close neurologic monitoring is required, and the patient will need to continue on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis until further evaluation by neurosurgery.
3. ESLD: The patient has end-stage liver disease with a MELD score of 26. This indicates a high risk of mortality. Continuous monitoring of liver function, administration of lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and following hepatology recommendations are essential.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient is hypernatremic, which may contribute to altered mental status and potential AMS (acute mental status changes). Close monitoring"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis who has experienced an intracranial hemorrhage after a fall and has had recurrent respiratory failure. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypernatremia, intracranial hemorrhage, and coagulopathy/anemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent respiratory failure indicates a risk for further respiratory distress or failure. This could be due to the inability to protect his airway, altered gag reflex, and impaired airway clearance.
2. Intracranial Hemorrhage: The patient's intracranial hemorrhage increases the risk of neurological complications such as increased intracranial pressure, brain herniation, or seizures.
3. Coagulopathy/Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia, which increases the risk of further bleeding and coagulation issues. The head laceration mentioned is oozing less, but there is still a risk of additional bleeding.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not managed appropriately.
5. Cirrhosis of the Liver: The patient's pre-existing liver disease can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and portal hypertension.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) who has multiple comorbidities including cirrhosis, encephalopathy, pneumonia, subdural hemorrhage, anemia, hypernatremia, coagulopathy, and altered mental status. 

The patient's current medical issues include respiratory failure due to acute pneumonia, which is likely caused by aspiration risk due to an inability to protect the airway. The patient has a history of intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy, and hypoxemia. He is also at risk for developing further complications such as sepsis, multiorgan failure, and increased intracranial pressure.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal coagulation profile indicating liver dysfunction and coagulopathy. His electrolytes are also imbalanced, with hypernatremia and borderline hyponatremia. 

In terms of management, the patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, diuretics for fluid balance, and blood products for anemia and coagulopathy. He is being monitored closely for changes in mental status, electrolyte imbalances, and infection. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and worsening coagulopathy. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient"

            This organism may develop resistance to third generation
            cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore, isolates
   that
            are initially susceptible may become resistant within three to
            four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
   infections,
            repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
   warranted
            if third generation cephalosporins were used.

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) who has experienced multiple complications. He has a history of alcohol abuse, ascites, varices, and encephalopathy. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute; subdural hemorrhage; hypoxemia; fever of unknown origin; and hypernatremia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: tmax: 37.8°C (100°F), tcurrent: 36.7°C (98.1°F), HR: 95 bpm, BP: 124/54 mmHg, RR: 23 insp/min, SpO2: 97%, and heart rhythm: SR (sinus rhythm). The patient's weight is 80 kg, and his height is 72 inches.

The patient has received several interventions, including antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, transfusion of PRBCs, FFP, and platelets due to coagulopathy and anemia, and treatment for hypernatremia with D5W.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function. The imaging reports indicate the presence of ascites and evidence of cirrhosis.

The patient's medical history includes a fall resulting in an intraparenchymal bleed, pneumonia, encephalopathy, and previous extubation. The patient has been diagnosed with ESLD, likely secondary to alcohol abuse, and"

            This organism may develop resistance to third generation
            cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore, isolates
   that
            are initially susceptible may become resistant within three to
            four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
   infections,
            repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
   warranted

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) presenting with various medical complications. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, ascites, varices, encephalopathy, pneumonia, intraparenchymal bleed, hypoxemia, hypernatremia, and altered mental status. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires close monitoring and management of his multiple conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of mild DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) and hepatic dysfunction, which can lead to bleeding complications. There is an ongoing concern about the patient's coagulation status, especially with the recent transfusion of PRBCs (packed red blood cells) without an appropriate increase in hematocrit (HCT) levels.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure and acute hypoxemia, likely secondary to pneumonia. The patient's ABG (arterial blood gas) demonstrates respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis. The patient may require further respiratory support and adjustment of antibiotics.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a significant free water deficit, leading to hypernatremia. This condition needs to be corrected carefully to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome. The patient's sodium levels are now borderline hyponatremic, and IV fluids should be adjusted accordingly.
4. Head Bleed: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and a history of alcohol use. The patient is currently in the ICU due to multiple complications related to ESLD, including respiratory failure, altered mental status, and a subdural hemorrhage (SDH).

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing confusion and disorientation, which may be secondary to hypoxia, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is unable to protect his airway, posing a risk for aspiration. He is currently on supplemental oxygen with an aerosol-cool face tent.
3. Subdural hemorrhage (SDH): The patient has a history of intracranial bleed with a decreasing right frontal intracranial hemorrhage. There is a 2mm shift of midline structures to the left, and an extra-axial collection along the left cerebral convexity remains unchanged.
4. Cirrhosis of the liver: The patient has decompensated liver disease with ascites, varices, and encephalopathy.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and free water flushes have been increased to 250mL Q4h to manage this condition.
6. Anemia: The patient is likely anemic due to head"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of alcohol-related liver disease, presenting with cirrhosis, intracranial bleed, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by pneumonia, encephalopathy, and hypoxemia. The patient has a known history of ascites, varices, and encephalopathy. Recent imaging shows persistent intrahepatic biliary dilation concerning for possible cholangiocarcinoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of mild DIC on admission, and coagulation factors are being carefully monitored. There is a risk of bleeding, especially with suctioning, and the patient received a blood transfusion without an appropriate increase in HCT.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient continues to experience respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis, likely due to pneumonia. There is a concern for mucous plugging and the possibility of aspiration.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a significant free water deficit, which needs to be managed with free water flushes. There is a concern that hypernatremia may be contributing to altered mental status.

4. Head Bleed: The patient experienced a fall resulting in an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Repeat scans show no significant changes, and the neuro exam remains stable.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to head wound bleeding"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease), presenting with cirrhosis, intracranial bleed, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. The patient has known decompensated liver disease with previous episodes of encephalopathy. The patient also has a history of alcohol use disorder and long-standing ductal dilation. The patient's MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score is currently 26.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of liver disease and previous episodes of encephalopathy suggest that he may be at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause altered mental status and should be monitored closely.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been growing enterobacter cloacae, which is pan-sensitive, and continues to spike despite broad coverage with antibiotics. This indicates a potential pneumonia infection.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of mild DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) on admission. Coagulopathy should be closely monitored due to the risk of bleeding.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a free water deficit of 4.8 liters. This condition can contribute to altered mental status and should be addressed with appropriate fluid management.
5. Intracranial Bleeding: The patient has a history of intr"

s girlfriend and
   mother
 Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9935**] from hepatology gave an overview of the pt
   current condition and explained to them that more time is necessary to
   see if mental status will improve.  We will plan for him to go out to
   [**Hospital Ward Name 408**] 10 today, but the family is interested in transferring him to
   [**Hospital3 6748**] Center in [**Location (un) 573**], NH if his condition stabilized
   to the point where transfer is safe.

   on:[**2156-11-25**] 15:14 ------
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 46-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis, intracranial hemorrhage following a fall, and recurrent respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, inability to protect his airway, fever of unknown origin, acute respiratory failure, subdural hemorrhage, hypernatremia, coagulopathy/anemia, and cirrhosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of recurrent respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
2. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient has a subdural hemorrhage, which requires close monitoring for any signs of neurological deterioration.
3. Coagulopathy/anemia: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, indicating an increased risk of bleeding.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has liver cirrhosis, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and hepatorenal syndrome.
5. Fever of unknown origin: The patient has a persistent fever without an identified source, which may indicate an underlying infection or systemic inflammatory response.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can cause dehydration and neurological symptoms if not corrected promptly.
7. Inability to protect airway: The patient's altered mental status puts him at risk for aspiration and respiratory compromise"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis who presented with intracranial hemorrhage after a fall. He has had recurrent respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient's mental status remains poor, and he is encephalopathic, unable to provide any history. He has allergies to citalopram and shakiness. The patient has been on various antibiotics, including metronidazole, vancomycin, and meropenem. He is receiving furosemide and pantoprazole through infusions and is being tube-fed.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/56 mmHg to 149/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on respiratory support with an aerosol-cool face tent and is receiving supplemental oxygen.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normocephalic forehead dressing, symmetric chest expansion, rhonchorous breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both lower extremities, and warm skin. Neurologically, the patient is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, responds to some voice commands but not directed, and has unassessed movement, tone, and deep tendon reflexes.

Lab results show leukocytosis"
