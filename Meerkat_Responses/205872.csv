   transferred from OSH for BRBPR and abdominal pain, now with hypotension
   and tachycardia.
   .
   # BRBPR: Pt with significant bleeding causing hemodynamic instability.
   Hct drop 40-->33, slow trend down to 28.6 today, with continued blood
   in bowel movements. Most recently crits stable. Likely lower GI bleed
   given description of BRB with clots. Differential would include
   diverticulosis, AVM, infectious, or crohn
s flare. Also uses chronic
   NSAIDS so could represent a brisk UGI bleed.
   - maintain active T+S, units typed and crossed in blood bank
   - q6 hct, transfuse for hct<25
   - plan for colonscopy by GI today
   - protonix 40mg IV q12
   - send stool for culture, O+P, c diff

   # Fever: Pt had fever to 102 at home and now with continued
   temperatures. No leukocytosis. Raises concern for infectious or
   inflammatory process-- especially given history of diverticulitis and
   Crohn's-- however no signs of abscess, colitis, or pericolic fat
   stranding on CT.

   # Hypotension/Sinus tachycardia: Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the
   context of bleeding, decreased PO intake, fever. Could also represent
   evolving sepsis given fevers, although [**Last Name (un) 2736**] likely given response to
   fluids.  BP and HR improved by this am, however continues to be febrile
   and to have bloody BMs.
   - IVF bolus prn
   - evaluation for source of bleeding/infection as above

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diverticulitis, partial colectomy, multiple herniorraphy's, and recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease. He was transferred from another hospital for bloody rice krispie brain-like material per rectum (BRBPR) and abdominal pain. Upon admission, he had hypotension and tachycardia, which improved after fluid resuscitation. He continues to have fevers and bloody bowel movements. 

His laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. The differential diagnosis for his condition includes lower gastrointestinal bleed, upper gastrointestinal bleed, diverticulosis, arteriovenous malformation, infection, or Crohn's flare. 

The plan is to maintain active temperature surveillance, cross-match and type blood, perform a colonoscopy, administer proton pump inhibitor, and send stool for culture, O+P, and Clostridium difficile testing. 

The patient is currently in the ICU and is expected to remain there for now, with a possible callout after the colonoscopy if stable."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diverticulitis, partial colectomy, multiple herniorraphies, and a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease. He was transferred from another hospital for bloody rectal bleeding (BRBPR) and abdominal pain. The patient presented with hypotension and tachycardia. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, elevated creatinine level, and other abnormal laboratory values.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GI Bleed): The patient's symptoms of BRBPR, along with the presence of blood in bowel movements, suggest a lower GI bleed. This could be due to diverticulosis, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), or an infectious cause. Crohn's disease is less likely to present with this type of bleeding.

2. Infection: The patient's fever, along with the absence of leukocytosis, raises concerns for an infectious or inflammatory process. His history of diverticulitis and Crohn's disease increases the risk for abscess formation or deep space infection.

3. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be secondary to hypovolemia due to bleeding, decreased oral intake, and fever. This could lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diverticulitis, partial colectomy, multiple herniorraphy's, and recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease. He was transferred to the ICU for BRBPR (bloody resistant to blood products) and abdominal pain. Currently, he presents with hypotension, tachycardia, and an elevated temperature.

The patient underwent a colonoscopy which showed ulceration, granularity, exudate, and erythema in the cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon, consistent with Crohn's disease and diverticulosis. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped significantly, indicating significant bleeding.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. BRBPR: The patient is experiencing significant bleeding leading to hemodynamic instability. Hematocrit (Hct) has dropped from 40% to 33%, and now stabilized at 28.4%. An MRI of the pelvis is recommended to evaluate for abscess and fistula. Prednisone will be administered at a dose of 20 mg every 8 hours if the MRI is negative for abscess. Remicade may also be considered.

2. Fever: The patient had a fever of 102 degrees at home and continues to have low-grade temperatures. No leukoc"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yom with hx of Diverticulitis s/p partial colectomy x 2, hx of
   multiple herniorraphy's, recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease who was
   transferred from OSH for BRBPR and abdominal pain, now with hypotension
   and tachycardia.
   .
   # BRBPR: Pt with significant bleeding causing hemodynamic instability.
   Hct drop 40-->33, slow trend down to 28.6 today, with continued blood
   in bowel movements. Most recently crits stable. Likely lower GI bleed
   given description of BRB with clots. Differential would include
   diverticulosis, AVM, infectious, or crohn
s flare. Also uses chronic
   NSAIDS so could represent a brisk UGI bleed.
   - maintain active T+S, units typed and crossed in blood bank
   - q6 hct, transfuse for hct<25
   - plan for colonscopy by GI today
   - protonix 40mg IV q12
   - send stool for culture, O+P, c diff
   .
   # Fever: Pt had fever to 102 at home and now with continued
   temperatures. No leukocytosis. Raises concern for infectious or
   inflammatory process-- especially given history of diverticulitis and
   Crohn's-- however no signs of abscess, colitis, or pericolic fat
   stranding on CT.
   - continue zosyn, d/c vanco and flagyl
   - MRI pelvis to evaluate for abscess/deep space infection/fistula
   tracking if stable following colonoscopy today
   - send blood cx, UA/urine cx
   - send stool for cx, O+P, c diff
   - cont to monitor fever curve
   - tylenol prn
   .
   # Hypotension/Sinus tachycardia: Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the
   context of bleeding, decreased PO intake, fever. Could also represent
   evolving sepsis given fevers, although [**Last Name (un) 2736**] likely given response to
   fluids.  BP and HR improved by this am, however continues to be febrile
   and to have bloody BMs.
   - IVF bolus prn
   - evaluation for source of bleeding/infection as above
   .
   # Elevated creatinine: Most likely represents prerenal acute renal
   failure in the setting of BRBPR, althought unknown baseline. Given
   mucomyst for renal protection after IV contrast. Cr stable following
   volume resuscitation.
   - Urine lytes
   - Continue to monitor creatinine
   .
   # DM2:
   - hold oral meds while in house
   - will give half of lantus dose while NPO
   - cover with humalog sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, IVF prn as above, replete lytes prn
   # PPX: PPI, pneumoboots, hold bowel regimen in setting of loose stools
   # Access: 2 PIV's, R IJ
   # Code status: FULL
   # Communication: with patient
   # Disposition: ICU for now, possible callout after colonscopy if stable

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diverticulitis, partial colectomy, multiple herniorraphy's, and recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.
- The patient was transferred from another facility for BRBPR (blood and red blood cell fragments in the stool) and abdominal pain.
- The patient now presents with hypotension and tachycardia, likely secondary to hypovolemia due to bleeding, decreased oral intake, and fever.
- The patient has a decreased hematocrit level, indicating ongoing blood loss.
- The patient has been diagnosed with Crohn's disease and requires further evaluation for fistula/abscess.
- The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests prerenal acute renal failure.
- The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and requires adjustments in medication management.
- The patient has been placed on IV fluids, blood transfusions as needed, and other supportive measures.
- The patient's fever persists despite antibiotic therapy, raising concerns for an infectious or inflammatory process.
- The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate.
- The patient requires close monitoring and ongoing evaluation for potential complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: Given the patient's persistent fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, there is a risk"
