   .
   #Leukocytosis: Etiology unclear, WBC ct has ranged from 13-30 during
   recent admission, blood Cx neg to date. C Diff negative, RIJ line was +
   beta strep presumably treated with vancomycin.  Urine Cx + 100,000
   yeast, currently treated with Fluconazole.  Pt is still receiving vanc
   for ?line infection.  Both RIJ & R sub clavian appear erythematous,
   will need to be removed and sent for culture.  Pt has been afebrile,
   CXR without focal infiltrate and steroids stopped on day 2 of
   admission. RUQ ultrasound shows persistent GB wall thickening but no
   other signs of cholecystitis, isolated elevation in Alk phos with
   normal Tbili is less suggestive suggestive of acalculous
   cholecystitis.  UA + WBCs, pending Cx.  D/C's diflucan last night.
   - f/u Blood/Urine Cx & sputum
   - f/[**Location 39**] read of CXR
   - d/c RIJ & dialysis line , send tips for Cx
   - change out foley
   - f/u Urine Cx, hold on empiric Abx
   - continue Vancomycin day [**8-1**] for ?line infection
   - f/u vanc trough given rapid changing renal function
   # Elevated Alk Phos: Pt was transferred due to concern of elev Alk Phos
   and GGT. Etiology still unclear, obstructive cholestasis seems unlikely
   given the repeatedly normal Tbili. Transaminases normal, hepatitis
   serologies negative. Repeated RUQ u/s show thickened GB wall with no
   stones and normal CBD, ascites but no pericholecystic fluid to suggest
   acute cholecystitis. It is unclear if this could be acalculous
   cholecystitis, would suspect that Tbili would also be elevated and pt
   would be less stable. CHF/volume overload can cause isolated Alk phos
   elevation. Fluconazole could also cause cholestatic picture.  Given h/o
   crohns, could have newly developped PSC though more commonly assoc with
   UC.   Alk Phos appears to be trending down from >900 at OSH to 750 here
   to ??? today
   - trend LFTs, Alk Phos, GGT
   - f/u BNP to evaluate for volume overload
   - NPO
   -imaging unlikely to change management
   - if not improving tomorrow would consider liver consult in am & work
   up for PSC including smooth muscle Ab, p-ANCA
   .
   # Resp Failure: Pt was intubated for airway control and has had
   prolonged intubation for unclear reasons.  Volume overload and MS
   likely contributing factors.  Per notes, attempted extubation on [**7-17**]
   but required re-intubation due to persistent hypoxia on BiPAP.
   Portable shows bilateral effusions and initial gas 7.4/48/66.  There is
   likely some component of chronic CO2 retention though no wheezing
   appreciated on exam.  Pt putting out >50cc of [**Month/Year (2) **]/hr, likely having
   post ATN natriuresis.  Chest tube still having some output
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs q6hr
   - daily wake ups
   - wean propofol
   - consider lasix with goal net negative 1-2L/day
   - monitor chest tube output, leave to suction
   - pressure support trial in am
   .
   #. Renal Failure: likely secondary to ATN and rhabdo. Currently
   improving with >50cc/hr of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be post ATN diuresis. Temporary HD
   line in place, but looks erythematous.  The only reason to continue HD
   would be for volume O/L but given auto-diuresis, this is unlikely to be
   a problem.
   - f/u renal HD team consult
   - D/C HD line (does not look clean)
   - avoid nephrotoxins, closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   - f/u urine lytes
   # Diarrhea/H/o Crohns: Pt with recurrent diarrhea that has been C Diff
   negative.  Elev WBC ct could also be related to Crohns flair and
   unclear if pt has been on any mainetenance meds.  Pt had episodes of
   hematochezia at OSH and admission CT showed distal enteritis.
   - f/u repeat C Diff
   - OSH records for Crohn's
   - consider GI consult for colonoscopy in am vs. empiric treatment with
   steroids
   - consider repeat CT scan
   .
   # MS changes: Baseline MS is unclear but was improving at OSH.
   Unresponsiveness here likely due to boluses of sedation in transfer,
   waking up overnight.
   - will wean sedation & monitor
   - consider head CT if no improvement
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was transferred to the ICU from another hospital after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been intubated for airway control. She has several lines and catheters in place, including a multi-lumen line, dialysis catheter, and temporary dialysis line. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has leukocytosis with an unclear etiology. She also has an elevated alkaline phosphatase level, which could be due to various causes such as congestive heart failure, volume overload, or liver dysfunction. The patient's urine culture shows a yeast infection, currently being treated with fluconazole. She has been receiving vancomycin for a possible line infection. The patient's recent blood cultures have been negative. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Line infection: The patient has multiple lines and catheters, increasing the risk of line-related infections. This is being treated with vancomycin.
2. Yeast infection: The patient's urine culture is positive for yeast, indicating a urinary tract yeast infection. This is being treated with fluconazole.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway control and has had"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU due to being found unresponsive with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient has been intubated for airway control and has had prolonged intubation for unclear reasons. She has been diagnosed with leukocytosis, urinary tract infection (UTI), line infection, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient's current condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure, and there is a possibility of prolonged mechanical ventilation or extubation failure.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI), which can lead to further deterioration of renal function or the need for ongoing dialysis.
3. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and line infection, which may require appropriate antibiotic therapy and close monitoring for signs of sepsis.
4. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease and recurrent diarrhea, which could indicate a flare-up of her condition or an alternative diagnosis. Clostridium difficile (C."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F with PMHx of DMII & Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 day adm after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA, resp failure,
   rhadomyolysis and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis.
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Etiology unclear, WBC ct has ranged from 13-30 during
   recent admission, always afebrile, blood Cx neg to date. C Diff
   negative, RIJ line was + beta strep presumably treated with
   vancomycin.  Urine Cx + 100,000 yeast, treated with Fluconazole.  Both
   RIJ & R sub clavian appear erythematous.  CXR without focal infiltrate
   and steroids stopped on day 2 of admission. RUQ ultrasound shows
   persistent GB wall thickening but no other signs of cholecystitis,
   isolated elevation in Alk phos with normal Tbili, now trending down, is
   less suggestive suggestive of acalculous cholecystitis.  UA + WBCs,
   pending Cx.  D/C'd diflucan last night. Foley changed. WBC trending
   down.
   - f/u Blood/Urine Cx & sputum
   - d/c RIJ & dialysis line , send tips for Cx
   - f/u Urine Cx, hold on empiric Abx
   - continue Vancomycin day [**8-1**] for ?line infection
   - f/u vanc trough given rapid changing renal function
   # Elevated Alk Phos: Pt was transferred due to concern of elev Alk Phos
   and GGT. Etiology still unclear, obstructive cholestasis seems unlikely
   given the repeatedly normal Tbili. Transaminases normal, hepatitis
   serologies negative. Repeated RUQ u/s show thickened GB wall with no
   stones and normal CBD, ascites but no pericholecystic fluid to suggest
   acute cholecystitis. It is unclear if this could be acalculous
   cholecystitis, would suspect that Tbili would also be elevated and pt
   would be less stable. CHF/volume overload can cause isolated Alk phos
   elevation. Fluconazole could also cause cholestatic picture.  Given h/o
   crohns, could have newly developped PSC though more commonly assoc with
   UC.   Alk Phos appears to be trending down from >900 at OSH to 750 here
   to 699 today
   - trend LFTs, Alk Phos, GGT
   - NPO
   -imaging unlikely to change management
   - if not improving tomorrow would consider liver consult in am & work
   up for PSC including smooth muscle Ab, p-ANCA
   .
   # Resp Failure: Pt was intubated for airway control and has had
   prolonged intubation for unclear reasons.  Volume overload and MS
   likely contributing factors.  Per notes, attempted extubation on [**7-17**]
   but required re-intubation due to persistent hypoxia on BiPAP.
   Portable shows bilateral effusions and initial gas 7.4/48/66.  There is
   likely some component of chronic CO2 retention though no wheezing
   appreciated on exam.  Pt putting out >50cc of [**Month/Year (2) **]/hr, likely having
   post ATN natriuresis.  Chest tube still having some output .  RSBI this
   AM is 98.
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs q6hr
   - wean propofol, start fentanyl bolus for sedation/pain.  Would like to
   see underlying mental status.
   - Lasix for goal net negative 1-2L/day
   - monitor chest tube output, leave to suction
   - wean to PS, daily SBTs, RSBIs and wake ups
   .
   #. Renal Failure: likely secondary to ATN and rhabdo. Currently
   improving with >50cc/hr of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be post ATN diuresis. Temporary HD
   line in place, but looks erythematous.  The only reason to continue HD
   would be for volume O/L but given auto-diuresis, this is unlikely to be
   a problem.
   - per renal no acute need for HD, they will continue to follow.
   - D/C HD line (from OSH)).
   - avoid nephrotoxins, closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # Diarrhea/H/o Crohns: Pt with recurrent diarrhea that has been C Diff
   negative.  Elev WBC ct could also be related to Crohns flair and
   unclear if pt has been on any mainetenance meds.  Pt had episodes of
   hematochezia at OSH and admission CT showed distal enteritis.
   - f/u repeat C Diff
   - OSH records for Crohn's
   - if continued diarrhea, could consider empiric treatment for Crohns.
   Also would try to find OSH records
   .
   # MS changes: Baseline MS is unclear but was improving at OSH.
   Unresponsiveness here likely due to boluses of sedation in transfer,
   waking up overnight.
   - will wean sedation & monitor
   - consider head CT if no improvement
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   -f/u OSH records

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU due to unresponsiveness and required intubation for airway control. The patient has been diagnosed with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis, and an elevated leukocyte count. She also has an infection in her central venous catheter, as well as a yeast infection in her urine. The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she has bilateral effusions. She has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, insulin, sedatives, and diuretics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's prolonged intubation and hypoxia suggest a risk of respiratory failure. Efforts should be made to wean her off mechanical ventilation and improve oxygenation.
2. Infection: The patient has multiple infections, including a central venous catheter infection and a yeast infection in her urine. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's history of rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure indicates a risk of AKI. Monitoring fluid balance, electrolytes, and kidney function is crucial.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with pancreatitis, DKA, ARF, acute resp failure
   *Resp failure: volume overload and MS the major obstacles
   -Attempt sedation wean and attempt prn bolus sedation
   -Keep negative with diuresis if needed
   -Try change to PSV
   *MS changes: has received significant sedation. Previously functional
   but new baseline (was found down for a long time) unclear
   -Attempt to wean sedation
   *Elevated alkP- appears slightly decreased today, continue to f/u
   *Leukocytosis: levels unchanged. Still on vanc for OSH line infxn. Will
   change lines
   *ARF: renal function has been unchanged. Developing hypokalemia,
   hypertraemia with auto-diuresis-- replete and recheck

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a complex medical history. She has been admitted to the ICU with multiple acute issues including hypothermia, hypotension, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), pancreatitis, rhabdomyolysis (rhabdo), acute renal failure (ARF), and acute respiratory failure. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/54 to 132/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support system.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, and warm skin without rash or jaundice. Her extremities are cool and her abdomen is soft with no bowel sounds present. Neurological examination is not assessable due to sedation.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), glucose, lactic acid, and liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The patient's electrolytes are imbalanced with low potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg++), and elevated phosphorus (PO4) levels. Renal function tests indicate acute renal failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F with PMHx of DMII & Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 day adm after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA, resp failure,
   rhadomyolysis and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis.
   # Resp Failure: Pt was intubated for airway control and has had
   prolonged intubation for unclear reasons.  Volume overload and MS
   likely contributing factors.  Per notes, attempted extubation on [**7-17**]
   but required re-intubation due to persistent hypoxia on BiPAP.  There
   is likely some component of chronic CO2 retention though no wheezing
   appreciated on exam.  Pt. tolerated PS most of yesterday, but is
   difficult to wean from propofol.
   - wean to PS, daily SBTs, RSBIs and wake ups
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs q6hr
   -change to fentanyl and midazolam, wean propofol
   - goal net negative 1-2L/day
   - monitor chest tube output, leave to suction
   #Leukocytosis: Etiology unclear, WBC ct has ranged from 13-30 during
   recent admission, always afebrile, blood Cx neg to date. C Diff
   negative, RIJ line was + beta strep presumably treated with
   vancomycin.  Urine Cx + 100,000 yeast, treated with Fluconazole.  Both
   RIJ & R sub clavian appear erythematous.  CXR without focal infiltrate
   and steroids stopped on day 2 of admission. RUQ ultrasound shows
   persistent GB wall thickening but no other signs of cholecystitis,
   isolated elevation in Alk phos with normal Tbili, now trending down, is
   less suggestive suggestive of acalculous cholecystitis.  UA + WBCs,
   pending Cx.  D/C'd diflucan last night. Foley changed. WBC trending
   down.
   - f/u Blood/Urine Cx & sputum
   - f/u tip cultures
   - last day of Vancomycin- day [**8-31**] for ?line infection
   # Elevated Alk Phos: Pt was transferred due to concern of elev Alk Phos
   and GGT. Etiology still unclear, obstructive cholestasis seems unlikely
   given the repeatedly normal Tbili. Transaminases normal, hepatitis
   serologies negative. Repeated RUQ u/s show thickened GB wall with no
   stones and normal CBD, ascites but no pericholecystic fluid to suggest
   acute cholecystitis. It is unclear if this could be acalculous
   cholecystitis, would suspect that Tbili would also be elevated and pt
   would be less stable. CHF/volume overload can cause isolated Alk phos
   elevation. Fluconazole could also cause cholestatic picture.  Given h/o
   crohns, could have newly developped PSC though more commonly assoc with
   UC.   Alk Phos appears to be trending down from >900 at OSH to 617
   today
   - trend LFTs, Alk Phos, GGT
   - NPO
   -imaging unlikely to change management
   - if trend revereses, would consider liver consult in am & work up for
   PSC including smooth muscle Ab, p-ANCA
   #. Renal Failure: ATN [**12-23**] rhabdo. Currently improving with >100cc/hr of
   UOP, likely post ATN diuresis. HD line d/c'd yesterday (line from OSH)
   as no HD needed in immediate future
   - f/u renal recs
   - avoid nephrotoxins, closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # Diarrhea: Pt with recurrent loose stool that has been C Diff
   negative.  Most likely [**12-23**] crohn's disease.  Pt had episodes of
   hematochezia at OSH and admission CT showed distal enteritis.
   - OSH records for Crohn's
   - if continued diarrhea, could consider empiric treatment for Crohns.
   Particularly if chronic diarrhea causes metabolic alkalosis and a
   compensatory respiratory acidosis.
   # MS changes: Since hospitalization, her new baseline MS is unclear.
   Thought to be improving at OSH.  Unresponsiveness yesterday due to
   boluses of sedation in transfer, waking up overnight.  Agitation off
   propofol is impeding ability to look at baseline MS.
   [**Name14 (STitle) 1402**] wean sedation & monitor
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   -f/u OSH records
   # FEN: hypernatremia
   -started TF yesterday, bolus w/free water given hypernatremia
   - monitor lytes, replete aggressively
   # Access: new central line placed yesterday

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient was intubated for airway control and has had prolonged intubation for unclear reasons. She tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) most of yesterday but is difficult to wean from propofol. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's prolonged intubation suggests a potential complication related to respiratory failure. It is unclear why the patient has been unable to be extubated successfully. 
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count. The etiology is unclear, and there are no signs of infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection and complete blood cultures.
3. Cholecystitis: There is evidence of gallbladder wall thickening on ultrasound, but no other signs of cholecystitis. This could suggest acalculous cholecystitis, especially considering the patient's history of Crohn's disease.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Currently, the renal"

   is likely some component of chronic CO2 retention though no wheezing
   appreciated on exam.  Pt. tolerated PS most of yesterday, but is
   difficult to wean from propofol.
   - wean to PS, daily SBTs, RSBIs and wake ups
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs q6hr
   - how to wean? wean propofol and add ativan or midaz?
   - goal net negative 1-2L/day
   - monitor chest tube output, leave to suction
   #Leukocytosis: Etiology unclear, WBC ct has ranged from 13-30 during
   recent admission, always afebrile, blood Cx neg to date. C Diff
   negative, RIJ line was + beta strep presumably treated with
   vancomycin.  Urine Cx + 100,000 yeast, treated with Fluconazole.  Both
   RIJ & R sub clavian appear erythematous.  CXR without focal infiltrate
   and steroids stopped on day 2 of admission. RUQ ultrasound shows
   persistent GB wall thickening but no other signs of cholecystitis,
   isolated elevation in Alk phos with normal Tbili, now trending down, is
   less suggestive suggestive of acalculous cholecystitis.  UA + WBCs,
   pending Cx.  D/C'd diflucan last night. Foley changed. WBC trending
   down.
   - f/u Blood/Urine Cx & sputum
   - f/u tip cultures
   - last day of Vancomycin- day [**8-31**] for ?line infection
   # Elevated Alk Phos: Pt was transferred due to concern of elev Alk Phos
   and GGT. Etiology still unclear, obstructive cholestasis seems unlikely
   given the repeatedly normal Tbili. Transaminases normal, hepatitis
   serologies negative. Repeated RUQ u/s show thickened GB wall with no
   stones and normal CBD, ascites but no pericholecystic fluid to suggest
   acute cholecystitis. It is unclear if this could be acalculous
   cholecystitis, would suspect that Tbili would also be elevated and pt
   would be less stable. CHF/volume overload can cause isolated Alk phos
   elevation. Fluconazole could also cause cholestatic picture.  Given h/o
   crohns, could have newly developped PSC though more commonly assoc with
   UC.   Alk Phos appears to be trending down from >900 at OSH to ???
   today
   - trend LFTs, Alk Phos, GGT
   - NPO
   -imaging unlikely to change management
   - if not improving tomorrow would consider liver consult in am & work
   up for PSC including smooth muscle Ab, p-ANCA
   #. Renal Failure: ATN [**12-23**] rhabdo. Currently improving with >50cc/hr of
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be post ATN diuresis. HD line d/c'd yesterday (line from OSH)
   as no HD needed in immediate future
   - f/u renal recs
   - avoid nephrotoxins, closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # Diarrhea: Pt with recurrent loose stool that has been C Diff
   negative.  Most likely [**12-23**] crohn's disease.  Pt had episodes of
   hematochezia at OSH and admission CT showed distal enteritis.
   - f/u repeat C Diff
   - OSH records for Crohn's
   - if continued diarrhea, could consider empiric treatment for Crohns.
   # MS changes: Since hospitalization, her new baseline MS is unclear.
   Thought to be improving at OSH.  Unresponsiveness yesterday due to
   boluses of sedation in transfer, waking up overnight.  Agitation off
   propofol is impeding ability to look at baseline MS.
   [**Name14 (STitle) 1402**] wean sedation & monitor

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the hospital due to pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. She has been intubated for airway control and has had prolonged intubation for unclear reasons. The patient tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) yesterday but was unable to be weaned off propofol. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's prolonged intubation and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has elevated white blood cell counts, which could be a sign of infection. However, the etiology of leukocytosis is unclear, as the patient has been afebrile and blood cultures have been negative to date.
3. Cholecystitis: The patient has persistent gallbladder wall thickening on ultrasound, but without other signs of cholecystitis. Isolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) with normal total bilirubin (Tbili) suggests acalculous cholecystitis.
4. Renal Failure: The patient initially presented with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Currently, her renal function is improving, but"

   Assessment and Plan
   A:
   1) Altered Mental Status
   - Review initial presentation to try to gain more insight into reason
   for persistent depressed mental status.
   - Haldol and wean sedation as tolerated
   - Thiamine
   2) Acute Respiratory Failure: Will continue to wean although limiting
   factor is mental status at this point.  See addendum note below for
   details on MS [**Name13 (STitle) 1424**] and plan.  If improved MS, will attempt to
   wean/extubate.
   3) Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology. Follow and monitor fevers. Will
   repeat abd ct scan to rule out any complication from pancreatitis
   4) Acute Renal Failure: Likely secondary to ATN at this point.  Now
   urine output improving and creatinine stable.
   5) Diarrhea: Check C. Dif.
   Addendum: Reviewed initial history and unclear reason for being found
   down though could be related to uncontrolled DM leading to DKA (less
   common given previously non-insuliin dependent) or sepsis-induced
   although no clear source.  Also, given persistent elevated alk phos, GI
   was consulted and raised the possibility of occult cirrhosis.  Thus,
   will give lactulose to see if MS improves.  We have also added thiamine
   to the regimen and will check an MRV/MRI to rule out cerebral sinus
   thrombosis as this is also associated with Chrohn
s disease.  Will also
   give haldol and wean sedation as tolerated.  If mental status does not
   improve with these [**Last Name (LF) 1425**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] consider further evaluation
   including EEG/LP/neuro.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with diabetes mellitus who was found unresponsive and taken to the hospital. She was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and attempted extubation but failed. Despite having a head CT scan that came back normal, the patient still exhibits poor neurologic function. The patient has a history of diabetes and Crohn's disease. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains poorly responsive. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelets, and lactate levels. The patient's mental status is being closely monitored, and she is receiving Haldol and weaning sedation as tolerated. Additional tests and treatments are being considered to determine the underlying cause of her altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged Intubation: The patient's failed extubation attempt indicates a potential complication of prolonged intubation, which can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia, vocal cord damage, and increased risk of infection.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's history of DKA and rhabdomyolysis, there is a possibility of developing ARDS, characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility due to being in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with diabetes mellitus who was found unresponsive on the floor. She was taken to OSH and diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), rhabdomyolysis (rhabdo), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient attempted extubation but failed. A head CT scan showed no abnormalities. The patient has a history of diabetes, Crohn's disease, and an unknown allergy to penicillins and metoprolol. She received various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/51 to 166/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is intubated and ventilated with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The patient's neurological examination reveals poor responsiveness without further assessment. The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.2 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's renal function is improving, and her urine output has increased. The patient is also experiencing diarrhea. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F with PMHx of DMII & Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 day adm after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA, resp failure,
   rhadomyolysis and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis.
   # Resp Failure: Patient was intubated most likely due to airway
   protection and new O2 requirements in the setting of agitation and
   non-possible non-invasive measures. Patient tried to be intubated in
   [**7-17**], but became hypoxic on BiPAP and agitated, so required
   re-inubation for airway protection. Patient still very agitated and
   with high-requirements of sedation medication. Non-responsive to verbal
   stimuli, only to pain. Patient also with chest tube and resolving
   pneumothorax and pleural fluid.
   - Stop Fentanyl/Midazolan
   - Start Propofol for sedation
   - Morphine PRN pain
   - Haldol PRN agitation
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs q6hr
   - goal net negative 1-2L/day
   - monitor chest tube output, leave to suction
   - Contult thoracics for chest tube pull out
   # Leukocytosis: Etiology unclear, WBC ct has ranged from 13-30 during
   recent admission, always afebrile, blood Cx neg to date. C Diff
   negative, RIJ line was + beta strep presumably treated with
   vancomycin.  Urine Cx + 100,000 yeast, treated with Fluconazole.  In
   the setting of [**Last Name (un) 1420**]
s without any current medications and agitated
   patient, it is unclear if this is the cause of the persistent
   leukocytosis.
   -          Consult GI for possible [**Last Name (un) 1420**]

   # Elevated Alk Phos: Pt was transferred for concerned of elevated Alk
   Phos and elevated GGT. Etiology unclear, but there is not a colestatic
   patern. CHF can also increase alk phos. Nicely trending down.
   -          Consult GI for possible PSC in setting of [**Last Name (un) 1420**]

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was transferred from another hospital after a 10-day admission for being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis.

The patient is currently in the ICU with several ongoing medical issues. The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated most likely due to airway protection and new oxygen requirements in the setting of agitation and non-responsive measures. She tried to be intubated on 7/17 but became hypoxic on BiPAP and agitated, requiring re-inubation for airway protection.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F with PMHx of DMII & Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 day adm after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA, resp failure,
   rhadomyolysis and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis.
   # Resp Failure: Patient was intubated most likely due to airway
   protection and new O2 requirements in the setting of agitation and
   non-possible non-invasive measures. Patient tried to be intubated in
   [**7-17**], but became hypoxic on BiPAP and agitated, so required
   re-inubation for airway protection. Patient still very agitated and
   with high-requirements of sedation medication. Non-responsive to verbal
   stimuli
   Pt was intubated for airway control and has had prolonged intubation
   for unclear reasons.  Volume overload and MS [**First Name (Titles) 1418**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1419**]
   factors.  Per notes, attempted extubation on [**7-17**] but required
   re-intubation due to persistent hypoxia on BiPAP.  There is likely some
   component of chronic CO2 retention though no wheezing appreciated on
   exam.  Pt. tolerated PS most of yesterday, but is difficult to wean
   from propofol.
   - wean to PS, daily SBTs, RSBIs and wake ups
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs q6hr
   - change to fentanyl and midazolam, wean propofol
   - goal net negative 1-2L/day
   - monitor chest tube output, leave to suction
   # Leukocytosis: Etiology unclear, WBC ct has ranged from 13-30 during
   recent admission, always afebrile, blood Cx neg to date. C Diff
   negative, RIJ line was + beta strep presumably treated with
   vancomycin.  Urine Cx + 100,000 yeast, treated with Fluconazole.  Both
   RIJ & R sub clavian appear erythematous.  CXR without focal infiltrate
   and steroids stopped on day 2 of admission. RUQ ultrasound shows
   persistent GB wall thickening but no other signs of cholecystitis,
   isolated elevation in Alk phos with normal Tbili, now trending down, is
   less suggestive suggestive of acalculous cholecystitis.  UA + WBCs,
   pending Cx.  D/C'd diflucan last night. Foley changed. WBC trending
   down.
   - f/u Blood/Urine Cx & sputum
   - f/u tip cultures
   - last day of Vancomycin- day [**8-31**] for ?line infection
   # Elevated Alk Phos: Pt was transferred due to concern of elev Alk Phos
   and GGT. Etiology still unclear, obstructive cholestasis seems unlikely
   given the repeatedly normal Tbili. Transaminases normal, hepatitis
   serologies negative. Repeated RUQ u/s show thickened GB wall with no
   stones and normal CBD, ascites but no pericholecystic fluid to suggest
   acute cholecystitis. It is unclear if this could be acalculous
   cholecystitis, would suspect that Tbili would also be elevated and pt
   would be less stable. CHF/volume overload can cause isolated Alk phos
   elevation. Fluconazole could also cause cholestatic picture.  Given h/o
   crohns, could have newly developped PSC though more commonly assoc with
   UC.   Alk Phos appears to be trending down from >900 at OSH to 617
   today
   - trend LFTs, Alk Phos, GGT
   - NPO
   -imaging unlikely to change management
   - if trend revereses, would consider liver consult in am & work up for
   PSC including smooth muscle Ab, p-ANCA
   #. Renal Failure: ATN [**12-23**] rhabdo. Currently improving with >100cc/hr of
   UOP, likely post ATN diuresis. HD line d/c'd yesterday (line from OSH)
   as no HD needed in immediate future
   - f/u renal recs
   - avoid nephrotoxins, closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # Diarrhea: Pt with recurrent loose stool that has been C Diff
   negative.  Most likely [**12-23**] crohn's disease.  Pt had episodes of
   hematochezia at OSH and admission CT showed distal enteritis.
   - OSH records for Crohn's
   - if continued diarrhea, could consider empiric treatment for Crohns.
   Particularly if chronic diarrhea causes metabolic alkalosis and a
   compensatory respiratory acidosis.
   # MS changes: Since hospitalization, her new baseline MS is unclear.
   Thought to be improving at OSH.  Unresponsiveness yesterday due to
   boluses of sedation in transfer, waking up overnight.  Agitation off
   propofol is impeding ability to look at baseline MS.
   [**Name14 (STitle) 1402**] wean sedation & monitor
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   -f/u OSH records
   # FEN: hypernatremia
   -started TF yesterday, bolus w/free water given hypernatremia
   - monitor lytes, replete aggressively

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient has been intubated multiple times due to airway protection and agitation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a volume assist-control mode, set at a tidal volume of 500 mL and respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 94% with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 13-30 during the recent admission. The etiology of leukocytosis is unclear, but it could be related to a central line infection, as the patient had beta-streptococcal bacteremia from a right internal jugular line. The patient also has yeast in her urine, which has been treated with fluconazole. Both the right internal jugular and subclavian lines appear erythematous, but there are no focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. 

The patient has elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, which could be due to volume overload, medication effects, or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), especially considering her"

   CT scan of the abdomen:
   1. Mild thickening of the distal terminal ileal wall and cecum
   compatible with Crohn's disease. No evidence of active inflammation.
   2. Bilateral large consolidations with associated pleural effusions,
   left greater than right, are suspicious for pneumonia. Mild mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy may be reactive. Right chest tube is positioned within
   the
   minor fissure.
   3. Evidence of anasarca and pulmonary edema.
   4. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2 cm above the carina.
   Repositioning by moving the tube approximately 2 cm superiorly is
   suggested.
   5. Mildly distended gallbladder without evidence of gallstones.
   6. Mild intra-abdominal and pelvic ascites. No large intra-abdominal
   fluid collection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with respiratory failure and a high risk of aspiration. The patient has been experiencing nausea after restarting tube feeds, so the feeds were stopped. The patient received free water boluses and had a CT scan of the abdomen, which showed mild thickening of the distal terminal ileal wall and cecum compatible with Crohn's disease. There is no evidence of active inflammation. The patient also has bilateral large consolidations with associated pleural effusions, left greater than right, which are suspicious for pneumonia. Mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy may be reactive. The right chest tube is positioned within the minor fissure. There is evidence of anasarca and pulmonary edema. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2 cm above the carina, and repositioning by moving the tube approximately 2 cm superiorly is suggested. The patient has mildly distended gallbladder without evidence of gallstones and mild intra-abdominal and pelvic ascites. No large intra-abdominal fluid collection is noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure puts him at risk for further deterioration in lung function and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Aspiration: Due to the patient's high risk of aspiration, there is a potential for aspiration pneumonia or chemical pneumonitis if aspirated material enters the lower airways.

   Assessment and Plan
   THIS IS YESTERDAYS PLAN ONLY USED FOR ROUNDS PURPOSES. FINAL PLAN FOR
   TODAY WILL BE POSTED LATER TODAY
   60 y/o F with PMHx of DMII & Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 day adm after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA, resp failure,
   rhadomyolysis and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis.
   # Resp Failure: Patient was intubated most likely due to airway
   protection and new O2 requirements in the setting of agitation and
   non-possible non-invasive measures. Patient tried to be intubated in
   [**7-17**], but became hypoxic on BiPAP and agitated, so required
   re-inubation for airway protection. Patient still very agitated and
   with high-requirements of sedation medication. Non-responsive to verbal
   stimuli, only to pain. Patient also with chest tube and resolving
   pneumothorax and pleural fluid.
   - Stop Fentanyl/Midazolan
   - Start Propofol for sedation
   - Morphine PRN pain
   - Haldol PRN agitation
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs q6hr
   - goal net negative 1-2L/day
   - monitor chest tube output, leave to suction
   - Contult thoracics for chest tube pull out
   # Leukocytosis: Etiology unclear, WBC ct has ranged from 13-30 during
   recent admission, always afebrile, blood Cx neg to date. C Diff
   negative, RIJ line was + beta strep presumably treated with
   vancomycin.  Urine Cx + 100,000 yeast, treated with Fluconazole.  In
   the setting of [**Last Name (un) 1420**]
s without any current medications and agitated
   patient, it is unclear if this is the cause of the persistent
   leukocytosis.
   -          Consult GI for possible [**Last Name (un) 1420**]
s filaire
   -          Review data for past LP and analyze the possibility of one
   if patient not improving
   -          F/u WBC tomorrow
   -          F/u blood and urine cultures
   -          F/u tip culture
   -          Stop vancomycin today
   # Elevated Alk Phos: Pt was transferred for concerned of elevated Alk
   Phos and elevated GGT. Etiology unclear, but there is not a colestatic
   patern. CHF can also increase alk phos. Nicely trending down.
   -          Consult GI for possible PSC in setting of [**Last Name (un) 1420**]
   -          F/u l
   - trend LFTs, Alk Phos, GGT
   - NPO
   -imaging unlikely to change management
   - If patient not adequately responding, then may need CT of abdomen
   #. Renal Failure: Creatinine improved today. Now with >100cc/hr of UOP,
   likely post ATN diuresis.
   - f/u renal recs
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # Diarrhea: Resolved.
   # MS changes: Same as yesterday.
   -will stop fentanyl and start propofol
   - Will give Haldol PRN
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   -f/u OSH records
   # FEN: hypernatremia

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was transferred from another hospital after a 10-day admission for pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis.

Current assessment:
- The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure and is intubated for airway protection.
- She is agitated and requires high sedation medication.
- She is responsive only to pain and not verbal stimuli.
- She has a chest tube and is resolving pneumothorax and pleural fluid.
- Her leukocyte count is elevated, but the cause is unclear.
- Her alkaline phosphatase level is elevated, but the cause is also unclear.
- She has improved renal function, likely post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis.
- She previously had diarrhea, which has resolved.
- She has changes in mental status and is on various medications.
- She has a history of diabetes, which is currently being managed with insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of bilateral large consolidations with associated pleural effusions suggests a possible pneumonia. This can be a complication due to the patient's compromised respiratory status and prolonged immobility.
2. Aspiration: The patient's high risk of aspiration due to impaired airway protection increases the likelihood of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia"

   24 Hour Events:
   Tube feeds restarted yesterday, but patient nauseous. Tube feeds
   stopped.
   Increased free water boluses.
   Pt had D5W @100cc/hr for 5 hours
   CT scan of the abdomen:
   1. Mild thickening of the distal terminal ileal wall and cecum
   compatible with Crohn's disease. No evidence of active inflammation.
   2. Bilateral large consolidations with associated pleural effusions,
   left greater than right, are suspicious for pneumonia. Mild mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy may be reactive. Right chest tube is positioned within
   the
   minor fissure.
   3. Evidence of anasarca and pulmonary edema.
   4. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2 cm above the carina.
   Repositioning by moving the tube approximately 2 cm superiorly is
   suggested.
   5. Mildly distended gallbladder without evidence of gallstones.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F with PMHx of DMII & Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 day adm after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA, resp failure,
   rhadomyolysis and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis.
   # Resp Failure: Patient was intubated most likely due to airway
   protection and new O2 requirements in the setting of agitation and
   non-possible non-invasive measures. Patient tried to be intubated in
   [**7-17**], but became hypoxic on BiPAP and agitated, so required
   re-inubation for airway protection. Pt still very sedated to extubate
   since she received extra propofol boluses for MRI. Chest tube was to
   water seal yesterday. No drainage and no change in CXR. Pleural fluid
   is transudate by Light
s criteria.
   - Decrease Propofol today
   - Morphine PRN pain
   - Haldol PRN agitation
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs q6hr
   - goal net negative 1-2L/day
   - monitor chest tube output, leave to suction
   - Pull chest tube today.
   # Leukocytosis: Improved, now WBC 9.3 from 13.
   # Elevated Alk Phos: GI consulted yesterday and they suggest that
   etiology of elevated enzymes is ischemia after shock. They recommend
   following them. CT of abdomen showed disteded gallblader without stones
   or thickening; mild inflammation of terminal illeus, presence of
   ascities.
   - F/u GI recs
   - trend LFTs, Alk Phos, GGT
   - If patient not adequately responding, then may need CT of abdomen
   #. Renal Failure: Creatinine improved today. Now with >100cc/hr of UOP,
   likely post ATN diuresis.
   - f/u renal recs
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # MS changes: Same as yesterday.
   -will stop fentanyl and start propofol
   - Will give Haldol PRN
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: hypernatremia in the setting of Post-ATN
   -Increase free water boluses per Tube Feed

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the hospital after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient is currently in the ICU and is intubated due to airway protection and new oxygen requirements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilator management are necessary.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: Due to the risk of aspiration, the patient may be susceptible to developing aspiration pneumonia. Adequate positioning and careful feeding practices should be implemented to minimize this risk.
3. Pneumonia: The CT scan shows bilateral large consolidations with associated pleural effusions, which are suspicious for pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on culture and sensitivity results.
4. Pleural Effusion: The patient has pleural effusions, and the fluid is transudate by Light's criteria. Further evaluation and management may be required, including drainage if necessary.
5. Crohn's Disease Flare: Although the CT scan does not show active inflammation, there is mild thickening of the distal terminal ileal wall and cecum compatible with Crohn's disease. Monitoring for signs of a Crohn's flare-up is essential"

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/56 to 169/110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and respiratory support. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of acute respiratory failure, mental status change, elevated alkaline phosphatase, acute renal failure (ATN), and resolved pneumothorax. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, elevated platelet count, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the hospital after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient was intubated due to airway protection and new oxygen requirements during agitation. She received extra propofol boluses for an MRI and is still very sedated to extubate. A chest tube was placed, but no drainage was observed, and there were no changes in the chest X-ray. Pleural fluid is transudate by Light's criteria. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 138/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and sinus rhythm. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure, and sedation is still a concern. There is a plan to decrease propofol and give another trial for extubation.
2. Elevated Alk Phos: The patient has an elevated alkaline phosphatase level, which may be due to ischemic biliary ducts after being down. The trend of Alk phos is nicely trending down.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU due to pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient had an unsuccessful attempt at intubation on July 17th and required re-intubation for airway protection. Currently, she is sedated and unable to be extubated. The chest tube was removed yesterday as there was no drainage and no change in chest X-ray. Pleural fluid is transudate by Light's criteria. The patient's white blood cell count has improved from 13 to 9.3. Elevated alkaline phosphatase levels are likely due to ischemia after shock, and it is recommended to follow them. The patient's creatinine level has improved, indicating possible post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis. The patient's diabetes is being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin. She also has hypernatremia in the setting of post-acute tubular necrosis. The patient has a new central line placed on July 22nd, and her nutritional status is being repleted with fiber at a rate of 50 mL/hour.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure following diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), pancreatitis, and shock. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and metoprolol, and has been receiving various medications including propofol, pantoprazole, hydromorphone, heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, and haloperidol.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 51-108 beats per minute, blood pressure between 106/50-138/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 4,125 mL and output of 3,838 mL, with urine output of 3,688 mL. The respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, and lactic acid. The patient also has a slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) level and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST). Other lab values are within normal ranges."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F with PMHx of DMII & Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 day adm after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA, resp failure,
   rhadomyolysis and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis.
   # Resp Failure: Patient was intubated most likely due to airway
   protection and new O2 requirements in the setting of agitation and
   non-possible non-invasive measures. Patient tried to be intubated in
   [**7-17**], but became hypoxic on BiPAP and agitated, so required
   re-inubation for airway protection. Pt still very sedated to extubate
   since she received extra propofol boluses for MRI. Chest tube was to
   water seal yesterday. No drainage and no change in CXR. Pleural fluid
   is transudate by Light
s criteria.
   - Decrease Propofol today
   - Morphine PRN pain
   - Haldol PRN agitation
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs q6hr
   - goal net negative 1-2L/day
   - monitor chest tube output, leave to suction
   - Pull chest tube today.
   # Leukocytosis: Improved, now WBC 9.3 from 13.
   # Elevated Alk Phos: GI consulted yesterday and they suggest that
   etiology of elevated enzymes is ischemia after shock. They recommend
   following them. CT of abdomen showed disteded gallblader without stones
   or thickening; mild inflammation of terminal illeus, presence of
   ascities.
   - F/u GI recs
   - trend LFTs, Alk Phos, GGT
   - If patient not adequately responding, then may need CT of abdomen
   #. Renal Failure: Creatinine improved today. Now with >100cc/hr of UOP,
   likely post ATN diuresis.
   - f/u renal recs
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # MS changes: Same as yesterday.
   -will stop fentanyl and start propofol
   - Will give Haldol PRN
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: hypernatremia in the setting of Post-ATN
   -Increase free water boluses per Tube Feed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the hospital after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to airway protection and new oxygen requirements in the setting of agitation and non-invasive measures.
- Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has improved from 13 to 9.3.
- Elevated Alk Phos: The patient has elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, which are being monitored. A CT scan of the abdomen showed distended gallbladder without stones or thickening, mild inflammation of the terminal ileum, and presence of ascites.
- Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved, indicating possible post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis.
- MS changes: The patient is experiencing mental status changes, including agitation and non-responsiveness.
- Diabetes: The patient presented with pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with intravenous fluids and insulin. Now being managed with sliding scale and fixed-dose insulin.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is agitation despite receiving Haldol. The patient's chest tube was removed, and an MRI showed normal results. 

The patient has allergies to penicillins, metoprolol, and unknown allergens. The last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin on 07/24/2014 at 08:18 AM.

The patient is currently on several infusions and medications including Hydromorphone (Dilaudid), Morphine sulfate, Pantoprazole (Protonix), Heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and Haloperidol (Haldol).

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.3°F (37.9°C), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/56 mmHg to 147/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-inch tall, 71.3 kg male who was admitted with respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated and sedated. Chest tube removal was performed overnight. An MRI of the brain was normal. The patient continues to be agitated despite receiving haloperidol.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 73 bpm (with a range of 55-108 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 118/56 mmHg to 173/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute (with a range of 12-44 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient has received various medications including hydromorphone, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and haloperidol. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged except for agitation.

The patient's flowsheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, respiratory support, and lab results. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show pH 7.48, PaCO2 35 mmHg, PaO2 224, and HCO3- 27 mEq/L. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 191 mg/dL.

Physical examination findings include the patient being intubated and sedated, with chest tube removal, normal heart sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm and dry extremities. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated blood urea nitrogen levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to be limited by mental status.
Plan: Continue assisted control ventilation and plan for tracheostomy.
2) Low-grade temperature: Check cultures/sputum. If positive, consider bronchoscopy, line change, and empiric antibiotics.
3) Elevated Alk phos: Trending down.
4) Altered Mental Status: LP/EEG results.
5) DM:
6) Acute renal failure/ATN: Resolving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to limited mental status.
2. Infection: The patient's low-grade temperature and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection. If confirmed, it could lead to worsening respiratory status and sepsis.
3. Bleeding: The patient's elevated platelet count and prolonged PTT may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to further renal dysfunction.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may persist or worsen, potentially leading to complications such as pressure ulcers, aspiration pneumonia, or falls."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male admitted to the ICU for septic shock secondary to community-acquired pneumonia. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuations in vital signs and lab results. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient's tracheostomy was performed at 7:30 am, and there were episodes of agitation and unresponsiveness to commands after decreasing propofol infusion. The patient did not respond to morphine and haloperidol, so the propofol infusion was increased.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and culture surveillance is necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. Regular assessment of lower extremities for signs of swelling or pain is important.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical illness and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitors have been initiated for gastric protection.
4. Medication reactions: Given the patient's allergies to penicillins and metoprolol, caution should be exercised when prescribing medications in the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the hospital after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient underwent several procedures including the placement of a tracheostomy, central line, and PICC line. She is currently on mechanical ventilation support and is being managed with propofol for sedation, pain medications, and anxiolytics. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and alkaline phosphatase levels, improved renal function, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still on assisted ventilation support, and there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheostomy-related infections.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia in the setting of post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which requires careful management of fluid balance and electrolytes.
3. Elevated Alk Phos: The patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase level may indicate ischemic biliary ducts or other liver-related issues. Monitoring liver function tests and following gastrointestinal recommendations would be important.
4. Renal Failure: Although the patient's creatinine level has improved, there is still"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the hospital after being found unresponsive with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. She has been in the ICU since then and is currently intubated on assisted control ventilation mode.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be a complication of her underlying conditions such as pancreatitis or due to the recent tracheostomy placement. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a history of rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to elevated potassium levels. This can cause cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of acute renal failure and is currently showing signs of post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis. This may indicate ongoing kidney injury, which requires close monitoring and management.
4. Ischemic Biliary Ducts: The elevated alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) levels suggest potential ischemic biliary ducts. This could be a complication of the patient's recent illness or previous surgeries.

   Total time spent: 35 (patient is critically ill)
","The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of acute respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. They have undergone a tracheostomy and peg tube placement. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and metoprolol, and unknown allergies. They received vancomycin on 07/27/2114 at 10:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/49 mmHg to 196/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on FiO2 of 50%. The patient's weight is 69.2 kg, down from 75 kg at admission.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 3,272 mL and output of 4,250 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 978 mL. Respiratory support includes being on a ventilator in CMV mode with Vt set at 500 mL, RR set at 12, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, PIP at 30 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, platelet count of 248 K/uL, creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL, blood glucose ranging from 135 mg/dL to 191 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including sodium at 27 mEq/L, potassium at 3.5 mEq/L, chloride at 115 mEq/L, bicarbonate at 28.9%, and magnesium at 1.7 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include several conditions. Firstly, acute respiratory failure is likely secondary to impaired neuro status with underlying lung congestion. A tracheostomy has been performed, and the plan is to change to pressure support ventilation and evaluate the patient's ability to wean off the ventilator. Secondly, mental status change is planned to be managed by weaning off propofol and haloperidol. Thirdly, increased alkaline phosphatase is improving. Fourthly, acute renal failure or acute tubular necrosis is also improving, and the plan is to continue monitoring BUN, creatinine, and urine output. Lastly, diabetes mellitus, feeding, access, upper extremity swelling, and other issues are also addressed in the plan.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of respiratory status, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and continued renal dysfunction."

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
   # Resp Failure: Patient had successful trach placed today and continues
   on AC which will be weaned off to PS as tolerated. Still on propofol
   due to agitation yesterday when drip stopped.  Will continue to attempt
   to wean off and also consider trying different pain medications and/or
   anxiolytics. Will continue haldol for now since it may be helping.
   - Decrease Propofol today and give her another trial.
   - Haldol PRN agitation
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs q6hr
   - goal net negative 1-2L/day
   # Elevated Alk Phos:  Most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after
   being down. Following Alk phos, which is trending down.
   - F/u GI recs if any
   - trend LFTs, Alk Phos, GGT
   #. Renal Failure: Creatinine improved today. Now with >100cc/hr of UOP,
   likely post ATN diuresis.
   - f/u renal recs
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # MS changes: LP negative, EEG shows encephalopathic picture
   potentially due to toxic metabolic etiology vs. sedation medications.
   Will continue to wean off propofol while supplemental meds for pain
   and/or anxiety.
   - Haldol PRN
   -continue propofol
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: hypernatremia in the setting of Post-ATN
   -Increase free water boluses per Tube Feed @ 400
   -D51/2NS PRN
   # Access: new central line placed on [**7-22**], PICC placement today. L

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease who was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy placement and continues to receive assisted ventilation (AC) with plans to wean off to pressure support (PS). She is still on propofol due to agitation and will be gradually decreased. Haloperidol is being used for agitation as well. Nebulizations of albuterol and atrovent are given every six hours. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters per day. The patient's alkaline phosphatase levels are elevated, which is likely due to ischemic biliary ducts. Renal function has improved with an increased urine output of over 100 cc/hr, indicating post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis. The patient has a history of diet-controlled diabetes but presented with pancreatitis and DKA. Insulin therapy is being managed with a sliding scale and fixed dose. Hypernatremia is present in the setting of post-ATN. The patient has a new central line placed on [**7-22**], and a PICC line was placed today. There is concern about possible"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
   # Resp Failure: Trach placed yesterday, on CPAP/PSV at 15/5 which will
   be weaned off to PS as tolerated. Will continue to attempt to wean off,
   although some tachypnea and hypoxia on several checks overnight. This
   is likely due to some problems with her trach placement, including
   bleeding/secretions into lung. Also, would continue to ensure negative
   fluid balance to prevent fluid retention in the lungs.
   - wean as tolerated to [**3-26**] on vent, reassess
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs q6hr
   - goal net negative 1-2L/day
   -f/u CXR
   #Fever: likely secondary to pulmonary insult during tracheostomy
   placement. Will follow up with CXR and monitor fever curve. No need to
   restart antibiotics at this point until there is reason to believe she
   is re-infected.
   -CXR
   -monitor fever curve
   -follow WBC
   -f/u cultures
   # Elevated Alk Phos:  Most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after
   being down. Following Alk phos, which is trending down. Also history of
   Crohns disease. However currently patient is denying abdominal pain and
   not having increased or bloody BMs.
   - F/u GI recs if any
   - trend LFTs, Alk Phos, GGT
   #. Renal Failure: Creatinine continues to trend down, and UOP has been
   maintained.
   - f/u renal recs
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # MS changes: Sedation has been decreased and zydis added with good
   resolution of MS changes. She is able to communicate, both attempting
   to vocalize and writing on paper. Today patient was sitting in chair
   with family at bedside which is a significant improvement.
   - continue zydis as needed
   - Haldol PRN for agitation
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: hypernatremia in the setting of Post-ATN improving with free
   water
   -1200cc free water per tube feed
   -replete electrolytes as needed

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the hospital after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy, ultrasound of the upper arm to rule out deep vein thrombosis (negative), removal of a central line, placement of a PICC line, and pancultured for fever. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 101.5°F, heart rate 95 bpm, blood pressure 162/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice in the sclera, regular heart sounds, clear lungs with crackles at the bases while supine, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm and well-perfused extremities, and no rashes. The patient is alert and oriented to place, interactive, and able to respond to questions but is unable to vocalize and attempts to write but is too weak. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes. The patient's respiratory status is being managed with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, and the plan is to wean off the ventilator"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the hospital after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation. She is also receiving propofol for agitation and haloperidol for sedation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure of 162/70 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has shown improvement in her renal function, with an increased urine output of >100cc/hr. Her laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's pain and anxiety are being managed with pain medications and haloperidol as needed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, she is at risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered if necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's recent immobilization and the presence of central lines"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
   # Resp Failure: Trach, on CPAP/PSV at 8/5 which will be weaned off to
   PS as tolerated. This is likely due to some problems with her trach
   placement, including bleeding/secretions into lung. Also, would
   continue to ensure negative fluid balance to prevent fluid retention in
   the lungs. CXR this morning with improved lung volumes and previously
   noted opacities which appear to be improving.
   - wean as tolerated to [**3-26**] on vent, reassess
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   - goal net negative 1-2L/day, if slows down ok to give lasix
   -f/u CXR
   #Fever: Initially thought to be secondary to pulmonary insult during
   tracheostomy placement. However blood cultures taken from her picc line
   grew out GPC in clusters/pairs yesterday. Will follow up with CXR and
   monitor fever curve. No need to restart antibiotics at this point until
   there is reason to believe she is re-infected.
   -CXR
   -monitor fever curve
   -follow WBC
   -f/u cultures
   # Elevated Alk Phos:  Most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after
   being down. Following Alk phos, which is trending down. Also history of
   Crohns disease. However currently patient is denying abdominal pain and
   not having increased or bloody BMs.
   - F/u GI recs if any
   - trend LFTs, Alk Phos, GGT
   #. Renal Failure: Creatinine continues to trend down, and UOP has been
   maintained.
   - f/u renal recs
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # MS changes: Sedation has been decreased and zydis added with good
   resolution of MS changes. She is able to communicate, both attempting
   to vocalize and writing on paper. Today patient was sitting in chair
   with family at bedside which is a significant improvement.
   - continue zydis as needed
   - Haldol PRN for agitation
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: hypernatremia in the setting of Post-ATN improving with free
   water
   -1200cc free water per tube feed
   -replete electrolytes as needed
   -nutrition consult
   -follow Na

- The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease.
- She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 73 bpm (with a range of 50-146 bpm), blood pressure of 143/79 mmHg (with a range of 115/52-161/80 mmHg), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (with a range of 13-36 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.
- The patient has been on a negative fluid balance and has shown improvement in lung volumes on a chest X-ray.
- Blood cultures from the patient's PICC line grew gram-positive cocci in clusters/pairs, suggesting a possible infection.
- The patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase levels are being monitored, and there are no signs of abdominal pain or bloody stools, which may indicate a potential complication related to her Crohn's disease.
- The patient's renal function is improving, with decreasing creatinine levels and maintained urine output.

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
   # Resp Failure: Trach, on CPAP/PSV at 8/5 which will be weaned off to
   PS as tolerated. This is likely due to some problems with her trach
   placement, including bleeding/secretions into lung. Also, would
   continue to ensure negative fluid balance to prevent fluid retention in
   the lungs. CXR this morning with improved lung volumes and previously
   noted opacities which appear to be improving.
   - wean as tolerated to [**3-26**] on vent, reassess
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn only
   - goal net negative 1-2L/day, if slows down ok to give lasix
   -trach collar
   -speech, swallow eval
   #Fever: Initially thought to be secondary to pulmonary insult during
   tracheostomy placement. However blood cultures taken from her picc line
   grew out GPC in clusters/pairs yesterday. Will repeat cultures today
   from PICC and peripheral to evaluate need for restarting vancomycin.
   Also continue to monitor fever trend and WBC. Given improvement in
   respiratory status unlikely this is due to pulmonary etiology.
   -monitor fever curve
   -follow WBC
   -culture PICC and peripheral
   -vanco IV if spikes
   # Elevated Alk Phos:  Most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after
   being down. Following Alk phos, which is trending down. Also history of
   Crohns disease. However currently patient is denying abdominal pain and
   not having increased or bloody BMs.
   - F/u GI recs if any
   - trend alk phos- if begins to plateau will re-consult GI for other
   possible causes and treatments
   #. Renal Failure: Creatinine continues to trend down, and good UOP has
   been maintained. Continue IV fluids as needed but ideally would like to
   keep negative and encourage diuresis.
   - if autodiuresis slows, okay to give lasix as bp tolerates
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # MS changes: Sedation has been decreased and zydis added with good
   resolution of MS changes. She is able to communicate, both attempting
   to vocalize and writing on paper. Today patient was sitting in chair
   with family at bedside which is a significant improvement. Is slowly
   getting stronger and trying to vocalize questions.
   - continue zydis as needed
   - PT/OT evaluation, speech-n-swallow eval
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: hypernatremia in the setting of Post-ATN improving with free
   water
   -continue free water per TF
   -replete electrolytes as needed
   -follow Na

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis.

The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode at 8/5 cmH2O due to respiratory failure, which is likely due to issues with her tracheostomy placement, including bleeding and secretions into the lung. The goal is to wean her off the ventilator as tolerated. She is also receiving Albuterol/Atrovent nebs as needed.

The patient has been experiencing fever, initially thought to be secondary to the pulmonary insult during tracheostomy placement. However, blood cultures from her PICC line grew out Gram-positive cocci in clusters/pairs yesterday. Repeat cultures will be taken today from the PICC and peripheral lines to evaluate the need for restarting vancomycin. The patient's fever trend and white blood cell count will also be monitored.

The patient has elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after being down. Her alkaline phosphatase levels are trending down, and she has a history of Crohn's disease. However, she denies abdominal pain and does not have increased or bloody bowel movements."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the hospital due to pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient underwent a tracheostomy placement yesterday and is currently on CPAP/PSV at 15/5, which will be weaned off to PS as tolerated. There are concerns about the tracheostomy placement, including bleeding and secretions into the lungs. The goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance to prevent fluid retention in the lungs. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to the recent tracheostomy placement. There may be issues with the placement leading to bleeding and secretions entering the lungs, causing hypoxia and further respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary. Weaning off ventilator support as tolerated is recommended.

2. Infection: The patient has a fever, which could be secondary to the pulmonary insult during tracheostomy placement. It is important to monitor the fever curve and perform a chest X-ray to rule out any signs of infection. Cultures should also be followed up to identify any potential sources of infection.

3. Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase (Alk Phos): The"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
    # Resp Failure: Trach, currently on 15/5 FiO2 of 40% (down from 50%).
   This is likely due to some problems with her trach placement, including
   bleeding/secretions into lung. CXR yesterday morning with improved lung
   volumes and previously noted opacities which appear to be improving.
   - wean as tolerated to [**3-26**] on vent with ultimate goal to trach mask
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   - goal net negative 1 liter /day. however nursing concern over giving
   lasix so was held, only out -300 cc yesterday
   -trach collar in place
   -speech, swallow eval consult ordered, will follow-up with results
   #Fever: Initially thought to be secondary to pulmonary insult during
   tracheostomy placement. However blood cultures taken from her picc line
   grew out GPC in clusters/pairs yesterday. Will repeat cultures today
   from PICC and peripheral to evaluate need for restarting vancomycin.
   Also continue to monitor fever trend and WBC. Given improvement in
   respiratory status unlikely this is due to pulmonary etiology.
   - repeat PICC culture tip wound culture pending
   - c. diff negative
   - urine culture from [**7-27**] + yeast,  UA from [**7-27**] with moderate blood,
   trace LE
   - will re-send another UA and Ucx today and follow up
   - blood culture from [**7-29**] still no growth to date
   -monitor fever curve, WBC
   -vanco IV if spikes
   # Elevated Alk Phos:  Most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after
   being down. Following Alk phos, which is trending down. Also history of
   Crohns disease. However currently patient is denying abdominal pain and
   not having increased or bloody BMs.
   - F/u GI recs if any
   - trend alk phos- if begins to plateau will re-consult GI for other
   possible causes and treatments
   #. Renal Failure: Creatinine continues to trend down, and good UOP has
   been maintained. Continue IV fluids as needed but ideally would like to
   keep negative and encourage diuresis.
   - if autodiuresis slows, consider lasix as bp tolerates
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # MS changes: Sedation has been decreased and zydis added with good
   resolution of MS changes. Pt able to communicate, both attempting to
   vocalize and writing on paper. yesterday patient was sitting in chair
   with family at bedside which is a significant improvement. Is slowly
   getting stronger and trying to vocalize questions.
   - continue zydis as needed
   - PT/OT evaluation, speech-n-swallow eval
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: hypernatremia in the setting of Post-ATN improving with free
   water
   -will increase free water boluses, in order to try to normalize sodium
   levels
   -replete electrolytes as needed
   -follow Na
   # Access: PICC* culture, so PICC d/c yesterday, now with peripheral IV
   # PPx: Heparin sc TID, PPI, bowel regimen
   # Code:  FULL
   # Dispo: would begin screening for rehab today if cultures continue to
   be negative and can wean to trach mask only

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of borderline diabetes and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), pancreatitis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place. She has been experiencing episodes of atrial flutter, which have been treated with diltiazem. Her blood pressure remains stable, and she has thick yellow secretions. The patient's PICC line was pulled due to coagulase-negative Staphylococcus infection. She is receiving tube feeds and has been given IV lasix, but the decision to administer it has been held due to concerns about fluid status. The patient's blood cultures are negative, and she is being monitored for potential complications such as fever, elevated alkaline phosphatase, renal failure, and diabetes management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if there are any issues with the tracheostomy placement or if the patient develops another pulmonary infection.
2. Infection: The patient had a previous infection in her PICC line, which was caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. This highlights the possibility of"

   Patient with episodes of atrial flutter that appears to be secondary to
   mucus plugging. Diltiazem drip was started then 1 hour later heart rate
   to 50s in normal sinus rhythm and diltiazem drip was stopped.  Patient
   blood pressure remained stable. This is not associated with chest pain
   or drop in blood pressure. Patient continues to have thick yellow
   secretions. Tube feeds at 40 cc/hr with 250 cc flushes q 4 hours.
   Patient had PICC line from [**7-27**] which was pulled yesterday because blood
   cultures from [**7-27**] grew coag negative staph in [**11-22**] bottles. Goal I/O
   yesterday as per team was -1L, patient was only -300 earlier this
   morning, and was going to give IV lasix, however nursing was concerned
   that patient was dry and also with those thick secretions, so decided
   to hold on it for now. will re-address on rounds this morning.  Patient
   appears to be putting out a lot of urine, so will hold on diuresis at
   this time.

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
    # Resp Failure: Trach, currently on 15/5 FiO2 of 40% (down from 50%).
   This is likely due to some problems with her trach placement, including
   bleeding/secretions into lung.
   - cxr , in comparison with study of [**7-29**], the right subclavian line has
   been removed. Enlargement of cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular
   congestion and bilateral pleural effusions persists.
   - wean as tolerated to [**8-26**] today on vent with ultimate goal to trach
   mask
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   - goal net negative 1 liter /day. however nursing concern over giving
   lasix so was held, only out -300 cc yesterday, especially with concern
   for pulmonary vascular congestion, would like to diuresis if possible
   -trach collar in place
   -speech, swallow eval consult ordered, state that too early for patient
   to be evaluated at this point
   - patient started on levoquin yesterday for increased secretions
   (aspiration pneumonia coverage)
   - will re-check sputum today
    #Fever: Initially thought to be secondary to pulmonary insult during
   tracheostomy placement. However blood cultures taken from her picc line
   grew out GPC in clusters/pairs yesterday. Will repeat cultures today
   from PICC and peripheral to evaluate need for restarting vancomycin.
   Also continue to monitor fever trend and WBC. Given improvement in
   respiratory status unlikely this is due to pulmonary etiology.
   - repeat PICC culture tip wound culture pending
   - c. diff negative
   - urine culture from [**7-27**] + yeast,  UA from [**7-27**] with moderate blood,
   trace LE
   - will re-send another UA and Ucx today and follow up
   - blood culture from [**7-29**] still no growth to date
   -monitor fever curve, WBC
   - started on IV vancomycin yesterday in the setting of one positive
   blood culture, will continue for now
   - consider surveillance cultures tomorrow AM
   # Elevated Alk Phos:  Most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after
   being down. Alk phos elevated has continued to trend down since
   admission. Also history of Crohns disease s/p surgeries in the remote
   past. However currently patient is denying abdominal pain and not
   having increased or bloody BMs.
   - trend alk phos- if begins to plateau will re-consult GI for other
   possible causes and treatments
   #. Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated on admission, continues to trend
   down, now 1.2, and good UOP has been maintained. Ideally would like to
   keep negative and encourage diuresis.
   - if net + > 500 cc, will give lasix, otherwise will leave alone
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
    # MS changes: Sedation has been decreased and zydis added with good
   resolution of MS changes. Pt able to communicate, both attempting to
   vocalize and writing on paper. yesterday patient was sitting in chair
   with family at bedside which is a significant improvement. Is slowly
   getting stronger and trying to vocalize questions.
   - continue zydis as needed
   - PT/OT evaluation, speech-n-swallow eval deferred as above for now
    # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of borderline diabetes and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with DKA, pancreatitis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient has been on various medications including insulin, morphine sulfate, and heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tracheostomy placement has been associated with bleeding and secretions into the lungs, leading to persistent respiratory failure. The goal is to wean her off the ventilator and eventually tracheostomy collar.
2. Fever: The patient initially had a fever thought to be secondary to pulmonary insult during tracheostomy placement. However, blood cultures from the PICC line grew out GPC in clusters/pairs, indicating a possible infection. Further cultures will be repeated to evaluate the need for restarting vancomycin.
3. Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase: The patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase levels are likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after being down. The levels have trended down since admission. Other possible causes such as Crohn's disease will be considered if the trend plateaus.
4. Renal Failure: The patient had elevated creatinine levels on admission, which have now trended down. Good urine output has been maintained. It is important to keep the patient's fluid balance negative"

   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
    # Resp Failure: Trach, currently on 15/5 FiO2 of 40% (down from 50%).
   This is likely due to some problems with her trach placement, including
   bleeding/secretions into lung.
   - cxr
   In comparison with study of [**7-29**], the right subclavian line has been
   removed. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular
   congestion and bilateral pleural effusions persists.
   - wean as tolerated to [**3-26**] on vent with ultimate goal to trach mask
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   - goal net negative 1 liter /day. however nursing concern over giving
   lasix so was held, only out -300 cc yesterday
   -trach collar in place
   -speech, swallow eval consult ordered, will follow-up with results
    #Fever: Initially thought to be secondary to pulmonary insult during
   tracheostomy placement. However blood cultures taken from her picc line
   grew out GPC in clusters/pairs yesterday. Will repeat cultures today
   from PICC and peripheral to evaluate need for restarting vancomycin.
   Also continue to monitor fever trend and WBC. Given improvement in
   respiratory status unlikely this is due to pulmonary etiology.
   - repeat PICC culture tip wound culture pending
   - c. diff negative
   - urine culture from [**7-27**] + yeast,  UA from [**7-27**] with moderate blood,
   trace LE
   - will re-send another UA and Ucx today and follow up
   - blood culture from [**7-29**] still no growth to date
   -monitor fever curve, WBC
   -vanco IV if spikes
   # Elevated Alk Phos:  Most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after
   being down. Following Alk phos, which is trending down. Also history of
   Crohns disease. However currently patient is denying abdominal pain and
   not having increased or bloody BMs.
   - F/u GI recs if any
   - trend alk phos- if begins to plateau will re-consult GI for other
   possible causes and treatments
   #. Renal Failure: Creatinine continues to trend down, and good UOP has
   been maintained. Continue IV fluids as needed but ideally would like to
   keep negative and encourage diuresis.
   - if autodiuresis slows, consider lasix as bp tolerates
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # MS changes: Sedation has been decreased and zydis added with good
   resolution of MS changes. Pt able to communicate, both attempting to
   vocalize and writing on paper. yesterday patient was sitting in chair
   with family at bedside which is a significant improvement. Is slowly
   getting stronger and trying to vocalize questions.
   - continue zydis as needed
   - PT/OT evaluation, speech-n-swallow eval
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: hypernatremia in the setting of Post-ATN improving with free
   water
   -will increase free water boluses, in order to try to normalize sodium
   levels
   -replete electrolytes as needed
   -follow Na

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of borderline diabetes and Crohn's disease. She was transferred from another hospital after a 10-day admission due to being found down with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), pancreatitis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis.

The patient has been experiencing episodes of atrial flutter, which appears to be secondary to mucus plugging. She has been given a diltiazem drip, and her heart rate has stabilized in normal sinus rhythm.

The patient's blood pressure has remained stable without any chest pain or drop in blood pressure. However, she continues to have thick yellow secretions. She has a tracheostomy tube in place and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system inspection reveals mild rhonchi bilaterally.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 105 bpm with a range of 52-171 bpm, blood pressure of 151/130 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with a range of 15-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her weight is currently 66.7 kg, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
    # Resp Failure: Trach, currently on 15/5 FiO2 of 40% (down from 50%).
   This is likely due to some problems with her trach placement, including
   bleeding/secretions into lung. CXR yesterday morning with improved lung
   volumes and previously noted opacities which appear to be improving.
   - wean as tolerated to [**3-26**] on vent with ultimate goal to trach mask
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   - goal net negative 1 liter /day. however nursing concern over giving
   lasix so was held, only out -300 cc yesterday
   -trach collar in place
   -speech, swallow eval consult ordered, will follow-up with results
   #Fever: Initially thought to be secondary to pulmonary insult during
   tracheostomy placement. However blood cultures taken from her picc line
   grew out GPC in clusters/pairs yesterday. Will repeat cultures today
   from PICC and peripheral to evaluate need for restarting vancomycin.
   Also continue to monitor fever trend and WBC. Given improvement in
   respiratory status unlikely this is due to pulmonary etiology.
   - repeat PICC culture tip wound culture pending
   - c. diff negative
   - urine culture from [**7-27**] + yeast,  UA from [**7-27**] with moderate blood,
   trace LE
   - will re-send another UA and Ucx today and follow up
   - blood culture from [**7-29**] still no growth to date
   -monitor fever curve, WBC
   -vanco IV if spikes
   # Elevated Alk Phos:  Most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after
   being down. Following Alk phos, which is trending down. Also history of
   Crohns disease. However currently patient is denying abdominal pain and
   not having increased or bloody BMs.
   - F/u GI recs if any
   - trend alk phos- if begins to plateau will re-consult GI for other
   possible causes and treatments
   #. Renal Failure: Creatinine continues to trend down, and good UOP has
   been maintained. Continue IV fluids as needed but ideally would like to
   keep negative and encourage diuresis.
   - if autodiuresis slows, consider lasix as bp tolerates
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # MS changes: Sedation has been decreased and zydis added with good
   resolution of MS changes. Pt able to communicate, both attempting to
   vocalize and writing on paper. yesterday patient was sitting in chair
   with family at bedside which is a significant improvement. Is slowly
   getting stronger and trying to vocalize questions.
   - continue zydis as needed
   - PT/OT evaluation, speech-n-swallow eval
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: hypernatremia in the setting of Post-ATN improving with free
   water
   -will increase free water boluses, in order to try to normalize sodium
   levels
   -replete electrolytes as needed
   -follow Na
   # Access: PICC* culture, so PICC d/c yesterday, now with peripheral IV
   # PPx: Heparin sc TID, PPI, bowel regimen
   # Code:  FULL
   # Dispo: would begin screening for rehab today if cultures continue to
   be negative and can wean to trach mask only

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of borderline diabetes and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with DKA, pancreatitis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient has been in the ICU for 10 days.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), a heart rate of 105 bpm with episodes of atrial flutter, blood pressure ranging from 151/130 mmHg to 168/130 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV with a set tidal volume of 400 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals a tracheostomy tube in place, EOMI (eyes open to pain and menace), mild rhonchi bilaterally, and positive bowel sounds. Laboratory results show elevated levels of WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, and Glucose. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of borderline diabetes and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with DKA, pancreatitis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis.

24-hour events:
- The patient had episodes of atrial flutter that appeared to occur with bronchospasm. Diltiazem drip was started, which successfully controlled the heart rate.
- The patient's blood pressure remained stable without any chest pain or drop in blood pressure.
- The patient continues to have thick yellow secretions, and tube feeds are being administered at 40 cc/hr with 250 cc flushes every 4 hours.
- The patient had a PICC line from July 27th, which was pulled yesterday due to coag-negative staph infection in both bottles.
- The patient's goal I/O yesterday was -1L, and the team planned to give IV lasix, but nursing was concerned about the patient being dry and having thick secretions, so they decided to hold off on it for now.
- Allergies include penicillins, metoprolol, and an unknown allergy.
- The patient received vancomycin and levofloxacin yesterday.
- Other medications include regular insulin, morphine sulfate, and intermittent dialysis.

Vital signs:
- Temperature: 37.8°C (100°F)
- Heart rate: 105 bpm (52-171 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 151/130 mmHg (136/51-168/130 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (15-32 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 95%
- Weight: 66.7 kg (admission weight: 75 kg)
- Height: 61 inches

Lab results:
- WBC: 9.3 (10.5-10.3-8.2)
- Hct: 28.4% (30.0-30.7-27.3%)
- Plt: 187 (248-293-306)
- Cr: 2.3 (2.1-2.0-1.7)
- TCO2: 27 (26-24)
- Glucose: 170 (211-191-162)
- Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%. The tracheostomy tube placement may have caused some bleeding and secretions into the lung, but the CXR shows improved lung volumes and previously noted opacities that appear to be improving. The goal is to wean off the ventilator and eventually tracheostomy collar.
2. Fever: The patient initially had a fever, which was thought to be secondary to the pulmonary insult during tracheostomy placement. However, blood cultures taken from the PICC line grew out GPC in clusters/pairs. Repeat cultures will be done today to evaluate the need for restarting vancomycin. Monitoring of fever trend and WBC is ongoing.
3. Elevated Alk Phos: The most likely cause is ischemic biliary ducts after being down. The trend in Alk Phos is decreasing, and there is no history of abdominal pain or bloody BMs. Follow-up GI recommendations will be provided if needed.
4. Renal failure: Creatinine continues to trend down, and good urine output has been maintained. IV fluids will be continued as needed, and the goal is to keep the patient negative and encourage diuresis.
5. MS changes: Sedation has been decreased, and zydis has been added with good resolution of MS changes. The patient is able to communicate and vocalize questions.
6. Diabetes: The patient has a history of diet-controlled diabetes and presented with pancreatitis and DKA. She is now being managed with sliding scale and fixed-dose insulin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, fever with gram-positive bacteria in blood culture, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, acute renal failure, and mental status changes. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is being weaned off positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 69-171 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 130/52 to 168/130 mmHg, respiratory rate between 21-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient's recent lab results show a white blood cell count of 9.3-10.5 thousand/mm3, hematocrit of 28.4-30.7%, platelet count of 187-306 thousand/mm3, creatinine level of 1.2-2.3 mg/dL, total CO2 level of 24-27 mEq/L, blood glucose level of 103-211 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits. The patient's overall condition has improved since admission, with resolution of acute renal failure and decreasing levels of alkaline phosphatase. The patient remains on nutritional support, and efforts are being made to wean off mechanical ventilation. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection, and further deterioration in mental status."

   Total time spent: 35 minutes (patient is critically ill)
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple ongoing medical issues. The patient has a tracheostomy in place, is on mechanical ventilation, and requires ongoing respiratory support. There are concerns regarding acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, fever with gram-positive bacteria in the blood, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, and acute renal failure. The patient's mental status has shown improvement. The patient is receiving nutrition through a pulmonary formula, and efforts are being made to wean the patient off positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient has a code status of full code and is currently receiving ICU level care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not managed appropriately.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of pneumonia increases the risk of infection spreading and worsening the patient's respiratory status.
3. Fever with Gram-Positive Bacteria in Blood: The presence of gram-positive bacteria in the blood indicates a possible bloodstream infection. If not managed effectively, this can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
4. Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase: While the alkaline phosphatase levels are decreasing, their initial elevation may indicate liver dysfunction or other underlying conditions. Continued monitoring is necessary to assess any potential complications.
5. Acute Renal Failure: Although the patient's renal function has improved, there is still a risk of renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
    # Resp Failure: Patient did well overnight on [**8-26**] and then [**3-26**] on her
   vent settings. However, became agitated and with SOB after an episode
   of AFl. Tracheostomy in place and clean.
   -Manage Afl (see down)
   -Switch to PS 10/5 and later [**3-26**] if tolerated.
   -ABGs later today
   -[**Month (only) 51**] be able to extubate depending on results
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   -trach collar in place
   -f/u speech, swallow recs
   - Continue Vanc/Levoquin ([**12-29**])
   -F/u cultures
   #Atrial Flutter/Atrial Fibrilation: Patient with multiple episodes with
   fibrilation/flutter with HR in 150s associated with SOB and agitation.
   The precipitants are pneumonia/pulmonary process versus PE. Not likely
   MI, thyrotoxicosis or medications (reviewed) or fluid overload with
   atrial dilation (echo yesterday). CHADS2 of 1+. [**Last Name (un) 1420**]
s exacerbation
   with hypercoagulable state must be considered as well.
   -Start Lovenox weight based
   -LENIs today; if negative PE-CT (will need bicarb/mucomyst)
   -Metoprolol cannot be given due to pulmonary processes; so start
   diltiazem to HR <80s today
    #Fever: Patient now afebrile. The catheter tip has had no growth. [**12-26**]
   bottles with coag negative staph.
   -Continue Vanc/Levoflox for PNA
   -f/u cultures
   -f/u temp curve
   -f/u WBC
   # Elevated Alk Phos:  Most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after
   being down. Alk phos elevated has continued to trend down since
   admission. Also history of Crohns disease s/p surgeries in the remote
   past. However currently patient is denying abdominal pain and not
   having increased or bloody BMs.
   - trend alk phos- if begins to plateau will re-consult GI for other
   possible causes and treatments
   #. Renal Failure: Creatinine now stable at 1.2.
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
    # MS changes: Sedation has been decreased and zydis added with good
   resolution of MS changes. Pt able to communicate, both attempting to
   vocalize and writing on paper. yesterday patient was sitting in chair
   with family at bedside which is a significant improvement. Is slowly
   getting stronger and trying to vocalize questions.
   - continue zydis as needed
   - PT/OT evaluation, speech-n-swallow eval deferred as above for now
    # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: hypernatremia resolved
   -replete electrolytes as needed
   -follow Na
   # Access: peripheral IV
   # PPx: Lovenox weight based full dose, PPI, single bowel regimen
   # Code:  FULL
   # Dispo: When patient off vent may go to rehab.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease who was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient underwent several interventions including tracheostomy, management of atrial flutter/fibrillation, fever, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, and renal failure. The patient's sedation was decreased, and zydis was added with good resolution of mental status changes. The patient is now able to communicate and attempt to vocalize.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had episodes of agitation and shortness of breath after an episode of atrial fibrillation, which may indicate a recurrence of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
2. Atrial Flutter/Fibrillation: The patient experienced multiple episodes of atrial flutter/fibrillation with rapid heart rates associated with shortness of breath and agitation. The precipitants could be pneumonia/pulmonary process or pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox should be initiated, and further evaluation for pulmonary embolism should be done.
3. Fever: Although the patient is currently afebrile, previous episodes of fever occurred, which might suggest an underlying infection. Cultures should be followed up"

   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
    # Resp Failure: Trach, currently on 15/5 FiO2 of 40% (down from 50%).
   This is likely due to some problems with her trach placement, including
   bleeding/secretions into lung.
   - cxr , in comparison with study of [**7-29**], the right subclavian line has
   been removed. Enlargement of cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular
   congestion and bilateral pleural effusions persists.
   - wean as tolerated to [**8-26**] today on vent with ultimate goal to trach
   mask
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   - goal net negative 1 liter /day. however nursing concern over giving
   lasix so was held, only out -300 cc yesterday, especially with concern
   for pulmonary vascular congestion, would like to diuresis if possible
   -trach collar in place
   -speech, swallow eval consult ordered, state that too early for patient
   to be evaluated at this point
   - patient started on levoquin yesterday for increased secretions
   (aspiration pneumonia coverage)
   - will re-check sputum today
    #Fever: Initially thought to be secondary to pulmonary insult during
   tracheostomy placement. However blood cultures taken from her picc line
   grew out GPC in clusters/pairs yesterday. Will repeat cultures today
   from PICC and peripheral to evaluate need for restarting vancomycin.
   Also continue to monitor fever trend and WBC. Given improvement in
   respiratory status unlikely this is due to pulmonary etiology.
   - repeat PICC culture tip wound culture pending
   - c. diff negative
   - urine culture from [**7-27**] + yeast,  UA from [**7-27**] with moderate blood,
   trace LE
   - will re-send another UA and Ucx today and follow up
   - blood culture from [**7-29**] still no growth to date
   -monitor fever curve, WBC
   - started on IV vancomycin yesterday in the setting of one positive
   blood culture, will continue for now
   - consider surveillance cultures tomorrow AM
   # Elevated Alk Phos:  Most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after
   being down. Alk phos elevated has continued to trend down since
   admission. Also history of Crohns disease s/p surgeries in the remote
   past. However currently patient is denying abdominal pain and not
   having increased or bloody BMs.
   - trend alk phos- if begins to plateau will re-consult GI for other
   possible causes and treatments
   #. Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated on admission, continues to trend
   down, now 1.2, and good UOP has been maintained. Ideally would like to
   keep negative and encourage diuresis.
   - if net + > 500 cc, will give lasix, otherwise will leave alone
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
    # MS changes: Sedation has been decreased and zydis added with good
   resolution of MS changes. Pt able to communicate, both attempting to
   vocalize and writing on paper. yesterday patient was sitting in chair
   with family at bedside which is a significant improvement. Is slowly
   getting stronger and trying to vocalize questions.
   - continue zydis as needed
   - PT/OT evaluation, speech-n-swallow eval deferred as above for now
    # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: hypernatremia in the setting of Post-ATN improving with free
   water
   -continue free water boluses, in order to try to normalize sodium
   levels, consider increase in frequency or dose as needed
   -replete electrolytes as needed
   -follow Na
   # Access: PICC* culture, so PICC d/c yesterday, now with peripheral IV
   # PPx: Heparin sc TID, PPI, bowel regimen
   # Code:  FULL
   # Dispo: would begin screening for rehab today if cultures continue to
   be negative and can wean to trach mask only

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube due to respiratory failure. There are concerns about tracheostomy placement-related issues such as bleeding and secretions into the lung. The chest X-ray shows an enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions. The goal is to wean the patient off the ventilator and transition to tracheal suctioning.

2. Fever: The patient has had intermittent fevers, and blood cultures from the PICC line grew Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in clusters/pairs. Repeat cultures will be done to evaluate the need for restarting vancomycin. The source of infection could be related to the PICC line or another site.

3. Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase (Alk Phos): The patient's Alk Phos levels are elevated, which could be due to ischemic biliary ducts following an episode of being down. However, the levels have been trending down since admission. The patient also has a history of Crohn's disease with surgeries in the"

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with rate control using diltiazem, a trend of decreasing alkaline phosphatase levels, resolving acute renal failure, and ongoing tube feeds for nutrition.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia. Monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased production of secretions, and changes in oxygenation parameters will be important.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of blood clots forming in the deep veins of the legs. Prophylactic measures such as heparin sodium infusion are already being given.

3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at higher risk for stress ulcers in the stomach and duodenum. Prophylactic measures such as H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors are being given to prevent this complication.

4. Glycemic control: Maintaining appropriate blood glucose levels is crucial in critically ill patients. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjustment of insulin infusion rates will be necessary.

5. Renal function: Although the patient's acute renal failure appears to be resolving, ongoing monitoring of renal function through laboratory tests is essential to prevent any further deterioration.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter and has experienced recurrences overnight, which have been controlled with diltiazem. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 126/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is awake and alert, with a tracheostomy in place. There are chest tube insertions bilaterally, and the abdomen is soft with no notable tenderness. The cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and the neurological examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and normal platelet count. Other lab values, including electrolytes, liver enzymes, and kidney function tests, are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventil"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
    # Resp Failure: Patient did well overnight on [**8-26**] and then [**3-26**] on her
   vent settings. However, became agitated and with SOB after an episode
   of AFl. Tracheostomy in place and clean.
   -Manage Afl (see down)
   -Switch to PS 10/5 and later [**3-26**] if tolerated.
   -ABGs later today
   -[**Month (only) 51**] be able to extubate depending on results
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   -trach collar in place
   -f/u speech, swallow recs
   - Continue Vanc/Levoquin ([**12-29**])
   -F/u cultures
   #Atrial Flutter/Atrial Fibrilation: Patient with multiple episodes with
   fibrilation/flutter with HR in 150s associated with SOB and agitation.
   The precipitants are pneumonia/pulmonary process versus PE. Not likely
   MI, thyrotoxicosis or medications (reviewed) or fluid overload with
   atrial dilation (echo yesterday). CHADS2 of 1+. [**Last Name (un) 1420**]
s exacerbation
   with hypercoagulable state must be considered as well.
   -Start Lovenox weight based
   -LENIs today; if negative PE-CT (will need bicarb/mucomyst)
   -Metoprolol cannot be given due to pulmonary processes; so start
   diltiazem to HR <80s today
    #Fever: Patient now afebrile. The catheter tip has had no growth. [**12-26**]
   bottles with coag negative staph.
   -Continue Vanc/Levoflox for PNA
   -f/u cultures
   -f/u temp curve
   -f/u WBC
   # Elevated Alk Phos:  Most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after
   being down. Alk phos elevated has continued to trend down since
   admission. Also history of Crohns disease s/p surgeries in the remote
   past. However currently patient is denying abdominal pain and not
   having increased or bloody BMs.
   - trend alk phos- if begins to plateau will re-consult GI for other
   possible causes and treatments
   #. Renal Failure: Creatinine now stable at 1.2.
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
    # MS changes: Sedation has been decreased and zydis added with good
   resolution of MS changes. Pt able to communicate, both attempting to
   vocalize and writing on paper. yesterday patient was sitting in chair
   with family at bedside which is a significant improvement. Is slowly
   getting stronger and trying to vocalize questions.
   - continue zydis as needed
   - PT/OT evaluation, speech-n-swallow eval deferred as above for now
    # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: hypernatremia resolved
   -replete electrolytes as needed
   -follow Na
   # Access: peripheral IV
   # PPx: Lovenox weight based full dose, PPI, single bowel regimen
   # Code:  FULL
   # Dispo: When patient off vent may go to rehab.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, metoprolol, and unknown allergens. He has been receiving various medications including lansoprazole, heparin sodium, enoxaparin, and lorazepam. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2°F (38.4°C), blood pressure ranging from 118/55 to 178/127 mmHg, heart rate between 72-121 bpm, respiratory rate of 18-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at 26 cmH2O. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as abnormalities in kidney function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated WBC and CRP levels suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. Further investigation through blood cultures and antibiotic therapy may be necessary.

2. Kidney dysfunction: The abnormal kidney function"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
    # Resp Failure: Patient continues to have a productive cough, and at
   times the vent tubing comes off her trach. Sputum appears yellowish.
   Written for guaifenecin w/codeine. Also febrile overnight. [**Month (only) 51**] not be a
   candidate for extubation at this point.
   -Continue to attempt to wean if tolerated however in setting of PNA may
   not be possible at this time.
   -follow ABGs
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   -suction prn
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime, add ciprofloxacin
   -F/u cultures
   #Atrial Flutter/Atrial Fibrilation: Patient with multiple episodes with
   fibrilation/flutter with HR in 150s associated with SOB and agitation.
   The precipitants are pneumonia/pulmonary process versus PE. Not likely
   MI, thyrotoxicosis or medications (reviewed) or fluid overload with
   atrial dilation (echo yesterday). CHADS2 of 1+. Crohn
s exacerbation
   with hypercoagulable state must be considered as well.
   -increase diltiazem to 60mg qid
   -continue Lovenox weight based
   -LENIs negative
   -CTA chest r/o PE today s/p mucomyst 2 doses
    #Fever: Patient with several fevers over last few days. Concern for
   aspiration PNA, although CXRs look stable. Increasing cough and sputum
   production. The catheter tip has had no growth. 2/5 bottles with coag
   negative staph. Sputum grew GNRs.
   -Continue Vanc/cefepime, add ciprofloxacin.
   -f/u cultures
   -f/u temp curve
   -f/u WBC
   -CTA chest r/o PE
   # Elevated Alk Phos:  Most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after
   being down. Alk phos elevated has continued to trend down since
   admission. Also history of Crohns disease s/p surgeries in the remote
   past. However currently patient is denying abdominal pain and not
   having increased or bloody BMs.
   - trend alk phos- if begins to plateau will re-consult GI for other
   possible causes and treatments
   #. Renal Failure: Creatinine now stable at 1.2. Patient appears to be
   autodiuresing. Will follow UA and culture but likely post-ATN diuresis.
   -UA, ctx
   -urine lytes, osmol
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
    # MS changes: Sedation has been decreased and zydis added with good
   resolution of MS changes. Pt able to communicate, both attempting to
   vocalize and writing on paper. yesterday patient was sitting in chair
   with family at bedside which is a significant improvement. Is slowly
   getting stronger and trying to vocalize questions.
   - continue zydis as needed
    # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: hypernatremia resolved
   -replete electrolytes as needed
   -follow Na
   # Access: peripheral IV
   # PPx: Lovenox weight based full dose, PPI, single bowel regimen
   # Code:  FULL
   # Dispo: When patient off vent may go to rehab.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis.

The patient continues to have a productive cough, and at times, the vent tubing comes off her tracheostomy tube. Sputum appears yellowish. She is febrile overnight and has been given guaifenesin with codeine. The physician believes that she may not be a candidate for extubation at this point.

The patient has had multiple episodes of atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation with heart rates in the 150s associated with shortness of breath and agitation. The precipitants are pneumonia/pulmonary process versus pulmonary embolism. The physician does not believe it is myocardial infarction, thyrotoxicosis, or medications (which were reviewed), or fluid overload with atrial dilation (echo yesterday). The patient's CHADS2 score is 1+, and she must also be considered for Crohn's exacerbation with hypercoagulable state.

The patient has had several fevers over the last few days, and there is concern for aspiration pneumonia, although chest X-rays look stable. Increasing cough and sputum production have been noted. The catheter tip has had no growth, but"

   fibrilation/flutter with HR in 150s associated with SOB and agitation.
   The precipitants are pneumonia/pulmonary process versus PE. Not likely
   MI, thyrotoxicosis or medications (reviewed) or fluid overload with
   atrial dilation (echo yesterday). CHADS2 of 1+. [**Last Name (un) 1420**]

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Respiratory failure: The patient is on a ventilator due to previous episodes of atrial flutter and shortness of breath. Tracheostomy has been performed and is clean.
- Atrial Flutter/Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has had multiple episodes of atrial flutter/fibrillation with a rapid heart rate, associated with shortness of breath and agitation. The cause is unclear but may be related to pneumonia/pulmonary process or a pulmonary embolism.
- Fever: The patient has had several fevers over the last few days, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia or a catheter-related infection. Sputum culture grew gram-negative rods.
- Elevated Alk Phos: The patient's alkaline phosphatase levels are elevated, which could be due to ischemic biliary ducts or previous surgeries related to Crohn's disease.
- Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.2.
- MS changes: The patient has shown improvement in mental status changes, possibly related to sedation. She is now able to communicate and interact with family members"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU due to pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient continues to have a productive cough, febrile episodes, and intermittent removal of the ventilator tubing from her tracheostomy. Her sputum appears yellowish. She is currently on a combination of antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. 

The patient has experienced multiple episodes of atrial flutter/fibrillation with a heart rate in the 150s, associated with shortness of breath and agitation. The cause is unclear but may be related to pneumonia/pulmonary process, pulmonary embolism (PE), or hypercoagulable state due to Crohn's disease exacerbation. She is being treated with increased doses of diltiazem and continues to receive low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox).

The patient's fever is of concern, especially since the catheter tip has shown no growth and there is evidence of coag-negative staphylococci in two of five bottles. The sputum grew Gram-negative rods (GNRs). The patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase levels are being monitored, and possible causes such"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
    # Resp Failure: Patient continues to have a productive cough, and at
   times the vent tubing comes off her trach. Sputum appears yellowish.
   Written for guaifenecin w/codeine. Also febrile overnight. [**Month (only) 51**] not be a
   candidate for extubation at this point.
   -Continue to attempt to wean if tolerated however in setting of PNA may
   not be possible at this time.
   -follow ABGs
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   -suction prn
   - Continue Vanc/cefepime, add ciprofloxacin
   -F/u cultures
   #Atrial Flutter/Atrial Fibrilation: Patient with multiple episodes with
   fibrilation/flutter with HR in 150s associated with SOB and agitation.
   The precipitants are pneumonia/pulmonary process versus PE. Not likely
   MI, thyrotoxicosis or medications (reviewed) or fluid overload with
   atrial dilation (echo yesterday). CHADS2 of 1+. Crohn
s exacerbation
   with hypercoagulable state must be considered as well.
   -increase diltiazem to 60mg qid
   -continue Lovenox weight based
   -LENIs negative
   -CTA chest r/o PE today s/p mucomyst 2 doses
    #Fever: Patient with several fevers over last few days. Concern for
   aspiration PNA, although CXRs look stable. Increasing cough and sputum
   production. The catheter tip has had no growth. 2/5 bottles with coag
   negative staph. Sputum grew GNRs.
   -Continue Vanc/cefepime, add ciprofloxacin.
   -f/u cultures
   -f/u temp curve
   -f/u WBC
   -CTA chest r/o PE
   # Elevated Alk Phos:  Most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after
   being down. Alk phos elevated has continued to trend down since
   admission. Also history of Crohns disease s/p surgeries in the remote
   past. However currently patient is denying abdominal pain and not
   having increased or bloody BMs.
   - trend alk phos- if begins to plateau will re-consult GI for other
   possible causes and treatments
   #. Renal Failure: Creatinine now stable at 1.2. Patient appears to be
   autodiuresing. Will follow UA and culture but likely post-ATN diuresis.
   -UA, ctx
   -urine lytes, osmol
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
    # MS changes: Sedation has been decreased and zydis added with good
   resolution of MS changes. Pt able to communicate, both attempting to
   vocalize and writing on paper. yesterday patient was sitting in chair
   with family at bedside which is a significant improvement. Is slowly
   getting stronger and trying to vocalize questions.
   - continue zydis as needed
    # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: hypernatremia resolved
   -replete electrolytes as needed
   -follow Na
   # Access: peripheral IV
   # PPx: Lovenox weight based full dose, PPI, single bowel regimen
   # Code:  FULL
   # Dispo: When patient off vent may go to rehab.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient continues to have a productive cough and intermittent removal of the vent tubing from her tracheostomy. She is febrile and has yellowish sputum, indicating a possible pneumonia. The patient also experienced multiple episodes of atrial flutter/fibrillation, which may be due to a pulmonary process or a pulmonary embolism. Her fever could be related to aspiration pneumonia, although chest X-rays appear stable. The patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase levels may be due to ischemic biliary ducts or previous surgeries for Crohn's disease. Her renal function has stabilized, and she is autodiuresing. The patient's mental status changes have improved with the addition of zydis. She is now able to communicate and sit up in a chair.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have a productive cough and removal of the vent tubing, indicating ongoing respiratory issues. She may not be a candidate for extubation at this time.
2. Atrial Flutter/Fibrillation: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of atrial flutter/fibrillation, which can increase the risk of stroke"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Overnight, she spiked a fever to 101..2 and was pan-cultured. Yesterday
   her LENIs (bilaterally) were negative for DVT. Had transient increase
   in HR to the 140s -- unresponsvie to Ativan and suctioning. Dilt PO was
   given at 5:30AM with 10mg IV Dilt push which decreased her HR to the
   100s. BP OK during this episode.
   Yesterday changed Levaquin to Cefepime for extra coverage given
   persistent fevers and secretions.
   Switched to PS 10/5 briefly this morning.
   I/O 3.4 in / 3.4 out. RN noticed increased UOP over last 24 hr.

   Impression: 60yo woman with Crohn's, ? cognitive dysfunction, new A
   flutter, found down on [**7-10**] now with persistent respiratory failure
   requiring trach c/b persistent fevers and increased secretions.
   1) Respiratory failure: Prolonged wean anticipated; she has had
   intermittent difficult with PS trials. Suspect that she has a
   blossoming aspiration pneumonia especially with GNRs in sputum;
   however, her chest x-ray doesn't appear markedly worse. At this point
   given her persistent fevers and increased secretions it may not be
   unreasonable to consider a chest CT. Continue Cefepime and Vanc;
   consider re-adding fluoroquinolone if she continues to spike. Send
   sputums for culture. This could also help us determine the presence or
   absence of a PE given her new A flutter in the setting of S1Q3T3 on
   recent EKDs.
   2) Caridiac: Negative LENIs. TTE without significant abnormal findings.
   New A flutter of unclear etiology; moderately responsive to Dilt 30 PGT
   QID -- increase to 60 PGT QID and follow. Decision to anticoagulate
   long-term will depend on results of CTA. Currently on Lovenox.
   3) Renal: Increased UOP of unclear etiology -- ? auto-diuresing. Not
   actively diuresing with Lasix. Will aim for I/O even. Check UA for spec
   gravity, consider urine / serum osms to assess for DI although this
   clinically appears unlikely.
   4) Neuro: Mental status is much better after d/c'ing her Propofol;

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease, cognitive dysfunction, and recent admission for respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing persistent fevers and increased secretions. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate in the 140s, blood pressure ranging from 110/53 to 178/127 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PPS ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds bilaterally, symmetric chest expansion, and no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologically, she responds appropriately and has normal bowel sounds. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels, as well as abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's imaging studies show persistent bilateral effusions on a recent chest X-ray, and her blood and sputum cultures have grown Gram-negative rods sensitive to vancomycin. The patient's current medications include Cefepime, Vancomycin, Ativan, Diltiazem, Colace, Mucomyst, Lansoprazole, and Free water.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

   HPI:
   Overnight, she spiked a fever to 101..2 and was pan-cultured. Yesterday
   her LENIs (bilaterally) were negative for DVT. Had transient increase
   in HR to the 140s -- unresponsvie to Ativan and suctioning. Dilt PO was
   given at 5:30AM with 10mg IV Dilt push which decreased her HR to the

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which requires tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. The difficulty in weaning off the ventilator suggests a possible blossoming aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by the presence of GNRs (Gram-negative rods) in the sputum. A chest CT scan may be necessary to further evaluate this.

2. Cardiac arrhythmia (Atrial flutter): The patient has developed a new onset of atrial flutter, an irregular heart rhythm. The cause of this arrhythmia is unclear and needs to be investigated further. A cardiac CT angiogram (CTA) will help determine if there is any underlying pulmonary embolism contributing to the development of atrial flutter.

3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's increased urine output of unclear etiology suggests possible renal dysfunction. Further evaluation, including checking urine and serum osmolality, is recommended to assess for diabetes insipidus or other renal issues.

4. Neurological status: The patient's mental status has improved after discontinuing propofol, but it is still necessary to monitor her neurological function closely. Continuing with Zyprexa (antipsychotic medication) on an as-needed basis is advised.

5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has diabetes, and it is essential to maintain good glycemic control. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels and administration of RSS"

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 60yo woman with Crohn's, ? cognitive dysfunction, new A
   flutter, found down on [**7-10**] now with persistent respiratory failure
   requiring trach c/b persistent fevers and increased secretions.
   1) Respiratory failure: Prolonged wean anticipated; she has had
   intermittent difficult with PS trials. Suspect that she has a
   blossoming aspiration pneumonia especially with GNRs in sputum;
   however, her chest x-ray doesn't appear markedly worse. At this point
   given her persistent fevers and increased secretions it may not be
   unreasonable to consider a chest CT. Continue Cefepime and Vanc;
   consider re-adding fluoroquinolone if she continues to spike. Send
   sputums for culture. This could also help us determine the presence or
   absence of a PE given her new A flutter in the setting of S1Q3T3 on
   recent EKDs.
   2) Caridiac: Negative LENIs. TTE without significant abnormal findings.
   New A flutter of unclear etiology; moderately responsive to Dilt 30 PGT
   QID -- increase to 60 PGT QID and follow. Decision to anticoagulate
   long-term will depend on results of CTA. Currently on Lovenox.
   3) Renal: Increased UOP of unclear etiology -- ? auto-diuresing. Not
   actively diuresing with Lasix. Will aim for I/O even. Check UA for spec
   gravity, consider urine / serum osms to assess for DI although this
   clinically appears unlikely.
   4) Neuro: Mental status is much better after d/c'ing her Propofol;
   continue Zyprexa PRN. Follow clinically.
   5) DM: Continue RSSI and NPH, follow sugars.
   6) F/E/N: Follow / replete 'lytes. Continue TFs.
   7) Crohn's: Stable, follow alk phos.
   8) Access: Peripheral. Code: Full. Dispo: [**Hospital Unit Name 1**].

   Attending Addendum: Fellow note (above) reviewed and I agree with
   assessment and plan.  Continue to have difficultly weaning and has
   afib/flutter with new development of an S1Q3T3 pattern on her EKG.
   Also had a fever spike overnight.  On exam, trach in place, lungs
   clear, abd soft.
   1)       Acute Respiratory Failure with difficult weaning
   2)       A. fib/flutter
   3)       Mental status changes
 improved
   Plan: Chest CT scan to evaluate for PE and (if not present) can
   evaluate lung parenchemya.  Continue to wean as tolerated.
   Anti-coagulation will depend on results of CT scan.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease, suspected cognitive dysfunction, new-onset atrial flutter, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers and increased secretions, which may indicate aspiration pneumonia. The chest X-ray does not show significant worsening. 

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure with difficulty weaning, atrial flutter, and potential pulmonary embolism (PE). The plan is to continue with the current antibiotic regimen and consider a chest CT scan to evaluate for PE and assess lung parenchyma. Anticoagulation will depend on the results of the CT scan. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure, development of septicemia due to untreated infection, progression of PE leading to circulatory collapse, and exacerbation of atrial flutter potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias."

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
   # Resp Failure/pneumonia: Patient continues to have a productive cough,
   and at times the vent tubing comes off her trach. Sputum appears
   yellowish. Written for guaifenecin w/codeine. Also persistently. likely
   not yet a candidate to wean off the vent
   -Continue to attempt to wean today lower to [**8-26**]
   - spontaneous breathing trial today with trach mask
   - goal to get off ventilator hopefully tomorrow
   - still with tan, thick secretions
   - added ciprofloxacin to vanc/cefepime yesterday as patient
   persistently febrile, gram negative rods in the sputum concern for
   possible ventilator associated pneumonia (possible pseudomonas)
   - CT chest yesterday with bilateral pleural efffusions without evidence
   of PE
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   -suction prn
   -[**7-30**] sputum cultures > 25 PMNs, 2+ GNR, culture shows oropharyngeal
   flora, sparse gram negative rods
    #Atrial Flutter/Atrial Fibrilation: Patient with multiple episodes
   with fibrilation/flutter with HR in 150s associated with SOB and
   agitation. Initially concern for possible PE, however given negative CT
   this is really no longer a concern. Likelyprecipitants are
   pneumonia/pulmonary process. Not likely MI, thyrotoxicosis or
   medications (reviewed) or fluid overload with atrial dilation (echo
   yesterday). CHADS2 of 1+. Crohn
s exacerbation with hypercoagulable
   state must be considered as well.
   -overnight patient was in normal sinus and then converted to afib
   -diltiazem currently 60mg [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] increase to 90 mg [**First Name3 (LF) **] with holding
   parameters for persistent breakthrough tachycardi
   - given that intermittent afib will start ASA 325 mg PO daily, can d/c
   lovenox as no active PE, does not meet criteria for anti-coagulation
   with coumadin given chads score
   -LENIs negative, CTA chest without evidence of PE
   #Fever: Patient with several fevers over last few days. Concern for
   aspiration PNA, although CXRs look stable. Increasing cough and sputum
   production. The catheter tip has had no growth but there was initially
   2/5 bottles with coag negative staph. Sputum grew GNRs.
   -Continue Vanc/cefepime/ciprofloxacin.
   -f/u cultures
   -f/u temp curve
   -f/u WBC
   -CTA negative for PE
    # Elevated Alk Phos:  Most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after
   being down. Alk phos elevated has continued to trend down since
   admission. Also history of Crohns disease s/p surgeries in the remote
   past. However currently patient is denying abdominal pain and not
   having increased or bloody BMs.
   - trend alk phos- if begins to plateau will re-consult GI for other
   possible causes and treatments
    #. Renal Failure: Creatinine now 1.3. Patient appears to be
   autodiuresing. Will follow UA and culture but likely post-ATN diuresis.
   -UA - small blood, trace protein, 71 RBCs, few bacteria, few yeast
   -urine osm 296
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # MS changes: Sedation has been decreased and zydis added with good
   resolution of MS changes. Pt able to communicate, both attempting to
   vocalize and writing on paper. yesterday patient was sitting in chair
   with family at bedside which is a significant improvement. Is slowly
   getting stronger and trying to vocalize questions.
   - continue zydis as needed
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale, on NPH as well, increased NPH
   to [**5-28**] from [**3-26**] with increased
    # FEN: hypernatremia resolved
   -replete electrolytes as needed
   -follow Na
    # Access: peripheral IV
    # PPx: will d/c lovenox, start heparin 5000 subQ TID, will hold today
   in case of thoracentesis, PPI, bowel regimen

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient's current condition includes persistent fevers, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia, atrial flutter/fibrillation, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. She is still on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's persistent fevers, productive cough, and yellowish sputum indicate the possibility of VAP. The addition of ciprofloxacin to the antibiotic regimen suggests concern for gram-negative rods, possibly Pseudomonas.
2. Atrial flutter/fibrillation: The patient has had multiple episodes of fibrillation/flutter with a heart rate in the 150s, associated with shortness of breath and agitation. This may be related to pneumonia/pulmonary process, and the patient's CHADS2 score is 1+. Crohn's exacerbation with hypercoagulable state must also be considered.
3. Elevated alkaline phosphatase: The patient has an elevated level of alkaline phosphatase, which could be due to ischemic biliary ducts after being down or her history of Crohn's disease with surgeries"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
    # Resp Failure/pneumonia: Patient continues to have a productive
   cough, and at times the vent tubing comes off her trach. Sputum appears
   yellowish. Written for guaifenecin w/codeine. Also persistently. likely
   not yet a candidate to wean off the vent
   -Continue to attempt to wean if tolerated however in setting of PNA may
   not be possible at this time
   - still with tan, thick secretions
   - added ciprofloxacin to vanc/cefepime as patient persistently febrile,
   gram negative rods in the sputum
   - CT chest yesterday with bilateral pleural efffusions
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   -suction prn
   -F/u cultures
   #Atrial Flutter/Atrial Fibrilation: Patient with multiple episodes with
   fibrilation/flutter with HR in 150s associated with SOB and agitation.
   The precipitants are pneumonia/pulmonary process. CTA negative for PE
   so unlikely PE as precipitant. Not likely MI, thyrotoxicosis or
   medications (reviewed) or fluid overload with atrial dilation (echo
   yesterday). CHADS2 of 1+. Crohn
s exacerbation with hypercoagulable
   state must be considered as well.
   -overnight patient was in normal sinus and then converted to afib
   -diltiazem currently 60mg qid, would consider increasing dose as
   patient persistently tachycardic
   -continue Lovenox weight based for anticoagulation
   -LENIs negative, CTA chest without evidence of PE
   #Fever: Patient with several fevers over last few days. Concern for
   aspiration PNA, although CXRs look stable. Increasing cough and sputum
   production. The catheter tip has had no growth. 2/5 bottles with coag
   negative staph. Sputum grew GNRs.
   -Continue Vanc/cefepime/ciprofloxacin.
   -f/u cultures
   -f/u temp curve
   -f/u WBC
   -CTA negative for PE
    # Elevated Alk Phos:  Most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after
   being down. Alk phos elevated has continued to trend down since
   admission. Also history of Crohns disease s/p surgeries in the remote
   past. However currently patient is denying abdominal pain and not
   having increased or bloody BMs.
   - trend alk phos- if begins to plateau will re-consult GI for other
   possible causes and treatments
    #. Renal Failure: Creatinine now 1.3. Patient appears to be
   autodiuresing. Will follow UA and culture but likely post-ATN diuresis.
   -UA - small blood, trace protein, 71 RBCs, few bacteria, few yeast
   -urine osm 296
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # MS changes: Sedation has been decreased and zydis added with good
   resolution of MS changes. Pt able to communicate, both attempting to
   vocalize and writing on paper. yesterday patient was sitting in chair
   with family at bedside which is a significant improvement. Is slowly
   getting stronger and trying to vocalize questions.
   - continue zydis as needed
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale, on NPH as well, increased NPH
   to [**5-28**] from [**3-26**] with increased
    # FEN: hypernatremia resolved
   -replete electrolytes as needed
   -follow Na
    # Access: peripheral IV
    # PPx: Lovenox weight based full dose, will hold today in case of
   thoracentesis PPI, single bowel regimen
    # Code:  FULL
    # Dispo: When patient off vent may go to rehab.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient has shown improvement in her mental status but remains on mechanical ventilation. She is now experiencing persistent fevers, which are likely due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been prescribed antibiotics for coverage against gram-negative rods, and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) has ruled out pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient also has atrial flutter/fibrillation, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) has been performed to evaluate for any precipitating factors. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's persistent fevers and productive cough suggest an ongoing infection in the lungs. It is important to monitor her respiratory status closely and ensure adequate antibiotic coverage.

2. Atrial flutter/fibrillation: The patient has had multiple episodes of atrial flutter/fibrillation with a rapid heart rate. This may be related to the underlying pulmonary process. Close monitoring of the heart rhythm and consideration of antiarrhythmic medications may be necessary.

3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is now at"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of atrial flutter, for which he is receiving treatment. He also has a tracheostomy in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure of 151/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, but there are slight variations in other parameters such as creatinine, potassium, and magnesium.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is being managed with the current ventilator settings. There are plans to decrease the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and potentially try a tracheal shield. A pleurocentesis will be performed to optimize pulmonary status and rule out any underlying infection as a cause.
2) Pneumonia: The patient is being treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. A pleurocentesis will also be performed to further evaluate the condition.
3) Atrial fibrillation/flutter: The patient's arrhythmia will be monitored for recurrence. If it recurs, anti-coagulation may be considered, but for now, it will be"

   Total time spent: 30 minutes (patient is critically ill)
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU. They have been experiencing persistent fevers and are on multiple antibiotics for suspected pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter and is currently being monitored for recurrence. Bilateral pleural effusions have been noted, and a pleurocentesis is planned to optimize pulmonary status and rule out any underlying infection as the cause. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, and decreased oxygen saturation. They are receiving mechanical ventilation and have a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of bilateral pleural effusions suggest a potential risk of worsening respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, the patient's persistent fevers indicate that pneumonia may not be fully controlled. There is a concern for underlying infection causing the pleural effusions.
3. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter, which can increase the risk of clot formation and potential complications like stroke.
4. Pleural Effusions: The presence of bilateral pleural effusions can lead to compromised lung function and potential respiratory distress if"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
   # Resp Failure/pneumonia: Patient continues to have a productive cough,
   and at times the vent tubing comes off her trach. Sputum appears
   yellowish. Written for guaifenecin w/codeine. Could do with trial of
   trach mask and continued weaning.
   -potentially off ventilator today
   - suction as needed
   -repeate CXR
   - continue cipro/vanc/cefepime  as patient persistently febrile, GNR in
   the sputum concern for VAP (? Pseudomonas)
   - pleural tap yesterday
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   -[**7-30**] sputum cultures > 25 PMNs, 2+ GNR, culture shows oropharyngeal
   flora, sparse gram negative rods
    #Atrial Flutter/Atrial Fibrilation: Patient with multiple episodes
   with fibrilation/flutter with HR in 150s associated with SOB and
   agitation. Initially concern for possible PE, however given negative CT
   this is really no longer a concern. Likelyprecipitants are
   pneumonia/pulmonary process. Not likely MI, thyrotoxicosis or
   medications (reviewed) or fluid overload with atrial dilation (echo
   yesterday). CHADS2 of 1+. Crohn
s exacerbation with hypercoagulable
   state must be considered as well.
   -overnight patient was in normal sinus and then converted to afib
   -diltiazem currently 60mg [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] increase to 90 mg [**First Name3 (LF) **] with holding
   parameters for persistent breakthrough tachycardi
   - given that intermittent afib will start ASA 325 mg PO daily, can d/c
   lovenox as no active PE, does not meet criteria for anti-coagulation
   with coumadin given chads score
   -LENIs negative, CTA chest without evidence of PE
   #Fever: Patient with several fevers over last few days. Concern for
   aspiration PNA, although CXRs look stable. Increasing cough and sputum
   production. The catheter tip has had no growth but there was initially
   2/5 bottles with coag negative staph. Sputum grew GNRs.
   -Continue Vanc/cefepime/ciprofloxacin.
   -f/u cultures
   -f/u temp curve
   -f/u WBC
   -CTA negative for PE
    # Elevated Alk Phos:  Most likely due to ischemic biliary ducts after
   being down. Alk phos elevated has continued to trend down since
   admission. Also history of Crohns disease s/p surgeries in the remote
   past. However currently patient is denying abdominal pain and not
   having increased or bloody BMs.
   - trend alk phos- if begins to plateau will re-consult GI for other
   possible causes and treatments
    #. Renal Failure: Creatinine now 1.3. Patient appears to be
   autodiuresing. Will follow UA and culture but likely post-ATN diuresis.
   -UA - small blood, trace protein, 71 RBCs, few bacteria, few yeast
   -urine osm 296
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # MS changes: Sedation has been decreased and zydis added with good
   resolution of MS changes. Pt able to communicate, both attempting to
   vocalize and writing on paper. yesterday patient was sitting in chair
   with family at bedside which is a significant improvement. Is slowly
   getting stronger and trying to vocalize questions.
   - continue zydis as needed
   # Diabetes: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   - continue regular insulin sliding scale, on NPH as well, increased NPH
   to [**5-28**] from [**3-26**] with increased
    # FEN: hypernatremia resolved
   -replete electrolytes as needed
   -follow Na
    # Access: peripheral IV
    # PPx: will d/c lovenox, start heparin 5000 subQ TID, will hold today
   in case of thoracentesis, PPI, bowel regimen
    # Code:  FULL
    # Dispo: When patient off vent may go to rehab.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient continues to have a productive cough and the vent tubing comes off her tracheostomy tube at times. Sputum appears yellowish, and she is currently febrile. The patient also has atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation, fever, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, renal failure, and muscle weakness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's persistent cough, yellowish sputum, and fever suggest a possible pneumonia. The sputum culture showed growth of gram-negative rods, indicating a bacterial infection.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient's sputum culture also grew oropharyngeal flora, raising concerns for VAP, especially with the presence of fever.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a high CHADS2 score, which increases the risk of atrial fibrillation and potential clot formation. Although a CTA chest was negative for PE, it does not completely rule out the possibility"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and agitation. The patient has undergone thoracentesis, blood culture, and urine culture. The patient is allergic to penicillins and metoprolol, with unknown mechanisms of allergy. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including levofloxacin, vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. The patient's vital signs show a high temperature of 102.6°F (39.2°C), heart rate between 66-116 bpm, blood pressure between 50-151/36-99 mmHg, respiratory rate between 19-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 66.7 kg, with a decrease from admission weight of 75 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,589 mL (743 mL PO, 886 mL TF, 1,013 mL IVF) and output of 3,035 mL (2,535 mL urine, 500 mL NG). The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CPAP/PSV, tidal volume of 379 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 100, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 16 cmH2O, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's blood gas analysis shows partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), pH, bicarbonate (HCO3-), base excess (BE), and oxygen saturation (SaO2) values. The patient's laboratory results show white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 4.6 to 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 26.5% to 30.7%, platelet (Plt) count ranging from 283 to 87 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 1.2 to 1.7 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) ranging from 24 to 26 mEq/L, glucose ranging from 103 to 169 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges. The patient is receiving various medications including morphine sulfate, lansoprazole, lorazepam, and ICU medications. The patient's medical and family history are unchanged from admission, except for the addition of a thoracentesis. The patient's review of systems is unchanged except for fever and agitation. The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed in multiple areas including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and others. The patient's disposition is noted as unknown. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever and is receiving multiple antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. The results of the blood culture and urine culture will help identify the specific pathogen causing the infection.
2. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,589 mL and output of 3,035 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 446 mL. This indicates a potential fluid deficit, which may require correction.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and the RSBI value is 100, which suggests a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Monitoring and appropriate care will be necessary to prevent and manage VAP.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and the presence of central venous lines. Prophylaxis measures should be implemented to reduce this risk.
5. Medication reactions or side effects: Considering the patient's allergies to penicillins and metoprolol, there is a potential risk of medication reactions or side effects. Monitoring for any adverse reactions is important.
6. Neurologic complications: The patient's neurologic examination findings"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
   # Resp Failure/pneumonia: Doing well on trach mask this morning s/p
   pleural tap. Fluid is transudative, likely [**12-23**] fluid overload.
   Continues to have some sputum production but improved, will continue
   antibiotics.
   -potentially off ventilator today
   - suction as needed
   -follow CXR
   - continue cipro/vanc/cefepime  as patient persistently febrile, GNR in
   the sputum concern for VAP
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
    #PAF: Patient with multiple episodes with fibrilation/flutter with HR
   in 150s associated with SOB and agitation. Initially concern for
   possible PE, however given negative CT this is really no longer a
   concern. Likelyprecipitants are pneumonia/pulmonary process. Not likely
   MI, thyrotoxicosis or medications (reviewed) or fluid overload with
   atrial dilation (echo yesterday). CHADS2 of 1+. Crohn
s exacerbation
   with hypercoagulable state must be considered as well.
   -overnight patient was in normal sinus
   -diltiazem currently 60mg qid continue to on this dose given patients
   BP is low-normal
   - given that intermittent afib on ASA 325 mg PO daily
   -LENIs negative, CTA chest without evidence of PE
   #Fever: Patient with several fevers over last few days. Concern for
   aspiration PNA, although CXRs look stable. Also consider drug fever vs.
   Crohn
s? Will consult ID and GI to get their input as etiology is
   unclear and we are treating with broad-spec antibiotics for several
   days now. The catheter tip has had no growth but there was initially
   2/5 bottles with coag negative staph. Sputum grew GNRs.
   -Continue Vanc/cefepime/ciprofloxacin for now.
   -f/u cultures
   -f/u temp curve
   -f/u WBC
    # Elevated Alk Phos/Crohn
s disease:  Most likely due to ischemic
   biliary ducts after being down. Alk phos elevated has continued to
   trend down since admission. Also history of Crohns disease s/p
   surgeries in the remote past. However currently patient is denying
   abdominal pain and not having increased or bloody BMs.
   -          trend alk phos
   -          GI consult re: Crohns disease
    #. Renal Failure: Creatinine stable. Patient appears to be
   autodiuresing. Will follow UA and culture but likely post-ATN diuresis.
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # MS changes: Significantly improved. Continue to monitor.
   - continue zydis as needed (fyi olanzapine can cause DKA in diabetics)
   # Diabetes/DKA: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   -          continue regular insulin sliding scale
   -          NPH to [**5-28**]
    # FEN: hypernatremia resolved
   -S&S recs
   -replete electrolytes as needed
   -IVF as needed
    # Access: peripheral IV

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory failure/pneumonia: The patient is doing well on a tracheostomy mask after having a pleural tap. The fluid is transudative, likely due to fluid overload. She continues to produce some sputum but has improved. Antibiotics will be continued, and the possibility of being taken off the ventilator today is being considered.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PAF): The patient had multiple episodes of fibrillation/flutter with a heart rate in the 150s associated with shortness of breath and agitation. Initially, concern for possible pulmonary embolism (PE) was present, but this is no longer a concern since the CT scan came back negative. The likely precipitants are pneumonia/pulmonary process. The patient's CHADS2 score is 1+. Crohn's disease exacerbation with a hypercoagulable state must also be considered. The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm, and diltiazem will continue to be administered at a dose of 60 mg qid. The patient's low-normal blood pressure is also considered"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. They have a history of pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, Crohn's disease, mental status changes, diabetes mellitus, and fib. The patient underwent a thoracentesis yesterday and is now off the ventilator but on a tracheostomy mask. They are experiencing persistent fevers and are on antibiotics for presumed pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.6 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 80/30 to 105/30 mmHg, heart rate of 79 bpm, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, and slightly low hemoglobin and platelet counts. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable as they are still relying on a tracheostomy mask for oxygen support.
2. Persistent Fevers: Despite being on multiple antibiotics, the patient continues to have fevers, indicating a possible ongoing infection or inadequate treatment.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation needs to be monitored and managed to prevent complications such as thromboembolism.
4. Crohn's Disease: The patient's underlying Crohn's disease may require specific management and consideration in the ICU setting.
5. Mental Status Changes: Although improved, the patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient underwent a thoracentesis on the right side of the lung and was successfully weaned off the ventilator. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, which have not resolved despite being on multiple antibiotics. The patient's mental status has improved, and there are no new findings in the physical examination. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 102.6°F, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 105/30 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the tracheostomy mask. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, indicating an ongoing infection. The patient's renal function is normal, with a serum creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, Crohn's disease, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent Infection: The patient's persistent fevers and elevated inflammatory markers suggest an ongoing infection. The presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase in the sputum may explain the lack of response to current antibiotics. Changing the antibiotic regimen to cover for this resistance could be necessary.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient was on mechanical ventilation before being weaned off, there is a risk of developing V"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I reviewed the history and relevant lab data on the patient and
   examined her.  I was physically present with the MICU team for the
   major portions of the services provided. I agree with the note above,
   including the assessment and plan.  I would add and emphasize the
   following:
   With increasing secretions and fever to 101.6F the pt was changed to
   Meopenem to Rx her ESBL Enterbacter.  She tolerated trache mask for a
   number of hrs yesterday but this AM became agitated and in resp
   distress shortly after being put back on trache collar.  Secretions in
   ETT suggestive of pulm edema, pt coughing and uncomfortable.  Hence pt
   put back on vent, started on IV Nitro for htn and sedated and given
   Morphine, all with nice improvement in her comfort.
   On exam this AM: pt in resp distress, coughing I/0 + 500 cc over 24 hr
   Lungs show rhonchi.  Cor
 tachy  Ext- no edema
   Lab: K=3.1  CXR suggest LLL pna;  prior CT shows RLL and LLL pna
s and
   effusions
   Problems:
   1.       Resp failure with persistent vent dependence, in part due to
   agitation and episodic apnea, in part due to enterobacter pna, in part
   due to possible flash pulm edema from likely diastolic chf, and in part
   due to pl effusions from CHF
   2.       P Atrial fib  on aspirin
   3.       CHFwith bilateral transudative effusions
   4.       DM, s/p DKA
   5.       CN Staph line infection, on Vanco
   Plan:
   1.       For now rest for 24 hr on vent with increased PSV and more
   sedation, morphine as needed, and rx with Lasix and rx  for htn and
   tachycardia
   2.       Continue abx above
   3.       Reassess CXR in AM
   4.       KCL repletion
   Rest of plan as above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on the ventilator due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF), thick secretions, and agitation. She was put on a tracheostomy mask but became agitated and required to be placed back on mechanical support.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has had multiple episodes of fibrillation/flutter with a heart rate in the 150s associated with shortness of breath and agitation. Initially, there was concern for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE), but this is no longer a concern. It is likely precipitated by VAP. The patient's CHADS2 score is 1+ and she is on full-dose aspirin.

3. Fever: The patient has had several fevers over the last few days, most likely due to VAP. Other potential causes should also be ruled out. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual who presented to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) after being found down for 10 hours. The patient has had a prolonged intra-hospital course, including a fever of 101.6°F, positive sputum culture for enterobacter, and multiple antibiotic regimens. The patient continues to experience agitation despite being given ativan and zyprexa, and has been restrained. The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins and metoprolol, as well as unknown allergies. The patient is currently on various medications, including lansoprazole, heparin sodium, haloperidol, lorazepam, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. This is particularly concerning due to the positive sputum culture for enterobacter.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which could potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if dislodged.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and the stress of critical illness can increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infection:"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
   # Resp Failure/pneumonia: Doing well on trach mask this morning s/p
   pleural tap. Fluid is transudative, likely [**12-23**] fluid overload.
   Continues to have some sputum production but improved, will continue
   antibiotics.
   -potentially off ventilator today
   - suction as needed
   -follow CXR
   - continue cipro/vanc/cefepime  as patient persistently febrile, GNR in
   the sputum concern for VAP
   - Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
    #PAF: Patient with multiple episodes with fibrilation/flutter with HR
   in 150s associated with SOB and agitation. Initially concern for
   possible PE, however given negative CT this is really no longer a
   concern. Likelyprecipitants are pneumonia/pulmonary process. Not likely
   MI, thyrotoxicosis or medications (reviewed) or fluid overload with
   atrial dilation (echo yesterday). CHADS2 of 1+. Crohn
s exacerbation
   with hypercoagulable state must be considered as well.
   -overnight patient was in normal sinus
   -diltiazem currently 60mg qid continue to on this dose given patients
   BP is low-normal
   - given that intermittent afib on ASA 325 mg PO daily
   -LENIs negative, CTA chest without evidence of PE
   #Fever: Patient with several fevers over last few days. Concern for
   aspiration PNA, although CXRs look stable. Also consider drug fever vs.
   Crohn
s? Will consult ID and GI to get their input as etiology is
   unclear and we are treating with broad-spec antibiotics for several
   days now. The catheter tip has had no growth but there was initially
   2/5 bottles with coag negative staph. Sputum grew GNRs.
   -Continue Vanc/cefepime/ciprofloxacin for now.
   -f/u cultures
   -f/u temp curve
   -f/u WBC
    # Elevated Alk Phos/Crohn
s disease:  Most likely due to ischemic
   biliary ducts after being down. Alk phos elevated has continued to
   trend down since admission. Also history of Crohns disease s/p
   surgeries in the remote past. However currently patient is denying
   abdominal pain and not having increased or bloody BMs.
   -          trend alk phos
   -          GI consult re: Crohns disease
    #. Renal Failure: Creatinine stable. Patient appears to be
   autodiuresing. Will follow UA and culture but likely post-ATN diuresis.
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # MS changes: Significantly improved. Continue to monitor.
   - continue zydis as needed (fyi olanzapine can cause DKA in diabetics)
   # Diabetes/DKA: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   -          continue regular insulin sliding scale
   -          NPH to [**5-28**]
    # FEN: hypernatremia resolved
   -S&S recs
   -replete electrolytes as needed
   -IVF as needed
    # Access: peripheral IV

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure/pneumonia, possible atrial fibrillation (PAF), fever of unknown origin, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels possibly related to Crohn's disease, and renal failure. 

For the respiratory failure/pneumonia, the patient is on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. Antibiotics have been prescribed due to the presence of GNRs in the sputum. 

The PAF is being managed with diltiazem and ASA due to the patient's low-normal blood pressure. The possibility of a pulmonary embolism (PE) has been ruled out with a negative CT scan. 

The fever of unknown origin is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and meropenem, as the sputum grew GNRs and there were initial positive cultures for coag-negative staph from the catheter tip. 

Elevated alkaline phosphatase levels are attributed to ischemic biliary ducts, which is a known complication in patients with"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU due to multiple complications including pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis.

The patient's current condition shows that she is still experiencing respiratory distress, agitation, and combativeness with the ventilator. She has a tracheostomy tube in place. Her vital signs indicate fever, elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose levels, and liver enzymes. Her renal function tests indicate stable creatinine levels but with signs of autodiuresis.

The patient is being treated with multiple medications including antibiotics (Vanc/meropenem), sedatives (propofol), diuretics (IV lasix), and anticoagulants (heparin, ASA). She is also receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and is being monitored for various conditions such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), atrial fibrillation, and hypernatremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and previous history of respiratory failure indicate a risk of further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Diabetic keto"

   # Resp Failure: VAP vs. CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema and AFl.
   Pt has received copious amount of fluids in the ICU. However, we have
   been diurising her slowly. Her CXR is slowly worsening. Right now on
   AC.
   -Treat baseline anxiety (see below)

   #Agitation: Patient has not seen her family in long time and has had a
   very complicated ICU course. She has responded to propofol, but now too
   long and it is not a good alternative. I think we need to address the
   baseline problem and do a good long-term regimen for that.
   -Arrange for her family to come and see her
   -Talk to her frequently about her progression
   -Improve her breathing
   -Morphine PRN
   -Olanzapine switch to standing
   - Psych curbside
   - Wean down propofol
   - Switch her trach to a smaller to be able to put a valve and help her
   talking
   #Flash pulmonary edema: etiology unknown, but may be CHF (despite
   normal Echo 1 week ago) in the setting of AFib. However, etiology
   remains unknown. For now, maximize medical management.
   -Control BP
   -Improve O2 delivery
   -Rate control her with dilt

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I have reviewed the history and relevant labs on the patient and also
   examined her. I was present with MICU team for the key portions of the
   services provided and agree with the note above, including its
   assessment and plans. I would add the following:
   Over the past 24hr she has been sedated and put back on A/C on the
   vent, but had hypotension with propofol.  This AM she is still not as
   comfortable as previously last week and is tearful.
   On exam: Tm=100.7, BP=99/39, Sat=97% on vent.   Lungs show LLL
   bronchial breath sounds.  Alert and writing.  Less rhonchorous and
   coughing less than yesterday.
   Lab:  CXR shows bilat LL infiltrates, with more opacity in the LLL than
   even yesterday.  However WBC normal
   Problems:
   1.       Resp Failure due to pneumonia (LLL and ? RLL) and possibly
   residual pulm edema from yesterday
   2.       Transudative pl effusions
   3.       Flash pulm edema
   4.       Agitation and anxiety
   5.       LLL pneumonia
   6.       RLL infiltrate
pneumonia vs residual CHF
   Plan:
   1.       Change vent to PSV
   2.       Make I/O neg by 1L
   3.       Recheck sputum C&S
   4.       Restart Zyprexa and consider RTC benzo
   5.       Pysch consult to advise on #5
   6.       Follow CXR and wait for improvement before restarting trach
   collar trials again

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient has been experiencing multiple complications since her admission.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Unable to wean off the ventilator due to abnormal liver function tests (LFTs).
2. Agitation and anxiety, possibly due to lack of family visitation and a complicated ICU course.
3. Flash pulmonary edema with an unknown etiology, possibly related to congestive heart failure (CHF) or atrial fibrillation (AFib).
4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), likely precipitated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, possibly due to ischemic biliary ducts.
6. Renal failure with an increase in creatinine levels, possibly related to contrast administration for a pulmonary embolism (PE)-CT.
7. Diabetes/DKA, managed initially with intravenous fluids and insulin, now on sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
8. FEN (Feeding) needs, requiring long-term diet management.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F)
- Blood pressure: 99/39 mmHg
- Heart rate: 78 bpm
- Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on the ventilator

The patient's recent lab results show:
- White blood cell count: 8.2 K/uL
- Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
- Blood glucose: 130 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
- Alkaline phosphatase: 188 IU/L
- Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L

The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, with more opacity in the left lower lobe (LLL).

The plan of care includes:
1. Change the ventilator mode to pressure support ventilation (PSV).
2. Make the fluid balance negative by 1 liter.
3. Recheck sputum culture and sensitivity.
4. Restart Zyprexa and consider reintroducing benzodiazepines for anxiety.
5. Psychiatric consult for agitation and anxiety management.
6. Follow-up chest X-ray and wait for improvement before restarting tracheostomy collar trials.

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of her multiple complications."

","The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and an inability to wean from mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Upon admission, the patient was found to have flash pulmonary edema, agitation, tachypnea, coughing, bronchospasm, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. These symptoms were managed with the administration of ativan, morphine, and nitroglycerin. However, the patient did not respond to an increased frequency of morphine and required an increase in propofol dosage. The patient then responded well to the increase in propofol and was switched back to assist-control ventilation.

The patient's input/output status reveals a negative fluid balance of 1.3 liters since the onset of flash pulmonary edema. Lasix was given to the patient, and the target was changed to negative.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, metoprolol, and an unknown allergy. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were cefepime on 08/02/2114 at 08:11 PM, ciprofloxacin on 08/03/2114 at 04:30 AM, vancomycin on 08/04/2114 at 08:22 AM, and meropenem on 08/05"

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient has been experiencing multiple complications during her ICU stay.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is struggling with both ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a possible exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF). She has received a significant amount of fluids, and her respiratory status has not improved. The presence of thick secretions and agitation when on mechanical ventilation suggests that she may have VAP.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (PAF): The patient has had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with a rapid heart rate in the 150s. Initially, there was concern for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE), but this was ruled out with a negative CT scan. The likely precipitant of the atrial fibrillation is VAP. The patient's CHADS2 score is 1+ due to her history of diabetes.

3. Fever: The patient has had several fevers over the last few days, most likely due to VAP. However, other non-infectious causes should also be considered. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and cultures are pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease who was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis. She has been in the ICU for an extended period and has developed various complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, possibly due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or an exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) with pulmonary edema and atrial fibrillation (Afib). The worsening chest X-ray suggests worsening respiratory status.
2. Agitation: The patient is anxious and agitated, possibly due to prolonged ICU stay, lack of family visitation, and complicated medical course. Propofol has been used to manage agitation, but long-term use is not ideal.
3. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient experienced sudden onset of pulmonary edema, etiology unknown. It may be related to CHF or another underlying cause. Medical management is being maximized to control blood pressure, improve oxygen delivery, and rate control.
4. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF): The patient has multiple episodes of fibrillation/flutter with a rapid heart rate associated with shortness of breath and agitation. The cause is unclear, but"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
   # Resp Failure: VAP vs. CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema and AFl.
   Pt has received copious amount of fluids in the ICU. However, we have
   been diurising her slowly. Her CXR is slowly worsening. Right now on
   AC.
   -Treat baseline anxiety (see below)
   -Continue Vanc/meropenem day [**1-29**]
   -suction as needed
   -follow CXR
   -Sputum culture and gram stain
   -Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   -Morphine PRN
   -IV lasix with target negative balance of 500 today
   #Agitation: Patient has not seen her family in long time and has had a
   very complicated ICU course. She has responded to propofol, but now too
   long and it is not a good alternative. I think we need to address the
   baseline problem and do a good long-term regimen for that.
   -Arrange for her family to come and see her
   -Talk to her frequently about her progression
   -Improve her breathing
   -Morphine PRN
   -Olanzapine switch to standing
   - Psych curbside
   - Wean down propofol
   - Switch her trach to a smaller to be able to put a valve and help her
   talking
   #Flash pulmonary edema: etiology unknown, but may be CHF (despite
   normal Echo 1 week ago) in the setting of AFib. However, etiology
   remains unknown. For now, maximize medical management.
   -Control BP
   -Improve O2 delivery
   -Rate control her with dilt
   -Treat baseline pulmonary problem with antibiotics
    #PAF: Patient with multiple episodes with fibrilation/flutter with HR
   in 150s associated with SOB and agitation. Initially concern for
   possible PE, however given negative CT this is really no longer a
   concern. Likelyprecipitant isVAP. CHADS2 of 1+. Currently on full dose
   ASA.
   -overnight patient was in normal sinus
   -diltiazem currently 60mg qid continue to on this dose given patients
   BP is low-normal
   -given that intermittent afib on ASA 325 mg PO daily
   #Fever: Patient with several fevers over last few days. Most likely
   VAP, but may be active [**Last Name (un) 1420**]
s and must rule out non-infectious causes
   as well. Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now. PICC was
   retreived, but no growth.
   -Continue Vanc/meropenem for now.

   abdominal pain and not having increased or bloody BMs.
   -          trend alk phos
   -          GI consult re: Crohns disease
    #. Renal Failure: Creatinine up from before. [**Month (only) 51**] be in the setting
   after contrast for PE-CT.
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # MS changes: Significantly improved. Continue to monitor.
   - continue zydis as needed (fyi olanzapine can cause DKA in diabetics)
   # Diabetes/DKA: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
   -          continue regular insulin sliding scale
   -          NPH to [**5-28**]

","The patient is a 39-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status and was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to severe agitation and anxiety. The patient's temperature is currently 103.7°F (39.8°C), heart rate is 81 beats per minute, blood pressure is 107/36 mmHg, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99% on 40% FiO2. The patient is still on a tracheostomy tube, and his daily fluid balance is negative 1.4 L. He has been receiving lasix to manage his fluid balance. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and metoprolol. He has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium, lorazepam (Ativan), and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever. His vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, and fluid balance are provided in the flow sheet data.

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
   # Resp Failure: VAP vs. CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema and AFl.
   Pt has received copious amount of fluids in the ICU. However, we have
   been diurising her slowly. Her CXR is slowly worsening. Right now on
   PS.
   -Treat baseline anxiety (see below)
   -Continue meropenem day [**2-27**]\
   - Stop vancomycin
   -suction as needed
   -follow CXR
   -Sputum culture and gram stain negative
   -Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   -Morphine PRN
   #Agitation: Patient has not seen her family in long time and has had a
   very complicated ICU course. She has responded to propofol, but now too
   long and it is not a good alternative. I think we need to address the
   baseline problem and do a good long-term regimen for that. Now off
   propofol on standing olanzapine.
   -Arrange for her family to come and see her
   -Talk to her frequently about her progression
   -F/u psych recs
   -Change trach to smaller, so we can use valve
   -Improve her breathing
   -Continue Olanzapine as standing
   #Fever: Fever overnight of 103. Needs workup. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to wrong
   diagnosis (other infection than VAP), wrong antibiotic (broadly
   covered) or non-infectious cause such as [**Last Name (un) 1420**]
s. Patient without change
   in her bowel habits, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 1420**]
s unlikely. However, other non-infectious
   causes must be ruled out.
   -Continue Vanc/meropenem for now.
   -f/u cultures
   -f/u temp curve
   -f/u WBC
   #PAF: Patient with multiple episodes with fibrilation/flutter with HR
   in 150s associated with SOB and agitation. Initially concern for
   possible PE, however given negative CT this is really no longer a
   concern. Likelyprecipitant isVAP. CHADS2 of 1+. Currently on full dose
   ASA.
   -overnight patient was in normal sinus
   -diltiazem currently 90mg qid continue to on this dose given patients
   BP is low-normal
   -given that intermittent afib on ASA 325 mg PO daily
   # Elevated Alk Phos/Crohn
s disease:  Most likely due to ischemic
   biliary ducts after being down. Alk phos elevated has continued to
   trend down since admission. Also history of Crohns disease s/p
   surgeries in the remote past. However currently patient is denying
   abdominal pain and not having increased or bloody BMs.
   -          trend alk phos
    #. Renal Failure: Creatinine improving.
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # Diabetes/DKA: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin. Patient
   running in high side, may increase AM insulin to 10.
   -          continue regular insulin sliding scale
   -          NPH to [**7-31**]
    # FEN: [**Month (only) 51**] need to address long-term diet on her.
   -S&S recs
   -replete electrolytes as needed
   -IVF as needed
    # Access: peripheral IV
    # PPx: heparin, ASA, PPI, bowel regimen
    # Code:  FULL
    # Dispo: may be c/o to floor once stable on trach while awaiting rehab

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is also experiencing agitation, anxiety, and an elevated temperature of 103.7°F.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin), sedatives (propofol and olanzapine), and diuretics (Lasix). Her vital signs show tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is being weaned off sedation.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactic acid levels. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolytes are within normal range. Imaging studies reveal worsening chest X-ray findings consistent with pulmonary edema.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, anxiety, fever, atrial fibrillation, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels possibly related to Crohn's disease, renal failure, DKA, and malnutrition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia, cardiac arrhythmias, electrolyte imbalances"

   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
   # Resp Failure: VAP vs. CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema and AFl.
   Pt has received copious amount of fluids in the ICU. However, we have
   been diurising her slowly. Her CXR is slowly worsening. Right now on

   -Morphine PRN
   #Agitation: Patient has not seen her family in long time and has had a
   very complicated ICU course. She has responded to propofol, but now too
   long and it is not a good alternative. I think we need to address the
   baseline problem and do a good long-term regimen for that. Now off
   propofol on standing olanzapine.
   -Arrange for her family to come and see her
   -Talk to her frequently about her progression

s. Patient without change
   in her bowel habits, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 1420**]

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring intermittent dialysis.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with worsening chest X-ray. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation with pulmonary edema and atrial fibrillation.
2. Agitation: The patient has not seen her family in a long time and has had a complicated ICU course. She has responded to propofol but is now too long on it. It is suggested to address the baseline problem and find a long-term regimen for anxiety. Olanzapine has been started as standing medication.
3. Fever: The patient had a fever overnight of 103.7 degrees Fahrenheit, which needs further workup. Possible causes include wrong diagnosis (other infection besides VAP), wrong antibiotic (broadly covered), or non-infectious cause.
4. Prolonged Atrial Fibrillation (PAF): The patient experienced multiple episodes of fibrillation/flutter with a heart rate in the 150s associated with shortness of breath and agitation. Initially, there was concern for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who was found unresponsive initially and has since undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She is currently experiencing prolonged ventilator weaning, tachypnea, and recurrent fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Failure--Acute on Chronic: The patient requires ventilatory support, but the source of difficulty needs to be better defined upon discontinuation of positive pressure support. The plan is to move to tracheostomy mask trials as possible, obtain an arterial blood gas (ABG) if worsening is seen, maintain PRN sedation, and allow for a stable regimen.

2) Atrial Flutter: Atrial flutter was seen in the acute setting within the past 24 hours. The plan is to better maintain rate control to allow for prolonged tracheostomy mask trials.

3) Pneumonia: The patient has left basilar consolidation on chest X-ray, indicating pneumonia. She is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem.

4) Fever: The patient has recurrent fever despite antibiotic treatment. Repeat cultures will be done, and alternative sources will be considered. Adequate IV broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage will be maintained.

5) Agitation: The patient is agitated, and olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg has been prescribed. Lorazepam (Ativan) is"

 chest x-ray
   FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**8-5**], there is continued diffuse
   bilateral opacifications consistent with pulmonary edema. Tracheostomy
   tube
   remains in place. Left hemidiaphragm is not well seen, suggesting some
   atelectatic change and effusion in this region.
   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
    # Resp Failure: VAP and likely CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema
   and AFl. Pt has received copious amount of fluids in the ICU. However,
   we have been diurising her slowly. Chest x-ray has continued diffuse
   bilateral opacifications c/w pulmonary edema, with left sided effusion
   and atelectasis. Currently off ventilator on trach mask
   - will continue active diuresis for pleural effusions and pulmonary
   edema
   -Continue meropenem day [**3-29**], no more vanco for now
   -suction as needed
   -follow CXR
   - sputum culture with enterobacter ( see below)
   -Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   -Morphine PRN
   - trach collar to be changed on Friday hopefully so that patient will
   be able to talk with trach in
    #Agitation: Patient has not seen her family in long time and has had a
   very complicated ICU course. She has responded to propofol, but now too
   long and it is not a good alternative. I think we need to address the
   baseline problem and do a good long-term regimen for that. Now off
   propofol on standing olanzapine.
   - psych consult appreciated
   - reccomending d/c wrist restraints as unnecessary and cause patient
   likely to become more agitated
   - limit ativan use (will d/c order now)
   -Talk to her frequently about her progression
   -F/u psych recs
   -Change trach to smaller, so she can talk (requesting it)
   -Improve her breathing
   -Continue Olanzapine as standing
    #Fever: Fever overnight of 102, still unclear etiology. Has had +
   blood culture with coag negative staph and sputum culture with
   enterobacter as below which is sensitive to meropenen which is what
   patient has been getting. Urine has been growing yeast only.  Also
   history of Crohn
s disease. ESR 95 CRP elevated.  Currently no lines or
   hardware. PEG looks okay. Negative blood cultures as above except for
   one coag neg staph which has cleared.   CT chest below. Negative for
   PE. TTE without evidence of active endocarditis. Would also consider
   non-infectious causes such as drug fever.
   - d/c vancomycin yesterday
   - continue meropenem day [**3-29**]

         This organism may develop resistance to third generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore, isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

   biliary ducts after being down. Alk phos elevated has continued to
   trend down since admission. Also history of Crohns disease s/p
   surgeries in the remote past. However currently patient is denying
   abdominal pain and not having increased or bloody BMs.
   - no new LFTs ordered today, will continue to trend
   -  does have loose stools and elevated ESR, CRP and fever
 would
   consider chron
s flare as an etiology, although in the absence of
   abdominal pain, and with only moderate loose stools, however cannot
   exclude
   - would touch base with GI
    #. Renal Failure: Creatinine currently 1.0 appears to have resolved.
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
   # Diabetes/DKA: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin. Patient
   running in high side, may increase AM insulin to 10.
   -          continue regular insulin sliding scale, NPH to [**7-31**], would

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. He was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient has been on invasive ventilation support since August 6th and has had a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. He has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and likely congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation with pulmonary edema. The patient's mental status is agitated, and he has been restrained. The medical team is working to address his agitation, improve his breathing, and manage his diabetes. The patient's renal function appears to have improved, but he still has elevated inflammatory markers. He is also experiencing loose stools and has a history of Crohn's disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's fever and diffuse bilateral opacifications on chest X-ray suggest an ongoing infection. Enterobacter species have been cultured from his respiratory secretions, which are sensitive to meropenem. Monitoring temperature curves and conducting further cultures will be important. ID consult today to follow up on recommendations.
2. Congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation: The patient's pulmonary edema and left-sided effusion indicate fluid overload. Active diures"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
    # Resp Failure: VAP vs. CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema and AFl.
   Pt has received copious amount of fluids in the ICU. However, we have
   been diurising her slowly. Her CXR is slowly worsening. Right now on
   PS.
   -Treat baseline anxiety (see below)
   -Continue meropenem day [**3-29**]
   - vancomycin was d/c
   -suction as needed
   -follow CXR
   -Sputum culture and gram stain negative
   -Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   -Morphine PRN
    #Agitation: Patient has not seen her family in long time and has had a
   very complicated ICU course. She has responded to propofol, but now too
   long and it is not a good alternative. I think we need to address the
   baseline problem and do a good long-term regimen for that. Now off
   propofol on standing olanzapine.
   - psych consult appreciated
   - reccomending d/c wrist restraints as unnecessary and cause patient
   likely to become more agitated
   - limit ativan use (will d/c order now)
   -Talk to her frequently about her progression
   -F/u psych recs
   -Change trach to smaller, so she can talk (requesting it)
   -Improve her breathing
   -Continue Olanzapine as standing
    #Fever: Fever overnight of 103. Needs workup. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to wrong
   diagnosis (other infection than VAP), wrong antibiotic (broadly
   covered) or non-infectious cause such as [**Last Name (un) 1420**]
s. Patient without change
   in her bowel habits, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 1420**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. He was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy and has a fever of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening chest X-ray suggests the possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or an exacerbation of congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema and atrial fibrillation. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotics are necessary.

2. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, which could be due to the prolonged ICU stay and lack of family visits. Addressing baseline anxiety, limiting the use of sedatives such as lorazepam (Ativan), and considering a psychiatric consultation for long-term management are recommended.

3. Fever: The patient had a high fever overnight, which needs further investigation to determine the cause. It could be due to an incorrect diagnosis, wrong antibiotic choice, or a non-infectious cause.

4. Atrial Fibrillation (PAF): The patient has had multiple episodes of flutter with a heart rate in the 150s associated with shortness of breath and agitation. Initially considered as a possible pulmonary embolism, it is now"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo female with chronic ventilatory failure.  She has had some
   improved mental status with medication adjustments made in past 24
   hours.  What remains is some significant need for ongoing ventilatory
   support.  Ongoing issue is recurrent and significant fever noted
   overnight in the absence of significant changes in hemodynamics.
   1)Respiratory Failure-The patient continues to demonstrate good
   pulmonary mechanics and reasonable tolerance of trach mask trials with
   2 hours achieved this morning.  The underlying source of continued
   ventilatory support remains to be defined and this may represent a
   trend to improvement.
   -Continue with trach mask trial
   -Meropenem in place and on day [**3-29**] for VAP
   -Diruesis continuing
   -Ventilatory support at night as needed.
   -Trach downsize suggested as possible plan for Friday
   2)Agitation-
   -Improved with Zyprexa
   -Benzodiazepines have been minimized and this has correlated with
   improvement
   3)Atrial Flutter-Rate remains under reasonable control and patient HR
   has been </=90 bpm this morning
   -Dilt 90mg to continue
   4)Fevers

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with chronic ventilatory failure. She has shown some improvement in mental status with medication adjustments made in the past 24 hours. However, she still requires ongoing ventilatory support due to recurrent and significant fevers overnight. The underlying cause of continued ventilatory support remains unclear.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to demonstrate good pulmonary mechanics and reasonable tolerance of trach mask trials. However, the need for ongoing ventilatory support suggests that respiratory failure may persist. This could be due to an underlying respiratory condition or infection.

2. Agitation: The patient has shown improvement in agitation with the use of Zyprexa. However, benzodiazepines have been minimized, which has correlated with improvement. It is important to monitor the patient's mental status and continue with appropriate medication adjustments.

3. Atrial Flutter: The patient's heart rate remains under reasonable control, and the atrial flutter rate is being managed with medication. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's heart rhythm and adjust medications as necessary.

4. Fevers: The patient has recurrent fevers with an unknown source. Previous infections from the PICC line and sputum culture have been treated, but the current fevers remain unexplained. Further evaluation and follow-up with culture results are needed. Additional imaging may be considered if there is deterioration in clinical parameters.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, with ongoing"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
    # Resp Failure: VAP and likely CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema
   and AFl. Pt has received copious amount of fluids in the ICU. However,
   we have been diurising her slowly. Chest x-ray has continued diffuse
   bilateral opacifications c/w pulmonary edema, with left sided effusion
   and atelectasis. Currently off ventilator on trach mask
   - will continue active diuresis for pleural effusions and pulmonary
   edema
   -Continue meropenem day [**3-29**], no more vanco for now
   -suction as needed
   -follow CXR
   - sputum culture with enterobacter ( see below)
   -Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   -Morphine PRN
   - trach collar to be changed on Friday hopefully so that patient will
   be able to talk with trach in
    #Agitation: Patient has not seen her family in long time and has had a
   very complicated ICU course. She has responded to propofol, but now too
   long and it is not a good alternative. I think we need to address the
   baseline problem and do a good long-term regimen for that. Now off
   propofol on standing olanzapine.
   - switched to haldol yesterday, d/c olanzapine
   - psych consult appreciated
   - reccomending d/c wrist restraints as unnecessary and cause patient
   likely to become more agitated
   - limit ativan use (will d/c order now)
   -Talk to her frequently about her progression
   -F/u psych recs
   -Change trach to smaller, so she can talk (requesting it)
    #Fever: Fever overnight of 102, still unclear etiology. Has had +
   blood culture with coag negative staph and sputum culture with
   enterobacter as below which is sensitive to meropenen which is what
   patient has been getting. Urine has been growing yeast only.  Also
   history of Crohn
s disease. ESR 95 CRP elevated.  Currently no lines or
   hardware. PEG looks okay. Negative blood cultures as above except for
   one coag neg staph which has cleared.   CT chest below. Negative for
   PE. TTE without evidence of active endocarditis. Would also consider
   non-infectious causes such as drug fever.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease who was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient has persistent fever of unclear etiology and is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy. She also has atrial fibrillation and agitation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 129/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 100% FiO2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There are diffuse bilateral opacifications on chest x-ray suggestive of pulmonary edema. Active diuresis is being continued for pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.

2. Agitation: The patient is agitated and has not seen her family in a long time. She has been responding to propofol but now too long and it is not a good alternative. Psychiatric consultation has been appreciated, and the plan is to switch to haldol, remove wrist restraints, limit ativan use, and talk to the patient frequently about her progress.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes and Crohn's disease who was admitted to the ICU with pancreatitis, DKA, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. She is currently experiencing a persistent fever of unclear etiology and has a tracheostomy. The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation with pulmonary edema and atrial fibrillation (AF). She has also shown signs of agitation, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels related to Crohn's disease, and resolving renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VAP: The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia, which is a common complication in patients who are on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and follow-up with sputum cultures.
2. CHF exacerbation: The patient's congestive heart failure may worsen due to fluid overload and pulmonary edema. Diuretics should be continued to manage fluid balance and reduce symptoms.
3. AF: The patient's atrial fibrillation may persist or worsen without appropriate management. It is important to monitor her heart rhythm and consider anticoagulation therapy if necessary.
4. Agitation: The patient has been experiencing agitation, which can be attributed to her complicated ICU course and lack of family visitation. A psychiatric consultation"

   -Nocturnal support as needed only
   2)Fevers-
   -Appreciate ID recommendations
   -She does have abdominal adenopathy noted on CT scan which has
   increased slightly in size
this may be a marker for non-infectious
   source of fever.  If fevers resolve interval follow up would be
   needed.  If fevers or clinical status worsen would have to consider
   further intervention.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute and chronic ventilatory failure. She has shown improvement in tolerance of tracheostomy mask trials, increased weaning attempts, improved alertness, and overall mental status. There have been no significant fevers in the past 24 hours, and the patient has tolerated the tracheostomy mask for over 24 hours straight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient still requires respiratory support, and there is a risk of further complications if weaning attempts are unsuccessful.
2. Fevers: Although significant fevers have not recurred in the past 24 hours, the patient has abdominal adenopathy noted on CT scan, which may be a marker for a non-infectious source of fever. Further evaluation and monitoring are needed.
3. Infection: The patient is on meropenem, an antibiotic, indicating a concern for infection. It is important to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy and consider ID recommendations.
4. Tracheostomy: The patient's tracheostomy may require downsizing to allow for speech and further evaluation is needed in this regard.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU. Prophylactic measures, such as wearing boots, should be continued.

Overall, the patient's condition has shown improvement, but there are still potential medical complications that need to be closely monitored and"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
    # Respiratory failure: VAP, pulmonary edema likely [**12-23**] fluid
   resuscitation on admission and during ICU stay. The patient has
   improved in her respiratory status while on antibiotics, with diuresis.
   CT chest shows atelectasis, some ground-glass opacities and nodules
   within the upper and mid-lung fields and improvement in the bilateral
   pleural effusions. This likely represents pneumonia and resolution of
   infection. Also has moderately enlarged heart on CT which makes
   underlying CHF something that could be exacerbating her pulmonary
   pathology. Underlying lung disease is unlikely given lack of these
   findings on prior chest CT. She has successfully stayed off ventilator
   for >24hr and IP downsized trach today.
   - continue active diuresis for pulmonary edema prn and follow on CXR
   - meropenem day [**4-29**] for enterobacter in sputum on cultures
   -suction, trach mask prn
   - sputum culture with enterobacter
   -Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
    #Agitation: Patient has improved on haldol and olanzapine however she
   continues to be agitated at times during the night. She has expressed
   wishes to see her family which may be causing her agitation however she
   also experiences significant sun-downing. Psychiatry is following and
   recommendations are much appreciated. Will continue to offer support
   and orient patient as needed. At times patient pulls at her lines and
   gets out of bed, which requires restraints. Would benefit from having a
   1:1 sitter however this does not appear to be available in the ICU at
   this time.
   - continue haldol per psych recs
   - will attempt to avoid wrist restraints unless patient is a harm to
   herself
   - continue to orient as needed
   -patient would benefit from 1:1 sitter
   -UA, culture to r/o UTI
    #Fever: Fever overnight of 101.2. Today pt with a significant WBC,It
   is still unclear as to what is causing these fevers. Blood cultures
   with coag negative staph and sputum culture with enterobacter both of
   which were treated with meropenen and vancomycin. Urine has been
   growing yeast.  Also history of Crohn
s disease. (AMA negative, ESR 95,
   CRP elevated).  Currently no lines or hardware other than trach and
   PEG. Pending cultures have been negative thus far.  Last  TTE without
   evidence of active endocarditis. Drug fever at this point is unlikely
   unless it is due to meropenem. CT (as below) shows multiple areas of
   lymphadenopathy, with continuing resolution of her PNA. There is
   possibility that this could be malignancy as cause of fever however per
   radiology this is unlikely given widespread LAD. Would consider biopsy
   of axillary nodes, colonoscopy to r/o active Crohns. CMV negative.
   - continue meropenem day [**5-29**], increased dose as per ID yesterday
   -f/u WBC, fever curve, pending cultures
   - ID, GI recs
   -consider oncology consult once biopsy is done
   - sputum culture GRAM STAIN (Final [**2114-7-31**]):

         ENTEROBACTER ASBURIAE.    SPARSE GROWTH.
            This organism may develop resistance to third generation
            cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore, isolates
   that
            are initially susceptible may become resistant within three to
            four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
   infections,
            repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
   warranted
            if third generation cephalosporins were used.

   Increasing patchy consolidations within the left upper lobe with
   smaller
   nodular and ground glass foci within the right middle and upper lobes,
   concerning for pneumonia.
   2. Marked decrease in bilateral pleural effusions with persistent
   collapse of
   the left lower lobe and significant atelectasis of the right lower
   lobe.
   3. Increasing pericardial effusion.
   4. Increasing size and number of lymph nodes in multiple nodal stations
   since
   [**2114-7-24**], including the axilla, gastrohepatic ligament,
   portacaval
   and retroperitoneal nodal basins. These are most consistent with an
   infectious process, lymphoma seems unlikely.
    #PAF: Patient with multiple episodes with fibrilation/flutter with HR
   in 150s associated with SOB and agitation. CT negative for PE.  Likely
   secondary to VAP. CHADS2 of 1+. Currently on full dose ASA.
   -diltiazem currently 90mg qid, monitor BP
   -given that intermittent afib on ASA 325 mg PO daily
   - next step would be to try digoxin load
    # Elevated Alk Phos/Crohn
s disease:  Most likely due to ischemic
   biliary ducts after being down. Alk phos elevated has continued to
   trend down since admission. Also history of Crohns disease s/p
   surgeries in the remote past. However currently patient is denying
   abdominal pain and not having bloody BMs.
   -LFT trend
   -  does have loose stools and elevated ESR, CRP and fever
 would
   consider chron
s flare as an etiology, although in the absence of
   abdominal pain, and with only moderate loose stools, however cannot
   exclude
   - would touch base with GI regarding thoughts on crohn
s disease
    #. Renal Failure: Creatinine currently 1.0 appears to have resolved.
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - closely monitor I&O and trend BUN/Cr.
    # Diabetes/DKA: Pt with h/o diet controlled DM who presented with
   pancreatitis and DKA, initially managed with IVF & insulin gtt. Now
   being managed with sliding scale and fixed dose insulin. Will increase
   NPH once no longer NPO. Her hyperglycemia was likely d/t zyprexa, now

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis.

The patient's respiratory status has improved while on antibiotics, with diuresis. A CT chest showed atelectasis, ground-glass opacities, and nodules in the upper and mid-lung fields, as well as improvement in bilateral pleural effusions.

Underlying lung disease is unlikely given the lack of these findings on a prior chest CT.

The patient successfully stayed off the ventilator for over 24 hours and had her tracheostomy tube downsized today.

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo F with PMHx of DMII and Crohns who was transferred from OSH after
   10 days admission after being found down with pancreatitis, DKA,
   respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis and ARF requiring intermittent
   dialysis.
    # Respiratory failure: VAP, pulmonary edema likely [**12-23**] fluid
   resuscitation on admission and during ICU stay. The patient has
   improved in her respiratory status while on antibiotics, with diuresis.
   CT chest shows atelectasis, some ground-glass opacities and nodules
   within the upper and mid-lung fields and improvement in the bilateral
   pleural effusions. This likely represents pneumonia and resolution of
   infection. Underlying lung disease is unlikely given lack of these
   findings on prior chest CT. She has successfully stayed off ventilator
   for >24hr and may be able to be downsized on trach today. Currently on
   trach mask.
   - continue active diuresis for pleural effusions and pulmonary edema
   - meropenem day [**4-29**] for enterobacter in sputum on cultures
   -suction, trach mask prn
   - follow CXR
   - sputum culture with enterobacter
   -Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   - trach downsizing today, will contact IP
    #Agitation: Patient has improved on haldol and olanzapine however she
   continues to be agitated at times during the night. She has expressed
   wishes to see her family which may be causing her agitation however she
   also experiences significant sun-downing. Psychiatry is following and
   recommendations are much appreciated. Will continue to offer support
   and orient patient as needed. At times patient pulls at her lines and
   gets out of bed, which requires restraints. Would benefit from having a
   1:1 sitter however this does not appear to be available in the ICU at
   this time.
   - continue haldol per psych recs
   - will attempt to avoid wrist restraints unless patient is a harm to
   herself
   - continue to orient as needed
   -patient would benefit from 1:1 sitter
    #Fever: Fever overnight of 101.2. Today pt with a significant WBC,It
   is still unclear as to what is causing these fevers. Blood cultures
   with coag negative staph and sputum culture with enterobacter both of
   which were treated with meropenen and vancomycin. Urine has been
   growing yeast.  Also history of Crohn
s disease. (AMA negative, ESR 95,
   CRP elevated).  Currently no lines or hardware other than trach and
   PEG. Pending cultures have been negative thus far.  Last  TTE without
   evidence of active endocarditis. Drug fever at this point is unlikely
   unless it is due to meropenem. CT (as below) shows multiple areas of
   lymphadenopathy, with continuing resolution of her PNA. There is
   possibility that this could be malignancy as cause of fever however per
   radiology this is unlikely given widespread LAD. Would consider biopsy
   of axillary nodes, colonoscopy to r/o active Crohns.
   - continue meropenem day [**5-29**], increased dose as per ID yesterday

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU after being found down with pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure requiring intermittent dialysis. The patient has been diagnosed with various complications during her stay in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure and was on mechanical ventilation. She has since improved and is now on a tracheostomy mask. However, she still requires suction and may be downsized on her tracheostomy tube.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's CT scan shows atelectasis, ground-glass opacities, and nodules in the upper and mid-lung fields, which are consistent with pneumonia. The patient is currently on meropenem, an antibiotic that covers enterobacter species found in her sputum culture.
3. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had persistent fever despite appropriate antibiotic therapy for suspected infections. Blood cultures have been negative, and the source of the fever remains unclear. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause of the fever.
4. Lymphadenopathy: The patient's CT scan shows increasing size and number of lymph nodes in multiple nodal stations. This finding is concerning for an infectious process, and a biopsy of the axillary nodes is"

   - will continue active diuresis for pleural effusions and pulmonary
   edema
   -Continue meropenem day [**3-29**], no more vanco for now
   -suction as needed
   - follow CXR
   - sputum culture with enterobacter ( see below)
   -Albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
   - trach collar to be changed on Friday hopefully so that patient will
   be able to talk with trach in
    #Agitation: Patient has not seen her family in long time and has had a
   very complicated ICU course. She has responded to propofol, but now too
   long and it is not a good alternative. I think we need to address the
   baseline problem and do a good long-term regimen for that. Now off
   propofol on standing olanzapine.
   - switched to haldol yesterday, d/c olanzapine
   - psych consult appreciated
   - reccomending d/c wrist restraints as unnecessary and cause patient
   likely to become more agitated
   - limit ativan use (will d/c order now)
   -Talk to her frequently about her progression
   -F/u psych recs
   -Change trach to smaller, so she can talk (requesting it)
    #Fever: Fever overnight of 102, still unclear etiology. Has had +
   blood culture with coag negative staph and sputum culture with
   enterobacter as below which is sensitive to meropenen which is what
   patient has been getting. Urine has been growing yeast only.  Also
   history of Crohn
s disease. ESR 95 CRP elevated.  Currently no lines or
   hardware. PEG looks okay. Negative blood cultures as above except for
   one coag neg staph which has cleared.   CT chest below. Negative for
   PE. TTE without evidence of active endocarditis. Would also consider
   non-infectious causes such as drug fever.

   - for now will hold off of biopsy of these lesions in the setting of
   active infection, will follow-up with ID regarding furthur thoughts,
   consider repeating scan once infection improved to see if lymph nodes
   decrease
   - consider heme/onc consult if lymph nodes do not regress

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU due to pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been on intermittent dialysis.

Current Assessment:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has improved in her respiratory status while on antibiotics. She has successfully stayed off the ventilator for more than 24 hours and may be able to be downsized on the tracheostomy (trach) today. She is currently on a trach mask. The CT chest shows atelectasis, some ground-glass opacities, and nodules within the upper and mid-lung fields, with improvement in the bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Agitation: The patient has not seen her family in a long time and has had a very complicated ICU course. She responded to propofol but is now too long-acting and not a good alternative. She is now off propofol and on olanzapine. Psychiatric consultation is appreciated, and she should be talked to frequently about her progress.
3. Fever: The patient had a fever overnight of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, with an unclear etiology. Blood cultures show coag-negative staph, and sputum culture shows Enterobacter asburiae, which is sensitive to"

","The patient is a 62-year-old woman admitted with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and septic shock. She has shown improvement but requires a tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient has been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for over 48 hours and experienced a temperature spike of 101.2 degrees overnight. A CT chest revealed increased pericardial effusion.

The patient's allergies include penicillins and metoprolol. The last doses of antibiotics were meropenem at 08:08 AM and fluconazole at 08:23 AM. She is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis, lansoprazole (Prevacid), chlorhexidine, aspirin, diltiazem, insulin, and haloperidol.

The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged except where noted above and below.

Vital signs as of 12:09 PM on [date] are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.9°C (100.2°F)
- Heart rate: 97 bpm (76-128 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 122/69 mmHg (80-160/83-102 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (18-38 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 95%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's weight has decreased from 75 kg at admission to 61.4 kg currently. Her height is 61 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,333 mL, including 957 mL of IV fluids, and a total output of 1,203 mL through the PEG tube. Urine output is 890 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a tracheostomy mask, and her ABG results are ///27.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, with normal findings in the eyes, head, ears, nose, throat, lymphatic system, cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular system, and abdomen. Bowel sounds are present. The patient has absent pulses in both radial and dorsal pedal arteries. Her skin is warm, and she is neurologically attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, but movement, tone, and other neurological assessments are not performed.

Lab results show a white blood cell count ranging from 4.2 to 9.9 thousand/mL, hemoglobin from 26.5 to 28.7 g/dL, platelet count from 257 to 342 thousand/mL, creatinine from 1.0 to 1.4 mg/dL, troponin-T at 0.09 ng/mL, total CO2 at 31 mmol/L, glucose levels between 82 and 273 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.
