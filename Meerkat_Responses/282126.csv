","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with significant vascular risk factors admitted with cauda equina syndrome and a gram-positive cocci infection. The patient underwent spinal canal stenosis surgery this morning and has been experiencing altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI), and epidural abscess.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cauda Equina Syndrome: The patient's symptoms suggest cauda equina syndrome, which is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. Delayed diagnosis or treatment may result in permanent nerve damage and loss of bladder and bowel control.

2. GPC Bacteremia: The patient has GPC bacteremia with unclear source/etiology. If left untreated, this infection can spread to other organs and cause sepsis, a life-threatening condition.

3. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection, especially considering he has a urostomy. If not properly managed, the UTI can lead to complications such as pyelonephritis (kidney infection), sepsis, or the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

4. Epidural Abscess: The patient's symptoms suggest an epidural abscess, which is a collection of pus between the outer membrane covering the spinal cord and the vertebrae. If not treated promptly, it can lead to spinal cord compression and neurological deficits.

5. Cardiovascular Disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with significant vascular risk factors admitted with cauda equina syndrome and gram-positive cocci infection. The patient is planned for orthopedic spine surgery this morning.

The patient has several medical conditions and complications:

1. Cauda Equina Syndrome: The patient exhibits clinical signs of cauda equina syndrome, including decreased rectal tone and progressive right lower extremity weakness. However, the preliminary MRI does not show an epidural abscess, but rather suggests epidural lipomatosis as per the orthopedic spine team. It is noted that the symptoms are non-infectious, likely due to worsening spinal stenosis rather than an epidural abscess.

2. GPC Bacteremia: The source and etiology of the GPC bacteremia are unclear. Blood cultures from outside and in-house have been obtained. Broad coverage with vancomycin and zosyn is being provided while awaiting speciation, and vancomycin dosage will be adjusted based on levels.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a urostomy and has tested positive for a UTI at the outside hospital. Blood and urine cultures will be followed up, and broad coverage with the same antibiotics is being given.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and is at high risk for intermediate-risk surgery. Medications such as carvedilol, at"

- Presenting with lower back pain and found to have spinal stenosis and blood cultures positive for Gram-positive cocci.
- Allergies: No known drug allergies.
- Last dose of antibiotics: Vancomycin on 12/3/2107 at 4:00 PM.
- Vital signs: Max temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), current temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/37 mmHg to 154/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and sinus rhythm.

- Assessment and plan: Altered mental status (not delirium), urinary tract infection, spinal stenosis surgery, unclear source of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, chronic renal failure, and ICU care including nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and disposition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Spinal stenosis surgery complications: Possible perioperative risks such as bleeding, infection, nerve damage, blood clots, and adverse reactions to anesthesia.
2. Unclear source of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: Potential complications include sepsis, endocarditis, or abscess formation if the infection spreads.
3. Chronic renal failure: Risks of further deterioration in kidney function, fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and potential need for dialysis.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Possible complications include pyelonephritis, sepsis, kidney damage, or the need for antibiotic treatment.
5. Altered mental status: Underlying causes need to be identified and managed promptly to prevent further deterioration in cognitive function.
6. Glycemic control: Poor control may lead to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, increasing the risk of infections, poor wound healing, or other metabolic disturbances."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old man who underwent a T12-L3 laminectomy and was found to have bacteremia with MSSA. The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, UTI, chronic pain, altered mental status, and spinal stenosis. The patient is currently receiving various medications for pain control, infection, and cardiovascular conditions. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 151/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of twelfth rib pain. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds, and warm skin without rash. Neurologic examination shows attentive behavior, response to verbal stimuli, and normal muscle tone. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, blood glucose, and troponin T levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, PaO2 of 214 mmHg, HCO3- of 21 mEq/L, and BE of -4. The plan includes continuing nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia, performing a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), initiating ciprofloxacin for UTI, discussing ASA and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who underwent a T12-L3 laminectomy and was found to have GPC bacteremia. The patient showed T wave inversions on an EKG but remained asymptomatic. The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, bacteremia, acute and chronic pain, altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI), spinal stenosis, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic renal failure, and hypertension (HTN).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which needs to be treated with appropriate antibiotics. Nafcillin has been continued as per the assessment and plan.

2. UTI: The patient is being treated with ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection. Proper hydration and urine culture should be done to determine the appropriate course of treatment.

3. CAD: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and CAD. It is recommended to discuss with cardiology about holding aspirin (ASA) and Plavix. Further evaluation may be required to manage the patient's cardiac condition.

4. CHF: The patient has CHF, and treatment with statin and carvedilol is ongoing. Lisinopril is temporarily held due to acute on chronic renal failure."
