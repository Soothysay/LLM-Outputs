   PO intake, diarrhea, and dehydration, also with hypothermia and
   leukocytosis.
   .
   #. Leukocytosis, hypotension: Pt presenting as septic. Has mutiple
   possible sources of infection
 C.diff (diarrhea, recent abx),  skin
   ulcers, HAP (effusion possibly parapneumonic, and cough), ORIF
   - Pancultures, including wound. Cdiff to be sent when pt has BM.
   - s/p elective intubation, given worsening pulmonary edema with fluid
   resuscitation and need to continue IVF. Will provide fluid boluses to
   maintain CVP 8-12, UOP 75cc/hr
   -Will continue empirical vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl to empirically
   cover for a hospital acquired PNA and C. diff
   -Monitor lactates, renal function, mentation for markers of perfusion.
   -Will reassess with IVF and via A-line if pt requires pressors
 if so,
   will start with NE.
   -TBW podiatry re foot wounds
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Currently anuric. Likely initially pre-renal
   given decreased POs and diarrhea, but persistent failure suggest ATN
   -sent urine lytes
   -Renally dose meds

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes.
- She presents with decreased oral intake, diarrhea, dehydration, hypothermia, and leukocytosis.
- She is morbidly obese, lethargic, and has dry mucous membranes.
- Her vital signs show a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 90/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula.
- Physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, regular rhythm, and normal rate. Peripheral pulses are diminished in both lower extremities. The patient has distant and difficult-to-assess respiratory system, mild tenderness in the abdomen, and obese skin with multiple areas of breakdown and necrotic ulcers on the lower extremities.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's presentation with hypotension, leukocytosis, and multiple possible sources of infection (C. diff, skin ulcers, HAP) suggests sepsis. Immediate intervention is necessary to address this critical condition.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient is currently anuric"

   infected to me, specifically on the left heel, or a pneumonia vs. a
   parapneumonic effusion, given her new unilateral right sided pleural
   effusion and cough.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3847**] is a 79F with a PMH s/f diabetes presenting with decreased
   PO intake, diarrhea, and [**Known lastname 4459**], also with hypothermia and
   leukocytosis.
   .
   #. Leukocytosis/hypotermia: Patient is likely infected, leading to the
   current presentation.  Possible sources include GI tract with a viral
   gastroenteritis, or C. diff.  Her elevated lactate makes me concerned
   for this.  Other sources could be her skin ulcers, which appear
   infected to me, specifically on the left heel, or a pneumonia vs. a
   parapneumonic effusion, given her new unilateral right sided pleural
   effusion and cough.
   -Will send blood, urine, sputum and wound cultures.  Will also send
   stool for C. diff.
   -Monitor fluid status with CVP and UOP, given concern for SIRS.
   -Will treat empirically with vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl to
   empirically cover for a hospital acquired PNA and C. diff
   -Monitor lactates with hydration
   .
   #. [**Known lastname **]: Likely secondary to decreased POs, and diarrhea.
   Evidenced by likely pre-renal failure and may account for elevated
   lactate.
   -Will provide fluid boluses to maintain CVP 8-12, UOP 75cc/hr
   -WIll provide maintenance IV fluids thereafter
   .
   #. Elevated lactate: Related to ongoing infection vs. [**Known lastname 4459**]
   -Will re-check with ongoing hydration
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: likely pre-renal given decreased POs and
   diarrhea.
   -Will re-check with AM labs after hydration, if it continues to be
   elevated, can send urine lytes/sediment
   -Renally dose meds
   .
   #. R pleural effusion: Unilateral nature in the setting of hypothermia,
   leukocytosis, and new cough raises my suspicion for a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   -Diagnostic thoracentesis under ultrasound guidance given body habitus
   -Empiric coverage with vanc/zosyn as above.
   .
   #. DM
   -QID fingersticks with ISS, holding PO meds in the setting of infection
   and hypoglycemia.
   .
   #. HTN: hold home regimen in the setting of ongoing volume losses.
   .
   #. S/p recent femur fracture: continue current regimen of enoxaparin
   .
   #. Chronic anemia: stable at baseline.

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes presenting with decreased oral intake, diarrhea, dehydration, hypothermia, and leukocytosis. She is currently admitted to the ICU and has been diagnosed with multiple potential sources of infection, including C. diff, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and skin ulcers. She is receiving empirical coverage for these infections with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole.

The patient also has anuria, and renal consultation has been sought. The initial ultrasound did not reveal any obstruction, but considering the possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), further imaging studies such as a CT scan of the abdomen are being considered. The patient's fluid balance is carefully being managed due to anuria.

Additionally, the patient has a right-sided pleural effusion, which is suspected to be a parapneumonic effusion. A diagnostic thoracentesis is planned under ultrasound guidance. The patient's hypoglycemia is being managed with dextrose infusions.

Overall, the patient's conditions include sepsis with multiple potential sources of infection, anuria, right-sided pleural effusion, diabetes with hypoglycemia, and chronic anemia. The patient is on full code status."

   - Will continue empirical vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl to empirically
   cover for a hospital acquired PNA and C. diff
   - wean levophed with MAP goal > 60
   - limit fluids as much as possible with anuria
   # Anuria-  Renal consulted for anuria- considering ATN vs. obstruction.
   Considering obstruction . Renal US was unrevealing from obesity.
   Bladder pressure was 9 and did not support compartment syndrome. ATN a
   possibility
   - get CT thorax
   - UA, urine prot/cr ratio, urine eos.
   - speak to pharmacy on how to consolidate fluids
   - check vanco trough tomorrow AM for redosing
   #. R pleural effusion: Unilateral nature in the setting of hypothermia,
   leukocytosis, and new cough raises my suspicion for a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   -Diagnostic thoracentesis under ultrasound guidance given body habitus
   -Empiric coverage with vanc/zosyn as above.
   - speak to IP for tap
   .
   #. DM/hypoglycemia: possibly from not clearing mefromin from urine,
   otherwise synthetic fxnQID fingersticks

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes. She presents with decreased oral intake, diarrhea, dehydration, hypothermia, and leukocytosis. The patient is currently intubated due to fluid overload during volume resuscitation. The patient's conditions and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Sepsis: The patient likely has sepsis physiology with hypotension and hypoglycemia. Possible sources of infection include Clostridium difficile (diarrhea, recent antibiotics), skin ulcers, and hospital-acquired pneumonia (effusion possibly parapneumonic, cough).

2. Anuria: The patient has anuria, which could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or obstruction. Renal consultation has been requested, considering ATN vs. obstruction. A renal ultrasound was unrevealing due to obesity, and bladder pressure does not support compartment syndrome. ATN is a possibility, and further investigations such as a CT thorax, urine analysis, and urine eosinophils have been recommended.

3. Right pleural effusion: A unilateral pleural effusion in the setting of hypothermia, leukocytosis, and new cough raises suspicion for a parapneumonic effusion. A diagnostic thoracentesis under ultrasound guidance is planned given the patient's body habitus. Empiric coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin"

   PO intake, diarrhea, dehydration, hypothermia and leukocytosis
   concerning for septic shock from HAP vs C Diff.  Has required
   intubation for fluid overload in the setting of volume resuscitation.
   24 Hour Events:
   - TSH elevated, sent rest of thyroid panel
   - CT scan showed enlarged uterus,  Fistula or infection is suspected.
   Adjacent 9 x 8 cm soft tissue mass centered at the right iliac crest
   with associated right iliac [**Doctor First Name **] bone destruction represents metastasis
   (likely from uterine carinoma).  GYN ONC and ONC consults placed, to
   see pt tomorrow.
   - CT chest showed pleural effusion, discussed with IP, IP thought too
   risky to tap so have put that on the back-burner while we sort out onc
   issues.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3847**] is a 79-year-old female patient with a history of diabetes presenting with decreased oral intake, diarrhea, dehydration, hypothermia, and leukocytosis. She is currently in the ICU and requires intubation for fluid overload during volume resuscitation. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are concerning for septic shock from hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) versus Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff). She also has multiple possible sources of infection, including skin ulcers, cough, and a pleural effusion that may be parapneumonic.

The patient has been started on empirical vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl to cover for hospital-acquired PNA and C. diff. Her fluids are being limited as much as possible, and she is being weaned off levophed with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal of >60. The patient's anuria has prompted a consultation with renal specialists to determine if it is due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or obstruction. Renal US was unrevealing due to obesity, and bladder pressure does not support compartment syndrome. 

The patient also has a CT scan showing worrisome findings for endometrial cancer with metastasis. Gynecologic oncology and hematology/oncology are following up with the case. Tissue biopsy from the endometrial area and/or"

   volume resuscitation.  Now with new pelvic mass concerning for
   endometrial ca.
   # Sepsis - Pt has mutiple possible sources of infection
 C.diff
   (diarrhea, recent abx),  skin ulcers, HAP (effusion possibly
   parapneumonic, and cough), ORIF, vs uterine infection/abscess (cannot
   be ruled out by radiology). BAL cx growing coag + SA.
   - f/u w/ XR of foot, XR femur and f/u ortho/podiatry as contributing
   source
   - Will continue empirical vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl to empirically
   cover for a hospital acquired PNA and C. diff
   - wean levophed with MAP goal > 60
   - limit fluids as much as possible with anuria
   # ARF and anuria-  ATN most likely, with question of TLS, although no
   uric acid crystals on UA from admission and pelvic mass most likely
   endometrial ca which would be unlikely to cause spont TLS.
   - no sign of obstruction on CT
   - consolidate fluids
   - vanc dosing is q48h, check trough
   - appreciate renal recs
   - f/u onc recs re: ? TLS, as uric acid is 13.5
   # Malignancy: Likely will not pursue tissue biopsy for diagnosis as
   family is not interested in invasive procdures, but true goals of care
   discussion being postponed until [**2200-2-7**].
   - appreciate gyn onc and onc recs
   - CEA is elevated, follow up CA 27.29
   # R pleural effusion: Unilateral nature in the setting of hypothermia,
   leukocytosis, and new cough raises my suspicion for a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   -Diagnostic thoracentesis under ultrasound guidance given body habitus
   on hold now as risky, even with IP
   -Empiric coverage with vanc/zosyn as above.
   - IP aware that [**Female First Name (un) 231**] is on hold until goals of care discussion on
   [**2200-2-7**]
   #  DM/hypoglycemia: possibly from not clearing meformin from urine,
   otherwise synthetic fxnQID fingersticks
   - continue D5W at 40ml/h
   - continue amp D50 to minimize fluids
   # Hypotyhyroid: likely sick euthyroid given normal T4
   # S/p recent femur fracture: sub q heparin as renal failure does not

   Ms. [**Known lastname 3847**] is a 79F with a PMH s/f diabetes presenting with
   dehydration and leukocytosis concerning for septic shock from HAP vs C
   Diff.  Has required intubation for fluid overload in the setting of
   volume resuscitation.  Now with new pelvic mass concerning for
   endometrial ca.
    # Sepsis - Pt has mutiple possible sources of infection
 C.diff
   (diarrhea, recent abx),  skin ulcers, HAP (effusion possibly
   parapneumonic, and cough), ORIF, vs uterine infection/abscess (cannot
   be ruled out by radiology). BAL cx growing coag + SA.
   - f/u w/ XR of foot, XR femur and f/u ortho/podiatry as contributing
   source
   - Will continue empirical vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl to empirically
   cover for a hospital acquired PNA and C. diff
   - wean levophed with MAP goal > 60
   - limit fluids as much as possible with anuria
   # ARF and anuria-  ATN most likely, with question of TLS, although no
   uric acid crystals on UA from admission and pelvic mass most likely
   endometrial ca which would be unlikely to cause spont TLS.
   - no sign of obstruction on CT
   - consolidate fluids
   - vanc dosing is q48h, check trough
   - appreciate renal recs
   - f/u onc recs re: ? TLS, as uric acid is 13.5
   # Malignancy: Likely will not pursue tissue biopsy for diagnosis as
   family is not interested in invasive procdures, but true goals of care
   discussion being postponed until [**2200-2-7**].
   - appreciate gyn onc and onc recs
   - CEA is elevated, follow up CA 27.29
   # R pleural effusion: Unilateral nature in the setting of hypothermia,
   leukocytosis, and new cough raises my suspicion for a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   -Diagnostic thoracentesis under ultrasound guidance given body habitus
   on hold now as risky, even with IP
   -Empiric coverage with vanc/zosyn as above.
   - IP aware that [**Female First Name (un) 231**] is on hold until goals of care discussion on
   [**2200-2-7**]
   #  DM/hypoglycemia: possibly from not clearing meformin from urine,
   otherwise synthetic fxnQID fingersticks
   - continue D5W at 40ml/h
   - continue amp D50 to minimize fluids
   # Hypotyhyroid: likely sick euthyroid given normal T4
   # S/p recent femur fracture: sub q heparin as renal failure does not
   permit lovenox at this time.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diabetes presenting with dehydration and leukocytosis concerning for septic shock from hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient required intubation for fluid overload during volume resuscitation. A new pelvic mass is concerning for endometrial cancer.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient already has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. It is crucial to continue empirical coverage with antibiotics such as vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). It is important to monitor renal function closely and adjust medication dosages accordingly. The cause of ARF should be investigated further.

3. Malignancy: There is a concern for likely endometrial cancer with metastasis to the spine. Tissue diagnosis and further oncology recommendations should be pursued.

4. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a unilateral pleural effusion, which raises suspicion for a parapneumonic effusion. A diagnostic thoracentesis under ultrasound guidance should be performed to assess the effusion.

5. Hypothyroidism: The patient likely has hypothyroidism, but it is possible that she may be experiencing a sick euthyroid state due to the acute illness.

She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 50%, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is maintained at 15 cmH2O.

3. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure (acute kidney injury), possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This is indicated by an increase in serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output.
