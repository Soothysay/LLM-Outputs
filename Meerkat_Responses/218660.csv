","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, NYHA class IV CHF, and previous CABG surgery. He presented with acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation and was admitted for aggressive diuresis. The patient has been on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) since yesterday due to acute-on-chronic renal failure. His vital signs are stable, but he has mild back pain. Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities except for slightly enlarged left pupil, crackles at lung bases, and cool, dusky extremities. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine and potassium levels, which have improved since admission. The patient has multiple comorbidities including CAD, type II diabetes, hypothyroidism, OSA, and anxiety. The plan includes initiating HD (hemodialysis) with ultrafiltration today, monitoring urine output, and adjusting medications accordingly. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and previous CABG surgery puts him at risk for further cardiac issues. Close monitoring of his cardiac function is essential to prevent or manage any potential complications.
2. Renal complications: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, and his creatinine levels are elevated. The initiation of hemodialysis with ultrafiltration aims to manage his renal function and prevent further deterioration.
3. Respiratory complications: The presence"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, NYHA class IV CHF, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD, and recently discharged for CHF exacerbation. He is currently in the ICU for another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation.

The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure (93/67 mmHg), a slightly elevated heart rate (70 bpm), and a normal respiratory rate (12 insp/min). His oxygen saturation is 93% on a bipap mask. The patient's weight is 119.8 kg, which is slightly lower than his admission weight of 121 kg.

The patient has been started on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) due to acute on chronic renal failure. His renal function has improved since admission, with a current creatinine level of 3.9 compared to a baseline of 2.4-2.9. The patient's hyperkalemia has resolved, but his potassium level is still slightly elevated at 4.4. His HbA1C levels indicate poorly controlled diabetes.

The patient's medications include calcium gluconate, phenylephrine, KCl, milrinone, pantoprazole, and others. He is also on a diuretic regimen to manage his fluid overload.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of type I diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and acute-on-chronic heart failure. He is currently admitted to the ICU for management of his conditions. 

The patient's recent events include low urine output this morning, leading to the initiation of continuous venovenous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) due to renal failure. The attempt to access a femoral dialysis catheter by nephrology was unsuccessful, so interventional radiology (IR) placed a line instead. The decision was made to keep cinacalcet at the current dose, and using sodium citrate instead of heparin for flushes.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/67 mmHg to 119/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on Bipap mask. The patient is receiving multiple infusions, including calcium gluconate, phenylephrine, potassium chloride, and milrinone.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and urea nitrogen, as well as low levels of hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets. The blood glucose levels are significantly elevated.

The patient's assessment and plan include diabetes mellitus type I, chronic renal failure, and acute-on-chronic"

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy.
   DNR status discussed. Full code.
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   Milrinone plus high dose furosemide infusion plus oral metolazone
   accomplished nothing.  Therefore, we will now initiate hemodialysis.
   He is mildly uremic now and is declining progressively.  I am going to
   discuss with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 34**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] the feasibility of adding a LV pacer lead
   for cardiac resynchronization.  His inferior, posterior, and lateral
   walls are quite viable and should respond to pacing stimuli.

The patient has been undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) since last night, with increasing filter numbers requiring higher citrate doses to keep the line flushed. The net fluid removal rate is between 100-150 cc per hour. He is also receiving infusions of calcium gluconate, phenylephrine, potassium chloride, and milrinone.

The patient's vital signs show a low body temperature (35.7°C), stable heart rate (70 bpm), low blood pressure (93/67 mmHg), normal respiratory rate (12 breaths per minute), and slightly decreased oxygen saturation (93%). The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a BiPAP mask.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and normal potassium levels. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, liver enzymes, bilirubin, albumin, LDH, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2405 mL and output of 2628 mL since midnight, with positive fluid balance of 784 mL. He has received a total of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, NYHA class IV CHF, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD, and recent discharge for CHF exacerbation. He was admitted directly from home with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation for aggressive diuresis. The patient's current medications include Neo synthesis, milrinone, asa 81, lipitor 20, coreg 12.5, carvedilol, amiodarone, and cinacalcet with vitamin D. He has a history of type I DM, chronic renal failure, mitral valve repair, extensive CAD s/p CABG x2, hypothyroidism, OSA, and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and previous CABG surgeries suggest a weakened heart function, making him susceptible to acute exacerbations of his systolic heart failure.
2. Chronic renal failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 2.4-2.9, indicating chronic renal impairment. His current creatinine level is 3.9, which further supports the presence of renal failure.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient had a potassium level of 6.1 upon admission, indicating hyperkalemia. This condition requires careful monitoring and management to prevent complications such"

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, NYHA class IV congestive heart failure (CHF), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries. He was recently discharged for CHF exacerbation and was directly admitted to the ICU due to acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. 

The patient is currently receiving continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to acute on chronic renal failure. His creatinine levels have improved from 3.9 to 2.7. 

He has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and anxiety. His medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, carvedilol, amiodarone, and various other medications for his medical conditions. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/51 mmHg to 144/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Physical examination reveals no acute issues, but there is evidence of venous stasis dermatitis bilaterally, a well-healed midline sternotomy scar, and crackles at the lung bases.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, NYHA class IV CHF, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD, and recent discharge for CHF exacerbation. He is admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation for aggressive diuresis. The patient has a history of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, extensive CAD s/p CABG x2, mitral valve repair, and recent discharge for CHF exacerbation. He is currently in the ICU for close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and previous CHF exacerbations. His current presentation suggests worsening of heart failure symptoms, which may require aggressive diuretic therapy and other interventions to manage fluid overload and improve cardiac function.

2. Renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, as indicated by an elevated baseline creatinine level of 2.4-2.9. His current creatinine level is 3.9, suggesting further deterioration in renal function. Close monitoring of urine output, strict input/output balance, and adjustment of medications according to renal function are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient presented with a high potassium level of 6.1 on admission. This is a potential life-threatening complication that requires immediate correction."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, NYHA class IV congestive heart failure (CHF), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries. He was recently discharged for CHF exacerbation and presented with acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/57 to 119/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic systolic heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%, and has undergone mitral valve repair in the past. He is currently receiving aggressive diuresis, neosynephrine, and other cardiac medications. The patient also has a history of extensive coronary artery disease, with previous CABG surgeries. There are no acute issues related to his coronary arteries.

The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm (NSR) on admission, but he has a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firing provoked by low potassium levels. He is being monitored on telemetry, and his beta-blocker medication has been held.

The patient is also suffering from"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, NYHA class IV congestive heart failure (CHF), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was recently discharged for CHF exacerbation and is now admitted to the ICU for aggressive diuresis. The patient has been diuresed 1.9 liters yesterday on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and a total of 3 liters off length of stay. He continues with diuresis today.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%. He underwent mitral valve repair in 2176 with improvement in cardiac function since. However, he is now presenting with an exacerbation of CHF and is being treated with diuretics and vasopressors.
2. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of extensive coronary artery disease and has undergone CABG twice. His last catheterization in 2176 showed a widely patent left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft, with a saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the omohyoid artery with proximal 30% stenosis, and a patent SVG jump graft to D1 with distal diagonal artery patent. No acute coronary issues are noted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of type I diabetes, chronic renal failure, and acute-on-chronic heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU for further management and monitoring. The patient's mental status has improved since admission, and he is currently resting comfortably. He is oriented and has appropriate mood and affect. His cardiovascular system shows signs of low perfusion with distended neck veins and a murmur indicative of possible valvular heart disease. His respiratory system is stable with adequate oxygenation. The patient's abdomen is distended but non-tender, and he has venous stasis dermatitis in both lower extremities. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated creatinine levels, and stable blood glucose levels. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and dialysis. He is also receiving nutrition and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and the presence of a holosystolic murmur suggest a possible valvular issue contributing to his heart failure. Complications related to worsening heart failure may include pulmonary edema, hypotension, and arrhythmias.
2. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function. Complications associated with chronic renal failure may include electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and an"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, NYHA class IV CHF, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD, and recent discharge for CHF exacerbation. He was admitted directly from home with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation for aggressive diuresis. The patient has a history of type I DM, chronic renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. He also has hypothyroidism, OSA, anxiety, and fen. The patient's current weight is 119.5 kg, down from his last admission weight of 121 kg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and previous CABG surgeries indicate a compromised cardiac function. The ongoing CHF exacerbation suggests the possibility of worsening heart failure.
2. Chronic renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 2.4-2.9, and currently, it is 2.7. His renal function needs close monitoring, and CVVH is being continued.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count was initially low but is now improving. Further monitoring of CBC and consideration of platelet transfusion during dialysis are necessary.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient had elevated potassium levels but has been resolved. Close monitoring of potassium levels"

   DNR status discussed. Full code.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   It appears that under the current hemodynamic conditions he will be
   dependent on dialysis/ultrafiltration for volume management.  There is
   a possibility that upgrading from exclusively RV pacing to
   biventricular pacing could augment stroke volume hence cardiac output
   in such a way as to make him independent from HD/UF.  However, I am not

His hyperkalemia has resolved, and he is being monitored closely. The patient also has hypothyroidism, OSA, anxiety, and is on multiple medications for pain management, diabetes, and cardiac issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 2.4-2.9, which is currently at 2.7. There is a concern for further deterioration in renal function due to his chronic systolic heart failure and poorly controlled DM. Monitoring urine output, strict I/Os, and renal function tests are essential.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has improved from 65 to 108, but close monitoring is required as he may become dialysis-dependent. Platelet transfusion may be considered during dialysis.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy.
   DNR status discussed. Full code.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   It appears that under the current hemodynamic conditions he will be
   dependent on dialysis/ultrafiltration for volume management.  There is
   a possibility that upgrading from exclusively RV pacing to
   biventricular pacing could augment stroke volume hence cardiac output
   in such a way as to make him independent from HD/UF.  However, I am not
   confident that this will be the case.  We will ask EPS to consult.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, NYHA class IV CHF, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD, and mitral valve repair. He was admitted for acute on chronic systolic heart failure and has been receiving aggressive diuresis. The patient's weight is currently 119.5kg, down from 121kg on admission. He requires another 5L of diuresis as estimated by Dr. [First Name (STitle)]. The patient may also require dialysis, which will be discussed further with the team and Dr. [First Name (STitle)].

The patient has extensive history of CAD and has undergone CABG x2. His coronary arteries are stable at present. He is currently in NSR on admission but has a history of VT with ICD firing provoked by K <4.8. Contact EP regarding the possibility of LV pacing to synchronize the ventricles and improve stroke volume.

The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, likely due to chronic systolic heart failure and poorly controlled DM. His baseline creatinine is 2.4-2.9, currently 2.7 down from 3.9. Renal US without hydro, bilateral simple renal cysts, no obstructing stones. CVVH will continue, and strict I/Os will be monitored. Medications will be renally dosed"

   is s/p mitral valve repair in [**2176**] with improvement in cardiac function
   since. Now coming in 8 pounds above his dry weight from his last
   admission.
   - diuresed 1.9 Liters yesterday on CVVH running at 100cc/hr and total
   4.9 Liters off length of stay, continue diuresis today as tolerated.

   weight 119.5kg down from 121kg on admission
   -Given his NYHA class IV pt may be dialysis dependent will discuss
   further with the team and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
   - neosynephrine gtt continued to maintain pressures
   - hold BB until off of pressors
   - EP consulted re: 1) Utility/benefit of pursuing [**Hospital1 **]-V pacing and 2) If
   [**Hospital1 **]-V pacing not indicated, increasing paced HR to 80 bpm.  Their
   assessment is that the benefit of pursuing CRT is unclear; previously
   pt did not have significant improvement in symptoms, but the LV lead
   was anterior, a suboptimal location for CRT. Removal of the current LV
   lead, placed in [**2172**], would be a morbid procedure. However, the issue
   of placing a new LV lead and generator, is associated with significant
   risk as well. We could consider doing the latter after the patient is
   optimized with regards to volume status, eg, in ~2 weeks time.
   Placement of an LV epicardial lead for CRT, which would have to be done
   surgically, would likely be associated with excess morbidity/
   mortality, and thus this would not be advised. If the CCU team wishes,
   we may try re-programming his AV pacing to an increased HR.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of infarct-related cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction less than 20%, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries, and a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He was recently discharged for congestive heart failure (CHF) and admitted with another acute exacerbation of chronic CHF. 

The patient has severe systolic heart failure in the setting of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) with a prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal replacement therapy for volume removal. He has a history of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction of 20%, and mitral valve repair. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/80 mmHg to 110/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a resting comfortably oriented individual with appropriate mood and affect. There is no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The patient has a well-healed midline sternal scar, distant breath sounds, crackles at the lung bases, and no wheezes. The patient is obese and distended with no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly. Cool, dusky extremities are noted bilaterally.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.4 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 13.2 g/dL, platelet count of 97 thousand/mm3, creatinine levels ranging from 1.7 to 2.0 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 105 to 158 mg/dL, and sodium/potassium levels within normal limits. Other lab values are also provided.

The patient's assessment includes pain control, diabetes mellitus type I, chronic renal failure, and acute on chronic heart failure. The plan includes continuing diuresis, holding beta-blockers until off of pressors, consulting electrophysiology regarding utility/benefit of pursuing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), and optimizing the patient's volume status before considering any further interventions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and renal function will be necessary to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   [**Hospital1 **]-V pacing not indicated, increasing paced HR to 80 bpm.  Their
   assessment is that the benefit of pursuing CRT is unclear; previously
   pt did not have significant improvement in symptoms, but the LV lead
   was anterior, a suboptimal location for CRT. Removal of the current LV
   lead, placed in [**2172**], would be a morbid procedure. However, the issue
   of placing a new LV lead and generator, is associated with significant
   risk as well. We could consider doing the latter after the patient is
   optimized with regards to volume status, eg, in ~2 weeks time.
   Placement of an LV epicardial lead for CRT, which would have to be done
   surgically, would likely be associated with excess morbidity/
   mortality, and thus this would not be advised. If the CCU team wishes,
   we may try re-programming his AV pacing to an increased HR.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of infarct-related cardiomyopathy, EF < 20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD in [**2172**] (LV lead capped [**1-25**] dysfunction) recently discharged on [**8-2**] for CHF admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. The patient has severe systolic heart failure in the setting of severe CAD with prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal replacement therapy for volume removal. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diuresis: The patient has been diuresed 0.9 liters yesterday and continues diuresis today as tolerated. The goal is to achieve diuresis of 10 liters. The patient's weight is currently 119.5 kg down from 121 kg on admission. This indicates the possibility of fluid overload due to heart failure, which can lead to pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress if not managed properly.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine 2.4-2.9, and currently 1.5 on [**8-17**]. CVVH is being continued, and the patient's urine output will be monitored with strict input-output measurements. Renal dosing of medications will also be done, and medications like gabapentin, spironolactone, and lisin"

   # PUMP: Severe systolic heart failure in setting of severe CAD with
   prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal
   replacement therapy for volume removal.  He has history of acute on
   chronic systolic heart failure [**1-25**] ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%. He
   is s/p mitral valve repair in [**2176**] with improvement in cardiac function
   since. Now coming in 8 pounds above his dry weight from his last
   admission.
   - diuresed 0.9 Liters yesterday on CVVH running at 100cc/hr and total 6
   Liters off length of stay, continue diuresis today as tolerated. Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) **] goal of diuresis of 10L.  Current weight 119.5kg down from 121kg
   on admission
   - Given his NYHA class IV pt may be dialysis dependent will discuss
   further with the team and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
   - Pressor support has remained at a consistent dose, neosynephrine gtt
   continued at same dose and he has not needed any increase to maintain
   pressures.
   -EP consulted re: 1) Utility/benefit of pursuing [**Hospital1 **]-V pacing and 2) If
   [**Hospital1 **]-V pacing not indicated, increasing paced HR to 80 bpm.  Their
   assessment is that the benefit of pursuing CRT is unclear; previously
   pt did not have significant improvement in symptoms, but the LV lead
   was anterior, a suboptimal location for CRT. Removal of the current LV
   lead, placed in [**2172**], would be a morbid procedure. However, the issue
   of placing a new LV lead and generator, is associated with significant
   risk as well. We could consider doing the latter after the patient is
   optimized with regards to volume status, eg, in ~2 weeks time.
   Placement of an LV epicardial lead for CRT, which would have to be done
   surgically, would likely be associated with excess morbidity/
   mortality, and thus this would not be advised.
   -Will call EP today to increase his paced HR

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of infarct-related cardiomyopathy, severe systolic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. He has been admitted with an acute exacerbation of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) and requires renal replacement therapy for volume removal. The patient is currently on pressor support with neosynephrine and has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea, and anxiety. He also has thrombocytopenia and hyperkalemia, which have improved. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 100/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's use of a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery increases the risk of aspiration and subsequent pneumonia.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobility and the presence of central venous catheters, there is an increased risk of developing DVT.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's ongoing requirement for renal replacement therapy indicates ongoing renal dysfunction, which could potentially lead to AKI.
4. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of type I diabetes, chronic renal failure, and acute-on-chronic heart failure, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate of 70-72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 76/28 mmHg to 110/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including phenylephrine, calcium gluconate, and potassium chloride through continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient's weight remains relatively unchanged since admission. Fluid balance shows an overall negative balance of 911 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's laboratory results indicate stable renal function, normal white blood cell count, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is receiving nutritional support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and no disposition has been mentioned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to his immunocompromised state and the use of indwelling lines and catheters.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension, which may require further evaluation and management"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o M with infarct related cardiomyopathy EF < 20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p
   BIV ICD in [**2172**] (LV lead capped [**1-25**] dysfunction) recently discharged on
   [**8-2**] for CHF admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # PUMP: Severe systolic heart failure in setting of severe CAD with
   prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal
   replacement therapy for volume removal.  He has history of acute on
   chronic systolic heart failure [**1-25**] ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%. He
   is s/p mitral valve repair in [**2176**] with improvement in cardiac function
   since. Now coming in 8 pounds above his dry weight from his last
   admission.
   - diuresed 0.9 Liters yesterday on CVVH running at 100cc/hr and total 6
   Liters off length of stay, continue diuresis today as tolerated. Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) **] goal of diuresis of 10L.  Current weight 119.5kg down from 121kg
   on admission
   - Given his NYHA class IV pt may be dialysis dependent will discuss
   further with the team and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
   - Pressor support has remained at a consistent dose, neosynephrine gtt
   continued at same dose and he has not needed any increase to maintain
   pressures.
   -EP consulted re: 1) Utility/benefit of pursuing [**Hospital1 **]-V pacing and 2) If
   [**Hospital1 **]-V pacing not indicated, increasing paced HR to 80 bpm.  Their
   assessment is that the benefit of pursuing CRT is unclear; previously
   pt did not have significant improvement in symptoms, but the LV lead
   was anterior, a suboptimal location for CRT. Removal of the current LV
   lead, placed in [**2172**], would be a morbid procedure. However, the issue
   of placing a new LV lead and generator, is associated with significant
   risk as well. We could consider doing the latter after the patient is
   optimized with regards to volume status, eg, in ~2 weeks time.
   Placement of an LV epicardial lead for CRT, which would have to be done
   surgically, would likely be associated with excess morbidity/
   mortality, and thus this would not be advised.
   -Will call EP today to increase his paced HR
   .
   # CORONARIES: Extensive history of CAD s/p CABG x2, last cath in [**2176**]
   with LIMA widely patent, SVG to OM with proximal 30% stenosis, SVG jump
   graft to D1 and distal diag patent. No acute issues.
   -continue asa 81, lipitor 20
   -coreg 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] resumed
   -no ACEI given acute on chronic renal failure
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR on admission, has BiV PPM/ICD. Does have h/o
   VT with ICD firing provoked by K <4.8.
   -Contact[**Name (NI) **] EP regarding possibility of LV pacing since pt is currently
   only RV pacing with the hopes of synchronizing the ventricles and
   improving cardiac output (as above)
   -monitor on telemetry
   -continue amiodarone
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 improving.  likely [**1-25**] combination
   of chronic systolic heart failure and poorly controlled DM, baseline
   creatinine 2.4-2.9, 1.5 on [**8-17**].
   -cont CVVH
   -monitor urine output with strict I/Os
   -monitor creatinine, uremia (improved today).
   -renally dose meds
   -reduced gabapentin to 100mg
   -continue cinacalcet, vitamin D
   -hold vasodilators, spironolactone, lisinopril
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- platelet count rising (up to 108 from 65). Could be
   [**1-25**] dialysis initiation.
   -monitor CBC
   .
   # Hyperkalemia
 resolved.  Potassium up to 6.1 on admission, now 4.7.
   Goal K of [**4-27**].5 given past history of ICD firing with low potassium.
   Replete PRN
   .
   # Type II DM - HbA1C 3/09=7.5, 8/09=9.2; followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9895**] of the
   [**Last Name (un) 276**] but not recently.
   -continue outpatient regimen of 75/25 45 units qam, 50 units qpm with
   NPH 45 units at bedtime and sugars will be monitored closely with
   regimen adjusted PRN
   -finger sticks qid
   -renally dosed gabapentin for neuropathic pain

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy. Progress reviewed
   extensively during family meeting.
   DNR status discussed. Full code.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   volume unloading is going well with cvvhd; he is making a modest amount
   of urine as well
   we will dc cvvhd after current filter is expended, and then will
   restart Lasix drip
   other plans include switching from carvedilol to metoprolol to increase
   blood pressure, and to increase pacer rate to 90 bpm (since he has a
   restrictive filling pattern, he does not require a slow heart rate to
   optimize filling, so a faster heart rate will incxrease cardiac output)

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of infarct-related cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction less than 20%, and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x2. He presented with another acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and required renal replacement therapy for volume removal due to chronic kidney disease. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2 C (98.9 F)
- Heart rate: 70 bpm
- Blood pressure: 100/80 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula

   Impression: Severe systolic heart failure in setting of severe CAD with
   prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal
   replacement therapy for volume removal.
   The benefit of pursuing CRT is unclear; previously pt did not have
   significant improvement in symptoms, but the LV lead was anterior, a
   suboptimal location for CRT. Removal of the current LV lead, placed in
   [**2172**], would be a morbid procedure. However, the issue of placing a new
   LV lead and generator, is associated with significant risk as well. We
   could consider doing the latter after the patient is optimized with
   regards to volume status, eg, in ~2 weeks time. Placement of an LV
   epicardial lead for CRT, which would have to be done surgically, would
   likely be associated with excess morbidity/ mortality, and thus this
   would not be advised. If the CCU team wishes, we may try re-programming
   his AV pacing to an increased HR.
   Rec:
   1. Continue CVVH/ volume removal as you are doing
   2. Continue current CV medications/ CCU management
   3. Will placement of new CS lead and generator for LV pacing ([**Hospital1 **]-V
   pacing) after optimization of volume status
   4. Continue to maintain K > 4.0
   5. [**Month (only) 60**] try increasing paced HR for increasing CO.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of infarct-related cardiomyopathy, EF < 20%, who has undergone CABG x2 and BIV ICD placement. He was recently discharged on 8-2 for CHF and was admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. The patient has chronic kidney disease requiring renal replacement therapy for volume removal. There is uncertainty regarding the benefit of pursuing CRT, as the previous LV lead placement was suboptimal. The current LV lead is dysfunctional. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 76-84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. Physical examination reveals a well-healed midline sternotomy scar, crackles at the lung bases, no wheezes, obesity with distension, and cool, dusky extremities. Laboratory results show elevated glucose levels, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's pain control, diabetes management, renal failure, and heart failure are being addressed. The medical team recommends continuing CVVH, optimizing volume status, maintaining potassium levels above 4.0, and potentially increasing the paced heart rate for increased cardiac output. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's current condition of acute on chronic heart failure puts him at risk for further deterioration, leading"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of infarct-related cardiomyopathy, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) dysfunction. He presented with acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe systolic heart failure due to severe coronary artery disease (CAD) with prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy for volume removal.
3. Thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 118 (low was 65), which could be related to dialysis initiation.
4. Hyperkalemia that has resolved, with a goal potassium level of 4.2.
5. Type II diabetes mellitus with HbA1C levels of 7.5 and 9.2 in 2009, requiring close monitoring of blood sugars.
6. Hypothyroidism requiring continuation of home dose levothyroxine.
7. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), for which the patient has brought home a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine.
8. Anxiety, for which the patient continues to take home doses of ativan and ambien.
9. Fluid overload, as indicated by the patient's current weight of 119.5"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o M with infarct related cardiomyopathy EF < 20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p
   BIV ICD in [**2172**] (LV lead capped [**1-25**] dysfunction) recently discharged on
   [**8-2**] for CHF admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # PUMP: Severe systolic heart failure in setting of severe CAD with
   prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal
   replacement therapy for volume removal.  He has history of acute on
   chronic systolic heart failure [**1-25**] ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%. He
   is s/p mitral valve repair in [**2176**] with improvement in cardiac function
   since. Now coming in 8 pounds above his dry weight from his last
   admission.
   - diuresed 0.9 Liters yesterday on CVVH running at 100cc/hr and total 6
   Liters off length of stay, continue diuresis today as tolerated. Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) **] goal of diuresis of 10L.  Current weight 119.5kg down from 121kg
   on admission
   - Given his NYHA class IV pt may be dialysis dependent will discuss
   further with the team and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
   - Pressor support has remained at a consistent dose, neosynephrine gtt
   continued at same dose and he has not needed any increase to maintain
   pressures.
   -EP consulted re: 1) Utility/benefit of pursuing [**Hospital1 **]-V pacing and 2) If
   [**Hospital1 **]-V pacing not indicated, increasing paced HR to 80 bpm.  Their
   assessment is that the benefit of pursuing CRT is unclear; previously
   pt did not have significant improvement in symptoms, but the LV lead
   was anterior, a suboptimal location for CRT. Removal of the current LV
   lead, placed in [**2172**], would be a morbid procedure. However, the issue
   of placing a new LV lead and generator, is associated with significant
   risk as well. We could consider doing the latter after the patient is
   optimized with regards to volume status, eg, in ~2 weeks time.
   Placement of an LV epicardial lead for CRT, which would have to be done
   surgically, would likely be associated with excess morbidity/
   mortality, and thus this would not be advised.
   -Will call EP today to increase his paced HR
   .
   # CORONARIES: Extensive history of CAD s/p CABG x2, last cath in [**2176**]
   with LIMA widely patent, SVG to OM with proximal 30% stenosis, SVG jump
   graft to D1 and distal diag patent. No acute issues.
   -continue asa 81, lipitor 20
   -coreg 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] resumed
   -no ACEI given acute on chronic renal failure
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR on admission, has BiV PPM/ICD. Does have h/o
   VT with ICD firing provoked by K <4.8.
   -Contact[**Name (NI) **] EP regarding possibility of LV pacing since pt is currently
   only RV pacing with the hopes of synchronizing the ventricles and
   improving cardiac output (as above)
   -monitor on telemetry
   -continue amiodarone
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 improving.  likely [**1-25**] combination
   of chronic systolic heart failure and poorly controlled DM, baseline
   creatinine 2.4-2.9, 1.5 on [**8-17**].
   -cont CVVH
   -monitor urine output with strict I/Os
   -monitor creatinine, uremia (improved today).
   -renally dose meds
   -reduced gabapentin to 100mg
   -continue cinacalcet, vitamin D
   -hold vasodilators, spironolactone, lisinopril
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- platelet count rising (up to 108 from 65). Could be
   [**1-25**] dialysis initiation.
   -monitor CBC

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of infarct-related cardiomyopathy, s/p CABG x2, and a biventricular ICD. He was admitted for acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. The patient has severe systolic heart failure with severe CAD and chronic kidney disease requiring renal replacement therapy. He also has a history of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, and mitral valve repair in [**2176**]. 

Medical Complications:
1. Severe systolic heart failure in the setting of severe CAD with prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal replacement therapy for volume removal.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure improving, likely due to combination of chronic systolic heart failure and poorly controlled DM.
3. Thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 118 (low was 65). Could be dialysis initiation.
4. Hyperkalemia resolved, but patient has a history of ICD firing with low potassium.
5. Type II DM with HbA1C levels of 7.5 and 9.2.
6. Hypothyroidism.
7. OSA.
8. Anxiety.
9. Allergies to penicillins and heparin agents.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] recommended switching carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID to lopressor
   50mg PO BID given that patient is on phenylephrine.  CVVH stopped when
   filter clotted off at 6:30 PM.  Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], he was given metolazone
   5mg [**Hospital1 **] and bolused with 80mg lasix and started  on a lasix gtt at
   25mg/hr.
   -EP changed paced rate to 90.  EP [**Name8 (MD) 10092**] CRT will not help patient given
   NYHA Class IV HF rating.
   -Patient complaining of right eye constantly watering and itchy for 2
   days, looks a little more swollen and red than the left, no
   intervention made at this time, will monitor.
   This AM- denies any complaints.  Shortness of breath improved.  Denies
   any chest pain, dizziness, mental status issues.  Doing well today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of infarct-related cardiomyopathy, EF <20%, who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) twice and received a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He was recently discharged on August 2nd for congestive heart failure (CHF) and is now admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. The patient has severe systolic heart failure in the setting of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) with prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal replacement therapy for volume removal.

Medical Complications:
1. Severe systolic heart failure: The patient's low ejection fraction (<20%) indicates impaired pumping function of the heart, leading to poor cardiac output and fluid accumulation.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 2.4-2.9, and it further increased to 2.1 this morning, likely due to a combination of chronic systolic heart failure and poorly controlled diabetes.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low at 118 (with a previous low of 65), which may be related to dialysis initiation.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient initially had a high potassium level of 6.1, which has now resolved at 4.2. Potassium levels will"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] recommended switching carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID to lopressor
   50mg PO BID given that patient is on phenylephrine.  CVVH stopped when
   filter clotted off at 6:30 PM.  Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], he was given metolazone
   5mg [**Hospital1 **] and bolused with 80mg lasix and started  on a lasix gtt at
   25mg/hr.
   -EP changed paced rate to 90.  EP [**Name8 (MD) 10092**] CRT will not help patient given
   NYHA Class IV HF rating.
   -Patient complaining of right eye constantly watering and itchy for 2
   days, looks a little more swollen and red than the left, no
   intervention made at this time, will monitor.
   This AM- denies any complaints.  Shortness of breath improved.  Denies

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o M with infarct related cardiomyopathy EF < 20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p
   BIV ICD in [**2172**] (LV lead capped [**1-25**] dysfunction) recently discharged on
   [**8-2**] for CHF admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # PUMP: Severe systolic heart failure in setting of severe CAD with
   prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal
   replacement therapy for volume removal.  He has history of acute on
   chronic systolic heart failure [**1-25**] ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%. He
   is s/p mitral valve repair in [**2176**] with improvement in cardiac function
   since. Now coming in 8 pounds above his dry weight from his last
   admission.
   - diuresed 1 Liters yesterday on CVVH before it clotted off at
   6:30pm.   Total 7 Liters off length of stay, continue diuresis today as
   tolerated. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] goal of diuresis of 10L.  Current weight 119.5kg
   down from 121kg on admission
   - started on lasix gtt and metolazone 5mg PO BID yesterday- good UOP
   (1030ml since 1800 on [**8-17**])
   - Given his NYHA class IV pt may be dialysis dependent will discuss
   further with the team and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
   - Pressor support has remained at a consistent dose, neosynephrine gtt
   continued at same dose and he has not needed any increase to maintain
   pressures.
   -EP does not think CRT will benefit patient
   -EP increased HR to [**Age over 90 382**] yesterday.   Given patient
s ECHO results (early
   diastolic filling)- it is thought that increasing CO (via  increasing
   HR) will improve patients forward flow
   .
   # CORONARIES: Extensive history of CAD s/p CABG x2, last cath in [**2176**]
   with LIMA widely patent, SVG to OM with proximal 30% stenosis, SVG jump
   graft to D1 and distal diag patent. No acute issues.
   -continue asa 81, lipitor 20
   -switched to lopressor 50mg PO BID yesterday (d/c
ed coreg)
   -no ACEI given acute on chronic renal failure
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR on admission, has BiV PPM/ICD. Does have h/o
   VT with ICD firing provoked by K <4.8.
   -EP increased paced rate to [**Age over 90 382**] yesterday to improve CO
   -monitor on telemetry
   -continue amiodarone
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 improving.  likely [**1-25**] combination
   of chronic systolic heart failure and poorly controlled DM, baseline
   creatinine 2.4-2.9, 2.1 this AM (1.5 on [**8-17**]).   Increase likely due to
   halting of CVVH
   -CVVH stopped yesterday
   -now on lasix gtt at 25mg as well as metolazone 5mg PO BID
   -UOP since 1800 yesterday- 1030mL
   -monitor urine output with strict I/Os
   -monitor creatinine, uremia
   -renally dose meds
   -reduced gabapentin to 100mg
   -continue cinacalcet, vitamin D
   -hold vasodilators, spironolactone, lisinopril
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- platelet count 118 (low was 65). Could be [**1-25**]
   dialysis initiation.
   -monitor CBC
   .
   # Hyperkalemia
 resolved.  Potassium up to 6.1 on admission, now 4.2.
   Goal K of [**4-27**].5 given past history of ICD firing with low potassium.
   Replete PRN
   .
   # Type II DM - HbA1C 3/09=7.5, 8/09=9.2; followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9895**] of the
   [**Last Name (un) 276**] but not recently.
   -continue outpatient regimen of 75/25 45 units qam, 50 units qpm with
   NPH 45 units at bedtime and sugars will be monitored closely with
   regimen adjusted PRN
   -finger sticks qid
   -renally dosed gabapentin for neuropathic pain
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home dose levothyroxine
   .
   # OSA - patient has brought home CPAP
   -Sleep recently  adjusted settings and switched pt to full face mask
   with improvement of breathing however pt did not like new mask.
   .
   # Anxiety - continue home dose ativan prn and ambien for sleep.
   .
   #FEN: Diuresis as above, K with goal of [**4-27**].5, low salt, cardiac diet.

   24 Hour Events:
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] recommended switching carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID to lopressor
   50mg PO BID given that patient is on phenylephrine.  CVVH stopped when
   filter clotted off at 6:30 PM.  Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], he was given metolazone
   5mg [**Hospital1 **] and bolused with 80mg lasix and started  on a lasix gtt at

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] recommended switching carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID to lopressor
   50mg PO BID given that patient is on phenylephrine.  CVVH stopped when
   filter clotted off at 6:30 PM.  Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], he was given metolazone
   5mg [**Hospital1 **] and bolused with 80mg lasix and started  on a lasix gtt at
   25mg/hr.
   -EP changed paced rate to 90.  EP [**Name8 (MD) 10092**] CRT will not help patient given
   NYHA Class IV HF rating.
   -Patient complaining of right eye constantly watering and itchy for 2
   days, looks a little more swollen and red than the left, no
   intervention made at this time, will monitor.
   This AM- denies any complaints.  Shortness of breath improved.  Denies
   any chest pain, dizziness, mental status issues.  Doing well today.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o M with infarct related cardiomyopathy EF < 20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p
   BIV ICD in [**2172**] (LV lead capped [**1-25**] dysfunction) recently discharged on
   [**8-2**] for CHF admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # PUMP: Severe systolic heart failure in setting of severe CAD with
   prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal
   replacement therapy for volume removal.  He has history of acute on
   chronic systolic heart failure [**1-25**] ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%. He
   is s/p mitral valve repair in [**2176**] with improvement in cardiac function
   since. Now coming in 8 pounds above his dry weight from his last
   admission.
   - diuresed 1 Liters yesterday on CVVH before it clotted off at
   6:30pm.   Total 7 Liters off length of stay, continue diuresis today as
   tolerated. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] goal of diuresis of 10L.  Current weight 119.5kg
   down from 121kg on admission
   - started on lasix gtt and metolazone 5mg PO BID yesterday- good UOP
   (1030ml since 1800 on [**8-17**])
   - Given his NYHA class IV pt may be dialysis dependent will discuss
   further with the team and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
   - EP does not think CRT will benefit patient
   - EP increased HR to [**Age over 90 382**] yesterday.   Given patient
s ECHO results
   (early diastolic filling)- it is thought that increasing CO (via
   increasing HR) will improve patients forward flow
   - no longer on neosynephrine since HR increased yesterday
   - if he sustains low BP, stop lasix gtt and metozalone.
   - consider dopamine gtt if pressures remain low today (goal of SBP>80)
   -drop metoprolol dose to 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CORONARIES: Extensive history of CAD s/p CABG x2, last cath in [**2176**]
   with LIMA widely patent, SVG to OM with proximal 30% stenosis, SVG jump
   graft to D1 and distal diag patent. No acute issues.
   -continue asa 81, lipitor 20
   -switched to lopressor 50mg PO BID yesterday (d/c
ed coreg)
   -no ACEI given acute on chronic renal failure
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR on admission, has BiV PPM/ICD. Does have h/o
   VT with ICD firing provoked by K <4.8.
   -EP increased paced rate to [**Age over 90 382**] yesterday to improve CO
   -monitor on telemetry
   -continue amiodarone
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 improving.  likely [**1-25**] combination
   of chronic systolic heart failure and poorly controlled DM, baseline
   creatinine 2.4-2.9, 2.1 this AM (1.5 on [**8-17**]).   Increase likely due to
   halting of CVVH
   -CVVH stopped yesterday
   -now on lasix gtt at 25mg as well as metolazone 5mg PO BID
   -UOP since 1800 yesterday- 1030mL
   -lytes three times per day
   -monitor urine output with strict I/Os
   -monitor creatinine, uremia
   -renally dose meds
   -reduced gabapentin to 100mg
   -continue cinacalcet, vitamin D
   -hold vasodilators, spironolactone, lisinopril
   -pull femoral line being that CVVH has been completed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- platelet count 118 (low was 65). Could be [**1-25**]
   dialysis initiation.
   -monitor CBC
   .
   # Hyperkalemia
 resolved.  Potassium up to 6.1 on admission, now 4.2.
   Goal K of [**4-27**].5 given past history of ICD firing with low potassium.
   Replete PRN
   .
   # Type II DM - HbA1C 3/09=7.5, 8/09=9.2; followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9895**] of the
   [**Last Name (un) 276**] but not recently.
   -continue outpatient regimen of 75/25 45 units qam, 50 units qpm with
   NPH 45 units at bedtime and sugars will be monitored closely with
   regimen adjusted PRN
   -finger sticks qid
   -renally dosed gabapentin for neuropathic pain
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home dose levothyroxine
   .
   # OSA - patient has brought home CPAP
   -Sleep recently  adjusted settings and switched pt to full face mask
   with improvement of breathing however pt did not like new mask.
   .
   # Anxiety - continue home dose ativan prn and ambien for sleep.
   .
   #FEN: Diuresis as above, K with goal of [**4-27**].5, low salt, cardiac diet.
   .
   ACCESS: PIV, Right IJ, femoral CVVH line

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy.
   Additional comments:
   He is diuresing surprisingly well off dialysis, on Lasix gtt at 25 mg
   per hour and metolazone 5 mg [**Hospital1 **].  His bp is low unsurprisingly and we
   have switched off carvedilol on to metoprolol.
   My plan and goal is to get him on an oral diuretic regimen by tomorrow
   (earlier if he becomes and stays hypotensive), get him to [**Hospital Ward Name 790**] 3
   tomorrow for physical therapy, and hopefully home by Friday or
   Saturday.  He is approaching or actually may have already achieved his
   realistic limit of volume unloading, and further prolonged hypotension
   will be a signal to cut back and hold diuretic therapy and keep his
   balance even.
   Although he is doing gratifyingly well at this very moment, his overall
   prognosis remains quite poor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of infarct-related cardiomyopathy, EF <20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted with an acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 34.7°C (94.5°F), HR: 90 bpm, BP: 97/67 mmHg, RR: 19 insp/min, SpO2: 97%, and heart rhythm: AV Paced. The patient's physical examination reveals right eye redness and watering, distended abdomen, venous stasis dermatitis bilaterally, and cool, duskiness in extremities. Lab results show WBC: 12.4, Hct: 41.8, Plt: 97, Cr: 1.7, Glucose: 156, and Other labs within normal limits. The patient is currently on CVVH, receiving diuretics (Lasix gtt and metolazone), and has been switched from carvedilol to metoprolol. The plan is to continue diuresis, monitor urine output, electrolytes, and creatinine levels, and consider dopamine gtt if pressures remain low. The patient is also being monitored for thrombocytopenia, hyperkalemia, and type II DM. Disposition:"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o M with infarct related cardiomyopathy EF < 20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p
   BIV ICD in [**2172**] (LV lead capped [**1-25**] dysfunction) recently discharged on
   [**8-2**] for CHF admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # PUMP: Severe systolic heart failure in setting of severe CAD with
   prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal
   replacement therapy for volume removal.  He has history of acute on
   chronic systolic heart failure [**1-25**] ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%. He
   is s/p mitral valve repair in [**2176**] with improvement in cardiac function
   since. Now coming in 8 pounds above his dry weight from his last
   admission.
   - diuresed 1 Liters yesterday on CVVH before it clotted off at
   6:30pm.   Total 7 Liters off length of stay, continue diuresis today as
   tolerated. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] goal of diuresis of 10L.  Current weight 119.5kg
   down from 121kg on admission
   - started on lasix gtt and metolazone 5mg PO BID yesterday- good UOP
   (1030ml since 1800 on [**8-17**])
   - Given his NYHA class IV pt may be dialysis dependent will discuss
   further with the team and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
   -EP does not think CRT will benefit patient
   -EP increased HR to [**Age over 90 382**] yesterday.   Given patient
s ECHO results (early
   diastolic filling)- it is thought that increasing CO (via  increasing
   HR) will improve patients forward flow
   - no longer on neosynephrine since HR increased yesterday
   .
   # CORONARIES: Extensive history of CAD s/p CABG x2, last cath in [**2176**]
   with LIMA widely patent, SVG to OM with proximal 30% stenosis, SVG jump
   graft to D1 and distal diag patent. No acute issues.
   -continue asa 81, lipitor 20
   -switched to lopressor 50mg PO BID yesterday (d/c
ed coreg)
   -no ACEI given acute on chronic renal failure
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR on admission, has BiV PPM/ICD. Does have h/o
   VT with ICD firing provoked by K <4.8.
   -EP increased paced rate to [**Age over 90 382**] yesterday to improve CO
   -monitor on telemetry
   -continue amiodarone
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 improving.  likely [**1-25**] combination
   of chronic systolic heart failure and poorly controlled DM, baseline
   creatinine 2.4-2.9, 2.1 this AM (1.5 on [**8-17**]).   Increase likely due to
   halting of CVVH
   -CVVH stopped yesterday
   -now on lasix gtt at 25mg as well as metolazone 5mg PO BID
   -UOP since 1800 yesterday- 1030mL
   -lytes three times per day
   -monitor urine output with strict I/Os
   -monitor creatinine, uremia
   -renally dose meds
   -reduced gabapentin to 100mg
   -continue cinacalcet, vitamin D
   -hold vasodilators, spironolactone, lisinopril
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- platelet count 118 (low was 65). Could be [**1-25**]
   dialysis initiation.
   -monitor CBC

Medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and it is improving but still requires close monitoring.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be related to dialysis initiation. Close monitoring of the CBC is necessary.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient had elevated potassium levels but has resolved. Potassium levels should be monitored regularly to maintain the goal of 4.2-5.0 mEq/L.
4. Type II DM: The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, and blood sugars will be monitored closely with the current outpatient regimen adjusted PRN.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of infarct-related cardiomyopathy, EF < 20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD (with LV lead capped dysfunction), recently discharged on 08/02 for CHF, admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. The patient's current weight is 119.5 kg, down from 121 kg on admission. He has severe systolic heart failure in the setting of severe CAD with prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal replacement therapy for volume removal. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe systolic heart failure: The patient's severe systolic heart failure can lead to complications such as worsening pulmonary edema, hypotension, and decreased cardiac output.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed properly. This can result in further fluid accumulation, electrolyte imbalances, and uremia.

3. Hypokalemia: Despite repletion of potassium, the patient remains at risk for hypokalemia due to ongoing diuresis and renal losses. Hypokalemia can cause arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and cardiac dysfunction.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of the platelet count is necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o M with infarct related cardiomyopathy EF < 20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p
   BIV ICD in [**2172**] (LV lead capped [**1-25**] dysfunction) recently discharged on
   [**8-2**] for CHF admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # PUMP: Severe systolic heart failure in setting of severe CAD with
   prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal
   replacement therapy for volume removal.  He has history of acute on
   chronic systolic heart failure [**1-25**] ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%. He
   is s/p mitral valve repair in [**2176**] with improvement in cardiac function
   since. Now coming in 8 pounds above his dry weight from his last
   admission.
   - diuresed 1 Liters yesterday on CVVH before it clotted off at
   6:30pm.   Total 7 Liters off length of stay, continue diuresis today as
   tolerated. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] goal of diuresis of 10L.  Current weight 119.5kg
   down from 121kg on admission
   - started on lasix gtt and metolazone 5mg PO BID yesterday- good UOP
   (1030ml since 1800 on [**8-17**])
   - Given his NYHA class IV pt may be dialysis dependent will discuss
   further with the team and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
   - EP does not think CRT will benefit patient
   - EP increased HR to [**Age over 90 382**] yesterday.   Given patient
s ECHO results
   (early diastolic filling)- it is thought that increasing CO (via
   increasing HR) will improve patients forward flow
   - no longer on neosynephrine since HR increased yesterday
   - if he sustains low BP, stop lasix gtt and metozalone.
   - consider dopamine gtt if pressures remain low today (goal of SBP>80)
   -drop metoprolol dose to 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CORONARIES: Extensive history of CAD s/p CABG x2, last cath in [**2176**]
   with LIMA widely patent, SVG to OM with proximal 30% stenosis, SVG jump
   graft to D1 and distal diag patent. No acute issues.
   -continue asa 81, lipitor 20
   -switched to lopressor 50mg PO BID yesterday (d/c
ed coreg)
   -no ACEI given acute on chronic renal failure
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR on admission, has BiV PPM/ICD. Does have h/o
   VT with ICD firing provoked by K <4.8.
   -EP increased paced rate to [**Age over 90 382**] yesterday to improve CO
   -monitor on telemetry
   -continue amiodarone
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 improving.  likely [**1-25**] combination
   of chronic systolic heart failure and poorly controlled DM, baseline
   creatinine 2.4-2.9, 2.1 this AM (1.5 on [**8-17**]).   Increase likely due to
   halting of CVVH
   -CVVH stopped yesterday
   -now on lasix gtt at 25mg as well as metolazone 5mg PO BID
   -UOP since 1800 yesterday- 1030mL
   -lytes three times per day
   -monitor urine output with strict I/Os
   -monitor creatinine, uremia
   -renally dose meds
   -reduced gabapentin to 100mg
   -continue cinacalcet, vitamin D
   -hold vasodilators, spironolactone, lisinopril
   -pull femoral line being that CVVH has been completed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- platelet count 118 (low was 65). Could be [**1-25**]

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   DNR status discussed. Full code.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   He continues to diurese surprisingly well on Lasix gtt plus metolazone,
   and his creat and bp are stable.  All of his lower extremity edema has
   been eliminated but he remains 20-25 lbs (10 kg) above his realistic
   dry weight.  Since we have been able to get away with further volume
   unloading after dialysis was discontinued, I would favor continuing
   this process, using continuous furosemide infusion as currently being
   done, until a meaningful increase in creatinine occurs (or if worsening
   hypotension ensues).  The whole point of this hospitalization is to
   maximize volume unloading, and he has not yet reached the endpoint of
   this process.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of infarct-related cardiomyopathy, EF < 20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD in [**2172**] (LV lead capped [**1-25**] dysfunction) recently discharged on [**8-2**] for CHF admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- He has severe systolic heart failure in the setting of severe CAD with prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal replacement therapy for volume removal.
- He is experiencing acute on chronic systolic heart failure [**1-25**] ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%. He underwent mitral valve repair in [**2176**] with improvement in cardiac function since.
- He is currently 8 pounds above his dry weight from his last admission.
- The patient's weight is 113.5 kg, down from 121 kg on admission.
- His potassium levels were initially high at 6.1 but have been resolved, currently at 4.3.
- He has a history of thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 125 (low was 65).
- The patient has type II DM with HbA1C levels of 7.5 and 9.2.

   24 Hour Events:
   Repleted potassium- got 80mg PO in early Am and an additional 40mg PO
   around noon.  Re-checking lytes 3 times per day.  Renal recommended
   decreasing lasix gtt to 20mg/hr (goal SBP > 95).  Also recommended
   pulling femoral line- they will do it today AM.
   2215- K of 4.3.  Gave 80mg PO KCl
   Patient remained off the neo yesterday.
   This AM, he has no complaints, he denies any CP, SOB and feels better

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of infarct-related cardiomyopathy, EF < 20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD in [**2172**] (LV lead capped [**1-25**] dysfunction) who was recently discharged for CHF and is now admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. He has severe systolic heart failure in the setting of severe CAD with prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal replacement therapy for volume removal. The patient is currently on lasix gtt and metolazone 5mg PO BID, maintaining SBP 80s-100s, and will be converted to an oral diuretic regimen today. His NYHA class IV, and he may be dialysis dependent, which will be discussed further with the team and Dr. [**First Name (STitle)**]. The patient's previous weight was 121 kg, and he is now at 113.5 kg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of severe systolic heart failure, and the current exacerbation may lead to further worsening of cardiac function.
2. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a need for ongoing monitoring and management of renal parameters.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient has had episodes of low potassium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of infarct-related cardiomyopathy, EF < 20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD in [**2172**] (LV lead capped [**1-25**] dysfunction), recently discharged on [**8-2**] for CHF admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. He has severe systolic heart failure in the setting of severe CAD with prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal replacement therapy for volume removal. The patient is also experiencing acute on chronic renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hyperkalemia, Type II DM, hypothyroidism, OSA, anxiety, deconditioning, and femoral line complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of severe systolic heart failure, infarct-related cardiomyopathy, and prior CABG surgeries. These factors increase the risk of further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbation, or even cardiac arrest.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is worsening, as indicated by the increasing creatinine levels. This can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for continued renal replacement therapy.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding"

   [**8-2**] for CHF admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # PUMP: Severe systolic heart failure in setting of severe CAD with
   prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal
   replacement therapy for volume removal.  He has history of acute on
   chronic systolic heart failure [**1-25**] ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%. He
   is s/p mitral valve repair in [**2176**] with improvement in cardiac function
   since. Now coming in 8 pounds above his dry weight from his last
   admission.
   -off of CVVH yesterday, negative 447 mL, total 8 Liters off length of
   stay, continue diuresis today as tolerated. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] goal of diuresis
   of 10L.  Current weight 113.5 kg down from 121kg on admission
   - started on lasix gtt and metolazone 5mg PO BID yesterday- good UOP
   (1030ml since 1800 on [**8-17**])
   - Given his NYHA class IV pt may be dialysis dependent will discuss
   further with the team and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
   - EP increased HR to 90 because of early diastolic filling seen on ECHO
   to help improve forward flow.
   - did not require neo yesterday , maintaining SBP 80s-100s
   - if he sustains low BP, stop lasix gtt and metozalone.
   - consider dopamine gtt if pressures remain low today (goal of SBP>80)
   - continue metoprolol dose to 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CORONARIES: Extensive history of CAD s/p CABG x2, last cath in [**2176**]

   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR on admission, has BiV PPM/ICD, is RV paced.
   Does have h/o VT with ICD firing provoked by K <4.8.
   -EP increased paced rate to 90 to improve CO
   -monitor on telemetry
   -continue amiodarone

   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 slightly worse this AM, CR 2.5 (1.5
   on [**8-17**] this AM, baseline Cr 2.4-2.9, likely [**1-25**] combination of chronic
   systolic heart failure and poorly controlled DM, this AM).   Increase
   likely due to halting of CVVH and lasix gtt.
   -Off CVVH
   -now on lasix gtt at 20mg as well as metolazone 5mg PO BID
   -UOP since 2818 yesterday- 447mL

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of chronic renal failure, type I diabetes mellitus, and acute-on-chronic heart failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and receiving aggressive potassium repletion, lasix, and metolazone for fluid management. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/70 to 100/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been closely monitored for fluid balance. 

Medical Complications:
1. Chronic renal failure: The patient's history of chronic renal failure may lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances, anemia, and increased risk of infections.
2. Type I diabetes mellitus: The patient's type I diabetes mellitus may contribute to complications like hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis.
3. Acute-on-chronic heart failure: The patient's acute exacerbation of heart failure may result in further fluid accumulation, decreased cardiac output, and potential respiratory distress.
4. Fluid overload: Given the patient's current fluid management and ongoing positive fluid balance, there is a risk of fluid overload, which can worsen heart failure symptoms and increase the likelihood of complications like pulmonary edema.
5. Hypokalemia:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of infarct-related cardiomyopathy, EF <20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD implantation in [**2172**] with LV lead capped dysfunction, and chronic kidney disease. He was recently discharged on [**8-2**] for CHF and admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been on CVVH, aggressive K+ repletion, and diuresis with lasix gtt and metolazone. His weight has decreased from 121 kg on admission to 113.5 kg. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/70 mmHg to 100/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula, and temperature within normal range. The patient's labs show slightly worsening renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.5 (1.5 on [**8-17**]). The patient's other lab values are within normal range. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe systolic heart failure in the setting of severe CAD with prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure, which is slightly worse this AM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of infarct-related cardiomyopathy, EF < 20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD in [**2172**] (LV lead capped [**1-25**] dysfunction), recently discharged on [**8-2**] for CHF admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. He has severe systolic heart failure in the setting of severe CAD with prior anterior infarct and chronic kidney disease, requiring renal replacement therapy for volume removal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe systolic heart failure: The patient has a history of severe CAD and prior anterior infarct, which can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function and exacerbation of heart failure symptoms.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised due to chronic kidney disease, and there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function during this acute exacerbation.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a history of ICD firing provoked by low potassium levels, so careful monitoring and management of potassium levels are essential to prevent hyperkalemia.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be related to dialysis initiation. Close monitoring of CBC is necessary to manage this condition.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and it"
