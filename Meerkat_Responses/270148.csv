","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer, COPD, and diabetes who was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently extubated but experiencing increased work of breathing and has been placed on BiPap for increasing PCO2. His blood pressure is elevated at 190 systolic and is being treated with hydralazine and nitro gtt. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, metoprolol, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, and there is a concern about his ability to maintain adequate ventilation. He is experiencing increased work of breathing and has been placed on BiPap, which suggests ongoing respiratory compromise.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated at 190 systolic, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. This may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as heart attack or stroke.
3. Infection: The patient has been receiving antibiotics (levofloxacin and metronidazole), suggesting a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and ensuring appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial.
4. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for deep"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and previous intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient presented with an increased work of breathing (WOB) in the morning, leading to the placement of BiPAP, which provided relief. The patient also had severe hypertension, which was managed with hydralazine and nitroglycerin (NTG) intravenous infusion.

Throughout the day, the patient's blood pressure remained elevated, requiring the restart of NTG gtt. The patient had a PICC line placed and some home anti-hypertensives were started. Multiple doses of lasix were given, but there was no significant change in fluid balance.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for increased WOB. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/58 mmHg to 224/153 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 1621 mL input and 1252 mL output. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.33, PCO2 of 88, PO2 of 213, and Ve of 9.6 L/min. The patient's blood gas analysis also shows a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 213.

The patient's physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral vascular status, skin, neurologic examination, and tone. The patient's labs show leukocyte count of 258 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.0 g/dL, glucose of 216 mg/dL, sodium of 143 mEq/L, potassium of 3.2 mEq/L, chloride of 99 mEq/L, magnesium of 2.1 mg/dL, and calcium of 9.2 mg/dL. The patient's WBC count is within normal range, but Hct and Plt levels are slightly decreased.

The patient's imaging results include a chest radiograph from 01/23/2119 showing no significant changes. The patient's microbiology results indicate an ET sputum gram stain with budding yeast.

The patient's assessment and plan include pneumonia due to aspiration, fall(s), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The etiology of hypercarbic respiratory failure is unclear, but it could be caused by hypoventilation induced by sedative medications or COPD exacerbation.

The patient's plan involves following ABGs/VBGs, administering empiric antibiotics, and checking sputum cultures. The patient also needs a transesophageal echocardiogram"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a medical history of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), breast cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's recent echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 55%. She also has a history of hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus (DM).

The patient's 24-hour events include the initiation of non-invasive ventilation and placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. She experienced increased work of breathing (WOB) in the morning, leading to the placement of bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP). The patient's blood pressure was severely elevated, requiring the administration of hydralazine and nitroglycerin (NTG). The NTG drip was continued throughout the day and eventually discontinued when the patient maintained normal blood pressure levels. Some of her home anti-hypertensive medications (Amlodipine and Atenolol) were started.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 258 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 13.0 g/dL, glucose level of 216 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 43 mEq/L, creatinine (Cr) of 1"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), breast cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes. She was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been on BiPap, a non-invasive ventilatory support device, and has shown improvement with its use. She has been started on Lasix diuresis, restarted on home Lisinopril, and transitioned from intravenous to oral steroids. Her blood sugars have been running high, so she has been started on low-dose insulin sliding scale.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to aspiration pneumonia or squamous cell metastasis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact etiology.

2. Fluid overload: Despite appearing to have fluid overload on imaging, it may be difficult to assess accurately due to the patient's bad emphysema. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated, indicating potential heart failure.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which requires close monitoring and management.

4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia should be managed with continued use of aspirin and atorvastatin.

5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's diabetes should be managed with glycemic control measures, including the use of insulin as needed"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer, COPD, and diabetes. She was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been on BiPAP, steroids, and diuretics. Her blood sugars have been running high, so she started on a low dose of insulin sliding scale. Her current vitals include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/88 to 174/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. She is receiving various medications including Lasix, heparin, and pantoprazole. The patient's review of systems shows fatigue and mild confusion. Her recent labs show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and glucose levels. Imaging shows a stable cardiomediastinal silhouette, bilateral pleural effusions, and bibasal atelectasis. The patient's microbiology results indicate the presence of budding yeast in the sputum culture. The assessment and plan include treating hypercarbic respiratory failure, managing potential aspiration pneumonia, addressing possible fluid overload and cardiac failure, and following up with outpatient care. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is screening for rehab.

","Summary:
The patient is a 82-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently improving, but there are concerns about her chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and the need for future oxygen support. The patient has a history of pneumonia and aspiration, and has experienced falls in the past. She is being weaned off prednisone and her cardiac medications will be adjusted due to elevated creatinine levels. Rehabilitation is recommended for the patient.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient has severe chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure at baseline, which will require ongoing management and future oxygen support.
2. Pneumonia and aspiration: The patient has a history of pneumonia and aspiration, which increases the risk of recurrent infections and respiratory complications.
3. Falls: The patient has experienced falls in the past, which can lead to injuries and further complications.
4. Elevated creatinine levels: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate kidney dysfunction, which may require adjustment of cardiac medications and close monitoring.
5. Glycemic control: The patient is on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, indicating a risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia if not properly managed.
6. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is receiving SQ UF Heparin for DVT prophylaxis, which is important to prevent deep vein thrombosis.

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), breast cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient was admitted to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, with the etiology still unclear. The patient is a chronic CO2 retainer and has known COPD.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/45-160/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance with no acute distress. The patient has normal pupils, head, ears, nose, throat, cardiovascular system (with a normal S1 and S2 and a systolic murmur), peripheral vascular system, respiratory system (with symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion note, and clear breath sounds), abdomen (soft, non-tender with bowel sounds present), extremities (without edema), and neurologic system (alert, attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time, normal movement and tone).

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.9 K"
