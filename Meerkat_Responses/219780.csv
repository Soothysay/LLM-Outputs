","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with cardiac tamponade secondary to a pulmonary vein isolation procedure. The patient underwent paracardiocentesis and placement of a pericardial drain, with drainage of 250cc fluid. She experienced hypotension and was supported with phenylephrine. The patient's hematocrit dropped from 45% to 34.7%. She was extubated, sedation and phenylephrine were weaned, and the patient continues to have sparse drainage. Pulsus paradoxus is present. 

The plan includes monitoring pericardial drainage and vital signs, performing an echocardiogram to further evaluate the pericardial fluid, continuing to hold Coumadin, following up on electrophysiology recommendations, and obtaining a CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for a potential bleed. The patient's rhythm has improved since the pulmonary vein isolation procedure and she is currently in normal sinus rhythm. However, she has experienced intermittent runs of atrial tachycardia and will continue to be monitored on telemetry. Amiodarone 400mg will be given orally once daily for two weeks, and Coumadin will be restarted once pericardial leak has subsided.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (a-fib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. She developed cardiac tamponade during an electrophysiological (EP) procedure and underwent pericardiocentesis with the placement of a drain. The patient experienced hypotension and required support with phenylephrine. Her hematocrit (Hct) level decreased from 45 to 34.7, but subsequent follow-up Hct levels were stable. The patient was extubated and sedation and phenylephrine were weaned. The drainage from the pericardial drain is minimal this morning, and she has a pulsus paradox of 10.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient initially developed cardiac tamponade during the EP procedure, which is a potentially life-threatening condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac, causing compression of the heart and impaired cardiac function. The ongoing monitoring of pericardial drainage and vital signs is crucial to manage this condition effectively.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension after the pericardiocentesis, which required support with phenylephrine. Close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic stability is essential to prevent"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. The patient developed cardiac tamponade during an electrophysiology (EP) procedure, resulting in hypotension. A paracardiocentesis was performed, and a drain was placed, with 250cc of fluid drained. The patient's hemodynamic status has been stable since then, with ongoing pericardial drainage. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/64 to 142/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 2LNC. The patient's weight is currently 66.4 kg, and she has received a total of 3,747 mL of intravenous fluids with a balance of 2,387 mL. 

On physical examination, the patient appears diaphoretic and uncomfortable, with serous drainage from the pericardial drain. No other significant abnormalities were noted during the examination. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.7 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL, sodium level of 142 mg/dL, potassium level of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with cardiac tamponade, which developed during an electrophysiology procedure. Paracardiocentesis was performed, and a drain was placed. Initially, hypotension developed, but the patient was supported with phenylephrine. Her hematocrit dropped from 45 to 34.7, but subsequent hematocrit levels were stable. The patient was extubated, sedation and phenylephrine were weaned, and she continues to drain pericardial fluid. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/64 to 142/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 2LNC. Physical examination shows diaphoresis and discomfort, with serous drainage from the pericardial drain. There are crackles in the chest anteriorly, right to left, and no wheezes. The patient has ecchymosis over the left groin site tracking down to the medial thigh, but no edema in the lower extremities. Neurologically, she is attentive and responds to simple commands. Lab"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. The patient developed cardiac tamponade during an electrophysiology (EP) procedure and underwent a pericardiocentesis with drain placement. A total of 250cc fluid was drained, and the patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped from 45% to 34.7%. The patient was supported with phenylephrine, extubated, and sedation and phenylephrine were weaned. 

The patient continues to experience mild positional back pain and pain around the drain site, which worsens upon deep inspiration. The drainage from the pericardial drain has been sparse, with 100cc drained overnight and 18cc in the past two hours. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/64 mmHg to 142/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100% on 2LNC, and sinus rhythm on electrocardiogram (ECG). 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 36.5%, platelet count of 159 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose of 142 mg/dL, sodium of 142 mg/dL, potassium of 4.9 mEq/L, chloride of 16 mg/dL, magnesium of 1.7 mg/dL, phosphate of 2.9 mg/dL, calcium of 8.1 mg/dL, and an INR of 2.4. 

The plan is to continue monitoring pericardial drainage and hemodynamics, perform an echocardiogram today to further evaluate pericardial fluid, continue holding coumadin, follow up on EP recommendations, and obtain a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to evaluate for bleed. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's symptoms of back pain and chest pain around the drain site, along with the presence of a friction rub on physical examination, suggest ongoing pericardial effusion. Monitoring pericardial drainage output and performing echocardiograms are appropriate to assess for persistent tamponade.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been variable, ranging from 100/64 mmHg to 142/99 mmHg. Close monitoring of hemodynamics and appropriate management with vasopressors, if needed, are important.

3. Atrial tachyc"

   cardiac tamponade
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2181-9-29**]: TTE showed very small pericardial effusion, primarily anterior
   and apical. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood,
   inflammation or other cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic
   signs of tamponade. Pericardium drained 100cc overnight, about 100cc
   during day.
   Pulsus ~ 12.
   Vascular recommended repeat ultrasound in one month, if pseudoaneurysm
   >2 cm, pt will need f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6328**] for possible thrombin
   injection.
   AP portable:
   A pericardial drain is in place. Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of
   normal in size. Aorta is slightly unfolded. Lungs are clear except for
   minimal atelectasis at the right base.
   CT C/A/P:
   1. No retroperitoneal hematoma.
   2. No pericardial effusion with catheter in the pericardial space
   wrapping around the heart.
   3. A few ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs bilaterally, as
   described above. While these may represent focal areas of atelectasis,
   a six-month followup CT thorax is recommended to ensure stability or
   resolution.
   4. Unremarkable CT of the abdomen and pelvis
   Pt entered SVT around 20:00, rate ~160, regular, narrow, normotensive.
   appeared to be a.flutter with 2:1 conduction.  lopressor 5 mg x 1
   slowed rate to 140, repeated lopressor 5 mg x 2 without effect.
   diltiazem 10 mg x 1 showed flutter waves with 2:1 and 3:1 conduction,
   then rate returned to 140.  Amio 150 mg IV x 1 given, rate slowed to
   70s-80s, transiently hypotensive, then returned to rate of 130.  Repeat
   amio 150 mg IV x1 with infusion of 1 mg/hr now improving rate.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the ICU after undergoing a pulmonary vein isolation procedure. The patient developed cardiac tamponade during the procedure and had a pericardiocentesis performed, with approximately 250cc of fluid drained. Hypotension developed, and the patient was supported with phenylephrine. Her hematocrit dropped from 45% to 34.7%. The patient was extubated, sedation and phenylephrine were weaned, and the drainage has been sparse since the morning. 

The patient's left common femoral artery (CFA) pseudoaneurysm was evaluated by vascular surgery and is currently stable. A repeat ultrasound is recommended in four weeks, and if the pseudoaneurysm increases from 1.2 to >2 cm, the patient may need a thrombin injection.

The patient's rhythm has been challenging to control, with evidence of atypical atrial flutter overnight. She is beginning to respond to amiodarone load. Tele monitoring will be continued, and amiodarone 400mg po qd for two weeks, along with IV amio load today, will be continued. Coumadin will be restarted today, and the patient will be NPO at midnight for possible cardioversion tomorrow.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for pulmonary vein isolation due to atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient now presents with cardiac tamponade, which is a condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardium, causing compression of the heart. The patient had a small pericardial effusion, primarily anterior and apical, which is consistent with blood, inflammation, or other cellular elements. There were no echocardiographic signs of tamponade initially. The patient underwent pericardial drainage overnight and during the day. The patient's pulse rate is around 125 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure is 96/71 mmHg, respiratory rate is 17 inspiratory movements per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98%. The patient's weight is 66.4 kg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: The presence of cardiac tamponade is a serious condition that can lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic instability. It requires prompt intervention to relieve the pressure on the heart.
2. Pseudoaneurysm: There is a concern for a pseudoaneurysm, which is an abnormal outpouching of the heart wall. If it grows larger than 2 cm, it may require further evaluation and possible treatment such as thrombin injection.
3. Thromboembolic Events: Patients with AFib and atr"

   was performed and drain was put in place. 250cc fluid was drained.
   Hypotension developed and pt was supported with phenylephrine. Hct
   dropped 45--> 34.7. Followup Hct
s were stable. Pt was extubated,
   sedation and phenylephrine was weaned. Drainage is very sparse this
   morning. Pulsus ~[**10-24**].
   - Continue to monitor pericardial drainage and H/H
   - Echo to further evaluate pericardial fluid. Still draining too much
   to pull at this time
   - Continue to hold coumadin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (a-fib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia.
- She underwent a pulmonary vein isolation procedure and subsequently developed cardiac tamponade.
- Paracardiocentesis was performed, and a pericardial drain was placed, with 250cc fluid drained.
- The patient experienced hypotension and was supported with phenylephrine. Her hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 45% to 34.7%.
- She was extubated, sedation, and phenylephrine were weaned. Pericardial drainage continued, but it was sparse in the morning.
- The patient's pulse is around 125 beats per minute (bpm).
- An echocardiogram (echo) is recommended to further evaluate the pericardial fluid.
- Coumadin should be continued to be held.
- Follow-up recommendations from the electrophysiology (EP) procedure will be followed.
- A CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis was done to evaluate for a possible bleed, but no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed was found.
- A left common femoral artery (CFA) pseudoaneurysm was identified, which is stable.
- Vascular consultation recommendations include a repeat ultrasound in"

   cardiac tamponade
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2181-9-29**]: TTE showed very small pericardial effusion, primarily anterior
   and apical. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood,
   inflammation or other cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic
   signs of tamponade. Pericardium drained 100cc overnight, about 100cc
   during day.
   Pulsus ~ 12.
   Vascular recommended repeat ultrasound in one month, if pseudoaneurysm
   >2 cm, pt will need f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6328**] for possible thrombin
   injection.
   AP portable:
   A pericardial drain is in place. Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of
   normal in size. Aorta is slightly unfolded. Lungs are clear except for
   minimal atelectasis at the right base.
   CT C/A/P:
   1. No retroperitoneal hematoma.
   2. No pericardial effusion with catheter in the pericardial space
   wrapping around the heart.
   3. A few ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs bilaterally, as
   described above. While these may represent focal areas of atelectasis,
   a six-month followup CT thorax is recommended to ensure stability or
   resolution.
   4. Unremarkable CT of the abdomen and pelvis
   Pt entered SVT around 20:00, rate ~160, regular, narrow, normotensive.
   appeared to be a.flutter with 2:1 conduction.  lopressor 5 mg x 1
   slowed rate to 140, repeated lopressor 5 mg x 2 without effect.
   diltiazem 10 mg x 1 showed flutter waves with 2:1 and 3:1 conduction,
   then rate returned to 140.  Amio 150 mg IV x 1 given, rate slowed to
   70s-80s, transiently hypotensive, then returned to rate of 130.  Repeat
   amio 150 mg IV x1 with infusion of 1 mg/hr now improving rate.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. She underwent a pulmonary vein isolation procedure for her atrial fibrillation but developed cardiac tamponade during the procedure. Paracardiocentesis was performed, and a pericardial drain was placed. Approximately 250cc of fluid was drained, and the patient was supported with phenylephrine due to hypotension. Her hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 45% to 34.7%. The patient was extubated and sedation and phenylephrine were weaned. Pericardial drainage continues to be sparse. The patient has a left common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, which is stable and being monitored. The patient's rhythm is currently atypical atrial flutter, and she is being treated with amiodarone. She also has hyperlipidemia, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, and glaucoma, for which she will start various medications upon discharge.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. The patient presented with cardiac tamponade and underwent a pulmonary vein isolation procedure. However, during the procedure, she developed cardiac tamponade, which was treated with paracardiocentesis and placement of a pericardial drain. The drain appeared to be adherent to the pericardium, and an attempt to pull it yesterday was unsuccessful. 

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/79 mmHg to 138/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's labs show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, the creatinine level is slightly elevated at 0.7 mg/dL. The glucose level is within normal range, and other electrolytes such as potassium, magnesium, and phosphate are also within normal limits. 

The patient's medical conditions include cardiac tamponade, left common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, rhythm disturbance (atrial fibrillation), hyperlipidemia, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperkalemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with cardiac tamponade and underwent a procedure for pulmonary vein isolation. During the procedure, she developed hypotension and required support with phenylephrine. A pericardial drain was placed, but subsequent attempts to remove it were unsuccessful due to adhesion to the pericardium. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped from 45% to 34.7% after the procedure. She has also been diagnosed with a left common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, which is being monitored with plans for repeat ultrasound in two weeks. The patient's rhythm has been unstable, with evidence of atrial flutter, and she is currently being treated with amiodarone and coumadin. Other medical conditions such as COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia are being managed with respective medications. The patient is currently in the ICU, where she will remain for further evaluation and treatment. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient already developed this condition during the EP procedure, leading to hypotension and requiring intervention. It can recur if the pericardial drain is not properly managed or if there is re-accumulation of fluid around the"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with cardiac tamponade due to a procedure called pulmonary vein isolation. The patient underwent paracardiocentesis and had a pericardial drain placed. However, attempts to remove the drain have been unsuccessful as it appears to be adhered to the pericardium. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 127 beats per minute, blood pressure of 126/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. Her lab results show a white blood cell count of 14.7 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level of 32.0 g/dL, platelet count of 176 thousand/mm3, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and glucose level of 151 mg/dL. 

The patient's assessment and plan include monitoring for cardiac tamponade, planning for pericardial drain removal under fluoroscopy in the cath lab, conducting a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) during and after the procedure, restarting Coumadin, and providing supportive care. 

There are also mentions of a left common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, which is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with cardiac tamponade, which developed during an electrophysiology (EP) procedure. A pericardial drain was placed, but there was unsuccessful attempt to remove it due to adhesion to the pericardium. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 45% to 34.7% and she experienced hypotension, which was supported with phenylephrine. The patient was extubated and sedation and phenylephrine were weaned.

The patient also has a left common femoral artery (CFA) pseudoaneurysm, which is stable and being monitored. Repeat ultrasound in two weeks is recommended, and thrombin injection may be necessary if the pseudoaneurysm increases from 1.2 to >2 cm.

The patient's rhythm is still atypical atrial flutter, which is being treated with amiodarone. Coumadin has been restarted, but the patient's INR is subtherapeutic at 1.4.

Other medical conditions include hyperlipidemia, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hypokalemia. The patient is on several medications including Simvastatin,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with cardiac tamponade secondary to a pulmonary vein isolation procedure. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis with drain placement and was supported with phenylephrine due to hypotension. The drain was later removed without complication. The patient's heart function is normal with mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, and there is no reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space. The patient also has a left common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, which is stable and being monitored. She has an elevated white blood cell count and a urinary tract infection, for which she will have a Foley catheter removed today. The patient's hyperlipidemia, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and conditioning needs are being managed accordingly. She is currently on cardiac output monitoring, and her INR is subtherapeutic at 1.9. The plan is to perform cardioversion today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of refractory atrial fibrillation, and although amiodarone is being used, there is still a risk of arrhythmia complications.
2. Cardiac Tamponade: Although the drain has been removed,"

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with cardiac tamponade, which was treated with pericardiocentesis and placement of a pericardial drain. The patient underwent a pulmonary vein isolation procedure but developed hypotension and required support with phenylephrine. The pericardial drain was attempted to be pulled on 9/30 but was unsuccessful due to adhesion to the pericardium. It was eventually removed under fluoroscopy in the cath lab. A transthoracic echo (TTE) showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction (>55%) with mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, mild aortic regurgitation, and mitral regurgitation. There was no reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space post-drain pull.

The patient's left common femoral artery (CFA) pseudoaneurysm was stable and evaluated by vascular surgery. It was recommended to have a repeat ultrasound in 2 weeks at the vascular follow-up appointment. If the pseudoaneurysm increases from 1.2 to >2 cm, the patient may need a thrombin injection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. Vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 128 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 104/61 mmHg to 149/94 mmHg. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with variable rate but remains hemodynamically stable. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,256 mL and output of 3,210 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -954 mL. Oxygen saturation is 99% on a nasal cannula, and respiratory support is provided. The patient has no known drug allergies.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemodynamic instability due to ongoing atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rate is elevated, and there is a wide range in blood pressure readings. Continuous monitoring of hemodynamic parameters is crucial to detect any deterioration.

2. Pericardial effusion: The patient has a history of pericardial effusion without tamponade. Regular monitoring of cardiac rhythms and echocardiogram may be necessary to assess for any worsening of the effusion or development of cardiac tamponade.

3. Infection: The patient's WBC count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. Laboratory results also show an increase in CRP levels, which can be associated with inflammation or infection. Appropriate cultures and antimicrobial therapy should be considered.

4. Bleeding"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the ICU with cardiac tamponade secondary to a pulmonary vein isolation procedure. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and had a drain placed, with 250cc of fluid drained. She was supported with phenylephrine and eventually extubated. The drain was removed under fluoroscopy in the cath lab. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, mild aortic regurgitation, and mild mitral regurgitation. There was no evidence of reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space post-drain pull.

The patient's rhythm has been difficult to control, with intermittent atrial tachycardia and variable rate. She received several doses of metoprolol to control her heart rate, and her rhythm was rate-controlled overnight. Amiodarone was loaded and converted to oral therapy. Cardioversion yesterday was unsuccessful. The patient's INR is supratherapeutic at 3.4, so she will hold coumadin today and decrease her dose to 2.5mg daily.

The patient's urine analysis (U/A) has been positive for bacteria on two occasions,"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2181-10-2**]:
   D/C'd foley. Cardioverted and briefly in sinus tach with ectopy, but
   then back in atrial tach/a.fib within a few hours. No plan for repeat
   cardioversion today.  Received extra bolus of amio 150 mg IV x 2, and
   metoprolol 25 po bid.  . Changed Amio to 600 po qd.  (has gotten total
   4300 mg amio while inpatient.) Heparin d/c'd after procedure.
   .
   Pt had recurrent a.fib/atrial tach.  Received total of lopressor 5 mg x
   5 (2 doses ~ 0200, 3 doses ~ 0500), and metoprolol 200 mg PO over 15
   hours. Rhythm initially controlled with boluses, but has been in and
   out of SVT overnight. Pt scheduled for metoprolol 75 mg TID currently.
   .
   This AM, patient reports feeling well. No CP, palp, SOB.  Had several
   BMs overnight. OOB to commode several times. UA still positive this
   morning but denies any urinary symptoms. Otherwise no new complaints
   but feels deconditioned and unsteady on feet.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with cardiac tamponade secondary to a pulmonary vein isolation procedure and required emergent paracardiocentesis. She had a drop in hemoglobin concentration but was stabilized with phenylephrine. The pericardiocentesis drain was initially unsuccessful to remove due to adhesion to the pericardium, but it was successfully removed under fluoroscopy in the cath lab. There were no signs of reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space post-drain pull, and a transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal cardiac function with mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis and mild aortic and mitral regurgitation. The patient has been experiencing recurrent atrial fibrillation refractory to cardioversion and rate control. She was given multiple doses of metoprolol and converted to oral amiodarone. Her INR is supratherapeutic, so she will have her Coumadin dose decreased. She also has a positive urine analysis, which is being treated with Bactrim. The patient has a left common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm that is stable, and further evaluation and management will be done by vascular surgery. She is currently extubated and receiving ICU care."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient's medical history includes a pericardial effusion without tamponade. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The patient has been experiencing recurrent AFib/atrial tachycardia. Initial attempts at cardioversion were unsuccessful, and the patient received a total of 4300 mg of amiodarone. Metoprolol was also administered to control the heart rate, initially via IV bolus followed by oral doses.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate ranging from 79-151 bpm, blood pressure between 98/65 mmHg and 160/124 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is currently on metoprolol 75 mg TID.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1051 mL, including 240 mL via TPN, 660 mL orally, and 391 mL via IV fluids. Output includes 1875 mL of urine, 160 mL of blood products, and 80 mL of NG drainage, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 824 mL.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 11.2 to 15.2 K/uL. Hematocrit levels are within normal range, but platelet counts are slightly low, ranging from 150-284 K/uL. Electrolyte levels are mostly within normal limits, except for elevated potassium levels. Renal function appears to be normal, and cardiac enzymes are within normal range.

The patient's chest X-ray from September 30th shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette and evidence of pericardial effusion. Subsequent chest X-rays show no significant changes in the cardiac silhouette or effusion size.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary concerns remain atrial fibrillation and pericardial effusion without tamponade. The patient is currently being managed in the ICU for close monitoring and treatment of AFib and associated symptoms."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with cardiac tamponade secondary to a pulmonary vein isolation procedure. She underwent pericardiocentesis and had a drain placed. The patient's hypotension was supported with phenylephrine, and her hematocrit dropped from 45% to 34.7. The pericardial drain was unsuccessfully attempted to be removed on 9/30 but was successfully removed yesterday under fluoroscopy in the cath lab. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction (>55%), mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, mild aortic regurgitation, and mitral regurgitation, with no reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space post-drain pull. Her hemoglobin concentration is 31.9% this morning, and there is no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.

The patient has a history of left common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, which is stable. Vascular evaluation recommends a repeat ultrasound in two weeks, and if the pseudoaneurysm increases from 1.2 to >2 cm, the patient may need a thrombin injection.

The patient's urinalysis was positive on 10/2, and she is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with cardiac tamponade secondary to a pulmonary vein isolation procedure. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and had a drain placed. After the procedure, she developed hypotension but was supported with phenylephrine. The patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped from 45% to 34.7%, but follow-up hemoglobin levels were stable. The pericardiocentesis drain was attempted to be pulled on [**9-30**], but it was unsuccessful as the drain appeared to be adhered to the pericardium. The drain was eventually removed on [**10-1**] under fluoroscopy in the cath lab. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) during and after drain removal showed no reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space and normal cardiac function with mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The patient's rhythm has been refractory to cardioversion and rate control, with evidence of intermittent atrial tachycardia. She is currently on amiodarone 600mg po qd and metoprolol 75 mg TID. Her INR is supratherapeutic at 3.4, and she is holding coumadin today. The plan"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU due to cardiac tamponade during a pulmonary vein isolation procedure. She had a pericardiocentesis performed and a drain was placed, resulting in the removal of 250cc of fluid. The patient experienced hypotension but was supported with phenylephrine. Her hematocrit dropped from 45% to 34.7, but follow-up Hct levels were stable. The pericardial drain was attempted to be pulled on 9/30 but was unsuccessful as it appeared to be adhered to the pericardium. The drain was eventually removed on 10/1 under fluoroscopy in the cath lab. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) during and after drain removal showed normal cardiac function with mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, mild aortic regurgitation, and mitral regurgitation. There was no reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space post-drain pull. The patient is currently being monitored on telemetry with a variable heart rate ranging from the 80s to 140s, primarily controlled with metoprolol. She has ongoing positive urine analysis, which is being treated with Bactrim. The patient also has a left common"

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with cardiac tamponade secondary to a pulmonary vein isolation procedure. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and had a drain placed. The drain was attempted to be removed on 10/1 but was unsuccessful due to adhesion to the pericardium. It was eventually removed under fluoroscopy in the cath lab without any complications.

The patient continues to have recurrent atrial tachycardia despite cardioversion attempts. She is currently on amiodarone 600mg po qd and metoprolol 75 mg q6h for rate control. Her INR is supratherapeutic at 3.4, so Coumadin has been held today and will be decreased to 2.5 mg daily. The patient's urinalysis is positive, and she has started on Bactrim for a 7-day course.

The patient also has a left common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, which is stable and being monitored. Repeat ultrasound in 2 weeks is planned, and if there is an increase in size, thrombin injection may be considered.

The patient's cardiac tamponade resolved after pericardiocentesis and drain placement. No reaccumulation of fluid was seen post-drain removal, and her e"

   # RHYTHM: History of a-fib refractory to cardioversion and rate
   control.  Evidence of atrial tachycardia intermittently.  Continues to
   be tachycardic with variable rate.  Amio loaded and converted to PO.
   Cardioversion yesterday unsuccessful.
   - Continue to monitor on tele
   - Continuing Amiodarone 600mg po qd for 2 weeks
   - Metoprolol 75 mg TID currently
   - Heparin gtt off
   - INR supratherapeutic this morning (3.4), holding coumadin today.
   Will decrease to 2.5 daily (was previously on 2.5/5.0 alternating days)
   .
   # U/A pos [**10-2**], patient asymptomatic.  Foley removed with repeat pos
   U/A this AM.
   - started bactrim with plan for 7 day course

   - repeat u/s in 2 weeks at vascular f/u
   -  if increased from 1.2 to >2 cm, pt may need thrombin injection
   .
   # CARDIAC TAMPONADE: Developed during EP procedure. Paracardiocentesis
   was performed and drain was put in place. 250cc fluid was drained.
   Hypotension developed and pt was supported with phenylephrine. Hct
   dropped 45--> 34.7. Followup Hct
s were stable. Pt was extubated,
   sedation and phenylephrine was weaned.  Attempt was made [**9-30**] to pull
   peridcardiocentesis drain which was unsuccessful as drain appeared to
   be adhesed to pericardium.  Drain was removed [**10-1**] under fluoroscopy in
   cath lab.
   - TTE during/after drain removal showed: There normal (LVEF>55%). with
   mild global RV free wall hypokinesis. Mild AR and MR, and no
   reaccumulation of fluid in pericardial space post drain pull
   - Hct stable, continuing to follow
   - no evidence of RP bleed

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia. The patient presented to the ICU for a pulmonary vein isolation procedure and developed cardiac tamponade during the procedure. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and had a drain placed, but later required removal of the drain due to adhesion to the pericardium. The patient also experienced recurrent atrial tachycardia and was unable to be converted to sinus rhythm through cardioversion. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:

1. Recurrence of atrial tachycardia: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the current episode of atrial tachycardia indicate an ongoing issue with maintaining sinus rhythm. There is a risk of further episodes of tachycardia or development of other arrhythmias.

2. Cardiac tamponade: Although the patient's tamponade was managed promptly, there is still a risk for reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space, leading to recurrent tamponade. Regular follow-up and monitoring will be necessary.

3. Pseudoaneurysm in the left common femoral artery: The patient has a stable pseudoaneurysm, which requires close monitoring. If it increases in size, there may be a need for"
