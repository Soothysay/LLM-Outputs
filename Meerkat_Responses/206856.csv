   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - COPD vs. ventilatory muscle
   weakeness/critical illness myopathy vs. over sedation. In discussion
   with nursing and RT, patient has been difficult to liberate from vent
   [**2-12**] low tidal volumes, especially in setting of narcotics. Small b/l
   pleural effusions not likely to be playing big role and unlikely to be
   corrected until albumin improves.
   - continue slow ventilatory wean, trial of [**5-15**] when sedation minimized
   - decrease sedating meds, consider transition to methadone, plan to
   discuss with pain service in am
   - continue slow steroid taper nebs for COPD
   - complete course of cefepime for VAP
   .
   # Persistent Fevers - possible etiologies include unresolved VAP,
   fungal UTI, persistent abcess in the spine/paraspinal space, pleural
   effusions/atelectasis, drugs. Has been on appropriate rx for VAP and
   [**Name8 (MD) **] RN/RT minimal secretions.
   - obtain MR to further assess spine(discussed w/ rads)
   - empirically treat urine w/ fluc
   - minimize unnecessary meds
   - follow blood cx data
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue above ABX - cefepime, vanc, rifampin, flagyl, follow vanc
   troughs
   .
   #  MRSA epidural abcess s/p thoracic spinal fusion and multiple
   surgical revisions for recurrent infection. Given persistent fevers and
   no clear source with negative blood cultures, urine only showing yeast,
   would benefit from further imaging of spine given persistent drainage
   from wound.
   - IV vanc/rifampin for MRSA osteo until [**7-5**]
   - obtain repeat CT of spine to assess for abcess
   .
   #  VAP - Pseudomonal sensitive to cefepime
   - continue cefepime for total 14 day course, day #1 [**6-5**]
   .
   # Sinus Tachycardia - Persistently tachycardic. Likely [**2-12**] agitation,
   anxiety, pain.
   - obtain EKG in am, check TSH
   - continue tele
   - d/c nodal agents and treat underlying cause
   .
   # C.diff colitis - stool output normal
   - continue flagyl until vancomycin course completed
   .
   # DMII - has been on regular sliding scale w/ TF with moderate control
   in 200s
   - titrate reg sliding scale with down titration of prednisone
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of COPD, diabetes mellitus type II, IgG/IgA deficiency, and MRSA epidural abscess. She underwent thoracic spinal fusion 35 days prior and has had multiple complications and infections requiring re-operation. She was transferred from the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - The patient has been difficult to liberate from the ventilator due to low tidal volumes, especially in the setting of narcotics. It is necessary to continue a slow ventilatory wean and consider a trial of extubation when sedation is minimized.
2. Persistent Fevers - Possible etiologies include unresolved ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), fungal urinary tract infection (UTI), persistent abscess in the spine/paraspinal space, pleural effusions/atelectasis, and drugs. Further investigations such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine, empirical treatment of urine with fluconazole, minimizing unnecessary medications, and following blood culture data are recommended.
3. MRSA Epidural Abscess - The patient would benefit from further imaging of the spine given persistent drainage from the wound. IV vancomycin and rifampin for MRSA osteomyelitis should be continued until July 5th.
4. VAP - Pseudomonal - C"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of COPD, DMII, IgG/IgA deficiency, and MRSA epidural abscess who underwent thoracic spinal fusion. He has had multiple complications and infections requiring re-operation. The patient is currently in the MICU for further management due to persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure, possible pseudomonal VAP, COPD exacerbation, ventilatory muscle weakness/critical illness myopathy, or oversedation. He also has persistent fevers, possibly due to unresolved VAP, fungal UTI, persistent abscess in the spine/paraspinal space, pleural effusions/atelectasis, or drug-induced fever. The patient's other medical conditions include MRSA epidural abscess, c.diff colitis, DMII, and agitation/anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's difficulty in liberating from the ventilator suggests the possibility of pseudomonal VAP, COPD exacerbation, ventilatory muscle weakness/critical illness myopathy, or oversedation. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Persistent Fevers: The patient's persistent fevers may be attributed to unresolved VAP, fungal UTI, persistent abscess in the spine/paraspinal space, pleural effusions/atelectasis, or drug-induced fever. Imaging studies and cultures should be obtained to identify the source of infection.
3. MRSA Epidural Abscess: The patient has an MRSA epidural abscess that required surgical intervention. Continued imaging and antibiotic therapy are necessary to monitor the progress of the abscess.
4. C. diff Colitis: The patient has a history of c.diff colitis, which requires continued treatment with flagyl until vancomycin course is completed.
5. DMII: The patient's DMII needs ongoing management with a sliding scale insulin regimen.
6. Agitation/Anxiety: The patient's agitation and anxiety require further evaluation and treatment, including tapering off clonidine and considering low-dose seroquel. Psychiatric consultation is recommended.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty weaning off the ventilator due to factors such as pseudomonal VAP, COPD, ventilatory muscle weakness/critical illness myopathy, or oversedation. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilatory support are necessary.

2. Fevers: Possible etiologies include unresolved VAP, fungal UTI, persistent abscess in the spine/paraspinal space, pleural effusions/atelectasis, drugs, dental abscess. Further evaluation and management are required, including imaging studies, antibiotic therapy, and investigation of potential sources.

3. MRSA Epidural Abscess: The patient has an ongoing MRSA infection in the epidural space following spinal fusion surgery. Imaging studies and continued antibiotic therapy are needed to address this condition.

4. VAP (Pseudomonal): The patient has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Completion of the prescribed course of cefepime is"

   Assessment and Plan
   50y F w/ COPD, DMII, IgG/IgA deficiency, MRSA epidural abcess s/p
   thoracic spinal fusion POD 35 c/b multiple complications and infections
   requiring re-operation, c. diff colitis, VAP (pseudomonal) and
   persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure transferred from the SICU to
   the MICU for further management.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pseudomonal VAP vs. COPD vs.
   ventilatory muscle weakness/critical illness myopathy vs. oversedation.
   In discussion with nursing and RT, patient has been difficult to
   liberate from vent [**2-12**] low tidal volumes, especially in setting of
   narcotics. Small b/l pleural effusions not likely to be playing big
   role and unlikely to be corrected until albumin improves.
   - continue slow ventilatory wean, trial of [**5-15**] when sedation minimized
   - decrease sedating meds, consider transition to methadone, plan to
   discuss with pain service today
   - continue slow steroid taper nebs for COPD - came in on prednisone
   25mg, currently on prednisone 15mg
   - complete course of cefepime for VAP
   .
   # Persistent Fevers: possible etiologies include unresolved VAP, fungal
   UTI, persistent abscess in the spine/paraspinal space, pleural
   effusions/atelectasis, drugs. Has been on appropriate rx for VAP and
   [**Name8 (MD) **] RN/RT minimal secretions.
   - obtain MR to further assess spine (discussed w/ rads)
   - empirically treating urine w/ fluconazole
   - continue cefepime, vanc (follow troughs), rifampin, flagyl
   - minimize unnecessary meds
   - follow blood cx data
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   #  MRSA epidural abcess s/p thoracic spinal fusion and multiple
   surgical revisions for recurrent infection: Given persistent fevers and
   no clear source with negative blood cultures, urine only showing yeast,
   would benefit from further imaging of spine given persistent drainage
   from wound.
   - IV vanc/rifampin for MRSA osteo until [**7-5**]
   - obtain repeat CT of spine to assess for abscess
   .
   #  VAP: Pseudomonal sensitive to cefepime
   - continue cefepime for total 14 day course, day #1 [**6-5**]
   .
   # Sinus Tachycardia: Persistently tachycardic. Likely [**2-12**] agitation,
   anxiety, pain.
   - obtain EKG in am, check TSH
   - continue tele
   - d/c nodal agents and treat underlying cause
   .
   # C.diff colitis: stool output normal
   - continue flagyl until vancomycin course completed
   .
   # DMII: has been on regular sliding scale w/ TF with moderate control
   in 200s
   - titrate reg sliding scale with down titration of prednisone
   .
   #  Agitation/Anxiety: Has been on ativan, zyprexa, this admission.
   Evaluated by psych/neuro, recommended EEG in setting of extremity
   tremors/""twitches""
   - obtain EEG as recommend; consider reconsult of neuro pending EEG
   - f/u psych recs. consider decreasing clonidine; will discuss
   alternative meds w/ psych in am

","The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of COPD, DMII, IgG/IgA deficiency, MRSA epidural abscess post thoracic spinal fusion, multiple complications, and infections requiring re-operation. She was transferred from the SICU to the MICU for further management due to persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure, pseudomonal VAP, critical illness myopathy, and oversedation.

The patient has been difficult to liberate from the ventilator, and it is challenging to determine if this is due to COPD, pseudomonal VAP, ventilatory muscle weakness/critical illness myopathy, or oversedation. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present but are not likely to be playing a significant role.

The plan includes continuing a slow ventilatory wean, starting a trial of extubation between days 5-15 when sedation is minimized. The sedating medications will be decreased, considering a transition to methadone, and discussing with the pain service today. Nebulized steroids for COPD will continue, and the patient is currently on prednisone 15mg. A complete course of cefepime for VAP will be completed.

Persistent fevers may be caused by unresolved VAP, fungal UTI, persistent abscess in the spine/paraspinal space, pleural effusions/atelectasis, or drugs. Appropriate antibiotics for VAP have already been administered. MR imaging will be"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of COPD, DMII, IgG/IgA deficiency, and multiple complications including an MRSA epidural abscess following thoracic spinal fusion. She was transferred to the MICU from the SICU due to persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure, VAP (pseudomonal), and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been difficult to liberate from the vent, possibly due to pseudomonal VAP, COPD, ventilatory muscle weakness/critical illness myopathy, or oversedation. Low tidal volumes and small bilateral pleural effusions may be contributing to the issue. A slow ventilatory wean is planned when sedation is minimized.

2. Persistent Fevers: Possible etiologies include unresolved VAP, fungal UTI, persistent abscess in the spine/paraspinal space, pleural effusions/atelectasis, drugs, dental abscess, or CNS infectious process. Further imaging studies, such as an MRI of the spine and a panorex to rule out a dental abscess, are recommended. Empirically treating urine with fluconazole and continuing cefepime, vanc, rifampin, and flagyl are advised.

3. MRSA Epidural Abscess: The patient had an MRSA epidural abscess post-thoracic spinal"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing various medical complications, including hypoglycemia, anxiety, impaired skin integrity, activity intolerance, pain control, and an inability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).

24-hour events:
- Psych recommended not starting seroquel until after EEG because it can suppress seizure.
- Consulted neuro-EMG service who will do EMG for?neuromyopathy on Monday unless one of the residents does it over the weekend.
- ID recommended treating VAP X 8 days, re-imaging spine to look for persistent infection, fluconazole X 7 days, and no longer necessary to check vanc troughs.
- One port of PICC was blocked -> tpa ordered with good effect.
- Neurontin taper started (400mg TID X 1 day = [**6-15**], 200mg TID X 1 day, 100mg TID X 1 day then off) because can cause fever and tremor.
- CT face and EEG ordered and are pending.
- MRI t/l spine ordered but can't get it until know what type of IVC filter she has.

   EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG recording due to the slow and
   disorganized pattern and the bursts of generalized slowing. This
   abnormality suggests a widespread encephalopathy. Medications,
   metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
   Of note is that although the right leg twitching had no EEG correlate
   it does not completely exclude the possibility of the patient having
   focal motor seizures. There are no epileptiform features seen in this
   recording and no lateralized features. Note is made of a tachycardia
   with a single ectopic beat
   CT sinus: pansinus mucosal thickening most prominent in right maxillary
   sinus which may represent sinusitis but no focal fluid collections
   Assessment and Plan
   50y F w/ COPD, DMII, IgG/IgA deficiency, MRSA epidural abscess s/p
   thoracic spinal fusion POD 35 c/b multiple complications and infections
   requiring re-operation, c. diff colitis, VAP (pseudomonal) and
   persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure transferred from the SICU to
   the MICU for further management.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pseudomonal VAP vs. COPD vs.
   ventilatory muscle weakness/critical illness myopathy vs. oversedation.
   In discussion with nursing and RT, patient has been difficult to
   liberate from vent [**2-12**] low tidal volumes, especially in setting of
   narcotics. Small b/l pleural effusions not likely to be playing big
   role and unlikely to be corrected until albumin improves.
   - Continue slow ventilatory wean, trial of [**5-15**] when sedation minimized
   - Decrease sedating meds, consider transition to methadone, plan to
   discuss with pain service today
   - Continue slow 5mg q3d steroid taper and nebs for COPD (came in on
   prednisone 25mg, currently on prednisone 15mg)
   - Completed 10-day course of cefepime for VAP
   - Consider EMG to r/o myopathy (contact [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1621**])
   .
   # Persistent Fevers: possible etiologies include unresolved VAP, fungal
   UTI, persistent abscess in the spine/paraspinal space, pleural
   effusions/atelectasis, drugs, dental abscess. MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] to be
   med-induced although CNS infectious process possible. Has been on

   - F/u MRI T/L spine, and CT sinus read
   - Holding off on IR-guided LP for now pending above studies per ID recs
   as clinical status would likely be worse if had untreated meningitis
   for so long
   - Continue vanc & rifampin for MRSA abscess; flagyl for C. diff,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, DMII, IgG/IgA deficiency, and MRSA epidural abscess status post thoracic spinal fusion. She has been admitted to the ICU for further management due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, persistent fevers, possible VAP, COPD exacerbation, and other complications.

The patient has been difficult to liberate from the ventilator, and there are concerns about pseudomonal VAP, ventilatory muscle weakness/critical illness myopathy, oversedation, small bilateral pleural effusions, and COPD exacerbation. The plan is to continue a slow ventilatory wean and decrease sedating medications. An EMG may be considered to rule out myopathy.

The patient has persistent fevers, and possible etiologies include unresolved VAP, fungal UTI, persistent abscess in the spine/paraspinal space, pleural effusions/atelectasis, drugs, dental abscess, and CNS infectious process. Further investigations such as an MRI T/L spine and CT sinus are planned.

The patient has a yeast-positive UCx, and fluconazole has been prescribed for 7 days. She also has an MRSA epidural abscess s/p thoracic spinal fusion with multiple surgical revisions for recurrent infection. IV vancomycin and rifampin will be continued until 7/5. Repeat CT and MRI of the spine are also"

   EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG recording due to the slow and
   disorganized pattern and the bursts of generalized slowing. This
   abnormality suggests a widespread encephalopathy. Medications,
   metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
   Of note is that although the right leg twitching had no EEG correlate
   it does not completely exclude the possibility of the patient having
   focal motor seizures. There are no epileptiform features seen in this

   requiring re-operation, c. diff colitis, VAP (pseudomonal) and
   persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure transferred from the SICU to
   the MICU for further management.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pseudomonal VAP vs. COPD vs.
   ventilatory muscle weakness/critical illness myopathy vs. oversedation.
   In discussion with nursing and RT, patient has been difficult to
   liberate from vent [**2-12**] low tidal volumes, especially in setting of
   narcotics. Small b/l pleural effusions not likely to be playing big
   role and unlikely to be corrected until albumin improves.
   - Continue slow ventilatory wean, trial of [**5-15**] when sedation minimized
   - Decrease sedating meds, consider transition to methadone, plan to
   discuss with pain service today
   - Continue slow 5mg q3d steroid taper nebs for COPD (came in on
   prednisone 25mg, currently on prednisone 15mg)
   - Complete course of cefepime for VAP
   - Consider EMG to r/o myopathy (contact [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1621**])
   .
   # Persistent Fevers: possible etiologies include unresolved VAP, fungal
   UTI, persistent abscess in the spine/paraspinal space, pleural
   effusions/atelectasis, drugs, dental abscess. MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] to be
   med-induced although CNS infectious process possible. Has been on
   appropriate rx for VAP and [**Name8 (MD) **] RN/RT minimal secretions.
   - Will d/w Neurorads best study (CT v. MRI) to assess spine given
   clinical status
   - Obtain panorex to r/o dental abscess given poor dentition; consider
   maxillofacial c/s as needed
   - Holding off on IR-guided LP for now pending spine imaging and EEG per
   ID recs as clinical status likely worse if had untreated meningitis for
   so long
   - Empirically treating urine w/ fluconazole
   - Continue cefepime, vanc (follow troughs), rifampin, flagyl
   - Minimize unnecessary meds. Hydralazine discontinued previously. Taper
   clonidine and steroids.  Switch famotidine to PPI.
   - Consider removing PICC although surveillance cx NGTD; f/u pending bcx
   - F/u ID recs
   .
   #  MRSA epidural abcess s/p thoracic spinal fusion and multiple
   surgical revisions for recurrent infection: Given persistent fevers and
   no clear source with negative blood cultures, urine only showing yeast,
   would benefit from further imaging of spine given persistent drainage
   from wound.
   - IV vanc/rifampin for MRSA osteo until [**7-5**]
   - Obtain repeat CT of spine to assess for abscess
   .
   #  VAP: Cefepime-sensitive Pseudomonas.
   - Continue cefepime for total 14 day course, day #1 [**6-5**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of COPD, DMII, IgG/IgA deficiency, and MRSA epidural abscess status post thoracic spinal fusion. He was transferred from the SICU to the MICU for further management due to multiple complications and infections. The patient has persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure, which could be due to pseudomonal VAP, COPD, ventilatory muscle weakness/critical illness myopathy, or oversedation. The patient also has persistent fevers, possibly from unresolved VAP, fungal UTI, persistent abscess in the spine/paraspinal space, pleural effusions/atelectasis, drugs, or dental abscess. The patient is being treated for VAP and has ongoing issues with MRSA epidural abscess, sinus tachycardia, C.diff colitis, DMII, and agitation/anxiety. Further imaging of the spine is needed to assess for abscess, and an EEG is recommended to evaluate extremity tremors/twitches. The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonal VAP vs. COPD vs. ventilatory muscle weakness/critical illness myopathy vs. oversedation leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
2. Unresolved VAP, fungal UTI, persistent abscess in the spine/paraspinal space, pleural effusions/"

She was transferred from the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is tolerating a tracheostomy mask trial and is being screened for vent mask. Decreasing sedating medications and transitioning to fentanyl for pain management is recommended. Slow steroid taper and nebulizers for COPD control should continue.
2. Persistent Fevers: Possible etiologies include persistent epidural abscess given recent MRI spine findings. Less likely causes are fungal urinary tract infection (UTI) or treated VAP, fungal UTI, pleural effusions/atelectasis. Drug fever possibility should be considered. Follow-up CT recommendations with plan for interventional radiology (IR)-guided abscess drainage on Monday, follow-up with infectious disease (ID) recommendations, and continue vancomycin and rifampin for MRSA abscess.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of COPD, diabetes mellitus type II, IgG/IgA deficiency, and MRSA epidural abscess post thoracic spinal fusion. She was transferred to the MICU from the SICU for further management due to persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure, pseudomonal VAP, multiple complications, and infections requiring reoperation. The patient has been difficult to liberate from the ventilator, and her sedating medications are being decreased. The potential medical complications that can arise include hypercarbic respiratory failure, MRSA infection, yeast infection, C. difficile colitis, agitation/anxiety, diabetes management, and encephalopathy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can be caused by factors such as pseudomonal VAP, COPD, ventilatory muscle weakness/critical illness myopathy, or oversedation. It is important to continue slow ventilatory weaning and minimize sedating medications.
2. MRSA Infection: The patient has an MRSA epidural abscess post thoracic spinal fusion and multiple surgical revisions for recurrent infection. She is currently on IV vancomycin and rifampin for MRSA osteo. Repeat CT and MRI scans are needed to assess for abscess.
3. Yeast Infection: The patient's urine culture showed yeast, and she is currently on"

   MRI T/L-spine: 1. Since the previous MRI of [**2131-5-22**], there is now
   increased fluid seen surrounding the interbody device placed following
   corpectomy with fluid extending into the anterior epidural space on the
   left side, narrowing the spinal canal at T7 and T8 level with
   compression of the spinal cord. 2. Superficial fluid collection in the
   left upper thoracic region and also fluid extending from laminectomy
   site to subcutaneous fat in the upper thoracic region. The fluid
   extending from the laminectomy site to the subcutaneous fat has
   considerably decreased since the previous study. 3. Extensive bilateral
   pleural parenchymal changes in the lungs, which can be further
   evaluated with CT of the chest.
   Assessment and Plan
   50y F w/ COPD, DMII, IgG/IgA deficiency, MRSA epidural abscess s/p

   ventilatory muscle weakness/critical illness myopathy vs. oversedation.
   In discussion with nursing and RT, patient has been difficult to
   liberate from vent [**2-12**] low tidal volumes, especially in setting of
   narcotics. Small b/l pleural effusions not likely to be playing big
   role and unlikely to be corrected until albumin improves.
   - Continue slow ventilatory wean, trial of [**5-15**] when sedation minimized
   - Decrease sedating meds, consider transition to methadone, plan to
   discuss with pain service today
   - Continue slow 5mg q3d steroid taper and nebs for COPD (came in on
   prednisone 25mg, currently on prednisone 15mg)
   - Completed 10-day course of cefepime for VAP
   - Consider EMG to r/o myopathy (contact [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1621**])

   fluconazole for yeast in urine. D/c cefepime as completed 10 days
   (8-day course recommended per ID).
   - Minimize unnecessary meds. Hydralazine discontinued previously.
   Switch famotidine to PPI. Taperering clonidine, steroids, neurontin
   (400mg TID X 1 day = [**6-15**], 200mg TID X 1 day, 100mg TID X 1 day then

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of COPD, DMII, IgG/IgA deficiency, and MRSA epidural abscess status post thoracic spinal fusion and multiple surgical revisions for recurrent infection. She has been transferred from the SICU to the MICU for further management.

The patient has persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be due to pseudomonal VAP, COPD, ventilatory muscle weakness/critical illness myopathy, or oversedation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes and has small bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient also has persistent fevers, possibly due to unresolved VAP, fungal UTI, persistent abscess in the spine/paraspinal space, pleural effusions/atelectasis, drugs, dental abscess, or CNS infectious process. An MRI T/L-spine and CT sinus are pending for further evaluation.

The patient has a yeast-positive urine culture and is being treated with fluconazole. She has an MRSA epidural abscess s/p thoracic spinal fusion and is receiving IV vancomycin and rifampin for MRSA osteo until 7/5. Repeat CT and MRI spine are planned.

The patient had completed a 10-day course of cefepime for VAP, which was sensitive to Pseudomonas. ID recommended an 8-day course, so cefepime will be discontinued today.

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo female admitted initially with epidural abscess and now with
   prolonged hosptial course complicated by persistent respiratory
   (hypercarbic) failure and now able to tolerate intermittent trach
   collars through today.  Of concern in the setting of intermittent
   fevers has been findings of significant fluid in epidural space and
   qestion of cord compromise.  In the setting of these fevers she has had
   relative stability of WBC and hemodynamics.
   1)Respiratory Failure-patient able to be able to be weaned to trach
   mask this morning in the setting of treatment for VAP, obstructive lung
   disease.
   -PSV support overnight and intermittently throughout the day.
   -Continue with suctioning
   -Atrovent
   -Prednisone 50mg and will continue to wean
   2)Sepsis-Now with continued fevers noted.  Dental abscess raised as
   possible concern, has epi-dural region collection and will move to
   sample.  Treatment continuing for known sources
   -Vanco/Rifampin
MRSA abscess
   -Flagyl-C. Diff
   -Fluconazole.
   -Follow up blood cultures
   -Will need ID input to continue to prioritize potentially infected
   targets and consideration of sampling and would consider sampling of
   epidural source given persistent drainage and fevers.
   3)Tachycardia-
   -Control anxiety and pain
   -Move to Fentanyl patch dose increase
   -Anxiety to be contolled with careful use of pharmacologic agents
   -Psych to evaluate today for further aid

","The patient is a 50-year-old female admitted initially with an epidural abscess and now with a prolonged hospital course complicated by persistent respiratory failure and intermittent fevers. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, with a heart rate of 133 bpm, and mild hypotension, with a blood pressure of 138/63 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a tracheostomy mask with PSV support, Atrovent, and Prednisone.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the new finding of compression and fluid collection in the epidural space, which is causing concern for cord compromise. The patient has a history of allergies to aspirin, codeine, erythromycin base, penicillins, influenza virus vaccine, and latex. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was metronidazole on 06/15/2131 at 12:00 PM, cefepime on 06/16/2131 at 07:11 AM, and vancomycin on 06/17/2131 at 09:07 AM.

The patient is currently receiving various ICU medications, including hydromorphone (Dilaudid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other medications. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 436 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of COPD, DMII, IgG/IgA deficiency, MRSA epidural abscess, and previous thoracic spinal fusion. She was transferred from the SICU to the MICU for further management due to multiple complications and infections. The patient has several ongoing medical issues including hypercarbic respiratory failure, persistent fevers, MRSA epidural abscess, C. diff colitis, yeast infection, VAP, sinus tachycardia, agitation/anxiety, and DMII.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure despite weaning off the ventilator. Continuous monitoring and management of her respiratory status are necessary.
2. Persistent Fevers: The patient's persistent fevers may be attributed to the MRSA epidural abscess. Further investigation and treatment are required, including a follow-up CT scan and intervention by interventional radiology for drainage of the abscess.
3. MRSA Epidural Abscess: The patient has an MRSA epidural abscess that requires aggressive treatment with appropriate antibiotics, such as vancomycin and rifampin. Surgical intervention might be necessary depending on the clinical situation.
4. C. diff Colitis: Although the patient's stool output is normal, she has a history of C. diff colitis. It is important to continue monitoring her bowel movements and complete the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of COPD, diabetes mellitus type II, IgG/IgA deficiency, and MRSA epidural abscess post thoracic spinal fusion. She has been admitted to the ICU due to multiple complications and infections requiring re-operation. The patient has persistent fevers, hypercarbic respiratory failure, MRSA epidural abscess, C. diff colitis, yeast in urine, and VAP. She also has agitation/anxiety, sinus tachycardia, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent fevers: The patient's persistent fevers may indicate an ongoing infection, such as the MRSA epidural abscess or other possible etiologies like fungal UTI, treated VAP, or pleural effusions/atelectasis. Further investigations are needed to identify the cause and guide treatment.

2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's weaning off the ventilator and tolerating short periods on a tracheal mask suggest improvement in her respiratory status. However, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further respiratory complications.

3. MRSA epidural abscess: The patient has an MRSA epidural abscess that requires appropriate antibiotic therapy. Increasing fluid collection suggests a new infection/abscess, which may explain the fevers and alter the current treatment plan. Ortho spine and ID recs should be followed for further evaluation and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing various medical complications including impaired ADLs and IADLs, impaired balance, impaired muscle performance, impaired oral hygiene tasks, impaired transfers, anxiety, impaired skin integrity, activity intolerance, and pain control. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and the current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. There is a risk of respiratory failure due to exacerbation of underlying lung disease or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Sepsis: The patient has yellow discharge from a small wound overlying the L-spine, indicating a possible infection. This could progress to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and the presence of a PICC line. Prophylactic measures such as boots and subcutaneous UF heparin are in place, but close monitoring for signs of DVT is essential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of COPD, DMII, IgG/IgA deficiency, MRSA epidural abscess following thoracic spinal fusion, and multiple complications and infections requiring re-operation. She was transferred from the SICU to the MICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent Fevers: The patient has been afebrile yesterday, but possible etiologies include persistent epidural abscess given recent MRI spine. Less likely fungal UTI or treated VAP, fungal UTI, pleural effusions/atelectasis. Drug fever possibility.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient was weaned off vent and tolerated short periods on trach mask. She needs to be closely monitored for any signs of respiratory distress or failure.
3. MRSA Epidural Abscess: Increased fluid collection suggestive of new infection/abscess which may explain fevers and would alter current treatment plan.
4. C.diff Colitis: Stool output normal. Continue flagyl until vancomycin course completed.
5. Yeast+ Ucx: Fluconazole x 7 days.
6. VAP: Cefepime-sensitive Pseudomonas. Completed 10-day course.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of COPD, DMII, IgG/IgA deficiency, MRSA epidural abscess following thoracic spinal fusion surgery. She was admitted to the SICU and then transferred to the MICU for further management. The patient has multiple complications and infections, including a re-operation for MRSA epidural abscess, c.diff colitis, pseudomonal VAP, and persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent Fevers: The patient has had persistent fevers, which could be due to the persistent epidural abscess, fungal UTI, or drug fever. Further evaluation is needed, including CT thorax with/without contrast to visualize fluid collections and consultation with ID for guidance.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to COPD exacerbation. Weaning off the ventilator and increasing tracheostomy mask trials should be considered. Nebulizers for COPD management and steroid taper should be continued.
3. MRSA Epidural Abscess: The patient has an MRSA epidural abscess, which requires ongoing antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and rifampin. Ortho spine and ID consultations are necessary for further management.
4. C. diff Colitis: The patient had c.diff colitis, but her stool output is now normal. Flagyl should be continued until the vancom"

   Assessment and Plan
   50y F w/ COPD, DMII, IgG/IgA deficiency, MRSA epidural abscess s/p
   thoracic spinal fusion POD 35 c/b multiple complications and infections
   requiring re-operation, c. diff colitis, pseudomonal VAP and persistent
   hypercarbic respiratory failure transferred from the SICU to the MICU
   for further management.
   .
   # Persistent Fevers: Afebrile since [**6-14**]. Possible etiologies include
   persistent epidural abscess given recent MRI spine but unable to drain;
   thought to have only small superficial pockets often consistent with
   postsurgical changes per Radiolology. Fever ource less likely fungal
   UTI or treated VAP, fungal UTI, pleural effusions/atelectasis. Unable
   to obtain panorex [**2-12**] cooperation but no fluid collections seen on CT
   face. Drug fever possibility.
   - Patient went IR-guided fluid drainage, but unable to drain any fluid.
   - F/u ID recs
   - Continue vanc & rifampin for MRSA abscess; flagyl for C. diff,
   fluconazole x 7d for yeast in urine. Completed cefepime course for VAP.
   - Minimize unnecessary meds. Hydralazine discontinued previously.
   Switch famotidine to PPI. Tapering clonidine, steroids, neurontin
   - F/u pending bcx; no need to remove PICC given negative cultures
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: patient has tolerated short periods
   on trach mask
   - Decrease sedating meds, increased her fentanyl patch per chronic pain
   recs.
   - 3 or 4-hour trach mask trials [**Hospital1 **], increase as tolerated. F/U ABGs
   while on mask
   - Continue slow 5mg q3d steroid taper and nebs for COPD
   - Consider diuresis today
   .
   #  MRSA epidural abcess s/p thoracic spinal fusion and multiple
   surgical revisions for recurrent infection: Increased fluid collection
   concerning for new infection/abscess but unable to drain. Not thought
   by Ortho spine to represent infection.
   - f/u Ortho spine and ID recs
   - IV vanc/rifampin for MRSA osteo until [**7-5**] for now
   .
   # C.diff colitis: Stool output normal.
   - Continue flagyl until vancomycin course completed
   .
   # Yeast+ Ucx: Fluconzaole x 7 days to end on [**2131-6-21**]
   .
   # Sinus Tachycardia: Persistently tachycardic likely due to agitation
   and pain. TSH nl.
   - Continue tele
   - Will f/u Chronic Pain and Psych recs
   .
   #  Agitation/Anxiety: Has been on ativan, zyprexa, this admission.
   Evaluated by psych/neuro. EEG suggests widespread encephalopathy c/w
   meds v. metabolic v. infectious although cannot exclude focal motor
   seizures as etiology of extremity tremors/""twitches
   - F/u psych recs and touch base with psychiastrist/therapist to see
   what medication might be best
   - Taper off clonidine (started for unclear reasons) and gabapentin;
   - continue low dose ativan prn for agitation per psych.
   .
   # DMII: Has been on regular sliding scale w/ TF with moderate control.
   - Titrate RISS prn with down-titration of prednisone

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including COPD, diabetes mellitus type II, IgG/IgA deficiency, and MRSA epidural abscess status post thoracic spinal fusion. The patient has been through multiple complications and infections requiring re-operation, as well as Clostridium difficile colitis, pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include persistent fevers, hypercarbic respiratory failure, MRSA epidural abscess, C. difficile colitis, yeast infection in urine, sinus tachycardia, agitation/anxiety, and diabetes mellitus type II.

The patient's persistent fevers may be due to an ongoing infection or inflammation, possibly related to the epidural abscess. The patient has been on various antibiotics, including vancomycin and rifampin for MRSA, Flagyl for C. difficile, and fluconazole for yeast in urine.

The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is likely due to COPD exacerbation and the need for weaning off mechanical ventilation. The plan is to decrease sedating medications and increase the patient's fentanyl patch for chronic pain management. Tracheostomy mask trials will be attempted, and the patient will be monitored for ABGs while on the mask.

The MRSA epidural abscess is still present, and there is increased fluid collection concerning"
