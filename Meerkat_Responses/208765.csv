   Assessment and Plan
   62F with medical history of DM, PVD, ESRD on HD, COPD with altered
   mental status and shortness of breath found to be hypoxic with
   leukocytosis and consolidation on imaging consistent with pneumonia.
   .
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The differential includes hypoxemia, hypocapnia
   or some combination of the two or possibly infection resulting in
   encephalopathy. Possible that developed mucus plug with hypoxemia with
   resolution and significant improvement on BIPAP.
   - goal O2 sat 90-92%
   - ABG if mental status changes
   - antibiotics for pneumonia as below
   .
   #HYPOXIA: Likely that pulmonary infection resulted in V/Q mismatch
   contributing to low SpO2. [**Month (only) 51**] be some element of bronchoconstriction
   contributing with improvement on nebs. Patient with diastolic heart
   failure but appears clinically euvolemic with possibly mild pulmonary
   edema on plain film. ACS considered although no EKG changes. Currently
   patient comfortable w/ O2 sats in low 90s on nasal cannula.
   - continuous O2 monitoring
   - supplemental O2 to goal 90-92%
   - antibiotics for pneumonia as below
   - Duonebs standing and PRN
   - check BNP
   - trend cardiac enzymes.
   .
   PNEUMONIA: The shortness of breath, cough, elevated white count with
   left shift and RUL infiltrate on chest film are consistent with
   pneumonia. Given her history of dialysis, she meets the definition for
   a healthcare acquired infection.  She is immune competant and has a
   CURB-65 score of 2 (confusion, elevated BUN). CT scan shows pneumonia
   but no evidence of cavitation (as appeared on CXR).
   - sputum culture
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Continue ceftriaxone, azithromycin, ampicillin
   - supportive treatment of cough
   - Duonebs
   .
   POSITIVE CARDIAC BIOMARKERS: Patient with [**Location (un) 1204**] risk factors of DM
   and PVD presents with SOB, without significant ST changes on EKG and
   elevated cardiac biomarkers. While can expect some elevation of cardiac
   biomarkers in setting of ESRD, this appears to be much higher than
   previously recorded values and troponins continue to trend up. While
   unlikley to be ACS given absence of EKG changes, Elevated troponin may
   be due to demand ischemia, sepsis, tachyarrhythmia, heart failure.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - re-check EKG
   - trend CE
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   - continue beta blocker
   .
   ESRD: Patient with ESRD on hemodialysis on Monday/Wednesday/Friday
   schedule currently being evaluated for renal transplant. Patient with
   electrolytes at baseline.  Last HD [**2163-4-22**] with 3 L of fluid removed.
   - Hemodialysis on M/W/F
   - Consult renal given need for HD in house
   - continue on calcium acetate and calcitriol

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- The patient presented with altered mental status, shortness of breath, and hypoxemia.
- Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis and consolidation on imaging consistent with pneumonia.
- The patient's condition has been monitored closely, and various interventions have been implemented to address the identified medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low SpO2 levels indicate a possible hypoxia due to pulmonary infection resulting in V/Q mismatch. This could be further exacerbated by bronchoconstriction. Continuous O2 monitoring and supplemental O2 to maintain target SpO2 levels of 90-92% should be continued.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, elevated white count with left shift, and RUL infiltrate on chest film are consistent with pneumonia. Given her history of dialysis, she meets the definition for a healthcare-acquired infection. Antibiotics have been initiated, and further cultures and supportive treatments should be continued.
3. Positive Cardiac Biomarkers: The patient presents with elevated cardiac biomarkers, which may indicate acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or other cardiac issues. Monitoring on telemetry, re-checking EKG, trending cardiac enzymes, and continuing antiplate"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was found with altered mental status and shortness of breath, leading to hospitalization in the ICU.

24-hour events include a trans-thoracic echo, fever, and an abnormal chest X-ray suggesting a cavitary lesion. The patient received Tylenol for the fever, and a CT chest showed large pneumonia but no cavitary lesions. She became hypotensive after dialysis and received a saline bolus with resolution. The patient was started on heparin due to upward trending troponin levels.

The patient has allergies to hydralazine Hcl, iodine, and renal toxicity. She was previously on antibiotics, specifically azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 165/54 to 180/65 mmHg, heart rate between 78 and 102 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination findings include bibasilar rales on lung auscultation, dry/scaling skin, and warm extrem"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with medical history of DM, PVD, ESRD on HD, COPD with altered
   mental status and shortness of breath found to be hypoxic with
   leukocytosis and consolidation on imaging consistent with pneumonia.
   .
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The differential includes hypoxemia, hypocapnia
   or some combination of the two or possibly infection resulting in
   encephalopathy. Possible that developed mucus plug with hypoxemia with
   resolution and significant improvement on BIPAP.
   - goal O2 sat 90-92%
   - ABG if mental status changes
   - antibiotics for pneumonia as below
   .
   #HYPOXIA: Likely that pulmonary infection resulted in V/Q mismatch
   contributing to low SpO2. [**Month (only) 51**] be some element of bronchoconstriction
   contributing with improvement on nebs. Patient with diastolic heart
   failure but appears clinically euvolemic with possibly mild pulmonary
   edema on plain film. ACS considered although no EKG changes. Currently
   patient comfortable w/ O2 sats in low 90s on nasal cannula.
   - continuous O2 monitoring
   - supplemental O2 to goal 90-92%
   - antibiotics for pneumonia as below
   - Duonebs standing and PRN
   - check BNP
   - trend cardiac enzymes.
   .
   PNEUMONIA: The shortness of breath, cough, elevated white count with
   left shift and RUL infiltrate on chest film are consistent with
   pneumonia. Given her history of dialysis, she meets the definition for
   a healthcare acquired infection.  She is immune competant and has a
   CURB-65 score of 2 (confusion, elevated BUN). CT scan shows pneumonia
   but no evidence of cavitation (as appeared on CXR).
   - sputum culture
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Continue ceftriaxone, azithromycin, ampicillin
   - supportive treatment of cough
   - Duonebs
   .
   POSITIVE CARDIAC BIOMARKERS: Patient with [**Location (un) 1204**] risk factors of DM
   and PVD presents with SOB, without significant ST changes on EKG and
   elevated cardiac biomarkers. While can expect some elevation of cardiac
   biomarkers in setting of ESRD, this appears to be much higher than
   previously recorded values and troponins continue to trend up. While
   unlikley to be ACS given absence of EKG changes, Elevated troponin may
   be due to demand ischemia, sepsis, tachyarrhythmia, heart failure.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - re-check EKG
   - trend CE
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   - continue beta blocker
   .
   ESRD: Patient with ESRD on hemodialysis on Monday/Wednesday/Friday
   schedule currently being evaluated for renal transplant. Patient with
   electrolytes at baseline.  Last HD [**2163-4-22**] with 3 L of fluid removed.
   - Hemodialysis on M/W/F
   - Consult renal given need for HD in house
   - continue on calcium acetate and calcitriol
   .
   PVD
   - continue aspirin
   - continue plavix
   .
   DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen with ISS
   .
   HYPERTENSION:
   - continue labetalol, amlodipine, lisinopril
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, shortness of breath, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and consolidation on imaging consistent with pneumonia. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fever spikes to 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, hypotension, and an episode of dizziness/lightheadedness after dialysis. She received a slow saline bolus, which resolved the hypotension and symptomatic orthostasis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4 degrees Celsius (101.2 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 165/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently on BIPAP and receiving supplemental oxygen. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin T levels. Imaging studies reveal large pneumonia without evidence of cavitation. The patient is also diagnosed with diastolic heart failure, but appears clinically euvolemic with possibly mild pulmonary edema on plain film. The patient has positive cardiac biomarkers, indicating possible myocardial"
