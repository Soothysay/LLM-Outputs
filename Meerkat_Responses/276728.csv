   Plan:
   # Altered mental status: Several possible etiologies at this point.
   Concern for underlying infection, however no other localizing symptoms
   aside from her mental status. No leukocytosis but mild left shift.
   Afebrile. UA is negative. [**Month (only) 51**] also represent hypertensive
   emergency/encephalopathy. Radiology mentioned concern for PRES
   (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome), which can be caused by
   cisplatin.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with progressive altered mental status, hypertension, and suspected malignant hypertension crisis or emergency. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to either PRES (Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) or metastatic disease to the brain. The patient's blood pressure is now controlled, and she is receiving hydralazine IV every six hours. The elevated lactate levels are likely related to decreased ability to process in the setting of liver metastasis. The patient's nutrition is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) as she is too somnolent to eat. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. PRES (Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome): This condition can present with altered mental status and symptoms such as headache, seizures, and visual disturbances. It is often associated with hypertension and can be seen in patients undergoing certain chemotherapy treatments.

2. Metastatic disease to the brain: Breast cancer can metastasize to the brain, leading to neurological symptoms including altered mental status.

3. Hypertensive crisis/emergency: The patient's high blood pressure values indicate a hypertensive crisis or emergency, which can lead to organ damage if not promptly managed.

4. Liver metastasis: The patient's elevated lactate levels suggest decreased liver function, which can result in impaired metabolism and other complications.

5. Thiamine deficiency: Given the patient's poor"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer presenting with progressive altered mental status. She has been diagnosed with malignant hypertension, which is a hypertensive crisis or emergency. There is concern for underlying infection, but no localizing symptoms aside from altered mental status. The patient's blood pressure is currently being controlled with labetalol. The cause of her altered mental status could be related to metastatic disease to the brain or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) possibly secondary to chemotherapy. The patient's nutrition is currently NPO, but they will consider feeding once she is less somnolent. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: Despite being afebrile and having negative urine analysis, there is still concern for an underlying infection. Monitoring the white blood cell count and fever curve is important. Continuing vancomycin and cefepime may help prevent or treat any potential infections.

2. Hypertensive Emergency/Encephalopathy: The patient's high blood pressure is causing a hypertensive emergency, which can lead to end-organ damage. Labetalol drip is being used to control her blood pressure, but further management will depend on the results of the neuro consult and MRI.

3. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient's altered mental status could be related to metastatic disease to the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of breast cancer widely metastatic, currently admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and hypertension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 127/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is sedated and intubated. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, no evidence of dehydration or edema, and normal cardiovascular findings. The patient has bilateral radial and digital pulses present. Respiratory examination is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal examination shows soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. Extremities are warm and well-perfused without cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination shows the patient attentive and follows simple commands, responding to verbal stimuli, but not oriented. 

Laboratory findings include leukocytopenia with a WBC count of 3.4 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 82 K/uL, elevated creatinine at 0.7 mg/dL, elevated troponin-T at 0.02 mg/dL, and elevated lactate at 5.1 mmol/L. Other lab results are within normal limits.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with altered mental status, hypertension, and a history of breast cancer with metastasis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various medical complications. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. PRES (Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome): This condition is characterized by symptoms such as altered mental status, headache, seizures, and visual disturbances. The MRI/MRA head/neck will help determine if PRES is present.

2. Embolic CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident): An embolic CVA occurs when a blood clot travels to the brain, causing a stroke. The MRI/MRA head/neck will also help evaluate this possibility.

3. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which could lead to hypertensive emergency. Transitioning to oral medications will help control the blood pressure.

4. Infection: The presence of fever, altered mental status, and elevated lactate levels may suggest an underlying infection. Cultures and appropriate antibiotics should be considered.

5. Seizure: The patient's altered mental status and somnolence could be related to a seizure. An electroencephalogram (EEG) may be useful in assessing seizure activity.

6. Metastatic Disease: The patient's history of breast cancer with metastasis increases the likelihood of metastatic disease involving the brain or other organs. Further imaging studies may be necessary to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of breast cancer that has widely metastasized and is considered progressive. She is currently in the ICU with an altered mental status, possibly related to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) potentially caused by cisplatin. The patient's blood pressure is under control, and she has been taken off iv beta-blocker infusion. She exhibits Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern and is somnulant but wakes up to voice. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/85 to 105/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for fatigue, no fever, and no weight loss. She has no known drug allergies. She has been receiving various medications including hydralazine, metoprolol, morphine sulfate, and lorazepam.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and normal pupils and conjunctiva. There are no signs of lymphadenopathy or edema. Her cardiovascular examination shows a normal pulse and no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds. Respiratory examination is clear with no wheezes or crackles. Abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination indicates that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli but is not oriented.

Laboratory results show low white blood cell count, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal range. Radiology images are not provided.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary concerns include altered mental status, possibly related to PRES, which may be related to cisplatin. Other potential causes such as embolic CVA or infection are less likely. The patient also has hypertension, breast cancer with widespread metastasis, lactic acid elevation, hypoxemia, and tachycardia.

The patient is being monitored closely, and her ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with altered mental status, concern for PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome), possibly related to cisplatin. The patient also has a history of breast cancer with widespread metastasis, hypertension that has improved and is now off iv beta-blocker infusion, and mild hypoxemia with known lung metastasis. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery with SpO2 at 98%. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status and concern for PRES may increase the risk of seizures. Monitoring for any signs of seizure activity is crucial.

2. Hypertensive crisis: Although the patient's hypertension has improved, there is still a risk of hypertensive crisis due to the malignant hypertension mentioned in the note. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary.

3. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's known lung metastasis and mild hypoxemia, there is a risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is essential.

4. Infection: As the patient is in the ICU, there is an increased risk of acquiring infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI). Frequent assessment of vital signs, white blood cell count, and culture results is important.

5. Thromboembolic events: The patient's cancer and immobilization in the ICU increase the"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer.
- She presents with progressive altered mental status.
- The patient's blood pressure has been consistently elevated, ranging from 130s-150s/100s, and she received hydralazine and labetalol to control her hypertension.
- An EEG was performed but not yet read.
- The primary oncologist suspects brain metastases given the patient's rapid disease progression over the past few months.
- The patient has been increasingly agitated and expressing wishes to die. She has been given Ativan to manage her agitation.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 162/103 to 174/120 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.
- The patient has received various medications, including hydralazine, lorazepam, morphine sulfate, and labetalol.
- The patient's lab results show leukopenia, anemia, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests.
- An MRI was performed but was limited due to patient movement, and it appears to show PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome). The radiology department requires an MRI with gadolinium to evaluate for metastases, but the patient cannot lie still for the scan."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with progressive altered mental status. The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to control, with readings in the 160s/100s. An EEG has been done but not yet read. The primary oncologist suspects brain metastases, which could explain the patient's rapid disease progression. The patient has been increasingly agitated and expressing a desire to die. She has been given Ativan to help with agitation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Brain Metastases: Given the patient's history of breast cancer and the rapid progression of her symptoms, it is possible that she has developed brain metastases. This would require further imaging, such as an MRI with gadolinium contrast, to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's blood pressure readings in the 160s/100s indicate uncontrolled hypertension. This can lead to end-organ damage and may necessitate additional interventions to lower her blood pressure.
3. Infection: Although the primary oncologist believes that an infection is unlikely, it is important to consider the possibility of an infectious source contributing to the patient's altered mental status. Further evaluation may be needed to rule out or treat any potential infections.
4. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status and high lactate levels raise concern for possible seizures. An EEG has been ordered but not yet read, so further investigation is needed"

     * Hypoxia (stable O2 sats on 3L NC with known lung involvement of
       breast ca)
   Agree with plan to restart labetolol gtt for improved BP control,
   maintaining sys < 150. Continue to monitor neuro exam closely.  With
   adequate BP control might anticipate improvement in neurologic
   status/mental status over next few days if [**2-2**] PRES, though concern
   also for progressive breast ca with new brain mets contributing.   F/u
   eeg read and continue thiamine. Thrombocytopenia presumed to be [**2-2**]

The patient's condition is attributed to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and possible new brain metastases. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 162/103 to 174/120 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 3 liters of nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination shows periods of somnolence interrupted by restlessness. Neurologic examination reveals that the patient opens her eyes to voice, occasionally follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and demonstrates purposeful movement. The patient's laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and abnormalities in other blood parameters.

Plan:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is attributed to PRES or metastatic disease to the brain. An MRI with gadolinium will be performed to better characterize the lesions. If PRES is confirmed, the patient will be closely monitored for improvement over the next few days. Labetalol will be restarted to control blood pressure.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA who presents
   with progressive altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) or
   metastatic disease to brain. MRI of brain final read reveals inability
   to evaluate for metastatic disease in setting of imaging artifact. No
   sign of infection. Would expect improvement in 3 days if PRES. BPs
   well-controlled on labetalol drip with SBPs in the 130s. EEG consistent
   with
widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical
   structures
. No epileptiform activity seen.
   - Continue labetalol drip
   - Continue thiamine
   #Thrombocytopenia:
   Likely secondary to chemo (recent Xeloda, Cisplatin). Platelet count
   has decreased from 71 to 47 today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Daily PLT
   - Transfuse for <10 or signs of bleeding
   # Elevated lactate:
   Trending down from 5.5 at admission to 3.4 yesterday, likely increased
   in setting of difficultly processing [**2-2**] liver mets as well as
   decreased nutrition and low thiamine (substrate for metabolism).
   - Continue to trend lactate with AM labs
   - Continue thiamine
   # Metastatic breast CA:
   Holding chemotherapy in the setting of her current illness.  Unless her
   mental status improves there is unlikely to be any futher
   interventions.
   - f/u recs from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4309**] and consult with him for goals of care
   discussion with patient and family
   - Consider palliative care consult
   # Dry oral mucosa
   Likely causing significant discomfort.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  60 yo F with metastatic breast ca (to liver
   and lung) presents with htn and altered MS.  AMS attributed to PRES
   and possible new brain mets.
   Restarted labetolol gtt yesterday with improved bp control.

   sats 97% on 3L NC.     i/o's-->800ml +

   Blood cx --> ngtd.
   60 yo F with metastatic breast ca (to liver and lung) presents with htn
   and altered MS.  AMS attributed to PRES and possible new brain
   mets/advancing disease.
   Primary issues include:
     * Altered MS--felt [**2-2**] PRES (recent cisplatin), intermittent sz,
       possible new brain mets
     * HTN
     * Advanced/metastatic breast ca
     * Lactic acid elevation
     * Thrombocytopenia
     * Hypoxia (stable O2 sats on 3L NC with known lung involvement of
       breast ca)
     * hypernatremic
   Agree with plan to continue aggressive BP control -->labetolol gtt -->
   will consider resuming intermittent IV BP medication, as pt unable to
   take PO's, though control had been suboptimal with IV hydral when last
   tried.   Continue to monitor neuro exam closely.  No evidence of active
   sz on recent EEG which was c/w toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. With
   adequate BP control might anticipate some improvement in neurologic
   status/mental status over next few days if [**2-2**] PRES--though PRES may
   not be fully reversible and could potentially take significantly longer
   to resolve. Also with high concern for progressive breast ca with new
   brain mets contributing.  Thrombocytopenia presumed to be [**2-2**] recent
   chemo.  Counts continue to drop--monitor and transfuse for evidence of
   active bleed or counts < 20.  Family is aware of poor prognosis and
   advancing metastatic breast ca. Appreciate oncolooy input and
   communication. Continue to treat pain as need with prn morphine. Would
   consider palliative care c/s but would discuss with onc first. Issue of
   nutrition remains as well as pt with poor PO X days and unable to take
   POs now [**2-2**] mental status.  Consider discussion of NGT placement as
   temporizing [**Doctor Last Name **] over next 1-2 days depending upon pt improvement and
   family input regarding goals of care. At present will
   continue maintenance IVFs.  Free water to correct FWD given new mild
   hypernatremia.  Continue ICU prophy with pneumo-boots. Lactic acidosis
   likely [**2-2**] liver mets and poor nutrition
appears adequately fluid
   resus. Continue thiamine.  Pt is DNR/DNI.  Pending additional
   improvement in neurologic status over next few days, family likely
   heading toward CMO.  Will readdress with dicussion with onc and family
   mtg.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with progressive altered mental status. The patient's vital signs are stable, with controlled blood pressure in the 130s. She is on a labetalol drip. There are no signs of infection, but there is evidence of thrombocytopenia likely secondary to chemotherapy. Her lactate levels are trending down from 5.5 at admission to 3.4 yesterday, possibly due to difficulty processing liver metastases, decreased nutrition, and low thiamine levels. The patient has dry oral mucosa, which is causing significant discomfort. The plan includes continuing labetalol drip, thiamine, and monitoring lactate levels. The patient's metastatic breast cancer is being held in the setting of her current illness. There is a discussion about goals of care and a potential palliative care consult. The patient is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to PRES, which is characterized by neurological symptoms such as confusion, headache, and seizures. PRES can be associated with hypertension and certain medications, including chemotherapy agents like cisplatin.

2. Metastatic disease to the brain: Another possibility is that the patient's altered mental status is due to new brain metastases from her breast cancer. This would require further evaluation with imaging,"

An MRI of the brain was performed but was unable to evaluate for metastatic disease due to imaging artifact, and no signs of infection were found. 

The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled on a labetalol drip, with systolic blood pressures in the 130s. The labetalol drip and thiamine supplementation are recommended to continue. Thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to chemotherapy, and the platelet count has decreased from 71 to 47 today. There are no signs of active bleeding, so daily platelet monitoring and transfusion for platelet count below 10 or signs of bleeding are advised.

The patient's elevated lactate level has been trending down from 5.5 at admission to 3.4 yesterday. This is likely increased due to difficulty processing liver metastases, as well as decreased nutrition and low thiamine levels. It is recommended to continue monitoring the lactate levels with AM labs and to continue thiamine supplementation.

Metastatic breast cancer is present, and chemotherapy is being held in the setting of her current illness. Unless her mental status improves, there are unlikely to be any further interventions. A referral"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer who presents with progressive altered mental status. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure in the 130s and an oxygen saturation of 97%. However, the patient is somnolent and intermittently interactive, with poor attention and focus. The physical examination reveals dry oral mucosa, scattered wheezes in the respiratory system, and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. 

Laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and abnormalities in liver function tests. The patient is currently receiving labetalol for blood pressure control, thiamine supplementation, and prophylactic measures such as boots for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

The assessment and plan include the possibility of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) or metastatic disease to the brain. An MRI of the brain was unable to evaluate for metastatic disease due to imaging artifact. There are no signs of infection. The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled on labetalol, and the plan is to continue the medication.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA who presents
   with progressive altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) or
   metastatic disease to brain. MRI of brain final read reveals inability
   to evaluate for metastatic disease in setting of imaging artifact. No
   sign of infection. Would expect improvement in 3 days if PRES. BPs
   well-controlled on labetalol drip with SBPs in the 130s. EEG consistent
   with
widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical
   structures
. No epileptiform activity seen.
   - Continue labetalol drip
   - Continue thiamine
   #Thrombocytopenia:
   Likely secondary to chemo (recent Xeloda, Cisplatin). Platelet count
   has decreased from 71 to 47 today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Daily PLT
   - Transfuse for <10 or signs of bleeding
   # Elevated lactate:
   Trending down from 5.5 at admission to 3.4 yesterday, likely increased
   in setting of difficultly processing [**2-2**] liver mets as well as
   decreased nutrition and low thiamine (substrate for metabolism).
   - Continue to trend lactate with AM labs
   - Continue thiamine
   # Metastatic breast CA:
   Holding chemotherapy in the setting of her current illness.  Unless her
   mental status improves there is unlikely to be any futher
   interventions.
   - f/u recs from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4309**] and consult with him for goals of care
   discussion with patient and family
   - Consider palliative care consult
   # Dry oral mucosa
   Likely causing significant discomfort.
   - Continue maintenance fluids
   - Continue oral care

- The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer.
- She presents with progressive altered mental status.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/81 mmHg to 141/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- The patient is on a labetalol drip and receiving maintenance fluids.
- She has a history of thrombocytopenia likely secondary to chemotherapy, with a platelet count decreasing from 71 to 47 today.
- There is an elevated lactate level that is trending down, possibly due to difficulty processing liver metastases, decreased nutrition, and low thiamine levels.
- The patient's mental status is somnolent with no acute distress.
- Physical examination reveals scleral edema, normocephalic head, crackles in the left anterior upper lung field, soft non-tender abdomen, and absent peripheral pulses.
- Laboratory results show elevated levels of WBC, Hct, and troponin T, while other values such as creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes are within normal ranges.
- An MRI of the brain revealed imaging artifacts, making it difficult to evaluate for metastatic disease. No signs of infection were observed.
- The assessment and plan include possible Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with progressive altered mental status, which could be due to Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) or metastatic disease to the brain. An MRI of the brain reveals imaging artifacts that prevent evaluation for metastatic disease. No signs of infection are seen on the EEG, which shows widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.

The patient has stable platelet counts, likely secondary to chemotherapy, and is being monitored with daily platelet counts. Her elevated lactate levels are trending down and are likely increased due to difficulty processing liver metastases, decreased nutrition, and low thiamine levels.

The patient's family is divided on whether to pursue aggressive treatment or not. The physician plans to work with Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 4309] to have a family discussion regarding goals of care, specifically if the patient would want a feeding tube to sustain nutrition since she currently does not have adequate mental status for oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Metastatic spread to the brain: This could lead to further neurological deterioration and impact the patient's quality of life.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low due to chemotherapy. If it continues to decrease, there is a risk of bleeding complications.

3. Poor glycemic control: The patient's blood"

 NASAL SWAB - At [**2199-12-31**] 04:06 AM
   - Patient was off labetalol drip all morning and had trial of
   enalaprilat 2.5 mg Q6H with little effect on BP. As her BP climbed
   through day, was restarted on labetalol drip at 1830 with good effect.
   - Family meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4309**] revealed family's desire to continue
   with current course and then revisit discussion once more information
   gathered from neurology and repeat MRI.
   - Neurology reported that time course and prognosis of PRES is
   unpredictable and thus they are unable to provide family with concrete
   goals and information at this time regarding potential resolution of
   mental status.
   - MRI unable to be pursued due to patient's mental status as during her
   prior MRI she received pain medication and anxiolytics without much
   effect on movement in MRI machine.

 .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), BREAST
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
   60 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA who presents
   with progressive altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) or
   metastatic disease to brain. MRI of brain final read reveals inability
   to evaluate for metastatic disease in setting of imaging artifact. No
   sign of infection. EEG consistent with
widespread encephalopathy
   affecting both cortical and subcortical structures
. No epileptiform
   activity seen.  Would expect improvement in 3 days if PRES. BPs
   well-controlled on labetalol drip yesterday with SBPs in the 130s prior
   to labetalol drip being titrated off at approximately 1700 last night.
   Patient
s blood pressure was climbing slowly this AM.
   - Enalaprilat 2.5 mg IV Q6H
   - Continue thiamine
   #Thrombocytopenia:
   Likely secondary to chemo (recent Xeloda, Cisplatin). Platelet count
   stable at 51 today from 47. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Daily PLT
   - Transfuse for <10 or signs of bleeding
   # Elevated lactate:
   Trending down from 5.5 at admission to 3.4 on [**2199-12-28**], likely
   increased in setting of difficultly processing [**2-2**] liver mets as well
   as decreased nutrition and low thiamine (substrate for metabolism). No
   need to continue to trend this value.
   - Continue thiamine
   # Metastatic breast CA:
   Holding chemotherapy in the setting of her current illness.  Unless her
   mental status improves there is unlikely to be any futher
   interventions. Has been some family members indicating they would like
   [**Name (NI) 580**] status while still others do not seem to agree.
   - Will work with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4309**] to have a family discussion regarding goals
   of care, specifically if the patient would want a feeding tube to
   sustain nutrition as she currently does not have adequate mental status
   for PO intake.
   - Considering palliative care consult; however, will speak with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 4309**] and family first regarding goals of care
   - Pain control with IV morphine
   - Anxiolysis with lorazepam
   # Dry oral mucosa

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer. She is currently admitted to the ICU for altered mental status. The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to control, with episodes of malignant hypertension. She has also been experiencing thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and dry oral mucosa. The patient's neurological condition may be due to either Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) or metastatic disease to the brain. An MRI of the brain revealed an inability to evaluate for metastatic disease in the setting of imaging artifact. The patient's blood pressure was well-controlled on labetalol drip yesterday but started climbing again this morning. Enalaprilat was initiated at 2.5 mg IV Q6H. The patient's platelet count is stable at 51, and she is not showing any signs of active bleeding. Her lactate levels have been trending down from 5.5 at admission to 3.4 on [**2199-12-28**]. The patient is currently not processing oral intake adequately, and there is a discussion regarding the placement of a feeding tube. Palliative care consult is being considered after discussing goals of care with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4309**] and the family. Pain control with IV morphine and anxiolysis with lorazepam are being provided."

   24 Hour Events:
 NASAL SWAB - At [**2199-12-31**] 04:06 AM
   - Patient was off labetalol drip all morning and had trial of
   enalaprilat 2.5 mg Q6H with little effect on BP. As her BP climbed
   through day, was restarted on labetalol drip at 1830 with good effect.
   - Family meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4309**] revealed family's desire to continue
   with current course and then revisit discussion once more information
   gathered from neurology and repeat MRI.
   - Neurology reported that time course and prognosis of PRES is
   unpredictable and thus they are unable to provide family with concrete
   goals and information at this time regarding potential resolution of
   mental status.
   - MRI unable to be pursued due to patient's mental status as during her
   prior MRI she received pain medication and anxiolytics without much
   effect on movement in MRI machine.
   - Low UOP in the evening at 1900 prompted a 500 mL NS bolus which
   resulted in increase in UOP over next 2 hours

   yesterday. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4309**] stopped by to see patient and family yesterday and
   outcome of his meeting was a request to contact neurology for further
   prognostic information for PRES as well as potential for repeat MRI.
   Neurology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and they felt that the time course and
   prognosis of PRES was too variable to be able to provide family with
   concrete information in goals of care discussion. MRI tech revealed
   that repeat MRI could not be attempted without intubation and sedation
   with anesthesia present as patient
s mental status and movement is
   incompatible with repeat imaging. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4309**] was notified of this in an
   email yesterday evening. Patient is receiving morphine essentially

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with progressive altered mental status, which may be due to Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) or metastatic disease to the brain. An MRI of the brain reveals imaging artifact, making it unable to evaluate for metastatic disease. There are no signs of infection, and an EEG shows widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 65-101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/75 mmHg to 171/120 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula with 3 L of oxygen. The patient's physical examination reveals somnolence, occasional moaning, dry oral mucosa with tongue bleeding, supple neck, periods of apnea interrupted by gradually deepening tachypneic breaths, diminished breath sounds at the anterior left upper lung field, normal heart sounds, hypoactive bowel sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, no cranial nerve deficits, and no skin rashes or breakdown. Neurological examination shows inattentiveness with occasional transient eye-opening to vocal stimuli, somnolence, and no focal neurological deficits.

 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
   60 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA who presents
   with progressive altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) or
   metastatic disease to brain. MRI of brain final read reveals inability
   to evaluate for metastatic disease in setting of imaging artifact. No
   sign of infection. EEG consistent with
widespread encephalopathy
   affecting both cortical and subcortical structures
. No epileptiform
   activity seen.  Would expect improvement in 3 days if PRES. BPs
   well-controlled on labetalol drip yesterday with SBPs in the 130s prior
   to labetalol drip being titrated off at approximately 1700 last night.
   Patient
s blood pressure was climbing slowly this AM.
   - Enalaprilat 2.5 mg IV Q6H
   - Continue thiamine
   #Thrombocytopenia:
   Likely secondary to chemo (recent Xeloda, Cisplatin). Platelet count
   stable at 51 today from 47. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Daily PLT
   - Transfuse for <10 or signs of bleeding
   # Elevated lactate:
   Trending down from 5.5 at admission to 3.4 on [**2199-12-28**], likely
   increased in setting of difficultly processing [**2-2**] liver mets as well
   as decreased nutrition and low thiamine (substrate for metabolism). No
   need to continue to trend this value.
   - Continue thiamine
   # Metastatic breast CA:
   Holding chemotherapy in the setting of her current illness.  Unless her
   mental status improves there is unlikely to be any futher
   interventions. Has been some family members indicating they would like
   [**Name (NI) 580**] status while still others do not seem to agree.
   - Will work with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4309**] to have a family discussion regarding goals
   of care, specifically if the patient would want a feeding tube to
   sustain nutrition as she currently does not have adequate mental status
   for PO intake.
   - Considering palliative care consult; however, will speak with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 4309**] and family first regarding goals of care
   - Pain control with IV morphine
   - Anxiolysis with lorazepam

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status. The patient's recent MRI results are consistent with Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), and further evaluation is recommended to assess for sagittal sinus thrombosis and seizures.

The patient's vital signs show hypertension with blood pressure in the 130s/60s range. She has received a 500 cc normal saline bolus to address hypotension. Her respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 26 breaths per minute, but her oxygen saturation is within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 41,000/mm3, likely secondary to chemotherapy. Her creatinine levels are within normal range, but her liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are elevated. Other lab values such as electrolytes and albumin are also abnormal.

The patient's nutrition has been compromised, as indicated by dry oral mucosa. She is receiving IV fluids and maintenance therapy. Pain control and anxiolysis are being managed with IV morphine and lorazepam, respectively.

The patient's family has expressed disagreement regarding her care, specifically regarding the insertion of a feeding tube. A family discussion and consultation with palliative care are planned to address the goals of care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of PRES, development of sag"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with progressive altered mental status and is currently unresponsive. The patient has been diagnosed with Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) and there are concerns about metastatic disease to the brain. Neurology believes that the time course and prognosis of PRES are too variable to provide concrete information for goals of care discussion. Repeat MRI cannot be attempted without intubation and sedation with anesthesia present due to the patient's mental status and movement. The patient is receiving morphine every 2 hours for comfort, which may impact her mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malignant hypertension (hypertensive crisis, hypertensive emergency): The patient has high blood pressure readings throughout the day, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. This condition can lead to organ damage and failure if not managed properly.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low at 41, likely secondary to chemotherapy (recent Xeloda, Cisplatin). Thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding and bruising.

3. Metastatic breast cancer with potential brain involvement: The patient has a history of metastatic breast cancer, and there are concerns about metastatic disease to the brain. Brain metastases can cause cognitive changes, seizures, and other neurological symptoms.

4. Altered mental status: The patient is currently"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, currently presenting with progressive altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) by neuro-MRI, but the encephalopathy is likely multifactorial. The patient's prognosis is poor due to metastatic disease. The family has made the decision for comfort measures only (CMO) and palliative care has been consulted. The patient is currently receiving morphine through a GTT and may not be stable for transfer to the floor today. The patient's code status is CMO. The patient's nutrition is being provided through IV fluids, but this will be discontinued per family wishes this afternoon. The patient's blood sugar levels are well-controlled. The patient has a 20-gauge line inserted on December 31st, 7:41 PM. Prophylactic measures include DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's disposition will be transferred to Hospital Ward 7 and the OMED service if the patient is stable this evening. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. PRES (Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome): This is a neurological disorder characterized by seizures, headache, altered mental status, and visual loss. It is associated with conditions such as hypertension, renal failure, and malignancies.
2. Metastatic disease to"

   24 Hour Events:
   - neuro recs: MRI results likely PRES, recommend paraneoplastic w/u and
   MRI/MRV if repeated to assess for sagittal sinus thrombosis, and EEG to
   assess for seizures. PRES may be reversible in as early as 1 wk, but
   encephalopathy is likely multifactorial (ie. metastases may be
   involved) and reversal of PRES does not guarantee resolution of current
   encephalopathy.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4309**] emailed on [**12-31**] in PM, had spoken with neurology. Returned

 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
   60 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA who presents
   with progressive altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) or
   metastatic disease to brain. MRI of brain final read reveals inability
   to evaluate for metastatic disease in setting of imaging artifact. No
   sign of infection. EEG consistent with
widespread encephalopathy
   affecting both cortical and subcortical structures
. No epileptiform
   activity seen.  Would expect improvement in 3 days if PRES. BPs
   well-controlled on labetalol drip yesterday with SBPs in the 130s prior
   to labetalol drip being titrated off at approximately 1700 last night.
   Patient
s blood pressure was climbing slowly this AM.
   - Enalaprilat 2.5 mg IV Q6H
   - Continue thiamine
   #Thrombocytopenia:
   Likely secondary to chemo (recent Xeloda, Cisplatin). Platelet count
   stable at 51 today from 47. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Daily PLT
   - Transfuse for <10 or signs of bleeding
   # Elevated lactate:
   Trending down from 5.5 at admission to 3.4 on [**2199-12-28**], likely
   increased in setting of difficultly processing [**2-2**] liver mets as well
   as decreased nutrition and low thiamine (substrate for metabolism). No
   need to continue to trend this value.
   - Continue thiamine
   # Metastatic breast CA:
   Holding chemotherapy in the setting of her current illness.  Unless her
   mental status improves there is unlikely to be any futher
   interventions. Has been some family members indicating they would like
   [**Name (NI) 580**] status while still others do not seem to agree.
   - Will work with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4309**] to have a family discussion regarding goals
   of care, specifically if the patient would want a feeding tube to
   sustain nutrition as she currently does not have adequate mental status
   for PO intake.
   - Considering palliative care consult; however, will speak with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 4309**] and family first regarding goals of care
   - Pain control with IV morphine
   - Anxiolysis with lorazepam
   # Dry oral mucosa
   - Continue maintenance fluids
   - Continue oral care

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer who presents with progressive altered mental status. She has been diagnosed with Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) or possible metastatic disease to the brain. The MRI results were inconclusive in evaluating for metastatic disease due to imaging artifacts. No signs of infection were found, and the EEG showed widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures, with no epileptiform activity observed. The patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled on a labetalol drip, but it started climbing this morning. Enalaprilat has been initiated to help control blood pressure. The platelet count is stable at 51, likely secondary to chemotherapy. There is a trend of decreasing lactate levels from 5.5 at admission to 3.4 on 12/28, which could be due to decreased liver metastases, poor nutrition, and low thiamine levels. Thiamine supplementation is recommended. The patient's mental status has not improved, and further interventions in chemotherapy are unlikely. There is disagreement among family members regarding the patient's wishes for Do Not Intubate (DNI) status. A family discussion regarding goals of care, including the possibility of a feeding tube for sustaining nutrition, is planned. A palliative care consult is being considered, but it needs to be discussed with Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 4309] and the family first. Pain control with IV morphine and anxiolysis with lorazepam are ongoing. The patient is currently receiving IV fluids and maintenance medications."
