   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and large cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He was admitted to the ICU for a mucous plug and subsequently reintubated. The patient is non-responsive after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. 

The patient has several ongoing issues, including the inability to protect his airway and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to the stroke. It is mentioned that he will likely continue to have episodes of mucous plugging. The plan is to wean the ventilator as tolerated with the goal of extubation today. However, tracheostomy and home hospice care have been recommended by the medical team, although the family is unlikely to support any escalation of care. Palliative care and ethics consultation have also been initiated.

Other medical problems include possible neurosyphilis, which is being treated empirically, ESRD, diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and vasculopathy. The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) yesterday and needs a fistula repair prior to discharge. His DMII management will continue with the previous insulin regimen and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). For vasculopathy, the patient is on simvastatin, lisinopril, and aspirin when stable.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving NovaSource Renal ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and a history of large cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who is non-responsive after a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: Possible infections such as lung, midline, skin, Clostridium difficile (CDiff), infected fistula), versus adrenal insufficiency versus vasculopathy.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient requires hemodialysis (HD) due to ESRD and ongoing fluid overload.
3. Airway protection and hypoxemic respiratory failure: Secondary to stroke, the patient is unable to protect his airway, leading to episodes of mucous plugging.
4. Neurosyphilis: Although unlikely, the patient is being treated empirically with intravenous ceftriaxone (CTX) for a 14-day course.
5. Fistula repair: The patient's infected fistula needs to be repaired prior to discharge from the hospital.
6. Diabetes Mellitus Type II (DMII): The patient's previous insulin regimen should be continued.

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and chronic right pleural effusion. The patient was initially admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and had a prolonged hospital course complicated by a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He is now readmitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with recurrent respiratory failure, poor mental status, and inability to manage secretions. The patient also experiences intermittent hypotension.

24-hour events include hypotension requiring two pressors overnight, which have since been weaned off.

The last dose of antibiotics was ceftriaxone on [**2163-12-30**] at 01:12 PM. The patient is currently receiving dopamine at 2.5 mcg/kg/min and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other ICU medications include fentanyl, which was last administered on [**2163-12-31**] at 04:30 AM. Other medications are reviewed per [**Month (only)**].

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), recurrent respiratory failure, intermittent hypotension, and poor mental status. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent respiratory failure due to mucus plugging, which is primarily driven by the patient's mental status and inability to manage secretions. This can lead to further respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and potential need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is of unclear etiology, but concerns include sepsis (lung, midline, skin, Clostridium difficile, infected fistula), cardiac etiology, or autonomic dysregulation. If sepsis is the cause, it may lead to organ dysfunction, shock, and potentially death if not promptly treated.

3. Infection: The patient has received broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concerns for infection. If an infection is present, it could progress and lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.

4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient is receiving stress dose hydrocortisone due to suspected adrenal insufficiency. This condition can result in hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and organ failure if not adequately managed.

5. Fistula Repair: The patient requires a fistula repair"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and a history of large cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who is non-responsive after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.

The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Mucous plugging: The patient has an altered mental status and ineffective airway clearance, which may contribute to the formation of mucous plugs.

2. Hypotension: The patient has wide swings in blood pressure, which could be due to infections, adrenal insufficiency, vasculopathy, or autonomic dysfunction. Midodrine is started to address this issue, and dopamine is used as needed.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a stroke. He is on mechanical ventilation, and the pressure support (PS) is increased for relative hypercarbia. A tracheostomy (trach) is recommended for long-term airway management.

4. Inability to protect airway: The patient's inability to protect his airway is due to his altered mental status and impaired motor function. ETT (endotracheal tube) suctioning is performed regularly.

5. Chronic pleural effusion: The patient has loculated right pleural effusion that is unchanged. This may contribute to respiratory compromise.

6. ESRD: The patient has end-stage"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and a history of large cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient is currently unresponsive after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to stroke. The patient has mucous plugging, ineffective coping, impaired airway clearance, impaired motor function, and impaired respiration/gas exchange. Other medical issues include gastrointestinal bleed, pneumonia, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to various causes such as infections (lung, midline, skin, Clostridium difficile), adrenal insufficiency, or vasculopathy. The patient is on dopamine for hypotension.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to stroke, and the inability to protect the airway. The patient is likely to continue experiencing episodes of mucous plugging.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a loculated right pleural effusion and left pleural effusion. These effusions need to be managed appropriately.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires dialysis. The patient's fistula needs to be repaired prior to discharge.

   initially with AMS, prolonged hospital course c/b PEA arrest,  now
   readmitted to MICU with recurrent respiratory failure in setting of
   poor mental status and inability to manage secretions and intermittent
   hypotension.
   Primary issues include:
   # Respiratory Failure-- primary issue appears to be mucus plugging with
   mental status being the primary driving force.  Difficulty also
   managing oral secretions. More dysnchronous with ventilator today
   possibly from pain or inadequate sedation, though BP limited, less
   likely recurrent plug noting stable airway pressures
   --check abg, bolus fentanyl, sedate if BP allows,  sx, repeat cxr,
   pending abd would increase PS or place back on rate
   --nebs, hyoscyamine
   --Continue vent support as pt is high risk for recurrent
   plugging
continue discussions with family regarding goals of care
   and/or movement to trach

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with ESRD on HD, CVA after CABG, chronic right effusion, and admitted initially with altered mental status (AMS).
- The patient had a prolonged hospital course complicated by a PEA arrest and is now readmitted to the MICU with recurrent respiratory failure.
- The patient has poor mental status, difficulty managing secretions, and intermittent hypotension.
- The primary issues include respiratory failure due to mucus plugging, inability to manage oral secretions, and intermittent hypotension.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, but he requires ongoing ventilator support.
- There is concern for sepsis as a possible cause of hypotension, although without leukocytosis or fever.
- The patient has chronic renal failure (CRF) and is scheduled for HD today.
- The patient's goals of care are being discussed with the family.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is primarily due to mucus plugging and inability to manage secretions. There is a risk of recurrent plugging, which may require increasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or placing the patient back on assist-control ventilation (ACV).
2. Hypotension: The patient has intermittent hypotension that may be related to sepsis, cardiac etiology, or autonomic dysregulation. There is a need for ongoing monitoring and"

   Primary issues include:
   # Respiratory Failure-- primary issue appears to be mucus plugging with
   mental status being the primary driving force.
    Appears more dysnchronous with ventilator today possibly from pain or

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and chronic right pleural effusion. He was initially admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and had a prolonged hospital course complicated by a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is now readmitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with recurrent respiratory failure due to poor mental status and inability to manage secretions. 

24-hour events include the initiation of a multi-lumen catheter and a percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has had multiple blood cultures taken. Vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 107/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 2,582 mL with an output of 940 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 269 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 132.

Physical examination reveals a diminished radial pulse on the right side, diminished dorsalis pedis (DP) pulse on the right side, and diminished left DP pulse. Breath sounds are diminished at the right base. Neurologic examination shows no attentive response, no follow-up of simple commands, and non-purposeful movement. Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 9.5 g/dL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count of 225 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 200 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL, sodium of 140 mEq/L, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, and glucose of 200 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary issues include respiratory failure, hypotension, altered mental status, chronic renal failure, and adrenal insufficiency. The respiratory failure is due to mucus plugging with mental status being the primary driving force. The patient appears more dysynchronous with the ventilator today, possibly from pain or inadequate sedation. Hypotension is normotensive at the moment but has had intermittent pressor requirements since transfer to the ICU. There is concern for sepsis as a possible source of infection. Altered mental status is suspected to be due to neurosyphilis with possible components of anoxic injury in the setting of arrest. Chronic renal failure requires ongoing hemodialysis, and adrenal insufficiency necessitates stress dose hydrocortisone. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mucus plugging leading to respiratory failure due to inadequate secretion management and poor mental status.
2. Hypotension potentially caused by sepsis, cardiac etiology, or autonomic dysregulation.
3. Altered mental status possibly due to neurosyphilis and anoxic injury.
4. Chronic renal failure requiring ongoing hemodialysis.
5. Adrenal insufficiency requiring stress dose hydrocortisone.

Note: Please consult the patient's medical team for specific treatment plans and interventions."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and a large cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He is currently unresponsive after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient's current issues include hypotension, inability to protect his airway, and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to the stroke. 

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) mode and has been receiving fentanyl for pain control. He has been given midodrine for autonomic instability and mucomyst nebulizers for secretions as needed. The family is considering a tracheostomy but wants to continue all other measures.

The patient's recent laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels. His liver function tests are within normal range. Chest X-ray reveals partial collapse of the right lung and a right pleural effusion, but no pneumothorax or changes in the cardiac mediastinum.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Mucous Plugging: The patient's inability to clear secretions may lead to mucous plugging, which can further compromise his respiratory function.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's impaired respiration and gas exchange may result in acute respiratory failure,"

   - HD yesterday
   - Discuss with transplant surgery regarding fistula repair
   3.       Hypotension:  Possible infection, but no clear source.
   - continue broad antibiotics, but plan to discontinue if cultures

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, history of cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and recurrent intubation due to mucous plugging/pneumonia. He remains intubated and ventilated, with the family deciding whether to proceed with a tracheostomy or change the goals of care. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he has clear lungs bilaterally. His blood work shows anemia, elevated creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging shows a stable right-sided effusion without significant infiltrate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may worsen if extubation is attempted prematurely. Barriers to extubation include mental status and low minute ventilation.
2. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further, leading to worsening electrolyte imbalances and anemia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate possible infection or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
4. Goals of Care: The family's decision regarding the patient's care will determine the aggressiveness of treatment and potential interventions such as tracheostomy.
5. Mucous Plugging/Pneumonia: The patient's recurrent mucous plugging/pneumonia can lead to further respiratory complications if not adequately managed.
6. Infection: The patient may develop new infections due to prolonged ICU"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and chronic right-sided effusion. He is currently in the ICU following respiratory failure requiring intubation due to a mucus plug. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/74 to 159/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CPAP/PSV, set tidal volume of 0 mL, pressure support of 15 cmH2O, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 172, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 21 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's chest X-ray reveals a stable right-sided effusion without significant infiltrate. Blood cultures have shown no growth, and C. difficile test is pending. The patient's current assessment includes respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, hypotension, and goals of care discussion involving palliative care. The family is considering an aggressive level"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and a history of large cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He is non-responsive and previously experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.

The patient's current condition is stable, with blood cultures from December 31st being negative after 48 hours. The patient has been taken off vancomycin and cefepime. He is now on midodrine three times a day and his stress dose steroids have been stopped, with an increase in prednisone to 10 mg daily.

The patient has had his last hemodialysis (HD) on Friday and does not require acute HD today. He is scheduled for fistula repair tomorrow per transplant surgery. 

The patient has an inability to protect his airway and is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to stroke. He is likely to continue having episodes of mucous plugging. The recommended course of action includes continuing ventilatory support, gradually reducing the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today, considering tracheostomy and sending home with hospice, although the family is unlikely to support any de-escalation of care. Palliative care and ethics consultation will also be pursued. Frequent endotracheal tube (ETT) suctioning, nebulizations with Mucomyst as needed,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and a history of large cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who is non-responsive post-cardiac arrest. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for various medical conditions and complications, including hypotension, respiratory failure, inability to protect airway, potential neurosyphilis, and ESRD requiring hemodialysis.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient was initially stable off pressors but required blood cultures NGTD. Midodrine is being given three times a day to manage hypotension.
2. ESRD: The patient has chronic kidney failure requiring hemodialysis. He is scheduled for fistula revision in the operating room today. No acute hemodialysis is required today.
3. Inability to protect airway and hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's inability to protect his airway is secondary to his stroke. He will likely continue to have episodes of mucous plugging. The plan is to perform a tracheostomy today and continue mechanical ventilation while gradually decreasing the peak inspiratory pressure (PS). A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be conducted today.
4. Possible neurosyphilis: An empiric 14-day course of ceftriaxone was completed today and discontinued.
5. Vasculopathy: The patient is on a regimen of simvastatin,"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, cerebrovascular accident post-coronary artery bypass graft (CVA post-CABG), and recurrent respiratory failure. The patient's current chief complaint is PEA (pulseless electrical activity) and respiratory failure. 

The patient is currently in the ICU for fistula repair and has been admitted multiple times for respiratory failure due to mucus plugs. The family has agreed to proceed with a tracheostomy to manage the patient's oral secretions. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, blood pressure ranging from 131/73 mmHg to 105/56 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 302 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 86. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show pH of 7.27, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 46 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 66 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 22 mEq/L, and base excess (BE) of -4 mEq/L.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is somnolent and unresponsive to voice, withdrawing to painful stimuli. There are diminished breath sounds on the right side, regular heart sounds with S1 and S2, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no edema in the extremities.

The laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.9 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 30.2%, platelet count (Plt) of 200 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 2.8 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 116 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 139 mEq/L, potassium (K+) level of 3.1 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) level of 106 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) level of 8.9 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) level of 1.8 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) level of 2.0 mg/dL. The imaging shows a persistent right-sided effusion but no infiltrate on the chest X-ray.

The assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure due to the inability to manage oral secretions, chronic renal failure, presumed neurosyphilis, adrenal insufficiency, prolonged prothrombin time (PTT), and recent pulseless electrical activity (PE"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and recurrent respiratory failure. He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to an inability to manage oral secretions. The patient's family has agreed to proceed with a tracheostomy. He also has a fistula repair scheduled today for chronic renal failure and is on hemodialysis (HD) per renal. Additionally, the patient is presumed to have neurosyphilis and has completed a course of ceftriaxone. He has prolonged PTT, which requires adjustment of heparin dosage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the tracheostomy procedure is not successful or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration.
2. Chronic Renal Failure: The fistula repair may not be successful, leading to ongoing renal failure and the need for continued HD. There is also a risk of infection or bleeding during the surgery.
3. Adrenal Insufficiency: Titration of prednisone dosage needs to be done carefully to avoid adrenal crisis.
4. Neurosyphilis: There is a risk of treatment failure or resistance to antibiotics used for neurosyphilis.
5. Prolonged PTT: Decreasing heparin dosage may increase the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and a history of large cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who is non-responsive post pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient had a tracheostomy (trach) placed yesterday and required temporary pressors for hypotension following the procedure. He also had a fistula repair and transplant, with an ordered tunneled line placed today. The patient is on ventilatory support due to hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to stroke. The family wants to take the patient home, but it is unlikely that they will be able to care for him there.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially required temporary pressors after tracheostomy, indicating a potential complication of hypotension. Midodrine has been prescribed TID to manage this condition.
2. ESRD: The patient has chronic ESRD and requires regular hemodialysis. There is no acute HD requirement today, but the patient had a fistula repair yesterday and an IR placed a tunneled HD line today.
3. Inability to protect airway and hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's inability to protect his airway is secondary to stroke, leading to episodes of mucous plugging. Tracheostomy has been performed, and the patient will continue on ventilatory support.

The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and a history of large cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who is non-responsive after a post-cardiac arrest (PEA) arrest. The patient required temporary pressors following tracheostomy and had a tracheostomy placed yesterday. The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to inability to protect airway and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to stroke. 

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), vasculopathy, and possible neurosyphilis, for which an empiric 14-day course of ceftriaxone was completed. The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) yesterday and has a fistula repair and transplant planned. 

The patient's current medications include ASA, midodrine, and decreased prednisone. The patient's family wants to take him home, but it is uncertain whether they will be able to care for him there. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient had episodes of hypotension that required temporary pressors after tracheostomy. It is important to monitor blood pressure closely and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. ESRD: The patient has chronic kidney disease and requires ongoing management of renal function, including dialysis.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and a history of large cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He is currently unresponsive following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has undergone fistula repair and transplant surgery, with the transplant team stating that his fistula needs to be repaired before he can leave the hospital.

The patient has been placed on a ventilator with assist-control mode ventilation (CMV/ASSIST), and a tracheostomy tube has been inserted. He is receiving pressor support but is stable at this time. Blood cultures have been ordered.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), vasculopathy, and possible neurosyphilis. He has completed an empiric 14-day course of ceftriaxone for suspected neurosyphilis.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood glucose levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. Imaging shows a new tracheostomy tube placed 5 cm from the carina, with no pneumothorax observed.

The patient's disposition is uncertain, as the family wants to take him home but may not be able to care for him there. The plan is to continue ventilatory support, perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), and involve palliative care and ethics discussions. Frequent endotr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and recent cardiac bypass surgery (CABG). He has been admitted multiple times to the ICU for respiratory failure, and now presents with poor oral intake, requiring tracheostomy placement. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and is receiving medications for various conditions including adrenal insufficiency, pain management, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he has an altered mental status. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and lactic acid. Chest X-ray reveals a tracheostomy tube in position and chronic right-sided effusion. Microbiology cultures are negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent ICU admissions for respiratory failure indicate a high risk for further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration pneumonia due to his inability to manage oral secretions.
2. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest worsening renal function. This increases the risk of fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and further deterioration of renal function.
3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient is on prednisone for adrenal insufficiency, which requires careful monitoring for adrenal crisis, especially during stress situations like critical illness.
4. Neurological Dysfunction: The patient's encephalopathy and minimal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and recurrent ICU admissions for respiratory failure in the setting of mucus plug. The patient's chief complaint is PEA (Pulseless Electrical Activity) and respiratory failure.

The patient underwent tracheostomy and fistula repair yesterday and required pressors peri-procedure but is now off. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 121/57mmHg to 188/75mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator support.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent tracheostomy and fistula repair. The patient is unable to provide history due to encephalopathy.

The patient's physical examination shows minimal edema, regular respirations, and first-degree AV block on ECG. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased albumin and potassium levels. Imaging shows a tracheostomy tube in position and chronic right-sided effusion. Microbiology cultures are negative to date.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and a history of large cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He is non-responsive after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has been stable and has been weaned off pressors following tracheostomy placement. Blood cultures were obtained through nasogastric tube drainage. Midodrine is being administered three times a day due to low blood pressures during hemodialysis. Prednisone dosage has been decreased to 5mg per day, which is the home dose. Cultures will be followed, but no active evidence of infection is currently present.

The patient has ESRD and is scheduled for hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. A tunneled line was placed for hemodialysis without any complications. The patient has an inability to protect his airway and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to stroke. He will likely continue to have episodes of mucus plugging. The plan is to discharge him to a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility today.

The patient has been tracheostomized and switched to continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode overnight. He will be weaned from the ventilator at the LTAC facility. Palliative care and ethics consultation will be pursued. Frequent suctioning and mucolytic nebulizations will be administered as needed. Hy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and a history of large cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient is non-responsive after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has been diagnosed with various medical conditions including hypotension, ESRD, inability to protect airway and hypoxemic respiratory failure, possible neurosyphilis, and colonization with a gram-negative rod (GNR) and pseudomonas in the sputum culture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension following tracheostomy placement and required temporary pressors. There is a risk of recurrent hypotension, especially during hemodialysis.
2. ESRD: The patient has chronic kidney failure and requires regular hemodialysis. Complications may arise from the dialysis procedure itself or due to underlying ESRD.
3. Inability to protect airway and hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration and subsequent pneumonia. Additionally, his respiratory failure may worsen due to mucous plugging and potential infections.
4. Possible neurosyphilis: Although the patient completed an empirical course of antibiotics for neurosyphilis, it is important to monitor for any neurological deterioration or worsening of symptoms.
5. Positive sputum culture: The presence of GNR and pseud"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and a large cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He is currently unresponsive following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient required temporary pressors following tracheostomy placement but is now stable off pressors. Midodrine is being administered three times a day.

2. Inability to protect airway and hypoxemic respiratory failure: This is secondary to the stroke. The patient has had a tracheostomy placed and is on mechanical ventilation. Frequent suctioning and mucolytic nebulizers are being used to manage mucous plugging. The patient's disposition is uncertain as the family wants to take him home but may not be able to care for him there.

3. Possible neurosyphilis: The patient completed an empiric 14-day course of ceftriaxone (CFTX) yesterday, which was discontinued.

4. ESRD: The patient had hemodialysis (HD) yesterday and will continue with renal recommendations, dialysis dose medications, and HD per renal. A tunneled dialysis line was placed due to the need for bridge therapy before a potential transplant.

5. Diabetes Mellitus Type II (DMII): The patient's previous insulin regimen should be continued."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M with ESRD, chronic pleural effusion, Hx of large CVA who is
   non-responsive s/p PEA arrest.
   # Hypotension:  stable, off pressors now, but needed temporarily
   following trach placement.  Neo now weened off.  Blood cultures NGTD
   - midodrine TID, added during this hospitalization due to low blood
   pressures w/ HD
   - decreased prednisone to 5mg QD (home dose) and will continue
   - f/u cultures, but no active evidence of infection
   # ESRD:
   -HD performed yesterday, next due F for MWF schedule
   - s/p fistula repair [**1-3**]
   - IR placed  HD tunneled line [**1-4**] w/o complication.
   # Inability to protect airway and hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   secondary to stroke.  Patient will likely continue to have episodes of
   mucous plugging.  D/C today to LTAC
   - Trached [**1-3**]
   - switched to CMV overnight, while ordinarily would move to PS and
   trach mask today, will leave CMV with further movements to ween from
   vent at LTAC
   - palliative care and ethics following
   - frequent suctioning
   - mucomyst nebs prn
   - Hyoscyamine
   - Minimize invasive procedures
   #Possible Neurosyphilis: Completed empiric 14 day course of CFTX
   yesterday, which was d/c-ed.
   .
   # Positive sputum culture: patient with sputumc cx from [**1-2**] w/ + GNR
   and pseudomonas.  No evidence of systemic or pulmonary infection.  [**Month (only) 60**]
   be colonization.  Hold off on antibiotics for now, and will signout out
   for LTAC to follow up on culture.
   #DMII: Continue previous insulin regimen, TFs
   #Vasculopathy:
   - continue simvastatin, lisinopril and ASA when stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and a history of large cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He is currently non-responsive following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has been stable, off pressors, but needed temporary support after tracheostomy placement. He has undergone hemodialysis and has a tunneled line placed for ongoing dialysis.

The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to a stroke, and he will likely continue to experience episodes of mucous plugging. He is being transferred to a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility for further management. Tracheostomy and continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) support will be continued at the LTAC.

The patient has completed an empirical course of antibiotics for possible neurosyphilis, but no evidence of systemic or pulmonary infection was found. The positive sputum culture showing growth of gram-negative rods (GNR) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is likely colonization rather than an active infection.

The patient's diabetes mellitus type II (DMII) requires continuation of the previous insulin regimen. He is also on medications for vasculopathy, including simvastatin, lisinopril, and aspirin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, particularly during hemodialysis. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate"
