","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a known urethral mass who presented with acute blood loss anemia from the urethral mass. Hemostasis was achieved in the emergency department with surgical injection, but the patient's hematocrit continued to drop despite receiving two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Another unit of PRBCs was given in the hospital, but the patient experienced a transfusion reaction (rigors, fever spike) during the administration of her fourth unit of PRBCs. The reaction resolved after receiving Demerol and Benadryl, and it was not hemolytic. The patient is currently receiving her fourth unit of PRBCs, is NPO for a possible gastrointestinal procedure, and has had no further bleeding. The plan includes monitoring the post-transfusion hematocrit and transfusing to maintain a hematocrit above 26, monitoring every six hours. The patient should continue to receive intravenous fluids, monitor for any signs of bleeding, keep a Foley catheter in place, and contact the urology department for further procedure recommendations. 

The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI), for which she has been on a 14-day course of ciprofloxacin as an outpatient. On admission, she was started on Ancef per urology recommendation. The urine culture is pending, and she will continue taking Ancef for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a known urethral mass presenting with acute blood loss anemia from the urethral mass. She received surgical treatment in the emergency department with Surgical/epi injection to achieve hemostasis. Despite receiving two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in the ED, the patient's hematocrit (Hct) continued to drop. She received another unit in the ICU and experienced a transfusion reaction, which resolved after receiving Demerol and Benadryl. The reaction was not hemolytic. The patient is currently receiving a fourth unit of PRBCs, is NPO for a possible genitourinary (GU) procedure, and has had no further bleeding. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100.4°F), a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/49 mmHg to 143/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, elevated glucose at 258 mg/dL, slightly elevated potassium at 21 mEq/L, low magnesium at 0.4 mg/dL, and low phosphorus at 2.8 mg/dL. 

The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, and is currently on insulin, not on any antihypertensive medication at home. 

Plan:
1. Monitor post-transfusion Hct and transfuse to Hct >26.
2. Monitor HCT every six hours.
3. Continue intravenous fluids.
4. Monitor bleeding and keep Foley catheter in place.
5. Touch base with GU regarding procedure and recommendations.
6. Follow-up urine culture pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a known urethral mass. She presents with acute blood loss anemia from the urethral mass. Hemostasis was achieved in the emergency department with surgical intervention, but her hematocrit (Hct) continued to drop despite receiving two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient experienced a transfusion reaction during the administration of her fourth unit of PRBCs, which resolved after receiving demerol and benadryl. She is currently receiving a fourth unit of PRBCs and is NPO for a possible gastrointestinal procedure. Her vital signs are stable, and she is being monitored closely. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She is also being treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is off her home medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's ongoing blood loss from the urethral mass has led to acute blood loss anemia. Continued monitoring of her Hct levels and transfusion as necessary are important to manage this condition.
2. Transfusion reaction: The patient experienced a non-hemolytic transfusion reaction during her recent transfusion. Monitoring for any signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction or other complications related to blood transfusion is essential.
3. Hypotension: The patient is borderline hypotensive and requires close monitoring, especially in the setting"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of urethral bleeding caused by a local mass lesion. She presented initially with urethral bleeding, and further management was required in the emergency department. A Foley catheter was placed, and an MRI was performed to evaluate the bleeding. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) levels have been dropping, leading to acute anemia secondary to blood loss. She received three units of blood transfusion, and an additional unit is being given. The goal HCT is set at >24, and the patient will be closely monitored for ongoing bleeding from the urethral mass. She will be transferred to the operating room (OR) once stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued blood loss from the urethral mass, leading to further drops in HCT levels and worsening anemia.
2. Hypotension and shock due to significant blood loss.
3. Infection at the site of bleeding or from the Foley catheter.
4. Kidney injury or acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypoperfusion or direct trauma from blood clots or debris.
5. Thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
6. Poor glycemic control due to stress and the use of regular insulin sliding scale.
7. Potential complications related to the planned surgical intervention"

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged except for fatigue, anemia, and the presence of a urethral mass. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/63 mmHg to 96/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an input of 4,310 mL and output of 4,705 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 395 mL. Respiratory support is not required, with an oxygen delivery device and SpO2 at 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals a thin appearance, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, distant heart sounds, diminished breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and unassessed skin and neurologic status.

Lab results indicate a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL, leukocyte count of 163 K/uL, blood glucose level of 96 mg/dL, sodium level of 28 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.3 mEq/L,"
