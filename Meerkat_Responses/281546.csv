","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress, stridor, esophageal cancer, laryngeal edema, and anemia. The patient's history is significant for allergies to Roxicet (Oxycodone Hcl/Acetaminophen) causing nausea/vomiting. The patient has been receiving various medications including protonix, decadron, methadone, nortryptaline, neurontin, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Upon examination, the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), a current temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), a heart rate of 108-131 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94-110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14-20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, overweight, and not in acute distress. No abnormal findings were noted in the eyes, conjunctiva, head, ears, nose, or throat. Cardiovascular examination showed a normal pulse and no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds. Peripheral vascular examination was not assessed due to a language barrier. Respiratory examination revealed slight expiratory prolongation. Abdominal examination was unremarkable, and no abnormalities were found in the extremities,"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of stridor. The patient has a history of central or upper esophageal cancer and is currently experiencing airway obstruction. 

A thoracic consult was obtained, and it was advised to perform a barium swallow to evaluate for possible tear or perforation. However, the patient did not tolerate the barium swallow. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started, covering both perforation and tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/60 mmHg to 95/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and hemoglobin levels. The rest of the lab values are within normal limits. 

The patient's airway obstruction is a concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening stridor, respiratory distress, aspiration pneumonia, or development of a tracheoesophageal fistula."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presents with stridor, a high-pitched breathing sound, and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient is unable to provide a history due to a language barrier. The patient has a trachea with a narrowest point of 3 mm and supraglottic edema. There is also right vocal cord paralysis. The thoracic consult suggests that there is no tear but advises further evaluation with a barium swallow and broad-spectrum coverage for potential perforation versus tracheoesophageal fistula. The patient did not tolerate the barium swallow. The MR Neck results are pending, but a wet read by surgery indicates no esophageal fistula or external air. The patient has been started on Ensure feeding. The patient's stridor worsened at 4:00 AM, with inspiratory stridor noted in all lung fields, but the patient is saturating well. There are no reports of worsening pain. The patient has allergies to Roxicet and experiences nausea/vomiting as a side effect. The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for cough and slight neck tenderness. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/60 to 95/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of "

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a male with a chief complaint of stridor. The patient has a history of airway obstruction due to central or upper esophageal cancer. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 104/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for the risk of esophageal perforation and infection. The patient's blood work shows leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.8 K/uL and other lab values within normal range. The patient's nutritional status is being managed with J-tube feedings. The patient's condition remains unchanged from admission, with complaints of cough and mild neck tenderness. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Esophageal perforation: The patient has a history of esophageal cancer, and there is concern for a possible esophageal perforation. This can lead to severe infections and sepsis if not managed properly.
2. Tracheal stenosis: The patient's airway is narrowed at the trachea level, which can result in stridor and difficulty breathing. If left untreated or if there is further narrowing, it can lead to tracheal stenosis, causing significant breathing difficulties.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's inspiratory stridor"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with laryngeal edema, respiratory distress, and esophageal rupture. They were comfortable throughout the day, maintaining good oxygen saturation without supplemental oxygen. An MRI suggested an esophageal perforation. The patient is unable to provide history due to a language barrier. They have allergies to Roxicet (Oral) and nausea/vomiting. They were on antibiotics for esophageal perforation, including Ampicillin/Sulbactam, Vancomycin, and Metronidazole. Other ICU medications included Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis, Pantoprazole (Protonix), and Pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/59-113/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support were noted. Physical examination showed a well-nourished patient without acute distress or signs of edema or cyanosis. The patient was alert and oriented, with normal heart and lung sounds. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Neurologic examination revealed purposeful movement and attentive behavior. Lab results indicated stable kidney function, normal electrolyte levels, and slightly elevated white blood cell count. The patient was diagnosed with anemia, chronic cancer"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of airway compromise and stridor. The patient develops stridor while sleeping but denies feeling shortness of breath or respiratory distress and maintains oxygen saturation. The patient's heart rate increases up to 120 beats per minute during exertion. ENT and thoracic specialists are discussing the need for a tracheostomy. The patient is also experiencing constipation and has not had a bowel movement since [**12-3**], so lactulose was given. The patient is now nothing by mouth (NPO) for possible tracheostomy placement.

Allergies include Roxicet (oral), which causes nausea/vomiting. The patient has received antibiotics such as Ampicillin/Sulbactam, Vancomycin, and Metronidazole. Other ICU medications include Pantoprazole (Protonix), Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis), and others.

The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for throat discomfort. The patient feels okay otherwise.

Flowsheet data shows vital signs including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also noted.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, and neurologic assessment, all of which were not assessed. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and hematocrit levels. An"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with airway compromise and stridor. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for continued throat discomfort. The patient has been experiencing symptoms such as tachycardia, low blood pressure, and shortness of breath. ENT and thoracic teams are discussing the need for tracheostomy. The patient is constipated and has not had a bowel movement since [**12-3**], so lactulose was given. The patient is now nothing by mouth (NPO) for possible tracheostomy placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction due to esophageal perforation and/or abscess, which is indicated by the presence of a collection of air with fluid anterior to the right aspect of the esophagus at the level of the thyroid gland on MRI Neck. This could potentially worsen the patient's airway compromise and stridor.
2. Infection: The presence of an abscess suggests the possibility of infection, which may require antibiotic treatment.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and stridor indicate potential respiratory distress, which could be exacerbated by any further airway obstruction or infection.
4. Constipation: The patient's constipation could lead to complications such as impaction or fecal withholding, which may require additional interventions to manage.
5. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates chronic"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of laryngeal edema, perforated esophagus, respiratory distress, and anemia. The patient has been in the ICU and is currently receiving various medications including heparin for prophylaxis, pantoprazole, methadone, nortryptaline, compazine, insulin, levofloxacin, flagyl, vancomycin, and lactulose.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 94/48 mmHg to 107/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for some stridor when sleeping last night, which resolved upon awakening. The patient also experiences tachycardia with exertion and has received fluids for a drop in blood pressure. The patient is tolerating tube feeds and is afebrile.

The patient has a history of allergies to Roxicet (oral) and nausea/vomiting. The patient was unable to provide a medical history due to a language barrier, and allergies were obtained from hospital records.

The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, no overweight/obesity, thin build, no anxiety or diaphoresis. The patient's eyes/conjugate are normal, head/ears/nose/throat is normocephalic without endotracheal tube or NG tube. The patient's cardiovascular examination reveals normal PMI, normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, and no rub. The respiratory/chest examination shows clear breath sounds with prolonged expiratory phase and soft inspiratory stridor present. The abdominal examination shows soft, non-tender bowel sounds, no distension, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in place. The extremities show no edema or cyanosis, and the musculoskeletal examination is normal. The neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, oriented to verbal stimuli, and able to move purposefully.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, leukocyte count of 514 K/uL, platelet count of 633 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 26.8 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, glucose of 97 mg/dL, and other laboratory values within normal ranges. The patient's white blood cell count has improved on antibiotics for esophageal perforation.

The assessment and plan include ongoing concern about the patient's airway due to laryngeal edema and stridor, which persists despite previous treatment. The plan is to place the patient back on dexameth"

","The patient is a 40-year-old female with terminal esophageal cancer who presented with recent stridor, nausea/vomiting, and evidence on MRI for possible esophageal perforation. The patient underwent tracheostomy placement and is now without stridor. She received one dose of dexamethasone yesterday and appears to be in no distress. The patient was on CPAP overnight and has been transitioned to tracheostomy mask.

The patient has the following medical complications that can arise:
1. Airway obstruction/malignancy: The patient's terminal esophageal cancer increases the risk of airway obstruction due to the tumor growth. The recent stridor suggests a possible obstruction, which was relieved after tracheostomy placement.
2. Esophageal perforation: There is evidence on MRI suggesting the possibility of an esophageal perforation. This condition can lead to mediastinitis, sepsis, and other serious complications if not managed appropriately.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient had an elevated white blood cell count, which has since resolved. This could indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation, possibly due to the esophageal perforation or another source.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, but she is in no distress. This may be due to hypovolemia, which needs to be addressed with appropriate fluid management.
5. Nutrition: The patient requires nutritional support, as indicated by the"

","Summary:
The patient is an adult male admitted to the ICU with stridor and suspected airway obstruction due to malignancy. The patient underwent tracheostomy and was weaned off the ventilator overnight. A Passy-Muir valve was attempted but not successful. The patient is currently on tracheostomy mask with CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation, set Vt of 400 mL, PS of 15 cmH2O, RR set at 20, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and PIP of 21 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show pH 7.48, PaCO2 38 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 318, Ve of 6.5 L/min, and SpO2 of 100%.

Medical Complications:
1. Airway Obstruction/Malignancy: The patient's primary concern is a possible esophageal perforation, which raises concerns about ongoing edema and potential complications. There is also a question of malignancy causing the airway obstruction.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of terminal esophageal cancer. She presented with stridor, nausea, vomiting, and evidence of possible esophageal perforation on MRI. She underwent a tracheostomy placement without any complications and is now on a tracheostomy mask. Her stridor has resolved after receiving dexamethasone. She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically for esophageal perforation. Her leukocytosis has resolved. She is NPO for possible surgery and J-tube feedings are on hold. There is concern about her low blood pressure, which may be due to hypovolemia. Fluids have been given as needed. The patient is attentive and follows simple commands. Her vital signs are stable, and she is receiving respiratory support with CPAP through the tracheostomy tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Esophageal perforation: The patient's history of recent stridor, nausea, vomiting, and findings on MRI suggest the possibility of esophageal perforation. This condition can lead to severe complications such as mediastinitis, sepsis, and pneumomediastinum if not managed promptly.
2. Infection: Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started due to the suspicion of esophageal perforation. However, there is still a risk of infection spreading from the perforation site, leading to sepsis or localized abscess"

   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed the note by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4058**] and
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  I have previously seen this
   unfortunate young woman with a very serious esophageal cancer, who now
   presents with upper airway obstruction needing tracheostomy.  I concur
   with antibiotic coverage in case there has been some soiling of
   mediastinum from occult esophageal perf.  We will attempt to expedite a
   Passy Muir valve for her use, but the major limiting factor in
   communication is her language barrier.  She seems very depressed and I
   would strongly urge a psych consult with the help of interpreter
   services, as I think she may benefit from antidepressant therapy.  We
   will call her out to the floor, now that her airway is stable with a
   sutured in trache.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with terminal esophageal cancer and recent symptoms of stridor, nausea, and vomiting. She underwent a tracheostomy, which was well-tolerated and allowed for weaning off of mechanical ventilation. The patient's airway obstruction has improved, and she is now on a tracheostomy mask without stridor. An MRI is pending to evaluate for possible esophageal perforation, abscess, or diverticulum.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway Obstruction: The patient initially presented with stridor, indicating a potential airway obstruction. Although the tracheostomy procedure improved her airway, there is still a possibility of recurrent obstruction if the underlying cause (esophageal cancer) progresses or if the tracheostomy site becomes obstructed.
2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for possible esophageal perforation or abscess. This suggests a risk of infection, particularly in the mediastinum if there has been an esophageal perforation.
3. Malnutrition: The patient's ability to eat orally is compromised due to her terminal esophageal cancer. She is currently restarting tube feeds pending surgical approval, indicating a risk of malnutrition if nutrition support is inadequate.
4. Hypotension: The patient has consistently low blood pressure, which could be due to hypovolemia. This may require ongoing fluid administration to maintain"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with stridor and has undergone tracheostomy, which was well-tolerated. They have been weaned off the ventilator and placed on a tracheostomy mask. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the recent episode of stridor overnight. 

The vital signs show a relatively stable condition, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate between 99-131 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/60 to 120/90 mmHg, respiratory rate between 11-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, possibly due to an infection or inflammation. Hemoglobin (Hct) levels are within normal range, but platelet (Plt) count is slightly low. Blood glucose levels are normal, and electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan mention airway obstruction/malignancy as a possible cause of the stridor episode. An MRI of the neck was performed, but the results are pending. There is concern about a possible esophageal perforation, and the patient is currently stable but at risk for continued edema or complications.

The patient has resolved leukocytosis and is being treated with antibiotics for possible esophageal perforation/abscess. They are NPO (nothing by mouth) for possible surgery, and J-tube feedings are on hold. The patient's low blood pressure is being monitored, and fluids are being administered accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the progress note include:

1. Airway obstruction: If the stridor persists or worsens, it can lead to severe respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.

2. Esophageal perforation: This condition can lead to severe complications such as mediastinitis, sepsis, and abscess formation if not treated promptly.

3. Infection: The elevated WBC count suggests an ongoing infection, which may require further investigation and treatment.

4. Hypotension: The consistently low blood pressure may indicate hypovolemia, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction if not managed appropriately.

5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient being NPO and having J-tube feedings on hold may result in inadequate nutrition and potential malnutrition if not addressed promptly.

Overall, the patient's current condition appears stable, but close monitoring and appropriate management of these potential complications are crucial to prevent further deterioration."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer, currently admitted to the ICU. He underwent a tracheostomy procedure without any complications and had his feeding tube restarted. The patient is still confused about his cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and will need further explanation from the doctors. He continues to be tachycardic and has a history of airway obstruction. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/58 to 103/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on various medications including antibiotics, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and has multiple IV lines for medication administration. He is at risk for hypotension, constipation, and airway obstruction.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's presence in the ICU and tracheostomy, he is at increased risk of developing pneumonia due to potential aspiration or infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU setting can increase the risk of blood clots, especially in patients with malignancy.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4321**]
s note above and
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  We have also discussed the
   patient
s case and seen the patient with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2269**], of GI, who knows her
   well.
   The patient appears to be in little pain and with little nausea on the
   combination of low dose Methadone, Zofran, and Neurontin.  Her resp
   status is stable though her upper airway is still narrow as seen by the
   stridor when she breathes around her trache and through her vocal
   cords.  Her BP is stable for her, and her mild tachycardia, also not
   new, will be addressed by giving her more liberal IV fluids.  She has
   been called out to the floor, to finish her antibiotics for abnormal
   MRI suggestive of a microscopic esophageal perforation.  So far she has
   declined to have any Rx of what we think is significant depression.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with terminal esophageal cancer. She has a history of recent stridor, nausea, vomiting, and retching. An MRI of the neck suggests the possibility of esophageal perforation. The patient has undergone tracheostomy placement and is now stable without stridor. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage empirically for esophageal perforation. The patient's leukocytosis has resolved, and she is being continued on antibiotics as per thoracic consultation plan. She is transitioning to tracheostomy mask ventilation and her pain is being managed with gabapentin and methadone. She is also receiving bowel regimen with docusate and lactulose. The patient's hypotension is thought to be due to hypovolemia, and she is being given fluids accordingly. The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, and she is restarting tube feeds pending surgical approval. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction due to malignancy: The patient's upper airway is still narrow as seen by the stridor when she breathes around her tracheostomy and through her vocal cords.
2. Esophageal perforation: The patient's MRI of the neck suggests the possibility of esophageal perforation, which is a serious complication that can lead to mediastinitis and sepsis.
3. Infection: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential infections"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with terminal esophageal cancer, who has a history of recent stridor, nausea, vomiting, and evidence of esophageal perforation on MRI. She underwent a tracheostomy placement without stridor and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible esophageal perforation or abscess. The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure consistently below normal, but she is not in distress. Her white blood cell count has resolved, and she is restarting tube feeds today pending surgical approval. She is also receiving pain management with gabapentin and methadone. Her bowel regimen includes docusate and lactulose. The patient's medical history includes chronic anemia and cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction due to malignancy: Since the patient has esophageal cancer, there is a risk of airway obstruction, which can be exacerbated by factors such as tracheostomy placement or other interventions.
2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to the suspicion of esophageal perforation or abscess. There is a potential risk of developing further infections, especially if the antibiotics are not effective.
3. Hypotension: The patient's consistently low blood pressure indicates hypotension. This can be due to hypovolemia, and appropriate fluid management is crucial to prevent complications like organ dysfunction.
4. Constipation: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with airway obstruction. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 128 bpm and hypotension with a blood pressure of 83/39 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support consists of a tracheal mask with supplemental oxygen, and their ABG results show pH at 7.29. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and their skin and neurologic examination findings are also not available. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit levels, and slightly decreased platelet count. Blood glucose levels have been within normal range. Other lab values include prolonged PT/PTT/INR, increased neutrophils, and decreased lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with terminal esophageal cancer who has recently experienced stridor, nausea, vomiting, and potential evidence of esophageal perforation on MRI. She underwent tracheostomy placement on [**12-8**]. The patient appears to be in no distress but continues to have a persistent cough and is currently on a tracheal mask. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage has been initiated empirically for esophageal perforation. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for complaints of cough. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction: The patient's history of stridor and recent tracheostomy placement indicate a risk of airway obstruction.
2. Hypotension/tachycardia: The patient has low baseline blood pressures and exhibits tachycardia with movement or cough. This could be related to cardiac issues such as effusion or pericarditis, which are being investigated with an echocardiogram.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient initially presented with leukocytosis, which has since resolved. However, she is still receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible esophageal perforation/abscess.
4. Flat affect/depression: The patient exhibits a flat affect and may be experiencing depression. Refusal of social work/psych input is being monitored.
5. Nutritional issues: The patient's nutrition plan is pending surgical approval and involves restarting tube feeds"
