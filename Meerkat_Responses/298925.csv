   Assessment and Plan
   68F with known aortic stenosis, COPD, recently treated pneumonia with
   dyspnea, fatigue and severe AS who developed acute SOB and hypoxia, now
   s/p intubation.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient became acutely SOB on the floor.
   Differential includes CHF, COPD, infection, PE, pulmonary hemorrhage
   (given bloody secretions from ETT).  Was hypertensive on floor and has
   severe AS so ? flash pulmonary edema in setting of diastolic
   dysfunction.  COPD likely contributing as well.  PE possible given
   recent prolonged hospitalization, however was on heparin ggt so less
   likely.  Completed course of antibiotics for PNA, has been afebrile.
   CXR now improved with positive pressure.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated with goal O2 sat >92%
   - Cont. lasix for goal I/O -500cc
   - Cont. nebs, steroid taper for COPD flare
   - Holding heparin in setting of gross blood from ETT
   - Serial Hct, consider bronch if dropping or bloody secretions worsen.
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Moderate to severe as noted by TTE yesterday.
   Likely source for patient's progressive weakness, fatigue, shortness of
   breath, and lower extremity edema. Evaluated by CT surgery for possible
   AVR. Pre-op workup initiated prior to transfer.  Will likely need
   cardiac catherization, now on hold given worsening respiratory
   failure.
   - Continue to hold nitrates as patient is preload dependent
   - Labetolol gtt prn to maintain SBP 110-140
   - ACE inhibitor may be considered once renal function improves as it
   has good afterload reducing effect
   - CT surgery following, appreciate their recs
   .
   #. Coronaries:  Had non-obstructive coronary disease on cath in [**2178**].
   Troponins elevated here to 0.14.  Differential includes demand from
   pumping against AS and ACS. By report, troponin trending downwards from
   outside hospital records. EKG with diffuse TWI, worsened in setting of
   respiratory distress.  Patient denied CP prior to intubation.
   - Continue to trend CE
   - Continue ASA, BB, statin
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Repeat EKG in am
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Unclear if patient has had this in the past.
   Currently back in NSR.  [**Month (only) 51**] be due to acute illness - recent pneumonia,
   decompensated heart failure. Also hyperthyroid which could induce
   afib.  CHADS score 3. Was on heparin gtt on the floor. Currently rate
   controlled
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Holding heparin gtt in setting of bloody secretions
   - Cont. BB, verapamil
   .
   #. DM type II: Diet controlled at home but elevated blood sugars.
   Started on [**Month (only) 3226**].
   - Cont. [**Last Name (LF) 3226**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] uptirate as needed.
   - Cont. SSI
   .
   #. Hypercholesterolemia - Cholesterol panel suboptimal. Total
   cholesterol>200 with LDL>130. Target LDL<100. Of note, patient reports
   recently being taken off of lovastatin secondary to myalgias.
   - Continue simvastatin
   .
   #. Thyrotoxicosis: TSH low (0.1).  T3 48 and free T4 1.2
   - Continue methimazole per home regimen
   .
   #. ARF: Unknown baseline, however Cr at OSH was 1.3 which is currently
   where patient is. Will need to balance diuresis with maintaining
   appropriate blood pressures and not worsening hypernatremia or renal
   failure.  Diuresis may help forward flow, increasing GFR and thus
   improving kideny function.
   - Cont. to follow
   .
   #. Anemia: In [**2178**], hematocrit was in the mid-30s. Normocytic anemia
   currently. Hct stable currently.
   - Anemia work-up, including iron, B12, folate studies
   - Guiac stools
   - Cont. to trend

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of aortic stenosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, hypercholesterolemia, thyrotoxicosis, acute renal failure, and anemia. She was admitted overnight and received Lasix for fluid overload. Her arterial line was placed without incident. She has been weaned from 100% FiO2 to 50%. The patient is currently on fentanyl and midazolam infusions, and her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 161/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. She has a history of recent acute shortness of breath and hypoxia, and she has been intubated. The differential diagnosis for respiratory failure includes congestive heart failure (CHF), COPD exacerbation, infection, pulmonary embolism (PE), and pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient has moderate to severe aortic stenosis, which may be contributing to her symptoms. She has completed a course of antibiotics for pneumonia and has no fever. Her chest X-ray shows improvement with positive pressure ventilation. The plan includes weaning FiO2 as tolerated, continuing Lasix for goal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with known aortic stenosis, COPD, and recently treated pneumonia. She was admitted overnight and received an arterial line without incident. Lasix 20mg IV was given for fluid overload, resulting in a net negative fluid balance of over 2.3 liters. The patient's FiO2 was weaned from 100% to 50%. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 161/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and sedated. Physical examination findings include a holosystolic murmur, diminished S1 and blunted S2 heart sounds, rhonchorous breath sounds, 2+ pitting edema to the knees bilaterally, and hypoactive bowel sounds.

Laboratory results show a TCO2 level of 33. The patient is being treated for respiratory failure, aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, hypercholesterolemia, thyrotoxicosis, acute renal failure, anemia, and gastrointestinal issues. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute shortness of breath and hypoxia may indicate respiratory failure. Possible causes include congestive heart failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   68F with known aortic stenosis, COPD, recently treated pneumonia with
   dyspnea, fatigue and severe AS who developed acute SOB and hypoxia, now
   s/p intubation.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient became acutely SOB on the floor.
   Differential includes CHF, COPD, infection, PE, pulmonary hemorrhage
   (given bloody secretions from ETT).  Was hypertensive on floor and has
   severe AS so ? flash pulmonary edema in setting of diastolic
   dysfunction.  COPD likely contributing as well.  PE possible given
   recent prolonged hospitalization, however was on heparin ggt so less
   likely.  Completed course of antibiotics for PNA, has been afebrile.
   CXR now improved with positive pressure.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated with goal O2 sat >92%
   - Cont. lasix for goal I/O -500cc
   - Cont. nebs
   - Holding heparin in setting of gross blood from ETT
   - Serial Hct, consider bronch if dropping or bloody secretions worsen.
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Moderate to severe as noted by TTE yesterday.
   Likely source for patient's progressive weakness, fatigue, shortness of
   breath, and lower extremity edema. Evaluated by CT surgery for possible
   AVR. Pre-op workup initiated prior to transfer.  Will likely need
   cardiac catherization, now on hold given worsening respiratory
   failure.
   - Continue to hold nitrates as patient is preload dependent
   - ACE inhibitor may be considered once renal function improves as it
   has good afterload reducing effect
   - CT surgery following, appreciate their recs
   - dental consult for pre-op clearance
   - panorex ordered, not yet read
   .
   # Hypertension
 patient hypertensive which may have contributed to
   acutely worsening heart failure and possibly flash pulmonary edema.
   Patient maintained on beta blocker and CCB as outpatient.
   -          increase BB dose
   -          cont CCB
   -          hydral with holding parameters for SBP < 140 (goal SBP
   140-160 in the setting of aortic stenosis and preload dependence)
   -          start ACE inhibitor now that Cr improved
   .
   #. Coronaries:  Had non-obstructive coronary disease on cath in [**2178**].
   Troponins elevated here to 0.14 in the setting of renal failure.
   Differential includes demand from pumping against AS and ACS. Both
   troponins and CKs flat so do not suspect acute ischemia. EKG with
   diffuse TWI, worsened in setting of respiratory distress.  Patient
   denied CP prior to intubation.
   - Continue ASA, BB, statin
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Repeat EKG in am
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Unclear if patient has had this in the past.
   Currently back in NSR.  [**Month (only) 51**] be due to acute illness - recent pneumonia,
   decompensated heart failure. Also hyperthyroid which could induce
   afib.  CHADS score 3. Was on heparin gtt on the floor. Currently rate
   controlled
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Holding heparin gtt in setting of bloody secretions, will eventually
   need to be started on coumadin
   - Cont. BB, verapamil  uptitrate as tolerated
   .
   #. DM type II: Diet controlled at home but elevated blood sugars.
   Started on [**Month (only) 3226**].
   - Cont. [**Last Name (LF) 3226**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] uptirate as needed.
   - Cont. SSI

   #. Hypercholesterolemia - Cholesterol panel suboptimal. Total
   cholesterol>200 with LDL>130. Target LDL<100. Of note, patient reports
   recently being taken off of lovastatin secondary to myalgias.
   - increase simvastatin to 80 mg PO daily, check LFTS
   .
   #. Thyrotoxicosis: TSH low (0.1).  T3 48 and free T4 1.2 which is WNL.
   - Continue methimazole per home regimen
   .
   #. ARF now resolved: Unknown baseline, however Cr at OSH was 1.3 now
   improved to 1.1. Suspect that patient with some chronic baseline renal
   insufficiency. Will need to balance diuresis with maintaining
   appropriate blood pressures and not worsening hypernatremia or renal
   failure.  Diuresis may help forward flow, increasing GFR and thus
   improving kideny function.
   - Cont. to follow
   .
   #. Anemia: In [**2178**], hematocrit was in the mid-30s. Normocytic anemia
   currently. Hct stable currently. Admission anemia labs are tibc 220
   (low), b12 elevated, folate normal, ferritin 440 (elevated),
   transferrin 160 (low), iron 58 (normal). Suspect component of anemic of
   chronic disease.

   Assessment and Plan
   68F with known aortic stenosis, COPD, recently treated pneumonia with
   dyspnea, fatigue and severe AS who developed acute SOB and hypoxia, now
   s/p intubation.
   .
   # Respiratory failure now resolved: Patient became acutely SOB on the
   floor.  Differential includes CHF, COPD, infection, PE, pulmonary
   hemorrhage (given bloody secretions from ETT).  Was hypertensive on
   floor and has severe AS so ? flash pulmonary edema in setting of
   diastolic dysfunction.  COPD likely contributing as well.  PE possible
   given recent prolonged hospitalization, however was on heparin ggt so
   less likely.  Completed course of antibiotics for PNA, has been
   afebrile.  CXR now improved with positive pressure. Patient was
   extubated [**2181-3-1**] intiially on CPAP and then with additional diuresis
   able to transition to nasal cannula.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated with goal O2 sat >92%
   - Cont. lasix for goal I/O -500cc, give 40 IV lasix yesterday
   - Cont. nebs
   - Holding heparin in setting of gross blood from ETT
   - Serial Hct, consider bronchscopy if dropping or bloody secretions
   worsen.
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Moderate to severe as noted by TTE. Likely source
   for patient's progressive weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, and
   lower extremity edema. Patient being evaluated by CT surgery for
   possible AVR. Will likely need cardiac [**Last Name (LF) 5731**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to get
   patient on the board as soon as possible for cardiac [**First Name3 (LF) 5731**].
   Panorex ordered. Called dental consult yesterday.
   - Continue to hold nitrates as patient is preload dependent
   - ACE inhibitor may be considered once renal function improves as it
   has good afterload reducing effect
   - CT surgery following, appreciate their recs
   .
   # Hypertension
 patient hypertensive which may have contributed to
   acutely worsening heart failure and possibly flash pulmonary edema.
   Patient maintained on beta blocker and CCB as outpatient.  Increased BB
   and continued CCB at current dose. Started patient on hydral IV with
   holding parameters for low blood pressure to keep blood pressure goal
   140-160 systolic in the setting of severe aortic stenosis and preload
   dependence. Started ACE inhibitor yesterday.
   -          Cont BB, CCB, ACEi
   -   hydral with holding parameters for SBP < 140 (goal SBP 140-160 in
   the setting of aortic stenosis and preload dependence).
   #. Coronaries:  Had non-obstructive coronary disease on cath in [**2178**].
   Troponins elevated here to 0.14 in the setting of renal failure.
   Differential includes demand from pumping against AS and ACS. Both
   troponins and CKs flat so do not suspect acute ischemia. EKG with
   diffuse TWI, worsened in setting of respiratory distress.  Patient
   denied CP prior to intubation.
   - Continue ASA, BB, statin
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Unclear if patient has had this in the past.
   Currently back in NSR.  [**Month (only) 51**] be due to acute illness - recent pneumonia,
   decompensated heart failure. Also hyperthyroid which could induce
   afib.  CHADS score 3. Was on heparin gtt on the floor. Currently rate
   controlled
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Holding heparin gtt in setting of bloody secretions, will eventually
   need to be started on coumadin
   - Cont. BB, verapamil  uptitrate as tolerated
   .
   #. DM type II: Diet controlled at home but elevated blood sugars.
   Started on [**Month (only) 3226**].
   - Cont. [**Last Name (LF) 3226**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] uptirate as needed.
   - Cont. SSI

   #. Hypercholesterolemia - Cholesterol panel suboptimal. Total
   cholesterol>200 with LDL>130. Target LDL<100. Of note, patient reports
   recently being taken off of lovastatin secondary to myalgias.
   - increase simvastatin to 80 mg PO daily, check LFTS
   .
   #. Thyrotoxicosis: TSH low (0.1).  T3 48 and free T4 1.2 which is WNL.
   - Continue methimazole per home regimen
   .
   #. ARF now resolved: Unknown baseline, however Cr at OSH was 1.3 now
   improved to 1.1. Suspect that patient with some chronic baseline renal
   insufficiency. Will need to balance diuresis with maintaining
   appropriate blood pressures and not worsening hypernatremia or renal
   failure.  Diuresis may help forward flow, increasing GFR and thus
   improving kideny function.
   - Cont. to follow

   #. Anemia: In [**2178**], hematocrit was in the mid-30s. Normocytic anemia
   currently. Hct stable currently. Admission anemia labs are tibc 220
   (low), b12 elevated, folate normal, ferritin 440 (elevated),
   transferrin 160 (low), iron 58 (normal). Suspect component of anemic of

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with known aortic stenosis, COPD, and recent pneumonia. She presented with dyspnea, fatigue, and severe AS. She developed acute respiratory failure and was intubated. Her respiratory status improved with CPAP and additional diuresis, allowing extubation. The patient is currently on CPAP via nasal cannula. She has a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes type II, hypercholesterolemia, and thyrotoxicosis. Her renal function is improved from acute renal failure. She also has anemia of chronic disease and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially experienced acute respiratory failure, which required intubation. Close monitoring and management of her respiratory status are essential.
2. Heart failure: The patient's moderate to severe aortic stenosis may contribute to her symptoms of weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, and lower extremity edema. Cardiac consultation is recommended for possible aortic valve replacement.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may have contributed to acutely worsening heart failure and possibly flash pulmonary edema. Blood pressure control is crucial, and medications such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors may be considered.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of non-obstructive coronary disease, and her tropon"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent pneumonia. She presented with dyspnea, fatigue, and severe aortic stenosis. The patient was intubated due to acute respiratory failure but has now been extubated and placed on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). 

Medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially experienced acute respiratory failure, which necessitated intubation. Even though she has been extubated and placed on CPAP, there is still a risk of recurring respiratory failure if her respiratory status worsens.

2. Heart failure: The patient has moderate to severe aortic stenosis and symptoms of heart failure. There is a risk of worsening heart failure if her cardiac function deteriorates further.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may contribute to her current condition of congestive heart failure. Proper management of blood pressure is crucial to prevent further complications.

4. Coronary artery disease: The patient had non-obstructive coronary disease on cardiac catheterization in the past, but with elevated troponin levels, there is a possibility of ongoing myocardial ischemia or infarction.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be managed carefully to avoid worsening renal function or dehydration.

6. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a stable hematocrit level. It is important to monitor her blood counts and provide appropriate transfusions if necessary.

7. Thyrotoxicosis: The patient has low TSH levels, but normal T3 and free T4 levels, indicating a possible subclinical thyrotoxicosis. Methimazole should be continued as per her home regimen.

8. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's baseline renal function is not known, but her creatinine levels are improving from 1.3 to 1.1. Monitoring renal function and avoiding nephrotoxic agents is important.

9. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's cholesterol panel shows elevated total cholesterol and LDL levels. Simvastatin should be increased to 80 mg daily, and liver function tests should be monitored.

10. GI bleeding: The patient has gross blood from the endotracheal tube, indicating a possible gastrointestinal bleed. Monitoring for melena or hematemesis and performing a guaiac stool test is important.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory status, heart failure symptoms, hypertension, electrolyte imbalances, anemia, thyroid function, renal function, and cholesterol levels. Additionally, the cause of her dyspnea and hypoxia needs further investigation."

   Assessment and Plan
   68F with known aortic stenosis, COPD, recently treated pneumonia with
   dyspnea, fatigue and severe AS who developed acute SOB and hypoxia, now
   s/p intubation.
   .
   # Respiratory failure now resolved: Likely CHF, s/p extubation after 24
   hours and 3 liter diuresis, and transiently required CPAP.  Also had
   markedly bloody secretions, while intubated, possibly related to OP
   trauma from ET tube.  Completed course of antibiotics for PNA at OSH,
   has been afebrile.  CXR now improved after diuresis and patient now
   weaned to nasal cannula.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated as continue diuresis
   - goal I/O is -500  to -1 Liter per day which was not met yesterday
   secondary to post catherization hydration, 40 IV lasix now and then
   check I/O later
   - Cont. nebs
   - Holding heparin in setting of gross blood from ETT, can consider
   restarting today
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Moderate to severe on TTE with heart failure
   symptoms.  Patient being evaluated by CT surgery for possible AVR.
   Patient got cardiac catherization yesterday which demonstrated clean
   coronaries, aortic area of 0.89 with gradient of only 16 (less than
   previously thought).  Panorex ordered. Cleared by dental for surgery.
   - Continue to hold nitrates as patient is preload dependent
   - ACE inhibitor restarted
   - f/u surgery recs, consider TEE as needed to assess valve area
   .
   # Hypertension
 [**Month (only) 51**] have contributed to CHF, increased BB and
   continued CCB at outpatient dose and PRN hydralazine
   - Cont BB, CCB, ACEi
   - hydral with holding parameters for SBP < 140 (goal SBP 140-160 in the
   setting of aortic stenosis and preload dependence).
   #. Coronaries:  Had non-obstructive coronary disease on cath in [**2178**].
   Troponins elevated here to 0.14 with normal CKs, so elevation secondary
   to ARF and CHF most likely.  Repeat cardiac catherization here
   demonstrates no evidence of coronary artery disease.  Patient is s/p
   catherization now with bruit at groin site.
   - Continue ASA, BB, statin
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - follow up groin ultrasound
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Unclear if patient has had this in the past.
   Currently back in NSR. Precipitated by CHF.  Was on heparin gtt on the
   floor, will need warfarin on discharge for longterm stroke prevention
   but would hold off on starting now in the setting of possible future
   surgery.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Holding heparin gtt in setting of bloody secretions
   - Cont. BB, CCB at current dose appears to be well rate controlled
   .
   #. DM type II: Diet controlled at home but elevated blood sugars.

   cholesterol>200 with LDL>130. Target LDL<100. Of note, patient reports
   recently being taken off of lovastatin secondary to myalgias.
   Admission LFTs mildly elevated likely in the setting of passive
   congestion which have been improving
   -          increase simvastatin to 80 mg PO daily
   -          trend LFTs
   .
   #. Thyrotoxicosis: TSH low (0.1).  T3 48 and free T4 1.2 which is WNL.
   - Continue methimazole per home regimen.
   .
   #. ARF now resolved: Unknown baseline, however Cr at OSH was 1.3 now
   improved to 0.9 which is patient

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with known aortic stenosis, COPD, and recently treated pneumonia. She presented with acute shortness of breath and hypoxia, leading to intubation. After extubation, she required CPAP due to respiratory failure, which has now resolved. She also had markedly bloody secretions while intubated, possibly related to oral trauma from the endotracheal tube.

The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for pneumonia at OSH and has been afebrile. Her chest X-ray improved after diuresis and she was weaned to a nasal cannula. Oxygen should be weaned as tolerated and diuresis continued. Nebulizers should be continued and heparin should be held in the setting of gross blood from the endotracheal tube, with the possibility of restarting today.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization yesterday, which demonstrated clean coronaries, an aortic area of 0.89 with a gradient of only 16 (less than previously thought). A Panorex was ordered and the patient was cleared by dental for surgery. Nitrates should be continued to hold, ACE inhibitors should be restarted, and follow-up surgery recommendations should be considered, including transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) as needed to assess valve area.

The patient's hypertension has contributed to congestive heart failure (CHF), with increased beta-blockers (BB) and continued calcium channel blockers ("

   Assessment and Plan
   68F with known aortic stenosis, COPD, recently treated pneumonia with
   dyspnea, fatigue and severe AS who developed acute SOB and hypoxia, now
   s/p intubation.
   .
   # Respiratory failure now resolved: Likely CHF, s/p extubation after 24
   hours and 3 liter diuresis, and transiently required CPAP.  Also had
   markedly bloody secretions, while intubated, possibly related to OP
   trauma from ET tube.  Completed course of antibiotics for PNA at OSH,
   has been afebrile.  CXR now improved after diuresis and patient now
   weaned to nasal cannula.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated as continue diuresis
   - goal I/O is -500  to -1 Liter per day which was not met yesterday
   secondary to post catherization hydration, 40 IV lasix now and then
   check I/O later
   - Cont. nebs
   - Holding heparin in setting of gross blood from ETT, can consider
   restarting today
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Moderate to severe on TTE with heart failure
   symptoms.  Patient being evaluated by CT surgery for possible AVR.
   Patient got cardiac catherization yesterday which demonstrated clean
   coronaries, aortic area of 0.89 cm2 with gradient of only 15 however
   here C.O is low.  Apparently also with significant aortic insufficiency
   based on wide pulse pressure. Panorex complete. Cleared by dental for
   surgery.
   - Continue to hold nitrates as patient is preload dependent
   - ACE inhibitor restarted
   - f/u surgery recs, consider TEE as needed to assess valve area
   .
   # Hypertension
 [**Month (only) 51**] have contributed to CHF, increased BB and
   continued CCB at outpatient dose and PRN hydralazine
   - Cont BB, CCB, ACEi
   - hydral with holding parameters for SBP < 140 (goal SBP 140-160 in the
   setting of aortic stenosis and preload dependence).
   #. Coronaries:  Had non-obstructive coronary disease on cath in [**2178**].
   Troponins elevated here to 0.14 with normal CKs, so elevation secondary
   to ARF and CHF most likely.  Repeat cardiac catherization here
   demonstrates no evidence of coronary artery disease.  Patient is s/p
   catherization now with bruit at groin site.
   - Continue ASA, BB, statin
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - follow up groin ultrasound
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Unclear if patient has had this in the past.
   Currently back in NSR. Precipitated by CHF.  Was on heparin gtt on the
   floor, will need warfarin on discharge for longterm stroke prevention
   but would hold off on starting now in the setting of possible future
   surgery.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Holding heparin gtt in setting of bloody secretions
   - Cont. BB, CCB at current dose appears to be well rate controlled
   .
   #. DM type II: Diet controlled at home but elevated blood sugars.
   Started on [**Year (4 digits) 3226**].
   - Cont. [**Last Name (LF) 3226**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] uptirate as needed.
   - Cont. SSI
   .
   #. Hypercholesterolemia - Cholesterol panel suboptimal. Total
   cholesterol>200 with LDL>130. Target LDL<100. Of note, patient reports
   recently being taken off of lovastatin secondary to myalgias.
   Admission LFTs mildly elevated likely in the setting of passive
   congestion which have been improving
   -          increase simvastatin to 80 mg PO daily
   -          trend LFTs
   .
   #. Thyrotoxicosis: TSH low (0.1).  T3 48 and free T4 1.2 which is WNL.
   - Continue methimazole per home regimen.
   .
   #. ARF now resolved: Unknown baseline, however Cr at OSH was 1.3 now
   improved to 0.9 which is patient
s baseline. Suspect component of heart
   failure with poor forward flow contributed as patient improved with
   diuresis.
   -          Cont. to follow
   -          Renally dose medications as needed
   -          Post catherization hydration
   .
   #. Anemia: In [**2178**], hematocrit was in the mid-30s. Normocytic anemia
   currently. Hct stable currently. Admission anemia labs are tibc 220
   (low), b12 elevated, folate normal, ferritin 440 (elevated),
   transferrin 160 (low), iron 58 (normal). Suspect component of anemic of
   chronic disease.
   - Guiac all stools
   - Cont. to trend
   - transfuse for Hct<27
   - active type and screen
   .
   #. FEN/GI: Hypernatremia now resolved: suspect component of diuresis
   improved with some free water repletion in the setting of active
   diuresis with lasix.
   -          Replete lytes prn
   -          Consider free water bolus as needed to maintain sodium

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recent pneumonia, and severe aortic stenosis. She presented with acute shortness of breath and hypoxia, leading to intubation. The patient had respiratory failure, likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF), which has now resolved. She was extubated after 24 hours and required CPAP. The patient also had bloody secretions while intubated, possibly related to oral trauma from the endotracheal tube. She completed a course of antibiotics for pneumonia at the outside hospital and has been afebrile. Her chest X-ray improved after diuresis and she was weaned to a nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of hypertension, which contributed to CHF, and is being treated with beta-blockers (BB) and calcium channel blockers (CCB) at outpatient doses, with additional hydralazine as needed. She also has non-obstructive coronary disease and had a cardiac catheterization that demonstrated clean coronaries with an aortic area of 0.89 cm2 and a gradient of only 15. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is low. She has significant aortic insufficiency based on wide pulse pressure. She is being evaluated by cardiovascular surgery for possible aortic valve replacement (AVR). The patient's dental evaluation"

   # Respiratory failure now resolved: Likely CHF, s/p extubation after 24
   hours and 3 litre diuresis, and transiently required CPAP.  Also has
   markedly bloody secretions, while intubated, possibly related to OP
   trauma from ET tube.  Completed course of antibiotics for PNA at OSH,
   has been afebrile.  CXR now improved after diuresis and patient now
   weaned to nasal cannula.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated with goal O2 sat >92%
   - Cont. lasix for goal I/O -500cc, gave 40 IV lasix yesterday
   - Cont. nebs
   - Holding heparin in setting of gross blood from ETT, can consider

   - Serial Hct, consider bronchscopy if dropping or bloody secretions
   worsen.
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Moderate to severe on TTE with heart failure
   symptoms.  Patient being evaluated by CT surgery for possible AVR. Plan
   for cardiac catheterization.  Panorex ordered. Called dental consult
   yesterday.    Carotid ultrasounds performed.
   - Continue to hold nitrates as patient is preload dependent
   - ACE inhibitor restarted
   - CT surgery following, appreciate their recs
   .
   # Hypertension
 [**Month (only) 51**] have contributed to CHF, increased BB and
   continued CCB at outpatient dose and PRN IV hydralazine
   - Cont BB, CCB, ACEi
   - hydral with holding parameters for SBP < 140 (goal SBP 140-160 in the

   #. Coronaries:  Had non-obstructive coronary disease on cath in [**2178**].
   Troponins elevated here to 0.14 with normal CKs, so elevation secondary
   to ARF and CHF most likely.
   - Clear coronaries at cath

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications:

1. The patient is a 68-year-old female with known aortic stenosis, COPD, and recently treated pneumonia. She presented with acute shortness of breath and hypoxia, leading to intubation.

2. The patient experienced respiratory failure, which has now resolved. She was extubated after 24 hours and required CPAP. The patient also had markedly bloody secretions while intubated, possibly related to oral trauma from the endotracheal tube.

3. The patient completed a course of antibiotics for pneumonia at OSH and is now afebrile. Her chest X-ray improved after diuresis, and she was weaned to a nasal cannula. Oxygen saturation was maintained above 92%.

4. The patient's aortic stenosis is moderate to severe, and she is preload dependent. Cardiac surgery evaluation is pending, and a cardiac catheterization is planned. A Panorex was ordered to assess dental issues before surgery.

5. The patient has hypertension, which has contributed to congestive heart failure. Blood pressure control includes continuing beta-blockers (BB), calcium channel blockers (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi). Hydralazine was also used with specific blood pressure parameters.

6. Coronary angiography showed non-obstructive coronary disease. Tropon"

   Assessment and Plan
   68F with known aortic stenosis, COPD, recently treated pneumonia with
   dyspnea, fatigue and severe AS who developed hypoxic respiratory
   failure, requiring intubation, now extubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure now resolved: Likely CHF, s/p extubation after 24
   hours and 3 liter diuresis, and transiently required CPAP.  Also had
   markedly bloody secretions while intubated, possibly related to OP
   trauma from ET tube.  Completed course of antibiotics for PNA at OSH,
   has been afebrile.  CXR now improved after diuresis and patient now
   weaned to nasal cannula.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated as continue diuresis
   - goal I/O is -500  to -1 Liter per day which was not met yesterday
   secondary to post catherization hydration, 40 IV lasix now and then
   check I/O later
   - restart home inhalers
   - Holding heparin in setting of gross blood from ETT
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Moderate to severe on TTE with heart failure
   symptoms.  Patient being evaluated by CT surgery for possible AVR.
   Patient got cardiac catherization yesterday which demonstrated clean
   coronaries, aortic area of 0.89 cm2 with gradient of only 15  which is
   a discrepancy from TTE.  Apparently also with significant aortic
   insufficiency based on wide pulse pressure. Panorex complete. Cleared
   by dental for surgery.
   - Continue to hold nitrates as patient is preload dependent
   - ACE inhibitor restarted
   - Repeat TTE
   - f/u surgery recs
   .
   # Hypertension
 [**Month (only) 51**] have contributed to CHF, increased BB and
   continued CCB at outpatient dose and PRN hydralazine
   - Cont BB, CCB, ACEi
   - hydral with holding parameters for SBP < 140 (goal SBP 140-160 in the
   setting of aortic stenosis and preload dependence).
   #. Coronaries:  Had non-obstructive coronary disease on cath in [**2178**].
   Troponins elevated here to 0.14 with normal CKs, so elevation secondary
   to ARF and CHF most likely.  Repeat cardiac catherization here
   demonstrates no evidence of coronary artery disease.  Patient is s/p
   catherization now with bruit at groin site.
   - Continue ASA, BB, statin
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - follow up groin ultrasound
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Unclear if patient has had this in the past.
   Currently back in NSR. Precipitated by CHF.  Was on heparin gtt on the
   floor, will need warfarin on discharge for longterm stroke prevention
   but would hold off on starting now in the setting of possible future
   surgery.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Holding heparin gtt in setting of bloody secretions
   - Cont. BB, CCB at current dose appears to be well rate controlled
   .
   #. DM type II: Diet controlled at home but elevated blood sugars.
   Started on [**Year (4 digits) 3226**].
   - Cont. [**Last Name (LF) 3226**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] uptirate as needed.
   - Cont. SSI
   .
   #. Hypercholesterolemia - Cholesterol panel suboptimal. Total
   cholesterol>200 with LDL>130. Target LDL<100. Of note, patient reports
   recently being taken off of lovastatin secondary to myalgias.
   Admission LFTs mildly elevated likely in the setting of passive
   congestion which have been improving
   -          increase simvastatin to 80 mg PO daily
   -          trend LFTs
   .
   #. Thyrotoxicosis: TSH low (0.1).  T3 48 and free T4 1.2 which is WNL.
   - Continue methimazole per home regimen.
   .
   #. ARF now resolved: Unknown baseline, however Cr at OSH was 1.3 now
   improved to 0.9 which is patient
s baseline. Suspect component of heart
   failure with poor forward flow contributed as patient improved with
   diuresis.
   -          Cont. to follow
   -          Renally dose medications as needed
   -          Post catherization hydration
   .
   #. Anemia: In [**2178**], hematocrit was in the mid-30s. Normocytic anemia
   currently. Hct stable currently. Admission anemia labs are tibc 220
   (low), b12 elevated, folate normal, ferritin 440 (elevated),
   transferrin 160 (low), iron 58 (normal). Suspect component of anemic of
   chronic disease.
   - Guiac all stools
   - Cont. to trend
   - transfuse for Hct<27
   - active type and screen
   .
   #. FEN/GI: Hypernatremia : suspect component of diuresis with lasix.
   Encourage PO
   -          Replete lytes prn
   -          Consider free water bolus as needed to maintain sodium

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient likely had CHF, as evidenced by her symptoms and the need for a 3-liter diuresis. She also required CPAP after extubation.
3. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has moderate to severe aortic stenosis, as determined by TTE. She is being evaluated by cardiac surgery for possible aortic valve replacement (AVR).
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient had non-obstructive coronary disease on previous catheterization. However, her recent cardiac catheterization showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.
5. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure has contributed to CHF. She is on multiple medications for blood pressure control, including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors.

   Assessment and Plan
   68F with known aortic stenosis, COPD, recently treated pneumonia with
   dyspnea, fatigue and severe AS who developed hypoxic respiratory
   failure, requiring intubation, now extubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure now resolved: Likely CHF, s/p extubation after 24
   hours and 3 liter diuresis, and transiently required CPAP.  Also had
   markedly bloody secretions while intubated, possibly related to OP
   trauma from ET tube.  Completed course of antibiotics for PNA at OSH,
   has been afebrile.  CXR now improved after diuresis and patient now
   weaned to nasal cannula.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated as continue diuresis
   - goal I/O is -500  to -1 Liter per day which was not met yesterday
   secondary to post catherization hydration, 40 IV lasix now and then
   check I/O later
   - restart home inhalers
   - Holding heparin in setting of gross blood from ETT
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Moderate to severe on TTE with heart failure
   symptoms.  Patient being evaluated by CT surgery for possible AVR.
   Patient got cardiac catherization yesterday which demonstrated clean
   coronaries, aortic area of 0.89 cm2 with gradient of only 15  which is
   a discrepancy from TTE.  Apparently also with significant aortic
   insufficiency based on wide pulse pressure. Panorex complete. Cleared
   by dental for surgery.
   - Continue to hold nitrates as patient is preload dependent
   - ACE inhibitor restarted
   - Repeat TTE
   - f/u surgery recs
   .
   # Hypertension
 [**Month (only) 51**] have contributed to CHF, increased BB and
   continued CCB at outpatient dose and PRN hydralazine
   - Cont BB, CCB, ACEi
   - hydral with holding parameters for SBP < 140 (goal SBP 140-160 in the
   setting of aortic stenosis and preload dependence).
   #. Coronaries:  Had non-obstructive coronary disease on cath in [**2178**].
   Troponins elevated here to 0.14 with normal CKs, so elevation secondary
   to ARF and CHF most likely.  Repeat cardiac catherization here
   demonstrates no evidence of coronary artery disease.  Patient is s/p
   catherization now with bruit at groin site.
   - Continue ASA, BB, statin
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - follow up groin ultrasound
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Unclear if patient has had this in the past.
   Currently back in NSR. Precipitated by CHF.  Was on heparin gtt on the
   floor, will need warfarin on discharge for longterm stroke prevention
   but would hold off on starting now in the setting of possible future
   surgery.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Holding heparin gtt in setting of bloody secretions
   - Cont. BB, CCB at current dose appears to be well rate controlled
   .
   #. DM type II: Diet controlled at home but elevated blood sugars.
   Started on [**Year (4 digits) 3226**].
   - Cont. [**Last Name (LF) 3226**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] uptirate as needed.
   - Cont. SSI
   .
   #. Hypercholesterolemia - Cholesterol panel suboptimal. Total
   cholesterol>200 with LDL>130. Target LDL<100. Of note, patient reports
   recently being taken off of lovastatin secondary to myalgias.
   Admission LFTs mildly elevated likely in the setting of passive
   congestion which have been improving
   -          increase simvastatin to 80 mg PO daily
   -          trend LFTs
   .
   #. Thyrotoxicosis: TSH low (0.1).  T3 48 and free T4 1.2 which is WNL.
   - Continue methimazole per home regimen.
   .
   #. ARF now resolved: Unknown baseline, however Cr at OSH was 1.3 now
   improved to 0.9 which is patient
s baseline. Suspect component of heart
   failure with poor forward flow contributed as patient improved with
   diuresis.
   -          Cont. to follow
   -          Renally dose medications as needed
   -          Post catherization hydration
   .
   #. Anemia: In [**2178**], hematocrit was in the mid-30s. Normocytic anemia
   currently. Hct stable currently. Admission anemia labs are tibc 220
   (low), b12 elevated, folate normal, ferritin 440 (elevated),
   transferrin 160 (low), iron 58 (normal). Suspect component of anemic of
   chronic disease.
   - Guiac all stools
   - Cont. to trend
   - transfuse for Hct<27
   - active type and screen
   .
   #. FEN/GI: Hypernatremia : suspect component of diuresis with lasix.
   Encourage PO
   -          Replete lytes prn
   -          Consider free water bolus as needed to maintain sodium
   balance

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Cardiac cath lab hemodynamics reviewed in detail.  Mean gradient less
   than noted by echo and may reflect changes in transvalvular flow after
   treatment.  [**Location (un) 342**] only slightly different but if there is much AI even
   the 0.89 may be overestimated.  It is important to determine relative
   contributions of fixed AV obstruction, AI and diastolic dysfunction
   related to severe hypertension.  Will plan to repeat echo to reassess
   gradient and AI.  Continue other medical therapy.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, COPD, and pneumonia who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. She was extubated and required CPAP due to respiratory failure, which has now resolved. The patient also had bloody secretions while intubated, possibly related to oral trauma from the endotracheal tube. She completed a course of antibiotics for pneumonia and her chest X-ray improved after diuresis. She was weaned to a nasal cannula and her oxygen is being titrated as tolerated.

Medical Complications:
1. Aortic stenosis: Moderate to severe with symptoms of heart failure. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which demonstrated clean coronaries, aortic area of 0.89 cm2 with a gradient of only 15, which is a discrepancy from the trans-thoracic echo (TTE). The patient also has significant aortic insufficiency based on wide pulse pressure. A Panorex was completed and the patient was cleared by dental for surgery. The plan is to continue holding nitrates as the patient is preload-dependent, restart ACE inhibitor, repeat TTE, and follow up with surgery recommendations.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has contributed to congestive heart failure (CHF), increased beta-blockers (BB), and continued calcium channel blockers (CCB) at outpatient dose. The plan is to continue BB, CCB"
