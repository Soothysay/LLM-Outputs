   Assessment and Plan
   .
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 12541**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:  Likely from pneumonia given fever and
   opacities on chest x ray.  The patient may also have a component of CHF
   given elevated BNP, elevated JVP and, mild peripheral edema as well as
   symptomatic improvement after diuresis on the medicine floor.  PE was
   also in the differnetial, although less likely since the pt was
   theraputic on coumadin.  Atrial tachycardia/fibrilation exacerbated
   hypoxia last night.  Baseline anemia and restrictive lung may make
   reserve poor contributing to profound hypoxia as well
   -- Follow up chest x ray read
   -- Continue vanc, cefpipime for pneumonia requiring ICU
   -- Continue doxycycline to cover atypicals
   -- stop diltiazem per EP
   -- standing nebs Q 4 hr plus PRN
   -- high flow nasal canula versus non-rebreather for sats > 93%
   -- f/u urine legionella
   -- f/u sputum and blood cultures
   -- Low threshold for repeat ABG and intubation if necessary
   -- tylenol PRN
   -- continue lasix 20 mg IV
   -- echo to assess for CHF
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation: Patient converted to normal sinus rhythm after
   dofetillide.  However, reverted back to atrial fibrillation versus
   multifocal atrial tachycardia last night in the setting of fever and
   hypoxia.  CHADS II is 3.  Pt anticoagulated with coumadin.
   -- per EP stop diltiazem
   -- continue dofetillide
   -- EKG 2 hrs after dose to measure QTc
   -- Clarify coumadin dose (coumadin 5 mg Q 5 days, 2.5 mg Q 2 days?)
   # altered mental status: patient tachycardic to 150s and unresponsive
   initially with somnolence.  Pt recently had taken home mirtazapine and
   ativan and is hard of hearing which may have contributed.  But
   tachycardic to 150s with decreasing O2 saturation worrisome for hypoxia
   causing AMS.  Pt underwent unsuccessful carotid massage and had rectal
   temp, then became agitated and violent, paranoid that he was being
   molested.  Redirected with talking with his son and avoided chemical
   restraints.
   -- appreciate psych recs to D/C ativan and mirtazepine
   -- f/u tox screen
   -- will try low dose haldol 1 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   -- continue aspirin 81 mg, lipitor, atenolol
   .
   # Hypertension:
   --continue atenolol and nifedipine
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   -- continue flonase
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.  Will continue on high flow canula and hold
   biPAP tonight given hypoxia.
   -- resume BiPAP when hypoxia resolves
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   -- Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:
   -- holding mirtazepine, ativan per psych
   .
   # FEN/GI:
   -- cardiac healthy diet if not looking like he will need intubation
   this am

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has several medical conditions and complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient likely has pneumonia given the fever and opacities on the chest x-ray. There may also be a component of congestive heart failure (CHF) due to elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and mild peripheral edema. Symptomatic improvement after diuretics on the medicine floor suggests this possibility. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is less likely since the patient is therapeutic on Coumadin. Atrial tachycardia/fibrillation exacerbated hypoxia last night. Baseline anemia and restrictive lung disease may contribute to poor respiratory reserve and profound hypoxia.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient converted to normal sinus rhythm after receiving dofetilide but reverted back to atrial fibrillation versus multifocal atrial tachycardia last night in the setting of fever and hypoxia. CHADS II score is 3, and the patient is anticoagulated with Coumadin.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient was tachycardic to 150s and unresponsive initially with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and has shown signs of congestive heart failure (CHF). He is currently being treated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypoxia, and opacities on chest x-ray suggest a possible infection in the lungs, which could lead to pneumonia. This condition requires prompt treatment to prevent further complications.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and mild peripheral edema indicate a possible exacerbation of CHF. Adequate diuresis and management of fluid balance are necessary to prevent worsening of the condition.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Close monitoring of heart rate and consideration of anticoagulation therapy may be required.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's decreased oxygen saturation and use of accessory muscles for breathing indicate significant respiratory distress. If the condition worsens, intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support respiratory function.
5. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status,"

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 12541**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:  Likely from pneumonia given fever and
   opacities on chest x ray.  The patient may also have a component of CHF
   given elevated BNP, elevated JVP and, mild peripheral edema as well as
   symptomatic improvement after diuresis on the medicine floor.  PE was
   also in the differnetial, although less likely since the pt was
   theraputic on coumadin.  Atrial tachycardia/fibrilation exacerbated
   hypoxia last night.  Baseline anemia and restrictive lung may make
   reserve poor contributing to profound hypoxia as well
   -- Follow up chest x ray read
   -- Continue vanc, cefpipime for pneumonia requiring ICU
   -- Continue doxycycline to cover atypicals
   -- stop diltiazem per EP
   -- standing nebs Q 4 hr plus PRN
   -- high flow nasal canula versus non-rebreather for sats > 93%
   -- f/u urine legionella
   -- f/u sputum and blood cultures
   -- Low threshold for repeat ABG and intubation if necessary
   -- tylenol PRN
   -- continue lasix 20 mg IV
   -- echo to assess for CHF
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation: Patient converted to normal sinus rhythm after
   dofetillide.  However, reverted back to atrial fibrillation versus
   multifocal atrial tachycardia last night in the setting of fever and
   hypoxia.  CHADS II is 3.  Pt anticoagulated with coumadin.
   -- per EP stop diltiazem
   -- continue dofetillide
   -- EKG 2 hrs after dose to measure QTc
   -- Clarify coumadin dose (coumadin 5 mg Q 5 days, 2.5 mg Q 2 days?)
   # altered mental status: patient tachycardic to 150s and unresponsive
   initially with somnolence.  Pt recently had taken home mirtazapine and
   ativan and is hard of hearing which may have contributed.  But
   tachycardic to 150s with decreasing O2 saturation worrisome for hypoxia
   causing AMS.  Pt underwent unsuccessful carotid massage and had rectal
   temp, then became agitated and violent, paranoid that he was being
   molested.  Redirected with talking with his son and avoided chemical
   restraints.
   -- appreciate psych recs to D/C ativan and mirtazepine
   -- f/u tox screen
   -- will try low dose haldol 1 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic sinusitis, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hyperlipidemia, depression/insomnia, and a history of CABG surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory distress and worsening oxygen saturation may lead to respiratory failure if not promptly addressed.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's fever, opacities on chest x-ray, and presence of bacteria and WBCs in the urine suggest an ongoing infection, which needs to be treated effectively to prevent complications such as sepsis or multi-organ dysfunction.

3. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, there is a risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure. Close monitoring of cardiac enzymes and symptoms is necessary.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's recent agitation, paranoia, and unresponsiveness could indicate an altered mental status. This requires careful management and consideration of underlying causes such as hypoxia, infection, or medication effects.

5. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient's history of OSA may"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 12541**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:  Likely from pneumonia given fever and
   opacities on chest x ray.  The patient may also have a component of CHF
   given elevated BNP, elevated JVP and, mild peripheral edema as well as
   symptomatic improvement after diuresis on the medicine floor.  PE was
   also in the differnetial, although less likely since the pt was
   theraputic on coumadin.  Atrial tachycardia/fibrilation exacerbated
   hypoxia last night.  Baseline anemia and restrictive lung may make
   reserve poor contributing to profound hypoxia as well
   -- Follow up chest x ray read
   -- Continue vanc, cefpipime for pneumonia requiring ICU
   -- Continue doxycycline to cover atypicals
   -- stop diltiazem per EP
   -- standing nebs Q 4 hr plus PRN
   -- high flow nasal canula versus non-rebreather for sats > 93%
   -- f/u urine legionella
   -- f/u sputum and blood cultures
   -- Low threshold for repeat ABG and intubation if necessary
   -- tylenol PRN
   -- continue lasix 20 mg IV
   -- echo to assess for CHF
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation: Patient converted to normal sinus rhythm after
   dofetillide.  However, reverted back to atrial fibrillation versus
   multifocal atrial tachycardia last night in the setting of fever and
   hypoxia.  CHADS II is 3.  Pt anticoagulated with coumadin.
   -- per EP stop diltiazem
   -- continue dofetillide
   -- EKG 2 hrs after dose to measure QTc
   -- Clarify coumadin dose (coumadin 5 mg Q 5 days, 2.5 mg Q 2 days?)
   # altered mental status: patient tachycardic to 150s and unresponsive
   initially with somnolence.  Pt recently had taken home mirtazapine and
   ativan and is hard of hearing which may have contributed.  But
   tachycardic to 150s with decreasing O2 saturation worrisome for hypoxia
   causing AMS.  Pt underwent unsuccessful carotid massage and had rectal
   temp, then became agitated and violent, paranoid that he was being
   molested.  Redirected with talking with his son and avoided chemical
   restraints.
   -- appreciate psych recs to D/C ativan and mirtazepine
   -- f/u tox screen
   -- will try low dose haldol 1 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   -- continue aspirin 81 mg, lipitor, atenolol
   .
   # Hypertension:
   --continue atenolol and nifedipine
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   -- continue flonase
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.  Will continue on high flow canula and hold
   biPAP tonight given hypoxia.
   -- resume BiPAP when hypoxia resolves
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   -- Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:
   -- holding mirtazepine, ativan per psych
   .
   # FEN/GI:
   -- cardiac healthy diet if not looking like he will need intubation
   this am

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary embolism (PE), atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic sinusitis, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hyperlipidemia, depression/insomnia, and a history of CABG surgery. The patient is currently on various medications and is in the ICU for close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has symptoms of pneumonia, including fever and opacities on chest x-ray. It is important to continue antibiotics and monitor for any worsening respiratory status.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's elevated BNP, elevated JVP, and peripheral edema suggest the possibility of CHF. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram is recommended to assess cardiac function and determine the need for diuretic therapy.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although less likely due to therapeutic anticoagulation, PE should be considered in the differential diagnosis given the patient's hypoxia and risk factors. A follow-up CT scan or D-dimer test may be necessary to rule out PE.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's conversion to normal sinus rhythm"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 12541**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:  Likely from pneumonia with  a possible
   component of CHF and poor baseline lung reserve.
   # Pneumonia: O2 saturations stable, but not yet improving on high flow
   mask.
   -- Follow up chest x ray read from this am
   -- Continue vanc, cefpipime (D # [**3-19**])
   -- Continue doxycycline to cover atypicals (D # [**3-19**])
   -- standing nebs Q 6 hr plus PRN
   -- high flow nasal canula versus non-rebreather for sats > 93%
   -- bipap PRN for comfort for decreased O2 sats
   -- f/u sputum and blood cultures
   -- Low threshold for repeat ABG and intubation if necessary
   -- tylenol PRN
   -- IV bolus to help hydrate during infection (and pt not taking good
   PO)
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation: Patient converted to normal sinus rhythm after
   dofetillide.  Had an episode of atrial fibrillation versus multifocal
   atrial tachycardia the night of admission to the unit in the setting of
   fever and hypoxia.  CHADS II is 3.  Pt anticoagulated with coumadin.
   -- per EP hold atenolol, will consider restaring or not at discharge
   -- continue dofetillide (have completed 6 doses with no prolonged QT)
   -- Continue coumadin 5 mg q day
   # altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   -- appreciate psych recs
   -- D/C ativan
   -- continue mirtazepine (pt did ok with this)
   -- will try low dose haldol 1 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   -- continue aspirin 81 mg, lipitor
   .
   # Hypertension:
   --continue nifedipine
   -- holding atenolol as above
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   -- continue flonase
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.  Will continue on high flow canula and hold
   biPAP tonight given hypoxia.
   -- resume BiPAP when hypoxia resolves
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   -- Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:
   -- holding ativan per psych
   -- continue mirtazepine

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has multiple medical conditions including hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic sinusitis, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hyperlipidemia, depression/insomnia, and possible restrictive lung disease. 

The patient was started on BiPAP and allowed to use it as desired for comfort, with improvement in respiratory status. He was also given IV fluids and nebulizer treatments as needed. Antibiotics were initiated to cover possible pneumonia. 

The patient's EKG showed ST depressions, which could indicate ischemia or myocardial infarction, but cardiac enzymes were negative. His chest x-ray is pending. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 95/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.4 K/uL, elevated creatinine at 1.2 mg/dL, slightly low potassium at 3.9 mEq/L, and slightly elevated magnesium at 2.3 mg/dL. 

The patient's physical examination revealed mild pedal edema, decreased breath sounds on both lung bases, and mild"

The patient's recent events include becoming acutely hypoxic and short of breath in the afternoon, requiring the use of a bipap mask. His chest x-ray remains unchanged, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) showed alkalosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 12541**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:  Likely from pneumonia with poor
   baseline lung reserve due to kyphoscoliosis and restrictive lung.
   # Pneumonia: O2 saturations stable, but not yet improving on high flow
   mask.
   -- Follow up chest x ray read [**2159-4-24**]
   -- Continue vanc, cefpipime (D # [**4-19**])
   -- Continue doxycycline to cover atypicals (D # [**4-19**])
   -- standing nebs Q 6 hr plus PRN
   -- high flow nasal canula versus non-rebreather for sats > 93%
   -- bipap PRN for comfort for decreased O2 sats
   -- f/u sputum and blood cultures
   -- Low threshold for repeat ABG and intubation if necessary
   -- tylenol PRN
   -- IV bolus to help hydrate during infection (and pt not taking good
   PO)
   -- pt requesting PT to relieve back pain with message from scoliosis
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation: Patient converted to normal sinus rhythm after
   dofetillide.  Had an episode of atrial fibrillation versus multifocal
   atrial tachycardia the night of admission to the unit in the setting of
   fever and hypoxia.  Had another episode of a fib with RVR last night
   that was unresponsive to lopressor, but was rate controlled with
   diltiazem.  This afternoon the patient was noted to be in junctional
   rhythm again so diltiazem stopped. CHADS II is 3.  Pt anticoagulated
   with coumadin.
   -- per EP hold atenolol, will consider restaring or not at discharge
   -- continue dofetillide
   -- holding diltiazem due to junctional rhythm in the 80s, will
   re-evaluate if pt has a fib with RVR again
   -- holding nifedipine due to metabolism interaction with diltiazem
   -- holding Coumadin for now (supratheraputic) will restart at 2.5 mg
   -- f/u with EP regarding long term management for a fib
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -- holding nifedipine as above, will consider captopril for
   hypertension
   -- holding atenolol as above
   # Low urine output:  Pt made low urine last night.  Improved after IV
   bolus.  Was also started on maintenance fluids overnight.  Pt not
   taking in good PO due to desaturations without the facemask
   -- continue to bolus PRN for low urine output
   .
   # altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   -- appreciate psych recs
   -- D/C ativan
   -- continue mirtazepine (pt did ok with this)
   -- will try low dose haldol 1 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Pt complained of insomnia last night and
   requested increased mirtazepine.  Received trazodone which left him
   groggy this am.  Family concerned about treating his anxiety, but team
   weary of using benzodiazepine given his tenuous respiratory status and
   multiple risk factors for delirium.
   -- prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych)
   -- per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilie which prolongs QT (although
   swtudies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   -- continue mirtazepine
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   -- continue aspirin 81 mg, lipitor
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   -- continue flonase
   -- discourage nasal lavage until respiratory status improves
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.  Will continue on high flow canula and hold
   biPAP tonight given hypoxia.
   -- resume BiPAP when hypoxia resolves
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   -- Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN/GI:
   -- cardiac healthy diet
   -- nutrition consult
   .

   DVT - Coumadin

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and chronic sinusitis. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has multiple comorbidities including restrictive lung disease due to kyphoscoliosis, pneumonia, low urine output, altered mental status, depression/insomnia, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently on various medications including Coumadin, metoprolol, diltiazem, atorvastatin, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's baseline lung reserve is compromised due to kyphoscoliosis and restrictive lung disease, making him susceptible to respiratory distress. It is important to monitor his oxygen saturation levels and ensure proper ventilation support.
2. Pneumonia: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, the patient's pneumonia has not improved significantly. Continuous monitoring of sputum and blood cultures is necessary to guide treatment decisions.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient experienced episodes of AFib, which were unresponsive to lopressor but responded to diltiazem. It is crucial to continue anticoagulation with Coumadin due to his CHADS II score of 3.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored, and appropriate antihypertensive medications should be considered after holding nifed"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 12541**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:  Likely from pneumonia with poor
   baseline lung reserve due to kyphoscoliosis and restrictive lung.
   # Pneumonia: O2 saturations stable, but not yet improving on high flow
   mask.
   -- Follow up chest x ray read from this am
   -- Continue vanc, cefpipime (D # [**3-19**])
   -- Continue doxycycline to cover atypicals (D # [**3-19**])
   -- standing nebs Q 6 hr plus PRN
   -- high flow nasal canula versus non-rebreather for sats > 93%
   -- bipap PRN for comfort for decreased O2 sats
   -- f/u sputum and blood cultures
   -- Low threshold for repeat ABG and intubation if necessary
   -- tylenol PRN
   -- IV bolus to help hydrate during infection (and pt not taking good
   PO)
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation: Patient converted to normal sinus rhythm after
   dofetillide.  Had an episode of atrial fibrillation versus multifocal
   atrial tachycardia the night of admission to the unit in the setting of
   fever and hypoxia.  CHADS II is 3.  Pt anticoagulated with coumadin.
   -- per EP hold atenolol, will consider restaring or not at discharge
   -- continue dofetillide (have completed 6 doses with no prolonged QT)
   -- Continue coumadin 5 mg q day
   # altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   -- appreciate psych recs
   -- D/C ativan
   -- continue mirtazepine (pt did ok with this)
   -- will try low dose haldol 1 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   -- continue aspirin 81 mg, lipitor
   .
   # Hypertension:
   --continue nifedipine
   -- holding atenolol as above
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   -- continue flonase
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.  Will continue on high flow canula and hold
   biPAP tonight given hypoxia.
   -- resume BiPAP when hypoxia resolves
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   -- Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:
   -- holding ativan per psych
   -- continue mirtazepine
   .
   # FEN/GI:
   -- cardiac healthy diet

","The patient's progress note indicates that they have been experiencing various medical complications. These complications include hypoxic respiratory distress, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic sinusitis, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hyperlipidemia, depression/insomnia, and potential issues related to their gastrointestinal (GI) health.

The patient's hypoxic respiratory distress is likely due to pneumonia with poor baseline lung reserve caused by kyphoscoliosis and restrictive lung disease. The patient is currently on high flow nasal canula versus non-rebreather for oxygen saturation levels above 93%, and bipap is used for comfort when oxygen saturation levels decrease.

The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, which has been present for some time. They were converted to normal sinus rhythm after receiving dofetillide. The patient's CHADS II score is 3, indicating a moderate risk for stroke, so they are anticoagulated with coumadin. The patient's medication regimen for atrial fibrillation includes continuing dofetillide and coumadin.

Additionally, the patient experienced an episode of altered mental status, which is believed to have occurred in the setting of fever and tachycardia, as well as an increased dose of benzodiazepine. The patient's psychosocial recommendations will be appreciated, and they are to discontinue ativan while continuing mirtazepine. If needed, low-d"

   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:  Likely from pneumonia with poor
   baseline lung reserve due to kyphoscoliosis and restrictive lung.
   # Pneumonia: O2 saturations stable, but not yet improving on high flow
   mask.
   -- Follow up chest x ray read [**2159-4-24**]

   -- Low threshold for repeat ABG and intubation if necessary
   -- tylenol PRN
   -- IV bolus to help hydrate during infection (and pt not taking good
   PO)
   -- pt requesting PT to relieve back pain with message from scoliosis
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation: Patient converted to normal sinus rhythm after
   dofetillide.  Had an episode of atrial fibrillation versus multifocal
   atrial tachycardia the night of admission to the unit in the setting of
   fever and hypoxia.  Had another episode of a fib with RVR last night
   that was unresponsive to lopressor, but was rate controlled with
   diltiazem.  This afternoon the patient was noted to be in junctional
   rhythm again so diltiazem stopped. CHADS II is 3.  Pt anticoagulated
   with coumadin.
   -- per EP hold atenolol, will consider restaring or not at discharge
   -- continue dofetillide
   -- holding diltiazem due to junctional rhythm in the 80s, will
   re-evaluate if pt has a fib with RVR again
   -- holding nifedipine due to metabolism interaction with diltiazem
   -- holding Coumadin for now (supratheraputic) will restart at 2.5 mg
   -- f/u with EP regarding long term management for a fib

   # Hypertension:
   -- holding nifedipine as above, will consider captopril for
   hypertension
   -- holding atenolol as above
   # Low urine output:  Pt made low urine last night.  Improved after IV
   bolus.  Was also started on maintenance fluids overnight.  Pt not
   taking in good PO due to desaturations without the facemask
   -- continue to bolus PRN for low urine output
   .
   # altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   -- appreciate psych recs
   -- D/C ativan
   -- continue mirtazepine (pt did ok with this)
   -- will try low dose haldol 1 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Pt complained of insomnia last night and
   requested increased mirtazepine.  Received trazodone which left him
   groggy this am.  Family concerned about treating his anxiety, but team
   weary of using benzodiazepine given his tenuous respiratory status and
   multiple risk factors for delirium.
   -- prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych)
   -- per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilie which prolongs QT (although
   swtudies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   -- continue mirtazepine

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease who presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has multiple comorbidities including pneumonia, restrictive lung disease due to kyphoscoliosis, and chronic sinusitis. He is currently intubated and on high flow nasal cannula with bipap support. His vital signs are stable, but he has had episodes of atrial fibrillation that were unresponsive to metoprolol but responded to diltiazem. His urine output has been low, and he has been given IV fluids. The patient also has altered mental status, depression, insomnia, and chronic sinusitis. He is on multiple medications including aspirin, lipitor, atorvastatin, senna, docusate, and tylenol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is a lung infection. If not treated properly, it can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially develop into sepsis or respiratory failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and has had episodes of atrial fibrillation during his hospital stay. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Restrictive Lung Disease: The patient's restrictive lung disease due to kyphoscoliosis"

   Assessment and Plan
 OLIGURIA/ANURIA
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE (INCLUDING NEUROMUSCULAR, CHEST WALL)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 12541**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:  O2 saturations tenuous but stable.
   Likely from pneumonia with poor baseline lung reserve due to
   kyphoscoliosis and restrictive lung. Anxiety leading to tachypnea and
   with poor tidal volumes likely contributing.
   -- Continue vanc, cefpipime (D # [**5-19**])
   -- Continue doxycycline to cover atypicals (D # [**5-19**])
   -- standing nebs Q 6 hr plus PRN
   -- high flow nasal canula versus non-rebreather for sats > 93%
   -- bipap PRN for comfort for decreased O2 sats
   -- f/u sputum and blood cultures
   -- Obtain VBG
   -- Low threshold for ABG and intubation
   -- tylenol PRN
   -- IV bolus to help hydrate during infection (and pt not taking good
   PO)
   -- Requesting Chest PT per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 712**]
   -- pt requesting PT to relieve back pain with message from scoliosis
   -- Treat panic attacks with small doses of ativan (0.25mg)
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation: Underlying mechanism for RVR is most likely
   hypoxia as O2 sats tightly correlate with tachycardia. Patient
   converted to normal sinus rhythm after dofetillide.  Had an episode of
   atrial fibrillation versus multifocal atrial tachycardia the night of
   admission to the unit in the setting of fever and hypoxia.  Had another
   episode of a fib with RVR last night that was unresponsive to
   lopressor, but was rate controlled with diltiazem.  CHADS II is 3.  Pt
   anticoagulated with coumadin.
   -- per EP hold atenolol, will consider restaring or not at discharge
   -- will discuss with EP re discontinuing dofetillide as may not be
   working effectively as an antiarrythmic
   -- Diltiazem 30mg PO Q6H standing for now
   -- STOP nifedipine now that using diltiazem
   -- holding Coumadin for now (supratheraputic) will restart when <2.5 mg
   -- f/u with EP regarding long term management for a fib
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -- Hold nifedipine as above
   -- holding atenolol as above
   # Low urine output:  Pt made low urine last night.  Improved after IV
   bolus.  Was also started on maintenance fluids overnight.  Pt not
   taking in good PO due to desaturations without the facemask
   -- continue to bolus PRN for low urine output
   .
   # altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   -- appreciate psych recs
   -- small doses of ativan PRN panic attacks
   -- continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   -- will try low dose haldol 1 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Pt complained of insomnia last night and
   requested increased mirtazepine.  Received trazodone which left him
   groggy this am.  Family concerned about treating his anxiety, but team
   weary of using benzodiazepine given his tenuous respiratory status and
   multiple risk factors for delirium.
   -- prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   -- per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   -- continue mirtazepine
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   -- continue aspirin 81 mg, lipitor
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   -- continue flonase
   -- discourage nasal lavage until respiratory status improves
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.  Will continue on high flow canula and hold
   biPAP tonight given hypoxia.
   --- Continue BiPAP PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has multiple comorbidities including restrictive lung disease, pneumonia, oliguria/anuria, hypertension, and depression/insomnia. He is currently in the ICU receiving mechanical ventilation and has been treated with vanc, cefepime, doxycycline, and diltiazem. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory distress and poor baseline lung reserve due to kyphoscoliosis and restrictive lung disease may lead to acute respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and close management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters are necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's presentation of fatigue, fever, and hypoxic respiratory distress suggests the possibility of pneumonia. Ongoing assessment of sputum cultures and chest X-rays will be required to monitor the progression or resolution of the infection.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation increases the risk of recurrent arrhythmias. Close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm, along with appropriate antiarrhythmic medication, is essential to prevent further complications.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's oliguria/anuria indicates potential renal dysfunction. Regular monitoring of urine output and kidney function tests (e.g., serum creatinine) is necessary to"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 12541**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:  O2 saturations tenuous but stable.
   Likely from pneumonia with poor baseline lung reserve due to
   kyphoscoliosis and restrictive lung. Anxiety leading to tachypnea and

   # Atrial fibrilation: Underlying mechanism for RVR is most likely
   hypoxia as O2 sats tightly correlate with tachycardia. Patient
   converted to normal sinus rhythm after dofetillide.  Had an episode of
   atrial fibrillation versus multifocal atrial tachycardia the night of
   admission to the unit in the setting of fever and hypoxia.  Had another
   episode of a fib with RVR last night that was unresponsive to
   lopressor, but was rate controlled with diltiazem.  CHADS II is 3.  Pt
   anticoagulated with coumadin.

   bolus.  Was also started on maintenance fluids overnight.  Pt not
   taking in good PO due to desaturations without the facemask
   -- continue to bolus PRN for low urine output

   # altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   -- appreciate psych recs
   -- small doses of ativan PRN panic attacks
   -- continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   -- will try low dose haldol 1 mg PO if needed for acute agitation

   # Depression/insomnia:  Pt complained of insomnia last night and
   requested increased mirtazepine.  Received trazodone which left him
   groggy this am.  Family concerned about treating his anxiety, but team
   weary of using benzodiazepine given his tenuous respiratory status and
   multiple risk factors for delirium.
   -- prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   -- per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has several medical conditions and complications that need to be considered:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's oxygen saturation is tenuous but stable, likely due to pneumonia with poor baseline lung reserve caused by kyphoscoliosis and restrictive lung disease. Anxiety may also contribute to tachypnea and poor tidal volumes.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has paroxysmal AFIB, which is contributing to the respiratory distress. He converted to normal sinus rhythm after taking dofetilide but had another episode of AFIB with rapid ventricular response that was unresponsive to lopressor but controlled with diltiazem. His CHADS II score is 3, indicating a moderate risk for stroke, so he is anticoagulated with coumadin.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and his antihypertensive medications (nifedipine and atenolol) have been held.

4. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has low urine output, which improved after receiving an IV bolus. He is also on maintenance fluids.

5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and underwent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with fatigue and was transferred to the CCU for hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient had episodes of junctional rhythm, and diltiazem was discontinued. The patient also experienced low urine output, and bolus normal saline was given. Tachycardia and anxiety were observed in the evening, and diltiazem and ativan were administered, leading to improvement. The patient has no known drug allergies. Antibiotics were administered on 04/25/2159 at 08:00 PM and 09:00 PM. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 97/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,183 mL, output of 589 mL, and a negative balance of 2,594 mL. The patient is on respiratory support with BiPAP and CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 set at 70%, PEEP at 7 cmH2O, and SpO2 at 92%. The patient's ABG results are pending. The patient's laboratory values show leukocyte count of 19 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, sodium of 130 mg/dL, potassium of 4.6 mEq/L, and creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal ranges. The patient's WBC count, hematocrit, and platelet count have fluctuated slightly over the past few days. Imaging and microbiology reports are pending. The patient has been diagnosed with oliguria/anuria, atrial fibrillation, restrictive lung disease, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status and disposition are noted. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory distress and requires respiratory support with BiPAP and CPAP/PSV mode. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the respiratory support is inadequate or if the underlying cause of the respiratory distress is not addressed.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation. This condition can lead to poor blood flow, clot formation, and potential embolic events if not managed properly.
3. Oliguria/anuria: The patient has low urine output, which can indicate kidney dysfunction or dehydration. Ongoing monitoring and management of fluid balance are crucial to prevent further complications.
4. Infection: The patient has pending blood cultures and urine culture. If the cultures reveal an infection, the patient may require additional antibiotic therapy, and"

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE (INCLUDING NEUROMUSCULAR, CHEST WALL)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 12541**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:  Likely from pneumonia with poor
   baseline lung reserve due to kyphoscoliosis and restrictive lung. O2
   saturations stable, but not yet improving on high flow mask.
   -- Continue vanc, cefpipime (D # [**5-19**])
   -- Continue doxycycline to cover atypicals (D # [**5-19**])
   -- standing nebs Q 6 hr plus PRN
   -- high flow nasal canula versus non-rebreather for sats > 93%
   -- bipap PRN for comfort for decreased O2 sats
   -- f/u sputum and blood cultures
   -- Low threshold for repeat ABG and intubation if necessary
   -- tylenol PRN
   -- IV bolus to help hydrate during infection (and pt not taking good
   PO)
   -- Starting Chest PT per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 712**]
   -- pt requesting PT to relieve back pain with message from scoliosis
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation: Underlying mechanism for RVR is most likely
   hypoxia. Patient converted to normal sinus rhythm after dofetillide.
   Had an episode of atrial fibrillation versus multifocal atrial
   tachycardia the night of admission to the unit in the setting of fever
   and hypoxia.  Had another episode of a fib with RVR last night that was
   unresponsive to lopressor, but was rate controlled with diltiazem.
   This afternoon the patient was noted to be in junctional rhythm again
   so diltiazem stopped. CHADS II is 3.  Pt anticoagulated with coumadin.
   -- per EP hold atenolol, will consider restaring or not at discharge
   -- will discuss with EP re discontinuing dofetillide as is not
   effectively working as antiarrythmic
   -- holding diltiazem due to junctional rhythm in the 80s except PRN,
   will re-evaluate if pt has a fib with RVR again
   -- continuing nifedipine for now
   -- holding Coumadin for now (supratheraputic) will restart at 2.5 mg
   -- f/u with EP regarding long term management for a fib
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -- continue nifedipine as above
   -- holding atenolol as above
   # Low urine output:  Pt made low urine last night.  Improved after IV
   bolus.  Was also started on maintenance fluids overnight.  Pt not
   taking in good PO due to desaturations without the facemask
   -- continue to bolus PRN for low urine output
   .
   # altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   -- appreciate psych recs
   -- D/C ativan
   -- continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   -- will try low dose haldol 1 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Pt complained of insomnia last night and
   requested increased mirtazepine.  Received trazodone which left him
   groggy this am.  Family concerned about treating his anxiety, but team
   weary of using benzodiazepine given his tenuous respiratory status and
   multiple risk factors for delirium.
   -- prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych)
   -- per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   swtudies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   -- continue mirtazepine
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   -- continue aspirin 81 mg, lipitor
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   -- continue flonase
   -- discourage nasal lavage until respiratory status improves
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.  Will continue on high flow canula and hold
   biPAP tonight given hypoxia.
   --- Continue BiPAP PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease who presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress. He has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient has multiple medical conditions including pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, restrictive lung disease, and coronary artery disease. He is currently receiving various medications and treatments to manage his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory distress indicates a risk of respiratory failure. Continued monitoring and management of oxygenation status is crucial.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's fatigue and hypoxic respiratory distress could be due to pneumonia. Close monitoring of sputum culture and chest X-ray results is necessary to guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation increases the risk of complications such as stroke or thromboembolism. Anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin is indicated, but careful monitoring of INR levels is required.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history of coronary artery disease puts him at risk for cardiac complications. Monitoring of cardiac enzymes and EKG changes is important to detect any ischemic events.
5. Restrictive Lung Disease: The patient's restrictive lung disease can lead to respiratory failure. Management of fluid balance and optimization of lung function through non-invasive ventilation strategies is important.

   Imaging: CXR [**2159-4-27**]:
   FINDINGS: Comparison to the previous chest radiograph of earlier the
   same
   date. The opacity in the right lower lung has improved suggesting this
   may be
   predominantly due to repositioning of a small right pleural effusion
   and
   improved mild pulmonary edema rather than consolidation although
   improved
   aspiration would be another consideration. The left lung is difficult
   to
   evaluate due to the severe scoliosis of the spine and probably
   unchanged.
   Cardiomegaly is stable.
   IMPRESSION:
   Overall improvement, the changes in the right lung base are less likely
   to be
   due to infection and more likely due to altered positioning of a small
   pleural
   effusion and improved mild pulmonary edema.

   on:[**2159-4-27**] 13:33 ------
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has several medical conditions including pneumonia (hospital-acquired), oliguria/anuria, atrial fibrillation, restrictive lung disease, and respiratory failure. He also has hypertension, depression/insomnia, coronary artery disease, chronic sinusitis, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, and a history of CABG. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 79 bpm (with a range of 77-147 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 137/70 mmHg to 148/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and an ECG showing atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's low urine output may indicate kidney dysfunction or dehydration. This can further complicate his overall health status and increase the risk of other complications.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke and other cardiac complications. It is important to manage"

   Imaging: CXR [**2159-4-27**]:
   FINDINGS: Comparison to the previous chest radiograph of earlier the
   same
   date. The opacity in the right lower lung has improved suggesting this
   may be
   predominantly due to repositioning of a small right pleural effusion
   and
   improved mild pulmonary edema rather than consolidation although
   improved
   aspiration would be another consideration. The left lung is difficult
   to
   evaluate due to the severe scoliosis of the spine and probably
   unchanged.
   Cardiomegaly is stable.
   IMPRESSION:
   Overall improvement, the changes in the right lung base are less likely
   to be
   due to infection and more likely due to altered positioning of a small
   pleural
   effusion and improved mild pulmonary edema.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 12541**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:  O2 saturations tenuous but stable.
   Likely from pneumonia with poor baseline lung reserve due to
   kyphoscoliosis and restrictive lung. Anxiety leading to tachypnea and
   with poor tidal volumes likely contributing.
   -- Continue vanc, cefpipime (D # [**6-19**])
   -- Continue doxycycline to cover atypicals (D # [**6-19**])
   -- continue nebs Q 6 hr PRN (changed to PRN given is not using this)
   -- high flow nasal canula versus non-rebreather for sats > 93%
   -- bipap PRN for comfort for decreased O2 sats
   -- f/u sputum and blood cultures
   -- Daily VBG
   -- Low threshold for ABG and intubation
   -- tylenol PRN
   -- IV bolus to help hydrate during infection (and pt not taking good
   PO)
   -- Trial of gentle diuresis with Lasix 10mg IV ONCE and monitor O2
   status as may have a component of pulmonary edema
   -- pt requesting PT to relieve back pain with message from scoliosis
   -- Treat panic attacks with small doses of ativan (0.25mg) PRN
   -- Formal pulm consult with discussions re MICU transfer as patient
   primary problem seems pulmonary
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation: Underlying mechanism for RVR is most likely
   hypoxia as O2 sats tightly correlate with tachycardia. Patient
   converted to normal sinus rhythm after dofetillide.  Had an episode of
   atrial fibrillation versus multifocal atrial tachycardia the night of
   admission to the unit in the setting of fever and hypoxia.  Had another
   episode of a fib with RVR last night that was unresponsive to
   lopressor, but was rate controlled with diltiazem.  CHADS II is 3.  Pt
   anticoagulated with coumadin.
   -- per EP hold atenolol, will consider restaring or not at discharge
   -- will discuss with EP re discontinuing dofetillide as may not be
   working effectively as an antiarrythmic
   -- Diltiazem 60mg PO Q6H standing for now with 10mg IV PRN RVR
   -- STOP nifedipine now that using diltiazem
   -- holding Coumadin for now (supratheraputic) will restart when <2.5 mg
   -- f/u with EP regarding long term management for a fib
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -- Hold nifedipine as above
   -- holding atenolol as above
   # Low urine output:  Improved.
   .
   # altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   -- appreciate psych recs
   -- small doses of ativan PRN panic attacks
   -- continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   -- will try low dose haldol 1 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Pt complained of insomnia last night and
   requested increased mirtazepine.  Received trazodone which left him
   groggy this am.  Family concerned about treating his anxiety, but team
   weary of using benzodiazepine given his tenuous respiratory status and
   multiple risk factors for delirium.
   -- prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   -- per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   -- continue mirtazepine
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   -- continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   -- Rate control with dilt and treating underlying hypoxia and infection
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   -- continue flonase
   -- discourage nasal lavage until respiratory status improves
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.  Will continue on high flow canula and hold
   biPAP tonight given hypoxia.
   --- Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   -- Continue Atorvastatin
   .

   -- cardiac healthy diet
   -- nutrition consult

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fatigue and hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing constipation and was given lactobacillus for relief. Lorazepam was prescribed as needed. Gentle hydration was continued, and nifedipine was stopped with diltiazem being started and titrated up to 60mg PO Q6H. The patient's pCO2 levels were rising, so they were placed back on BiPAP. Occasionally, diltiazem 10mg IV was given for elevated blood pressure. The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were cefepime and vancomycin on 04/26/2159 at 08:06 PM and 08:45 PM respectively. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/70 mmHg to 148/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's weight is currently 54.8 kg, with a height of 57 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,560 mL, including 510 mL through TF and 1,360 mL through IVF. The patient received 807 mL of blood products and had an output of 807 mL through urine. Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV with a Vt of 216 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR of 24 breaths per minute, PEEP of 7 cmH2O, FiO2 of 70%, PIP of 18 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 94%. The patient's ABG results show pH of 7.28, pCO2 of 28 mmHg, and HCO3- of 24 mEq/L. 

Lab results include WBC of 9.1 K/uL, Hct of 35.5%, Plt of 192 K/uL, Cr of 1.1 mg/dL, TropT of <0.01 ng/mL, TCO2 of 32 mmHg, Glucose of 118 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range. Imaging shows improvement in the right lower lung, suggesting repositioning of a small right pleural effusion and improved mild pulmonary edema rather than consolidation. The left lung is difficult to evaluate due to severe scoliosis of the spine. Cardiomegaly is stable. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include pneumonia, oliguria/anuria, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), restrictive lung disease (including neuromuscular, chest wall), and acute respiratory failure."

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 12541**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:  O2 saturations tenuous but stable.
   Likely from pneumonia with poor baseline lung reserve due to
   kyphoscoliosis and restrictive lung. Anxiety leading to tachypnea and
   with poor tidal volumes likely contributing.
   -- Continue vanc, cefpipime (D # [**6-19**])
   -- Continue doxycycline to cover atypicals (D # [**6-19**])
   -- continue nebs Q 6 hr PRN (changed to PRN given is not using this)
   -- high flow nasal canula versus non-rebreather for sats > 93%
   -- bipap PRN for comfort for decreased O2 sats
   -- f/u sputum and blood cultures
   -- Daily VBG
   -- Low threshold for ABG and intubation
   -- tylenol PRN
   -- IV bolus to help hydrate during infection (and pt not taking good
   PO)
   -- Consider trial of gentle diuresis and monitor O2 status
   -- pt requesting PT to relieve back pain with message from scoliosis
   -- Treat panic attacks with small doses of ativan (0.25mg) PRN
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation: Underlying mechanism for RVR is most likely
   hypoxia as O2 sats tightly correlate with tachycardia. Patient
   converted to normal sinus rhythm after dofetillide.  Had an episode of
   atrial fibrillation versus multifocal atrial tachycardia the night of
   admission to the unit in the setting of fever and hypoxia.  Had another
   episode of a fib with RVR last night that was unresponsive to
   lopressor, but was rate controlled with diltiazem.  CHADS II is 3.  Pt
   anticoagulated with coumadin.
   -- per EP hold atenolol, will consider restaring or not at discharge
   -- will discuss with EP re discontinuing dofetillide as may not be
   working effectively as an antiarrythmic
   -- Diltiazem 60mg PO Q6H standing for now with 10mg IV PRN RVR
   -- STOP nifedipine now that using diltiazem
   -- holding Coumadin for now (supratheraputic) will restart when <2.5 mg
   -- f/u with EP regarding long term management for a fib
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -- Hold nifedipine as above
   -- holding atenolol as above
   # Low urine output:  Improved.
   .
   # altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   -- appreciate psych recs
   -- small doses of ativan PRN panic attacks
   -- continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   -- will try low dose haldol 1 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Pt complained of insomnia last night and
   requested increased mirtazepine.  Received trazodone which left him
   groggy this am.  Family concerned about treating his anxiety, but team
   weary of using benzodiazepine given his tenuous respiratory status and
   multiple risk factors for delirium.
   -- prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   -- per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   -- continue mirtazepine
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   -- continue aspirin 81 mg, lipitor
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   -- continue flonase
   -- discourage nasal lavage until respiratory status improves
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.  Will continue on high flow canula and hold
   biPAP tonight given hypoxia.
   --- Continue BiPAP PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including pneumonia, oliguria/anuria, atrial fibrillation, restrictive lung disease, and anxiety.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's oxygen saturation is tenuous but stable. It is likely due to pneumonia with poor baseline lung reserve due to kyphoscoliosis and restrictive lung disease. Anxiety may also contribute to tachypnea and poor tidal volumes.

   Assessment and Plan
   Professor [**Known lastname 12543**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress now s/p CCU stay for A. Fib with
   RVR and respiratory distress requiring BiPap.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Initially patient had focal RLL
   infiltrate c/w pneumonia and fever.  Agree with continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  At this time, patient appears to have
   superimposed pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by
   LOS fluid balance, interval weight, and clinical exam.  Attempted low
   dose lasix overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitor respiratory status,
   with 700cc out and no worsening in creatinine.  Will attempt further
   diuresis and if no improvement in the respiratory status would obtain
   non-contrast chest CT and consider thoracentesis of any pleural
   effusions.  Patient has limited reserve given prior pneumonectomy and
   severe kyphoscoliosis and may not tolerate small volumes of fluid.
   Would anticipate that he would look a lot sicker if this were
   principally a worsening pneumonia. Urine legionella negative.
   - Give additional 20mg IV lasix now, follow I/O closely with goal
   negative 500cc
   - If pt not improved despite continue diuresis, will obtain NC CT chest
   to better characterize pathology and possible effusions
   - Continue vanc, cefpipime (Day 1 [**2159-4-22**]) for full 8 day course.
   - Repeat vanc trough in AM
 ordered as add-on (dose was last changed
   on [**4-25**]; may need readjustment given changing Cr)
   - Continue doxycycline to cover atypicals for full 8 day course
   - Nebulizers as needed
   - f/u blood cultures; consider repeat sputum culture
   - Low threshold for repeat ABG and intubation if necessary - appears
   comfortable currently though.
   - Chest PT
   - frequent attempts to wean BiPap; would like to keep SpO2 > 90%.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with
   episodes of RVR.
   - Dofetilide interacts with vancomycin and hence need to monitor QT
   intervals.
   - continue dofetillide with daily ECG for QTc (clarify with cardiology
   when this practice can be d/c'd and plan for dofetilide regarding
   rhythm therapy for a. fib)
   - keep potassium around 4 and magnesium at 1.8 for the dofetilide;
   check electrolytes frequently
   - Restart Coumadin today at 2.5mg (pt was on 5mg X 5 days, 2.5 mg on
   Mon/Fri) and dose based on INR (goal 2-2.5)
   - Touch base with EP
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.
   .
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - Rate control with standing and prn dilt and treating underlying
   hypoxia and infection
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - small doses of ativan PRN panic attacks
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Free water down by 1.5L, not taking PO's well given
   respiratory distress.
   - Continue slow D5 infusion at 75-100cc/hr with improvement in sodium;
   recheck sodium in afternoon.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   - continue flonase
   # Hematuria
 pink tinged urine likely from traumatic foley placement.
   - monitor hematuria for resolution.
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.  Will continue on high flow canula and hold
   biPAP tonight given hypoxia.
   - Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN/GI:
   - cardiac healthy diet
   - nutrition consult, recs appreciated -> not taking good PO's while on
   BiPap; possible TFs supplementation
   .
   # DVT - Coumadin with INR therapeutic
   # Bowel regimen - senna, docusate; pt takes own lactobacillus
   # Pain: Currently comfortable, tylenol prn

   on [**4-25**]; may need readjustment given changing Cr)
   - Continue doxycycline to cover atypicals for full 8 day course
   - Nebulizers as needed
   - f/u blood cultures; consider repeat sputum culture
   - Low threshold for repeat ABG and intubation if necessary - appears
   comfortable currently though.
   - Chest PT
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with
   episodes of RVR.
   - Dofetilide interacts with vancomycin and hence need to monitor QT
   intervals.
   - continue dofetillide with daily ECG for QTc (clarify with cardiology
   when this practice can be d/c'd and plan for dofetilide regarding
   rhythm therapy for a. fib)
   - Restart Coumadin today at 2.5mg (pt was on 5mg X 5 days, 2.5 mg on
   Mon/Fri), then restart 5 mg tomorrow and based on INR (goal 2-2.5)
   - Touch base with EP in AM
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.

   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - Rate control with standing and prn dilt and treating underlying
   hypoxia and infection
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - small doses of ativan PRN panic attacks
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Free water down by 1.5L, not taking PO's well given
   respiratory distress.
   - Continue slow D5 infusion at 75-100cc/hr with improvement in sodium;
   recheck sodium in afternoon.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and previous CABG. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress, requiring a CCU stay for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and respiratory distress necessitating BiPap. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia, but now appears to have superimposed pulmonary edema due to volume resuscitation. The patient's respiratory status has not improved despite diuresis, so a non-contrast chest CT is ordered, and thoracentesis of any pleural effusions will be considered. Additional IV lasix has been administered, and I/O will be closely monitored with a goal of negative 500cc. If the patient does not improve, an NCCT chest will be obtained. The patient is currently on vancomycin, cefepime, and doxycycline, and repeat blood cultures are pending. Diltiazem is being used for rate control, and Coumadin will be restarted at 2.5mg today. The patient's mental status is altered, and psych recommendations are appreciated. Mirtazapine is being continued for depression/insomnia. Hypernatremia is being addressed with slow D5 infusion and lasix. Chronic sinusitis, OSA, hyperlipidemia, FEN/GI issues, DVT, bowel regimen,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 12541**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress now s/p CCU stay for A. Fib with
   RVR and respiratory distress requiring BiPap.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Initially patient had focal RLL
   infiltrate c/w pneumonia and fever.  Agree with continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  At this time, patient appears to have
   superimposed pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by
   LOS fluid balance, interval weight, and clinical exam.  Attempted low
   dose lasix overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitor respiratory status,
   with 700cc out and no worsening in creatinine.  Will attempt further
   diuresis and if no improvement in the respiratory status would obtain
   non-contrast chest CT and consider thoracentesis of any pleural
   effusions.  Patient has limited reserve given prior pneumonectomy and
   severe kyphoscoliosis and may not tolerate small volumes of fluid.
   Would anticipate that he would look a lot sicker if this were
   principally a worsening pneumonia.
   - 20mg IV lasix now, follow I/O closely with goal negative 500cc.
   - Continue vanc, cefpipime (Day 1 [**2159-4-22**]) for full 8 day course.
   - repeat trough in AM
 pending (dose was changed on [**4-25**])
   - Continue doxycycline to cover atypicals for full 8 day course
   - Nebulizers as needed, is currently not wheezing.
   - urine legionella negative
   - f/u blood cultures; consider repeat sputum culture
   - Low threshold for repeat ABG and intubation if necessary - appears
   comfortable currently though.
   - Chest PT
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with
   episodes of RVR.
   - continue dofetillide with daily ECG for QTc (clarify with cardiology
   when this practice can be d/c'd and plan for dofetilide regarding
   rhythm therapy for a. fib)
   - hold coumadin today, check INR in afternoon, and restart on basis of
   INR (goal 2-2.5); pt was on 5 mg
   - Touch base with EP in AM.
   - Dofetilide interacts with vancomycin and hence need to monitor QT
   intervals.
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.
   .
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - Rate control with standing and prn dilt and treating underlying
   hypoxia and infection
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - small doses of ativan PRN panic attacks
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Free water down by 1.5L, not taking PO's well given
   respiratory distress.
   - Continue slow D5 infusion at 75-100cc/hr with improvement in sodium;
   recheck sodium in afternoon.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   - continue flonase
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.  Will continue on high flow canula and hold
   biPAP tonight given hypoxia.
   - Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN/GI:
   - cardiac healthy diet
   - nutrition consult, recs appreciated -> not taking good PO's while on
   BiPap
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress, which required a critical care unit stay for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of pneumonia, fever, focal right lower lobe infiltrate, and pulmonary edema. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and being closely monitored for respiratory status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient initially had focal right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia and fever. He also has superimposed pulmonary edema due to volume resuscitation. The patient's limited fluid tolerance due to prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis may lead to further respiratory distress. Monitoring and further diuresis are planned if there is no improvement in respiratory status. Thoracentesis may be considered if pleural effusions are present.

2. Junctional Bradycardia: The patient has a history of junctional bradycardia and is currently on atenolol. It is important to avoid beta-blockers like metoprolol for rate control and consult with an electrophysiologist regarding beta-blocker discontinuation prior to discharge.

3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and status post coronary artery bypass grafting. There are ECG changes"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 12541**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress now s/p CCU stay for A. Fib with
   RVR and respiratory distress requiring BiPap.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Initially patient had focal RLL
   infiltrate c/w pneumonia and fever.  Agree with continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  At this time, patient appears to have
   superimposed pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by
   LOS fluid balance, interval weight, and clinical exam.  Will attempt
   low dose lasix overnight for diuresis and monitor respiratory status.
   If no improvement in the AM would obtain non-contrast chest CT and
   consider thoracentesis of any pleural effusions.  Patient has limited
   reserve given prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis and may not
   tolerate small volumes of fluid.  Would anticipate that he would look a
   lot sicker if this were principally a worsening pneumonia.
   - 20mg IV lasix now, follow I/O closely with goal negative 500cc.
   - Continue vanc, cefpipime (Day 1 [**2159-4-22**]) for full 8 day course.
   - repeat trough in AM.
   - Continue doxycycline to cover atypicals for full 8 day course
   - Nebulizers as needed, is currently not wheezing.
   - urine legionella negative
   - f/u sputum and blood cultures
   - Low threshold for repeat ABG and intubation if necessary - appears
   comfortable currently though.
   - Chest PT
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation: Currently in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with
   episodes of RVR.
   - continue dofetillide with daily ECG for QTc (clarify with cardiology
   when this practice can be d/c'd and plan for dofetilide regarding
   rhythm therapy for a. fib)
   - hold coumadin tonight, and resume in AM on basis of INR (goal 2-2.5).
   - Touch base with EP in AM.
   - Dofetilide interacts with vancomycin and hence need to monitor QT
   intervals.
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.
   .
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - Rate control with dilt and treating underlying hypoxia and infection
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - small doses of ativan PRN panic attacks
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Free water down by 1.5L, not taking PO's
   - Slow D5 infusion at 75-100cc/hr.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   - continue flonase
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.  Will continue on high flow canula and hold
   biPAP tonight given hypoxia.
   - Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN/GI:
   - cardiac healthy diet
   - nutrition consult -> not taking good PO's while on BiPap
   .
   # DVT - Coumadin with INR therapeutic
   # Bowel regimen - senna, docusate
   # Pain: Currently comfortable, tylenol prn

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress, requiring a stay in the critical care unit for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and respiratory distress. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory distress, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, Junctional Bradycardia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, altered mental status, depression/insomnia, hypernatremia, chronic sinusitis, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hyperlipidemia, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of respiratory distress: The patient's initial presentation of hypoxic respiratory distress indicates a compromised respiratory system. If not properly managed, it may lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Pneumonia: The presence of a focal right lower lobe infiltrate suggests pneumonia. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it could progress and potentially lead to sepsis or other complications.

3. Pulmonary edema: The patient appears to have superimposed pulmonary edema due to volume resuscitation. If fluid overload continues, it could worsen the edema and compromise cardiac function.

4. Junctional Bradycardia: The patient's Junctional Bradycardia should be closely monitored, as it can lead"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries, atrial fibrillation (AF), restrictive lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema or pneumonia. The patient requires noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) almost all the time and reports being comfortable on NIPPV. He has been admitted to the ICU for ongoing respiratory support and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is acute respiratory failure, which can be caused by pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Close monitoring and continuous NIPPV support are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has a reduced urine output, indicating possible renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury. This can be due to hypotension, sepsis, or other underlying conditions. Frequent assessment of renal function and fluid balance is crucial.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has a history of AF, and his current vital signs show an irregular heart rhythm. It is essential to monitor his heart rate, blood pressure, and electrolyte levels closely. Anticoagulation therapy with dofetilide may be required to maintain sinus rhythm and prevent thromboembolic events.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, which needs to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Professor [**Known lastname 12543**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress now s/p CCU stay for A. Fib with
   RVR and respiratory distress requiring BiPap.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Initially patient had focal RLL
   infiltrate c/w pneumonia and fever.  Agree with continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  At this time, patient appears to have
   superimposed pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by
   LOS fluid balance, interval weight, and clinical exam.  Attempted low
   dose lasix overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitor respiratory status,
   with 700cc out and no worsening in creatinine.  Will attempt further
   diuresis and if no improvement in the respiratory status would obtain
   non-contrast chest CT and consider thoracentesis of any pleural
   effusions.  Patient has limited reserve given prior pneumonectomy and
   severe kyphoscoliosis and may not tolerate small volumes of fluid.
   Would anticipate that he would look a lot sicker if this were
   principally a worsening pneumonia. Urine legionella negative.
   - Chest CT with moderate right sided pleural effusion.
   - Continue vanc, cefpipime, doxycycline (Day 1 [**2159-4-22**]) for full 8 day
   course for now; re-eval after thoracentesis and pleural fluid results.
   - Repeat vanc trough this morning.
   - Nebulizers as needed
   - f/u blood cultures; consider repeat sputum culture
   - Low threshold for repeat ABG and intubation if necessary - appears
   comfortable currently though.
   - Chest PT
   - frequent attempts to wean BiPap; would like to keep SpO2 > 90%.
   - consult IP this morning for likely thoracentesis versus some form of
   tube thoracostomy.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in atrial fibrillation with episodes
   of RVR.  Patient appears to have chemically cardioverted back to NSR
   this morning.
   - Dofetilide interacts with vancomycin and hence need to monitor QT
   intervals.
   - continue dofetillide with daily ECG for QTc (clarify with cardiology
   when this practice can be d/c'd and plan for dofetilide regarding
   rhythm therapy for a. fib)
   - keep potassium around 4 and magnesium at 2 for the dofetilide; check
   electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue coumadin today at 2.5mg and monitor INR closely (goal INR
   2-2.5)
   - Touch base with EP
   - diltiazem gtt (wean as tolerated)
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.
   .
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - Rate control with standing and prn dilt and treating underlying
   hypoxia and infection
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Free water down by 1.5L, not taking PO's well given
   respiratory distress.
   - Continue slow D5 infusion at 75-100cc/hr with improvement in sodium;
   recheck sodium in afternoon.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   - continue flonase
   # Hematuria
 pink tinged urine likely from traumatic foley placement.
   - monitor hematuria for resolution.
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.
   - Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN/GI: Had [**2-14**] Ensures yesterday.
   - cardiac healthy diet
   - nutrition consult, recs appreciated -> not taking good PO's while on
   BiPap; possible TFs supplementation
   - ADAT post-thoracentesis

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient had pneumonia and fever initially, but now appears to have superimposed pulmonary edema due to volume resuscitation. The patient has limited fluid tolerance due to prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis. Antibiotics have been started, and further diuresis is planned. Thoracentesis may be considered if there is no improvement in respiratory status. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but has a history of atrial fibrillation. Dofetilide has been started to maintain sinus rhythm, but monitoring of QT intervals is necessary due to drug interactions with vancomycin. Other medical conditions include junctional bradycardia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, altered mental status, depression/insomnia, hypernatremia, chronic sinusitis, hematuria, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, and deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient may require further diuresis to manage the fluid overload and prevent worsening of respiratory distress.
3. Pleural effusions: Thoracentesis may be necessary to evaluate the pleural fluid and"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - EP recs (pager [**Numeric Identifier 12705**]) - keep pt on dofetilide even if still in Afib;
   will attempt electrical cardioconversion when pt stable in terms of
   respiratory status and then will need to continue dofetilide to
   maintain NSR. While on dofetilide, keep K>4, Mg>2, and obtain daily EKG
   to monitor QTc. Watch Cr function closely and if it increases, page EP

   this morning.
   - Dofetilide interacts with vancomycin and hence need to monitor QT
   intervals.
   - continue dofetillide with daily ECG for QTc (clarify with cardiology
   when this practice can be d/c'd and plan for dofetilide regarding
   rhythm therapy for a. fib)
   - keep potassium around 4 and magnesium at 2 for the dofetilide; check
   electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue coumadin today at 2.5mg and monitor INR closely (goal INR
   2-2.5)
   - Touch base with EP
   - diltiazem gtt
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.
   .
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - Rate control with standing and prn dilt and treating underlying
   hypoxia and infection
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Free water down by 1.5L, not taking PO's well given
   respiratory distress.
   - Continue slow D5 infusion at 75-100cc/hr with improvement in sodium;
   recheck sodium in afternoon.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   - continue flonase
   # Hematuria
 pink tinged urine likely from traumatic foley placement.
   - monitor hematuria for resolution.
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.
   - Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Atorvastatin

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), restrictive lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema versus pneumonia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is being managed with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). There is also a large pleural effusion around the right lung, and the decision to perform thoracentesis or insert a small-bore chest tube needs to be made.

2. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient has an elevated serum sodium level, indicating hypernatremia. This condition can lead to neurological complications such as seizures and confusion.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient is also suffering from low oxygen levels in the blood, known as hypoxemia. This can result in inadequate oxygen supply to vital organs, leading to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.

4. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient has an alteration in nutrition, which may be due to the inability to eat normally while critically ill. Malnutrition can weaken the immune system and impede the healing process.

5. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, which is a type of lung infection acquired during hospitalization. If left"

   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Initially patient had focal RLL
   infiltrate c/w pneumonia and fever.  Agree with continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  At this time, patient appears to have
   superimposed pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by
   LOS fluid balance, interval weight, and clinical exam.  Attempted low
   dose lasix overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitor respiratory status,
   with 700cc out and no worsening in creatinine.  Non-contrast CT showed
   moderate right sided pleural effusion, now s/p 1.5L thoracentesis on
   [**4-29**] with interval improvement in respiratory status.   Patient has
   limited reserve given prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis and
   may not tolerate small volumes of fluid.  Would anticipate that he
   would look a lot sicker if this were principally a worsening pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and previous pneumonectomy. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress. He was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and respiratory distress, requiring BiPAP support. His current condition includes hypoxic respiratory distress, superimposed pulmonary edema, pneumonia, junctional bradycardia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, altered mental status, depression/insomnia, hypernatremia, chronic sinusitis, hematuria, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, and previous deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, requiring BiPAP support. There is a risk of further deterioration leading to respiratory failure.
2. Superimposed pulmonary edema: The patient may develop worsening pulmonary edema due to fluid overload or cardiac dysfunction.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia, and there is a risk of progression or new infection.
4. Junctional bradycardia: The patient's heart rate may continue to be unstable, potentially leading to severe bradycardia or heart block.
5. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and may experience worsening angina or myocardial infarction.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress, for which he received care in the cardiac care unit (CCU) due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and respiratory distress requiring BiPAP.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient initially had focal right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia and fever. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and the patient appears to have superimposed pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation. A thoracentesis was performed, removing 1.5 liters of pleural fluid, which showed improvement in respiratory status. The patient has limited reserve due to prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis, and may not tolerate small volumes of fluid. Further monitoring and management are recommended.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation with a controlled rate using diltiazem. Therapeutic dosing of coumadin is being continued, with close monitoring of INR levels. Dofetilide is also being continued, with attention to potassium and magnesium levels.

3. Junctional Bradycardia: The patient had previously been considered for beta-blockers, but atenolol was held due to junctional bradycardia.

   Assessment and Plan
   Professor [**Known lastname 12543**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress now s/p CCU stay for A. Fib with
   RVR and respiratory distress requiring BiPap.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Initially patient had focal RLL
   infiltrate c/w pneumonia and fever.  Agree with continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  At this time, patient appears to have
   superimposed pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by
   LOS fluid balance, interval weight, and clinical exam.  Attempted low
   dose lasix overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitor respiratory status,
   with 700cc out and no worsening in creatinine.  Non-contrast CT showed
   moderate right sided pleural effusion, now s/p 1.5L thoracentesis with
   interval improvement in respiratory status.   Patient has limited
   reserve given prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis and may not
   tolerate small volumes of fluid.  Would anticipate that he would look a
   lot sicker if this were principally a worsening pneumonia. Urine
   legionella negative. Chest
   - Continue vanc, cefpipime, doxycycline (Day 1 [**2159-4-22**]) for full 8 day
   course for now
   - f/u pleural fluids results
   - Nebulizers as needed
   - f/u blood cultures; consider repeat sputum culture
   - Low threshold for repeat ABG and intubation if necessary - appears
   comfortable currently though.
   - Chest PT
   - frequent attempts to wean BiPap; would like to keep SpO2 > 90%.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in atrial fibrillation with episodes
   of RVR.  Patient appears to have chemically cardioverted back to NSR
   this morning.
   - Dofetilide interacts with vancomycin and hence need to monitor QT
   intervals.
   - continue dofetillide with daily ECG for QTc (clarify with cardiology
   when this practice can be d/c'd and plan for dofetilide regarding
   rhythm therapy for a. fib)
   - keep potassium around 4 and magnesium at 2 for the dofetilide; check
   electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue coumadin today at 2.5mg and monitor INR closely (goal INR
   2-2.5)
   - Touch base with EP
   - diltiazem gtt (wean as tolerated)
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.
   .
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - Rate control with standing and prn dilt and treating underlying
   hypoxia and infection
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Free water down by 1.5L, not taking PO's well given
   respiratory distress.
   - Continue slow D5 infusion at 75-100cc/hr with improvement in sodium;
   recheck sodium in afternoon.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   - continue flonase
   # Hematuria
 pink tinged urine likely from traumatic foley placement.
   - monitor hematuria for resolution.
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.
   - Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN/GI: Had [**2-14**] Ensures yesterday.
   - cardiac healthy diet
   - nutrition consult, recs appreciated -> not taking good PO's while on
   BiPap; possible TFs supplementation
   - ADAT post-thoracentesis
   .
   # DVT - Coumadin with INR therapeutic
   # Bowel regimen - senna, docusate; pt takes own lactobacillus
   # Pain: Currently comfortable, tylenol prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She was admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. The patient has been experiencing progressive shortness of breath, cough, and fever for the past week. On admission, she was found to have a high respiratory rate, increased oxygen requirement, and low blood pressure. 

24-hour events:
- The patient underwent an EKG and thoracentesis. Pleural fluid appeared transudative but bloody with a hematocrit of 1.
- She was weaned off bipap to 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FM) and converted to spontaneous respiration overnight.
- The patient was converted to regular sinus rhythm and weaned off diltiazem gargle, restarting it at a dose of 60 mg qid.
- Electrolytes were monitored, and no longer need for daily EKG was recommended.
- The patient's urine output decreased overnight, so she was given 20 mg IV Lasix, which resulted in diuresis.
- Antibiotics vancomycin and cefepime were administered.

Allergies:

   Assessment and Plan
   Professor [**Known lastname 12543**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress now s/p CCU stay for A. Fib with
   RVR and respiratory distress requiring BiPap now on face mask.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Initially patient had focal RLL
   infiltrate c/w pneumonia and fever.  Agree with continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  At this time, patient appears to have
   superimposed pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by
   LOS fluid balance, interval weight, and clinical exam.  Attempted low
   dose lasix overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitor respiratory status,
   with 700cc out and no worsening in creatinine.  Non-contrast CT showed
   moderate right sided pleural effusion, now s/p 1.5L thoracentesis on
   [**4-29**] with interval improvement in respiratory status.   Patient has
   limited reserve given prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis and
   may not tolerate small volumes of fluid.  Would anticipate that he
   would look a lot sicker if this were principally a worsening pneumonia.
   Urine legionella negative. Blood cultures negative (finalized). Sputum
   cultures contaminated.
   - vanc, cefpipime, doxycycline (Day 1 - [**2159-4-22**]) for 8 day course to
   end [**4-30**]
   - f/u pleural fluid culture (appears transudative
possibly related to
   diastolic heart failure)
   - Nebulizers as needed
   - Monitor for reaccumulation of effusion by exam, respiratory status,
   daily CXRs
   - Chest PT
   - spirometer to bedside
   - lasix bolus for net negative 1L
   - attempt to wean oxygen; would like to keep SpO2 > 90%.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in atrial fibrillation, rate
   controlled with diltiazem.   Therapeutic on INR coumadin.
   - continue diltiazem 60 QID to goal HR <110
   - continue dofetilide per EP recs  (no need for daily EKGs any more)
   - keep potassium around 4 and magnesium at 2 for the dofetilide; check
   electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue coumadin today at 2.5mg and monitor INR closely (goal INR
   2-2.5)
   - f/u EPrecs
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.
   .
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - follow-up cardiology recs
   - Rate control with standing and prn dilt and treating underlying
   hypoxia and infection
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Free water down by 1.5L, not taking PO's well given
   respiratory distress.
   - Continue slow D5 infusion at 75-100cc/hr with improvement in sodium;
   recheck sodium in afternoon.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   - continue flonase
   # Hematuria
 pink tinged urine likely from traumatic foley placement.
   - monitor hematuria for resolution.
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.
   - Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN/GI: Had [**2-14**] Ensures yesterday.
   - cardiac healthy diet
   - nutrition consult, recs appreciated -> not taking good PO's while on
   BiPap; possible TFs supplementation (on [**4-27**] nutrition recommended tube
   feedings once off BiPAP; goal is Nutren Pulmonary @ 35 ml/hr to provide
   1260 kcals/ 57 g protein)
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease, presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient was admitted to the CCU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and respiratory distress, requiring BiPap support. 

The patient initially had focal right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia and fever. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started, but the patient appeared to have superimposed pulmonary edema due to volume resuscitation. A thoracentesis was performed, revealing transudative pleural fluid with negative Gram stain and no organisms/PMNs. The patient's respiratory status improved after the thoracentesis. 

The patient has limited pulmonary reserve due to a prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis and may not tolerate small volumes of fluid. The urine Legionella test was negative, and blood cultures were negative as well. Sputum cultures were contaminated.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including diltiazem, dofetilide, and coumadin for atrial fibrillation, as well as aspirin and Lipitor for coronary artery disease. The patient's hypertension is being managed with diltiazem. 

The patient also has altered mental status likely caused by fever and tachycardia. Mirtazapine is being continued for depression/insomnia, and low-dose haloperidol may be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries, atrial fibrillation (AF), restrictive lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure and was admitted to the ICU. After a right-sided thoracentesis yesterday, the patient showed significant improvement. Fluid analysis suggests a transudate with some procedural trauma resulting in red blood cells in the fluid. The patient's oxygenation has improved, and efforts are being made to wean him off oxygen. Diuretics are being continued to remove excess fluid. BiPap is being used at night. The patient is also on dofetilide for atrial fibrillation and diltiazem. The ICU team is providing ongoing care, including monitoring glycemic control, managing lines, providing prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and monitoring for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure indicates a serious condition that can worsen if not properly managed.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient's AF can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure if not adequately controlled.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of pneumonia, particularly hospital-acquired pneumonia, increases the risk of infection and potential"

   Images:
   [**2159-4-30**] CXR: Pulmonary edema cleared substantially between [**4-28**] and
   18, but consolidation in the right upper lobe has worsened suggesting
   this is pneumonia. Right lower lobe consolidation is difficult to
   assess could be a second focus of infection or alternatively
   atelectasis. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has increased.
   Heart size has been stable, but difficult to assess because of anatomic
   distortion from scoliosis. Calcific left fibrothorax is longstanding.
   The underlying lung is grossly unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax.
   [**2159-5-1**] CXR: Report pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   Professor [**Known lastname 12543**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress now s/p CCU stay for A. Fib with
   RVR and respiratory distress requiring BiPap now on face mask.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Initially patient had focal RLL
   infiltrate c/w pneumonia and fever.  Agree with continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  At this time, patient appears to have
   superimposed pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by
   LOS fluid balance, interval weight, and clinical exam.  Attempted low
   dose lasix overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitor respiratory status,
   with 700cc out and no worsening in creatinine.  Non-contrast CT showed
   moderate right sided pleural effusion, now s/p 1.5L thoracentesis on
   [**4-29**] with interval improvement in respiratory status.   Patient has
   limited reserve given prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis and
   may not tolerate small volumes of fluid.  Would anticipate that he
   would look a lot sicker if this were principally a worsening pneumonia.
   Urine legionella negative. Blood cultures negative (finalized). Sputum
   cultures contaminated. Pleural fluid cultures NGTD.
   - Off Abx (completed course of vanc, cefpipime, doxycycline (Day 1 -
   [**2159-4-22**]) for 8 day course ending [**4-30**])
   - f/u pleural fluid culture (appears transudative
possibly related to
   diastolic heart failure)
   - Nebulizers as needed
   - Monitor for reaccumulation of effusion by exam, respiratory status,
   daily CXRs
   - Chest PT
   - spirometer to bedside
   - lasix PRN for net negative 1L
   - attempt to wean oxygen; would like to keep SpO2 > 90%.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in atrial fibrillation, rate
   controlled with diltiazem.   Therapeutic on INR coumadin.  Received
   additional PO 30 dilt overnight -> NSR, but then back into A-fib this
   AM.
   - continue diltiazem 60 QID to goal HR <110
   - continue dofetilide per EP recs  (no need for daily EKGs any more)
   - keep potassium around 4 and magnesium at 2 for the dofetilide; check
   electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue coumadin today at 2.5mg and monitor INR closely (goal INR
   2-2.5)
   - f/u EPrecs
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.
   .
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - follow-up cardiology recs
   - Rate control with standing and prn dilt and treating underlying
   hypoxia and infection
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Free water down by 1.5L, not taking PO's well given
   respiratory distress.
   - Continue slow D5 infusion at 75-100cc/hr with improvement in sodium;
   recheck sodium in afternoon.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   - continue flonase
   # Hematuria
 pink tinged urine likely from traumatic foley placement.
   - monitor hematuria for resolution.
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.
   - Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN/GI: Had [**2-14**] Ensures yesterday.
   - cardiac healthy diet
   - nutrition consult, recs appreciated -> not taking good PO's while on
   BiPap; possible TFs supplementation (on [**4-27**] nutrition recommended tube
   feedings once off BiPAP; goal is Nutren Pulmonary @ 35 ml/hr to provide

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a chief complaint of worsening shortness of breath. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on face tent 15L 50% during the day, breathing comfortably, and diuresed 1L net negative with lasix 20mg IV boluses. The patient's heart rate has been fluctuating, with a low of <110 on diltiazem 60QID during the day and trending up at night. The patient was given an extra dose of 30PO diltiazem, which converted to sinus rhythm overnight but then reverted back to atrial fibrillation around 6 AM this morning. The family members have requested to speak with the EP, and the cards fellow from [Hospital1] has agreed to transfer the patient when ready.

Allergies:
The patient has no known drug allergies.

   Assessment and Plan
   Professor [**Known lastname 12543**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress now s/p CCU stay for A. Fib with
   RVR and respiratory distress requiring BiPap now on face mask.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Initially patient had focal RLL
   infiltrate c/w pneumonia and fever.  Agree with continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  At this time, patient appears to have
   superimposed pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by
   LOS fluid balance, interval weight, and clinical exam.  Attempted low
   dose lasix overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitor respiratory status,
   with 700cc out and no worsening in creatinine.  Non-contrast CT showed
   moderate right sided pleural effusion, now s/p 1.5L thoracentesis on
   [**4-29**] with interval improvement in respiratory status.   Patient has
   limited reserve given prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis and
   may not tolerate small volumes of fluid.  Would anticipate that he
   would look a lot sicker if this were principally a worsening pneumonia.
   Urine legionella negative. Blood cultures negative (finalized). Sputum
   cultures contaminated. Pleural fluid cultures NGTD.
   - Off Abx: completed course of vanc, cefepime, doxycycline (Day 1 -
   [**2159-4-22**]) for 8 day course ending [**2159-4-30**]
   - f/u pleural fluid culture (appears transudative
possibly related to
   diastolic heart failure)
 NGTD on [**5-1**]
   - Nebulizers as needed
   - CXR overall worse on [**5-1**] consistent with possible RUL PNA (new
   infection vs resolving PNA vs edema, but no new cough or sputum
   production) together with reaccumulatiung effusion and pulmonary edema.
   For now will monitor clinically and restart antibiotics in setting of
   fever or new symptoms of PNA. Will culture sputum if patient produces
   sputum.
   - Chest PT
   - spirometer to bedside
   - lasix PRN for net negative 1L: will give lasix 20 mg now and reassess
   in afternoon
   - attempt to wean oxygen; would like to keep SpO2 > 90%.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in atrial fibrillation, rate
   controlled with diltiazem.   Therapeutic on INR coumadin.  Received
   additional PO 30 dilt overnight -> NSR, but then back into A-fib this
   AM.
   - continue diltiazem 60 QID to goal HR <110; will give additional doses
   of diltiazem prn to attain better rate control
   - continue dofetilide per EP recs  (no need for daily EKGs any more)
   - keep potassium around 4 and magnesium at 2 for the dofetilide; check
   electrolytes [**Hospital1 **] while on Lasix
   - continue coumadin today at 2.5mg and monitor INR closely (goal INR
   2-2.5)
   - f/u EP recs: will inquire about appropriateness of restarting
   beta-blocker for rate control (initial recs from cards to avoid
   starting beta-blocker while still in setting of respiratory distress
   because rate will be difficult to control due to respiratory issues)
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.
   .
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - follow-up cardiology recs
   - Rate control with standing and prn dilt and treating underlying
   hypoxia and infection
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 148 on [**5-1**], not taking PO's well given respiratory
   distress.
   - Encourage POs; recheck Na in afternoon.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   - continue flonase
   # Hematuria
 pink tinged urine likely from traumatic foley placement.
   - monitor hematuria for resolution.
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.
   - Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN/GI: Had [**2-14**] Ensures yesterday.
   - cardiac healthy diet
   - nutrition consult, recs appreciated -> not taking good PO's while on
   BiPap; possible TFs supplementation (on [**4-27**] nutrition recommended tube
   feedings once off BiPAP; goal is Nutren Pulmonary @ 35 ml/hr to provide

   [**2159-4-30**] CXR: Pulmonary edema cleared substantially between [**4-28**] and
   18, but consolidation in the right upper lobe has worsened suggesting
   this is pneumonia. Right lower lobe consolidation is difficult to
   assess could be a second focus of infection or alternatively
   atelectasis. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has increased.
   Heart size has been stable, but difficult to assess because of anatomic
   distortion from scoliosis. Calcific left fibrothorax is longstanding.
   The underlying lung is grossly unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax.
   [**2159-5-1**] CXR: Report pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   Professor [**Known lastname 12543**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress now s/p CCU stay for A. Fib with
   RVR and respiratory distress requiring BiPap now on face mask.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Initially patient had focal RLL
   infiltrate c/w pneumonia and fever.  Agree with continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  At this time, patient appears to have
   superimposed pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by
   LOS fluid balance, interval weight, and clinical exam.  Attempted low
   dose lasix overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitor respiratory status,
   with 700cc out and no worsening in creatinine.  Non-contrast CT showed
   moderate right sided pleural effusion, now s/p 1.5L thoracentesis on
   [**4-29**] with interval improvement in respiratory status.   Patient has
   limited reserve given prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis and
   may not tolerate small volumes of fluid.  Would anticipate that he
   would look a lot sicker if this were principally a worsening pneumonia.
   Urine legionella negative. Blood cultures negative (finalized). Sputum
   cultures contaminated. Pleural fluid cultures NGTD.
   - Off Abx: completed course of vanc, cefepime, doxycycline (Day 1 -
   [**2159-4-22**]) for 8 day course ending [**2159-4-30**]
   - f/u pleural fluid culture (appears transudative
possibly related to
   diastolic heart failure)
 NGTD on [**5-1**]
   - Nebulizers as needed
   - CXR overall worse on [**5-1**] consistent with possible RUL PNA (new
   infection vs resolving PNA vs edema, but no new cough or sputum
   production) together with reaccumulatiung effusion and pulmonary edema.
   For now will monitor clinically and restart antibiotics in setting of
   fever or new symptoms of PNA. Will culture sputum if patient produces
   sputum.
   - Chest PT
   - spirometer to bedside
   - lasix PRN for net negative 1L: will give lasix 20 mg now and reassess
   in afternoon
   - attempt to wean oxygen; would like to keep SpO2 > 90%.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in atrial fibrillation, rate
   controlled with diltiazem.   Therapeutic on INR coumadin.  Received
   additional PO 30 dilt overnight -> NSR, but then back into A-fib this
   AM.
   - continue diltiazem 60 QID to goal HR <110; will give additional doses
   of diltiazem prn to attain better rate control
   - continue dofetilide per EP recs  (no need for daily EKGs any more)
   - keep potassium around 4 and magnesium at 2 for the dofetilide; check
   electrolytes [**Hospital1 **] while on Lasix
   - continue coumadin today at 2.5mg and monitor INR closely (goal INR
   2-2.5)
   - f/u EP recs: will inquire about appropriateness of restarting
   beta-blocker for rate control (initial recs from cards to avoid
   starting beta-blocker while still in setting of respiratory distress
   because rate will be difficult to control due to respiratory issues)
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.
   .
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - follow-up cardiology recs
   - Rate control with standing and prn dilt and treating underlying
   hypoxia and infection
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 148 on [**5-1**], not taking PO's well given respiratory
   distress.
   - Encourage POs; recheck Na in afternoon.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   - continue flonase
   # Hematuria
 pink tinged urine likely from traumatic foley placement.
   - monitor hematuria for resolution.
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.
   - Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN/GI: Had [**2-14**] Ensures yesterday.
   - cardiac healthy diet
   - nutrition consult, recs appreciated -> not taking good PO's while on
   BiPap; possible TFs supplementation (on [**4-27**] nutrition recommended tube
   feedings once off BiPAP; goal is Nutren Pulmonary @ 35 ml/hr to provide
   1260 kcals/ 57 g protein)

   [**2159-4-30**] CXR: Pulmonary edema cleared substantially between [**4-28**] and
   18, but consolidation in the right upper lobe has worsened suggesting
   this is pneumonia. Right lower lobe consolidation is difficult to
   assess could be a second focus of infection or alternatively
   atelectasis. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has increased.
   Heart size has been stable, but difficult to assess because of anatomic
   distortion from scoliosis. Calcific left fibrothorax is longstanding.
   The underlying lung is grossly unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax.
   [**2159-5-1**] CXR: Report pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   Professor [**Known lastname 12543**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress now s/p CCU stay for A. Fib with
   RVR and respiratory distress requiring BiPap now on face mask.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Initially patient had focal RLL
   infiltrate c/w pneumonia and fever.  Agree with continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  At this time, patient appears to have
   superimposed pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by
   LOS fluid balance, interval weight, and clinical exam.  Attempted low
   dose lasix overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitor respiratory status,
   with 700cc out and no worsening in creatinine.  Non-contrast CT showed
   moderate right sided pleural effusion, now s/p 1.5L thoracentesis on
   [**4-29**] with interval improvement in respiratory status.   Patient has
   limited reserve given prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis and
   may not tolerate small volumes of fluid.  Would anticipate that he
   would look a lot sicker if this were principally a worsening pneumonia.
   Urine legionella negative. Blood cultures negative (finalized). Sputum
   cultures contaminated. Pleural fluid cultures NGTD.
   - Off Abx (completed course of vanc, cefpipime, doxycycline (Day 1 -
   [**2159-4-22**]) for 8 day course ending [**4-30**])
   - f/u pleural fluid culture (appears transudative
possibly related to
   diastolic heart failure)
   - Nebulizers as needed
   - Monitor for reaccumulation of effusion by exam, respiratory status,
   daily CXRs
   - Chest PT
   - spirometer to bedside
   - lasix PRN for net negative 1L
   - attempt to wean oxygen; would like to keep SpO2 > 90%.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in atrial fibrillation, rate
   controlled with diltiazem.   Therapeutic on INR coumadin.  Received
   additional PO 30 dilt overnight -> NSR, but then back into A-fib this
   AM.
   - continue diltiazem 60 QID to goal HR <110
   - continue dofetilide per EP recs  (no need for daily EKGs any more)
   - keep potassium around 4 and magnesium at 2 for the dofetilide; check
   electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue coumadin today at 2.5mg and monitor INR closely (goal INR
   2-2.5)
   - f/u EPrecs
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.
   .
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - follow-up cardiology recs
   - Rate control with standing and prn dilt and treating underlying
   hypoxia and infection
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Free water down by 1.5L, not taking PO's well given
   respiratory distress.
   - Continue slow D5 infusion at 75-100cc/hr with improvement in sodium;
   recheck sodium in afternoon.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   - continue flonase
   # Hematuria
 pink tinged urine likely from traumatic foley placement.
   - monitor hematuria for resolution.
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.
   - Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN/GI: Had [**2-14**] Ensures yesterday.
   - cardiac healthy diet
   - nutrition consult, recs appreciated -> not taking good PO's while on
   BiPap; possible TFs supplementation (on [**4-27**] nutrition recommended tube
   feedings once off BiPAP; goal is Nutren Pulmonary @ 35 ml/hr to provide

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress, requiring a critical care unit (CCU) stay for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and respiratory distress. The patient is currently on BiPap for respiratory support and has a history of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and a moderate right-sided pleural effusion. He has limited lung reserve due to prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, for which he underwent CABG surgery. He is currently on multiple medications including diltiazem, coumadin, and Lipitor. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to fever and tachycardia, and he has been prescribed mirtazapine for depression/insomnia. He also has hypernatremia, chronic sinusitis, hematuria, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and bowel regimen. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 136/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature of 37.1°C.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving mechanical ventilation support. The patient's medical history includes severe kyphoscoliosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for worsening dyspnea and increased sputum production. 

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the right base and absent breath sounds on the left except at the apex. The patient's chest X-ray shows pulmonary edema clearance, worsening consolidation in the right upper lobe suggesting pneumonia, difficult-to-assess right lower lobe consolidation, increased small-to-moderate right pleural effusion, and a longstanding calcific left fibrothorax. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated potassium levels, and normal liver function tests. The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
   Professor [**Known lastname 12543**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress now s/p CCU stay for A. Fib with
   RVR and respiratory distress requiring BiPap now on face mask.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Initially patient had focal RLL
   infiltrate c/w pneumonia and fever.  Agree with continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  At this time, patient appears to have
   superimposed pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by
   LOS fluid balance, interval weight, and clinical exam.  Attempted low
   dose lasix overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitor respiratory status,
   with 700cc out and no worsening in creatinine.  Non-contrast CT showed
   moderate right sided pleural effusion, now s/p 1.5L thoracentesis on
   [**4-29**] with interval improvement in respiratory status.   Patient has
   limited reserve given prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis and
   may not tolerate small volumes of fluid.  Would anticipate that he
   would look a lot sicker if this were principally a worsening pneumonia.
   Urine legionella negative. Blood cultures negative (finalized). Sputum
   cultures contaminated. Pleural fluid cultures NGTD.
   - Off Abx: completed course of vanc, cefepime, doxycycline (Day 1 -
   [**2159-4-22**]) for 8 day course ending [**2159-4-30**]
   - f/u pleural fluid culture (appears transudative
possibly related to
   diastolic heart failure)
 NGTD on [**5-1**]
   - Nebulizers as needed
   - CXR overall worse on [**5-1**] consistent with possible RUL PNA (new
   infection vs resolving PNA vs edema, but no new cough or sputum
   production) together with reaccumulatiung effusion and pulmonary edema.
   For now will monitor clinically and restart antibiotics in setting of
   fever or new symptoms of PNA. Will culture sputum if patient produces
   sputum.
   - Chest PT
   - spirometer to bedside
   - lasix PRN for net negative 1L- 20-40 IV lasix boluses
   - attempt to wean oxygen; would like to keep SpO2 > 90%.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in atrial fibrillation, rate
   controlled with diltiazem.   Therapeutic on INR coumadin.  Received
   additional PO 30 dilt overnight -> NSR, but then back into A-fib this
   AM.
   - continue Diltiazem 90QID per EP recs (consider transition to long
   acting)
   - additional doses for rate control <110 at rest
   - continue dofetilide per EP recs  (no need for daily EKGs any more)
   - keep potassium around 4 and magnesium at 2 for the dofetilide; check
   electrolytes [**Hospital1 **] while on Lasix
   - Coumadin 5mg/2.5mg per home dosing
   - f/u EP recs: will inquire about appropriateness of restarting
   beta-blocker for rate control (initial recs from cards to avoid
   starting beta-blocker while still in setting of respiratory distress
   because rate will be difficult to control due to respiratory issues)
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.
   .
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - follow-up cardiology recs
   - Rate control with standing and prn dilt and treating underlying
   hypoxia and infection
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 148 on [**5-1**], not taking PO's well given respiratory
   distress.
   - Encourage POs; recheck Na in afternoon.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   - continue flonase
   # Hematuria
 pink tinged urine likely from traumatic foley placement.
   - monitor hematuria for resolution.
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.
   - Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN/GI: Had [**2-14**] Ensures yesterday.
   - cardiac healthy diet
   - nutrition consult, recs appreciated -> not taking good PO's while on
   BiPap; possible TFs supplementation (on [**4-27**] nutrition recommended tube

","Summary:
Professor Known lastname 12543, a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease, presented with five days of fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress. He was admitted to the CCU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and respiratory distress. The patient has been on BiPAP since admission and is currently on a face mask. He has limited respiratory reserve due to a prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis.

The patient has been treated for pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which have been discontinued today as his pneumonia course is complete. However, there is evidence of reaccumulating effusion and pulmonary edema on the chest X-ray. The patient's fever and respiratory symptoms have improved, but his oxygen saturation remains below 90%. He has been receiving diuretics and his fluid balance shows a negative output.

The patient's cardiac status includes atrial fibrillation, rate-controlled with diltiazem, and therapeutic INR on coumadin. He also has a history of coronary artery disease, status post CABG, and junctional bradycardia.

Other medical issues include altered mental status, depression/insomnia, hypernatremia, chronic sinusitis, hematuria, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, and a history of deep vein thrombosis. The patient is currently on several medications and supplements, including beta-blockers, calcium"

   Assessment and Plan
   Professor [**Known lastname 12543**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress now s/p CCU stay for A. Fib with
   RVR and respiratory distress requiring BiPap now on face mask.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Initially patient had focal RLL
   infiltrate c/w pneumonia and fever.  Agree with continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  At this time, patient appears to have
   superimposed pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by
   LOS fluid balance, interval weight, and clinical exam.  Attempted low
   dose lasix overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitor respiratory status,
   with 700cc out and no worsening in creatinine.  Non-contrast CT showed
   moderate right sided pleural effusion, now s/p 1.5L thoracentesis on
   [**4-29**] with interval improvement in respiratory status.   Patient has
   limited reserve given prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis and
   may not tolerate small volumes of fluid.  Would anticipate that he
   would look a lot sicker if this were principally a worsening pneumonia.
   Urine legionella negative. Blood cultures negative (finalized). Sputum
   cultures contaminated. Pleural fluid cultures NGTD.
   - Off Abx: completed course of vanc, cefepime, doxycycline (Day 1 -
   [**2159-4-22**]) for 8 day course ending [**2159-4-30**]
   - f/u pleural fluid culture (appears transudative
possibly related to
   diastolic heart failure)
 NGTD on [**5-1**]
   - Nebulizers as needed
   - CXR overall worse on [**5-1**] consistent with possible RUL PNA (new
   infection vs resolving PNA vs edema, but no new cough or sputum
   production) together with reaccumulatiung effusion and pulmonary edema.
   For now will monitor clinically and restart antibiotics in setting of
   fever or new symptoms of PNA. Will culture sputum if patient produces
   sputum.
   - Chest PT
   - spirometer to bedside
   - lasix PRN for net negative 1L: will give lasix 20 mg now and reassess
   in afternoon
   - attempt to wean oxygen; would like to keep SpO2 > 90%.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in atrial fibrillation, rate
   controlled with diltiazem.   Therapeutic on INR coumadin.  Received
   additional PO 30 dilt overnight -> NSR, but then back into A-fib this
   AM.
   - continue diltiazem 60 QID to goal HR <110; will give additional doses
   of diltiazem prn to attain better rate control
   - continue dofetilide per EP recs  (no need for daily EKGs any more)
   - keep potassium around 4 and magnesium at 2 for the dofetilide; check
   electrolytes [**Hospital1 **] while on Lasix
   - continue coumadin today at 2.5mg and monitor INR closely (goal INR
   2-2.5)
   - f/u EP recs: will inquire about appropriateness of restarting
   beta-blocker for rate control (initial recs from cards to avoid
   starting beta-blocker while still in setting of respiratory distress
   because rate will be difficult to control due to respiratory issues)
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.
   .
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - follow-up cardiology recs
   - Rate control with standing and prn dilt and treating underlying
   hypoxia and infection
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 148 on [**5-1**], not taking PO's well given respiratory
   distress.
   - Encourage POs; recheck Na in afternoon.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   - continue flonase
   # Hematuria
 pink tinged urine likely from traumatic foley placement.
   - monitor hematuria for resolution.
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.
   - Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN/GI: Had [**2-14**] Ensures yesterday.
   - cardiac healthy diet
   - nutrition consult, recs appreciated -> not taking good PO's while on
   BiPap; possible TFs supplementation (on [**4-27**] nutrition recommended tube
   feedings once off BiPAP; goal is Nutren Pulmonary @ 35 ml/hr to provide

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress, requiring a stay in the critical care unit for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and respiratory distress. The patient is currently on BiPap face mask for respiratory support.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient initially had a focal right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were agreed upon. The patient appears to have superimposed pulmonary edema due to volume resuscitation, as evidenced by the fluid balance, weight gain, and clinical exam. Low-dose Lasix was attempted overnight for diuresis and monitoring of respiratory status, with no worsening in creatinine. A thoracentesis was performed, resulting in improvement in respiratory status. The patient has limited reserve given prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis and may not tolerate small volumes of fluid. It is anticipated that he would look sicker if this were principally a worsening pneumonia. Urine Legionella negative, blood cultures negative, and sputum cultures contaminated.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, with rate controlled using diltiazem. Additional PO 30 diltiazem was given overnight, resulting in normal sinus rhythm, but then the patient reverted back to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Professor [**Known lastname 12543**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrilation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress now s/p CCU stay for A. Fib with
   RVR and respiratory distress requiring BiPap now on face mask.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Initially patient had focal RLL
   infiltrate c/w pneumonia and fever.  Agree with continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  At this time, patient appears to have
   superimposed pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by
   LOS fluid balance, interval weight, and clinical exam.  Attempted low
   dose lasix overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitor respiratory status,
   with 700cc out and no worsening in creatinine.  Non-contrast CT showed
   moderate right sided pleural effusion, now s/p 1.5L thoracentesis on
   [**4-29**] with interval improvement in respiratory status.   Patient has
   limited reserve given prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis and
   may not tolerate small volumes of fluid.  Would anticipate that he
   would look a lot sicker if this were principally a worsening pneumonia.
   Urine legionella negative. Blood cultures negative (finalized). Sputum
   cultures contaminated. Pleural fluid cultures NGTD.
   - Off Abx: completed course of vanc, cefepime, doxycycline (Day 1 -
   [**2159-4-22**]) for 8 day course ending [**2159-4-30**]
   - f/u pleural fluid culture (appears transudative
possibly related to
   diastolic heart failure)
 NGTD on [**5-1**]
   - Nebulizers as needed
   - CXR overall worse on [**5-1**] consistent with possible RUL PNA (new
   infection vs resolving PNA vs edema, but no new cough or sputum
   production) together with reaccumulatiung effusion and pulmonary edema.
   For now will monitor clinically and restart antibiotics in setting of
   fever or new symptoms of PNA. Will culture sputum if patient produces
   sputum.
   - Chest PT
   - spirometer to bedside
   - lasix PRN for net negative 1L- 20IV lasix boluses
   - attempt to wean oxygen; would like to keep SpO2 > 90%.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in atrial fibrillation, rate
   controlled with diltiazem.   Therapeutic on INR coumadin.  Received
   additional PO 30 dilt overnight -> NSR, but then back into A-fib this
   AM.
   - continue Diltiazem 90QID per EP recs (consider transition to long
   acting)
   - additional doses for rate control <110 at rest
   - continue dofetilide per EP recs  (no need for daily EKGs any more)
   - keep potassium around 4 and magnesium at 2 for the dofetilide; check
   electrolytes [**Hospital1 **] while on Lasix
   - Coumadin 5mg/2.5mg per home dosing
   - f/u EP recs: will inquire about appropriateness of restarting
   beta-blocker for rate control (initial recs from cards to avoid
   starting beta-blocker while still in setting of respiratory distress
   because rate will be difficult to control due to respiratory issues)
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.
   .
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - follow-up cardiology recs
   - Rate control with standing and prn dilt and treating underlying
   hypoxia and infection
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 148 on [**5-1**], not taking PO's well given respiratory
   distress.
   - Encourage POs; recheck Na in afternoon.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   - continue flonase
   # Hematuria
 pink tinged urine likely from traumatic foley placement.
   - monitor hematuria for resolution.
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.
   - Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN/GI: Had [**2-14**] Ensures yesterday.
   - cardiac healthy diet
   - nutrition consult, recs appreciated -> not taking good PO's while on
   BiPap; possible TFs supplementation (on [**4-27**] nutrition recommended tube
   feedings once off BiPAP; goal is Nutren Pulmonary @ 35 ml/hr to provide
   1260 kcals/ 57 g protein)

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of chronic lung disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. He is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 133 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 114/33 to 172/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on face tent. The patient is also on multiple medications including furosemide, lipitor, flovent, ASA, dofilitide, colace, lactobacillus, and diltiazem.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the right lung base and diminished breath sounds at the bases. He also has trace edema in both lower extremities and warm skin. Neurological assessment shows that he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to time, place, and person. Movement, tone, and other neurological functions have not been assessed.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 11.6 g/dL, hemoglobin of 13.9 g/dL, platelet count of 276 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 35.3 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, sodium of 137 mg/dL, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, chloride of 98 m"

   Assessment and Plan
   Professor [**Known lastname 12543**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress now s/p CCU stay for A. Fib with
   RVR and respiratory distress requiring BiPap now on face mask.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Initially patient had focal RLL
   infiltrate c/w pneumonia and fever. Patient was initially on broad
   spectrum antibiotics, but radiographs did not bear out evidence of
   infiltrate.  At this time, patient appears to have superimposed
   pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by LOS fluid
   balance, interval weight, and clinical exam.  Attempted low dose lasix
   overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitor respiratory status, with 700cc
   out and no worsening in creatinine.  Non-contrast CT showed moderate
   right sided pleural effusion, now s/p 1.5L thoracentesis on [**4-29**] with
   interval improvement in respiratory status.   Patient has limited
   reserve given prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis and may not
   tolerate small volumes of fluid.  Would anticipate that he would look a
   lot sicker if this were principally a worsening pneumonia. Urine
   legionella negative. Blood cultures negative (finalized). Sputum
   cultures contaminated. Pleural fluid cultures NGTD.
   - Off Abx: completed course of vanc, cefepime, doxycycline (Day 1 -
   [**2159-4-22**]) for 8 day course ending [**2159-4-30**]
   - f/u pleural fluid culture (appears transudative
possibly related to
   diastolic heart failure)
 NGTD on [**5-2**]
   - Nebulizers as needed
   - CXR overall worse on [**5-1**] consistent with possible RUL PNA (new
   infection vs resolving PNA vs edema, but no new cough or sputum
   production) together with reaccumulatiung effusion and pulmonary edema.
   For now will monitor clinically and restart antibiotics in setting of
   fever or new symptoms of PNA. Will culture sputum if patient produces
   sputum.
   - Chest PT
   - spirometer to bedside
   - lasix PRN for net negative -500 to 1L today 20-40 IV lasix boluses
   - attempt to wean oxygen; would like to keep SpO2 > 90%.
   - speech and swallow evaluation today with ? chronic aspiration playing
   a role in his worsening roentgenogram/respiratory status
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in atrial fibrillation, rate
   controlled intermittently with diltiazem.   Therapeutic on INR
   coumadin.
   - Diltiazem increased yesterday to 90QID per EP recs, however, patient
   still having episodes of RVR just prior to redosing.  Change to
   Diltiazem Extended-Release 240 mg PO BID and monitor for hypotension.
   - continue dofetilide per EP recs  (no need for daily EKGs any more)
   - keep potassium around 4 and magnesium at 2 for the dofetilide; check
   electrolytes [**Hospital1 **] while on Lasix
   - Coumadin 5mg/2.5mg per home dosing
   - f/u EP recs: will inquire about appropriateness of restarting
   beta-blocker for rate control (initial recs from cards to avoid
   starting beta-blocker while still in setting of respiratory distress
   because rate will be difficult to control due to respiratory issues)
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.
   .
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - follow-up cardiology recs
   - Rate control with standing dilt
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 148 on [**5-1**], not taking PO's well given respiratory
   distress.
   - D5W @ 100ml/hr x 1 liter
   - Encourage POs; recheck Na in afternoon.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   - continue flonase
   # Hematuria
 pink tinged urine likely from traumatic foley placement.
   - monitor hematuria for resolution.
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.
   - Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN/GI: Had [**2-14**] Ensures yesterday.
   - cardiac healthy diet
   - nutrition consult, recs appreciated -> not taking good PO's while on
   BiPap; possible TFs supplementation (on [**4-27**] nutrition recommended tube

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress, requiring a stay in the critical care unit (CCU) for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and respiratory distress. The patient is currently on a face mask with BiPAP for respiratory support. His condition has been complicated by pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and a right-sided pleural effusion. He has also had junctional bradycardia, altered mental status, depression/insomnia, hypernatremia, chronic sinusitis, hematuria, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hyperlipidemia, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is currently receiving various medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, antiarrhythmics, antihypertensives, and lipid-lowering agents. He is being monitored closely in the ICU and is expected to remain there pending improvement in his respiratory status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, as evidenced by the need for continued oxygen supplementation and BiPAP support. There is a risk of further deterioration in his respiratory function, which could necessitate advanced interventions such as intubation and mechanical ventilation.

2. Recurrence of pneumonia or new infection: Despite the completion of antibiotic therapy, the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Professor [**Known lastname 12543**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and
   coronary artery disease who presented with 5 days of fatigue and
   developed hypoxic respiratory distress now s/p CCU stay for A. Fib with
   RVR and respiratory distress requiring BiPap now on face mask.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Initially patient thought to have RLL
   infiltrate c/w pneumonia and fever. Patient was initially on broad
   spectrum antibiotics, but radiographs did not bear out evidence of
   infiltrate.  At this time, patient appears to have superimposed
   pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by LOS fluid
   balance, interval weight, and clinical exam.  Attempted low dose lasix
   overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitor respiratory status, with 700cc
   out and no worsening in creatinine.  Non-contrast CT showed moderate
   right sided pleural effusion, now s/p 1.5L thoracentesis on [**4-29**] with
   interval improvement in respiratory status.   Patient has limited
   reserve given prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis and may not
   tolerate small volumes of fluid.  Would anticipate that he would look a
   lot sicker if this were principally a worsening pneumonia. Urine
   legionella negative. Blood cultures negative (finalized). Sputum
   cultures contaminated. Pleural fluid cultures NGTD.
   - Off Abx: completed course of vanc, cefepime, doxycycline (Day 1 -
   [**2159-4-22**]) for 8 day course ending [**2159-4-30**]
   - f/u pleural fluid culture (appears transudative
possibly related to
   diastolic heart failure)
 NGTD on [**5-2**]
   - Nebulizers as needed
   - CXR overall worse on [**5-1**] concerning for RUL PNA (new infection vs
   resolving PNA vs edema, but no new cough or sputum production) together
   with reaccumulatiung effusion and pulmonary edema. For now will monitor
   clinically and restart antibiotics in setting of fever or new symptoms
   of PNA. Will culture sputum if patient produces sputum.
   - Chest PT
   - spirometer to bedside
   - lasix PRN for net negative -500 to 1L today with 20-40 IV lasix
   boluses
   - attempt to wean oxygen; would like to keep SpO2 > 90%.
   - speech and swallow evaluation today with ? chronic aspiration playing
   a role in his worsening roentgenogram/respiratory status
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in atrial fibrillation, rate
   controlled intermittently with diltiazem.   Therapeutic on INR
   coumadin.
   - Diltiazem increased yesterday to 90QID per EP recs, however, patient
   still having episodes of RVR just prior to redosing.  Change to
   Diltiazem Extended-Release 240 mg PO BID and monitor for hypotension.
   - continue dofetilide per EP recs  (no need for daily EKGs any more)
   - keep potassium around 4 and magnesium at 2 for the dofetilide; check
   electrolytes [**Hospital1 **] while on Lasix
   - Cont coumadin 5mg daily for now as still subtherapeutic
   - hold on heparin gtt; if not therapeutic by tmrw will consider
   starting
   - f/u EP recs
   .
   # Junctional Bradycardia: thought [**2-13**] to beta-blockers.  Hold atenolol
   and avoid metoprolol for rate control.
   - d/w EP regarding beta-blocker prior to d/c home.
   .
   # Coronary artery disease:  Status post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST
   depressions on EKG (stable, but worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No
   active chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes negative.
   - continue aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor
   - follow-up cardiology recs
   - Rate control with standing dilt
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue diltiazem.  holding beta-blocker given junctional rhythm
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely occurred in the setting of fever and
   tachycardia along with increased benzodiazepine dose.  .
   - appreciate psych recs
   - continue mirtazepine HS plus PRN (pt did ok with this)
   - will try low dose haldol 0.5 mg PO if needed for acute agitation
   .
   # Depression/insomnia:  Psych following, avoid benzodiaepines
   - prefer to hold ativan (recommended by psych) and use only if needed
   - per psych may consider 0.25 mg haldol for anxiety, will weigh the
   cost/benefits given pt on dofetilide which prolongs QT (although
   studies show haldol prolongs QT less than other antipsychotics.
   - continue mirtazapine.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 148 on [**5-1**], not taking PO's well given respiratory
   distress.
   - D5W @ 100ml/hr x 1 liter
   - Encourage POs; recheck Na in afternoon.
   - Maintain negative with lasix.
   .
   # Chronic sinusitis:
   - continue flonase
   # Hematuria
 pink tinged urine likely from traumatic foley placement.
   - monitor hematuria for resolution.
   .
   # OSA: On biPAP at home.
   - Continue BiPAP PRN
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # FEN/GI: Had [**2-14**] Ensures yesterday.
   - cardiac healthy diet
   - nutrition consult, recs appreciated -> not taking good PO's while on
   BiPap; possible TFs supplementation (on [**4-27**] nutrition recommended tube
   feedings once off BiPAP; goal is Nutren Pulmonary @ 35 ml/hr to provide

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress, which required a stay in the cardiac care unit (CCU) for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and respiratory distress. He was placed on BiPAP for respiratory support.

The patient initially had suspected right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia, but radiographs did not confirm this. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the antibiotics were discontinued after blood cultures were negative and urine Legionella test was negative. A thoracentesis was performed to remove a moderate right-sided pleural effusion, which improved his respiratory status.

The patient has limited fluid tolerance due to a prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis. The pleural fluid was transudative and possibly related to diastolic heart failure. There is concern for right upper lobe pneumonia, but this will be monitored clinically, and antibiotics may be restarted if there is fever or new symptoms of pneumonia.

The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation with a controlled rate using diltiazem. His INR is subtherapeutic, and he is on coumadin. He will continue on dofetilide, which requires monitoring of potassium and magnesium levels. Heparin may be considered if the INR does not become therapeutic.

The patient has a history of junctional bradycardia"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - D5W at 100cc/hr for 1L (Na 148 in AM)
   - EP recs: increase dilt to 90 qid (done)
   - Lasix 20 mg IV at 12pm and 6pm -> -1.5 L for day
   - abx discontinued today (PNA course complete)
   - brown sediment in foley; min brown clot but no active bleeding at
   penis with mild TTP. sent U/A & Ucx; ordered for urojet
   - EP recs: Give dilt 120 Q6H until tomorrow, then convert to
   long-acting dilt (to prevent breakthrough) at 240 QAM and 240 QPM. Hold
   off on increasing dofetilide given proarrhythmic potential. Rate of
   90-120 is acceptable and not likely to contribute much to
   hypoxia/pulmonary sx. If INR not therapeutic by tomorrow, should get
   heparin gtt for anticoagulation. S&S evaluation as aspiration may have
   played role in triggering sx.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He presented with fatigue and developed hypoxic respiratory distress, for which he received care in the critical care unit (CCU). The patient's respiratory status improved after a thoracentesis procedure to remove a moderate right-sided pleural effusion. However, his condition remains concerning due to worsening chest X-rays indicating possible right upper lobe pneumonia (new infection vs resolving PNA vs edema), reaccumulating effusion, and pulmonary edema. The patient is currently on low-dose Lasix for diuresis, nebulizers as needed, and being monitored for any signs of fever or new symptoms of pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's initial presentation was hypoxic respiratory distress, which has partially improved with the removal of the pleural effusion. However, there is still concern for worsening pneumonia or pulmonary edema, which can lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Junctional Bradycardia: The patient was previously thought to have junctional bradycardia, possibly related to beta-blocker use. This condition should be monitored, and the patient should be evaluated for any changes in heart rate or rhythm.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent CABG surgery. There is a risk of recurrent cardiac events, such"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old man with chronic respiratory failure, admitted with acute on chronic respiratory failure, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure. The patient's current condition is improving, with reduced oxygen dependency and conversion to sinus rhythm. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including hypernatremia (high sodium levels), hypoxemia (low oxygen levels), alteration in nutrition, pneumonia (hospital-acquired, non-ventilator-associated), oliguria/anuria (low urine output), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and restrictive lung disease (including neuromuscular and chest wall restrictions). Additionally, the patient has acute respiratory failure, but it is not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate between 95-135 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 108/56 to 136/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight has increased from 53.1 kg at admission to 56.4 kg currently.

The patient has received several medications, including cefipime, furosemide (Lasix), lansoprazole (Prevacid), lipitor, asa, dofetilide, lactobacillus, mirtazapine, diltiazem SR 240mg, and coumadin. The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,415 mL and total output of 2,928 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,513 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 7.8-8.5 thousand/mm³, hematocrit of 33.2-36.8%, platelet count of 80-276 thousand/mm³, creatinine of 0.7-0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 97-157 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including high sodium (149 mg/dL), low potassium (0.8 mEq/L), and normal chloride, bicarbonate, and magnesium levels. Other lab results show elevated levels of lactic acid and troponin-T, while being within normal range for CK, CKMB, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, albumin, calcium, and phosphorus.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the lungs, diminished breath sounds at the bases, right lower extremity edema, and trace edema in the left lower extremity. Neurological examination is not assessed due to the patient's critical condition."
