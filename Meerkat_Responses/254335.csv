   Assessment and Plan
   73 yoM w/ a h/o PVD, DM, CAD and recent C diff presenting with PEA
   arrest following 4 days of general malaise.
   # Arrest: PEA arrest.  Unclear etiology but recent admission for C diff
   and VRE / S epi bactermia (all PICC line related with negative
   surveillance cultures)  DDx includes infection (sepsis, C diff),
   dehydration, GI bleed (as has history of PUD, unlikely given Hct 32,
   guaiac negative), PE (prelim CTA negative for PE, has IVC filter for
   h/o DVT), MI (first set of CE relatively negative), no major
   electrolyte abnormalities (except Mg of 1.3).
   -low GCS so started on cooling protocol, continue cooling unless
   adverse reaction, monitor for electrolyte abnormalities and for
   bleeding / worsening of infection
   -treat sepsis with daptomycin, cefepime and PO vancomycin / IV flagyl,
   send CVO2, monitor CVP and MAPs
   -culture blood, urine, sputum, f/u CXR
   -monitor for signs of bleeding, continue on [**Hospital1 **] ppi (home medication)
   -f/u final CTA chest and CT abd/pelvis read
   -send tox screen
   -48 hour EEG per cooling protocol, if seizure then benzo and neuro
   consult
   -monitor electrolytes, glucose while on cooling protocol, avoid
   hyperthermia 24 hours after rewarming.
   -lactic acidosis- lactate trended to normal, monitor BP and UOP
   # Anemia: likely acute blood loss as he has gastoccult positive NG
   lavage. No RP bleed on CT torso yesterday.  History of esophageal and
   stomach ulcers. GI wanted repeat EGD in 6 weeks in early [**Month (only) 51**].  Also had
   colonoscopy with blood seen but no actively bleeding lesion.  Also,
   likely component of dehydraiton/volume contraction at admission, and
   drop in HCT may be related to hydration.
   -trend hematocrit
   # Respiratory: on ventilatory [**1-3**] arrest.
   -attempt to wean settings, oxygenating very well and currently being
   slightly overventilated
   # ETOH abuse: per old notes had drank 4oz of vodka per day
   -versed for sedation, will give bolus versed vs. valium for tachycardia
   / hypertension
   -thiamine IV, folate, MVI daily
   # ?Bilateral renal infarcts: f/u final read
   -trend cr, currently 1.6 (baseline 1.5 - 2.0)
   -no other signs of infarction
   -continue abx
   -obtain echo to evaluate for vegetations if in fact are bilateral renal
   infarcts
   # CAD: h/o MI in [**2120**], s/p stent at that time
   -EKG in a.m.
   -trend cardiac enzymes
   -ASA 325mg in ER, had been on aspirin in the past but this was held due
   to a massive GI bleedin in [**2129-3-2**].  Will hold off on ASA unless
   he rules in for MI
   -continue lipitor and beta blocker (home dose is low dose lopressor
   12.5mg po bid)
   -no previous echo in system
   # DM:
   -HISS, last A1C was 6% in [**7-9**]
   # COPD: standing inhaler q6hrs (albuterol and atrovent)

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and recent Clostridium difficile infection presenting with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest following four days of general malaise. The patient likely had sepsis of multiple sources including C. difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia, as well as pyelonephritis. He has not required pressors and his blood pressure is stable. The patient has anemia likely due to acute blood loss, which is supported by a positive occult blood test in the nasogastric lavage. There is no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding on the CT scan. The patient also has a history of esophageal and stomach ulcers. Additionally, the drop in hematocrit may be related to dehydration or volume contraction at admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient had sepsis of multiple sources, including C. difficile, VRE, and Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia, as well as pyelonephritis. This indicates a risk of further complications related to infection.
2. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to acute blood loss. This can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although there is no evidence of gastrointestinal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and recent Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff). The patient presented with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest following four days of general malaise. The etiology of the arrest is unclear, but it may be related to recent admission for C. diff and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE)/Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia, which was associated with the patient's peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line.

The patient has low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and was started on a cooling protocol. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/54 mmHg to 116/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 650 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yoM w/ a h/o PVD, DM, CAD and recent C diff presenting with PEA
   arrest following 4 days of general malaise.
   # Arrest: PEA arrest.  Unclear etiology but recent admission for C diff
   and VRE / S epi bactermia (all PICC line related with negative
   surveillance cultures)  DDx includes infection (sepsis, C diff),
   dehydration, GI bleed (as has history of PUD, unlikely given Hct 32,
   guaiac negative), PE (prelim CTA negative for PE, has IVC filter for
   h/o DVT), MI (first set of CE relatively negative), no major
   electrolyte abnormalities (except Mg of 1.3).
   -low GCS so started on cooling protocol, continue cooling unless
   adverse reaction, monitor for electrolyte abnormalities and for
   bleeding / worsening of infection
   -treat sepsis with daptomycin, cefepime and PO vancomycin / IV flagyl,
   send CVO2, monitor CVP and MAPs
   -culture blood, urine, sputum, f/u CXR
   -monitor for signs of bleeding, continue on [**Hospital1 **] ppi (home medication)
   -f/u final CTA chest and CT abd/pelvis read
   -send tox screen
   -48 hour EEG per cooling protocol, if seizure then benzo and neuro
   consult
   -monitor electrolytes, glucose while on cooling protocol, avoid
   hyperthermia 24 hours after rewarming.
   -lactic acidosis- lactate trended to normal, monitor BP and UOP
   # Respiratory: on ventilatory [**1-3**] arrest.
   -attempt to wean settings, oxygenating very well and currently being
   slightly overventilated
   # ETOH abuse: per old notes had drank 4oz of vodka per day
   -versed for sedation, will give bolus versed vs. valium for tachycardia
   / hypertension
   -thiamine IV, folate, MVI daily
   # ?Bilateral renal infarcts: f/u final read
   -trend cr, currently 1.6 (baseline 1.5 - 2.0)
   -no other signs of infarction
   -continue abx
   -obtain echo to evaluate for vegetations if in fact are bilateral renal
   infarcts
   # CAD: h/o MI in [**2120**], s/p stent at that time
   -EKG in a.m.
   -trend cardiac enzymes
   -ASA 325mg in ER, had been on aspirin in the past but this was held due
   to a massive GI bleedin in [**2129-3-2**].  Will hold off on ASA unless
   he rules in for MI
   -continue lipitor and beta blocker (home dose is low dose lopressor
   12.5mg po bid)
   -no previous echo in system
   # DM:
   -HISS, last A1C was 6% in [**7-9**]
   # COPD: standing inhaler q6hrs (albuterol and atrovent)

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and recent Clostridium difficile infection presenting with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest following four days of general malaise. The patient was admitted for C. diff and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE)/Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia, which was found to be related to the PICC line. The differential diagnosis includes infection (sepsis, C. diff), dehydration, gastrointestinal bleed (with a history of peptic ulcer disease, but unlikely given the hematocrit level and negative guaiac test), pulmonary embolism (with a negative CT angiogram and presence of inferior vena cava filter for previous deep vein thrombosis), and myocardial infarction (with a negative initial cardiac enzyme levels).

The patient is currently being treated with daptomycin, cefepime, and oral vancomycin/IV flagyl, and blood cultures have been sent. The patient's blood pressure and central venous pressure (CVP) are being closely monitored, along with mean arterial pressure (MAP). The patient is also being monitored for signs of bleeding and worsening infection. A follow-up CT angiogram of the chest and abdominal/pelvic area is planned, as well as a send tox screen. The patient's temperature is being controlled using a cooling protocol, and they are being monitored"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a chief complaint of cardiac arrest. The patient has a history of recent VRE bacteremia, Cdiff infection with recurrent diarrhea, malaise, and an unknown length of time in a down state. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/59 mmHg to 97/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, central venous pressure is 9 mmHg, and the respiratory system is clear.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 6.9 g/dL, platelet count of 316 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, troponin T level of 0.07 ng/mL, blood glucose level of 166 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including low potassium, sodium, and chloride levels.

The patient has multiple medical conditions including altered mental status, hypothermia, gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, and bacteremia with coverage for VRE and Cdiff infections. The patient's cardiac arrest was likely due to sepsis and hypotension.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral artery disease. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, chest pain, and hypotension. The patient was found to have an acute myocardial infarction and subsequently developed cardiogenic shock. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 115/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on face tent with FiO2 of 60%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 6 mmHg, with total fluid intake of 2,484 mL and output of 1,644 mL. The patient's blood products include a transfusion of 840 mL whole blood.

The patient's respiratory support consists of being on standby ventilator mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 726 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) result of 7.35/26/98 with PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 163.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he appears well-nourished but in acute distress. He has poor dentition and symmetric chest expansion with bronchial breath sounds. His abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. The patient's extremities show absent pulses in both lower extremities. His skin is not assessed, and his neurological examination is also incomplete.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.0 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 23.1%, platelet count (Plt) of 360 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.2 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.07 mg/dL, blood glucose of 166 mg/dL, and anion gap of 15 mEq/L. Other lab values include PT/PTT/INR of 16.0/36.3/1.4, electrolytes within normal range, and a slightly low albumin level of 1.8 g/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing ICU care, glycemic control, and line management. The patient is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There are no specific comments or code status mentioned in the progress note.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include worsening cardiogenic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer bleeding, and renal dysfunction."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and recent Clostridium difficile infection presenting with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest following four days of general malaise. The patient had sepsis of multiple sources including Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia, as well as pyelonephritis. The patient has been extubated and is currently on low-flow oxygen via a face tent.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 115/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,484 mL and output of 840 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,644 mL. The patient's blood products have been transfused, and he has received various medications including sodium bicarbonate, pantoprazole, and heparin prophylaxis.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 360 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and recent Clostridium difficile infection. He presented with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest following four days of general malaise. The arrest was likely related to sepsis of multiple sources, including C. difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), and Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia, as well as pyelonephritis. The patient has been extubated and is doing well. His hematocrit levels have been stable, and there are no new culture data or fever.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis of multiple sources: The patient's PEA arrest was likely due to sepsis caused by C. difficile, VRE, and Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia, as well as pyelonephritis. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are required.
2. Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit levels suggest acute blood loss. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, and blood transfusion may be necessary if the levels drop below 21.
3. Chronic kidney disease: The patient has bilateral renal infarcts vs. pyelonephritis on CT scan, but urine cultures and urinalysis are negative. An echocardiogram should be performed to evaluate for vegetations and the patient's renal function"
