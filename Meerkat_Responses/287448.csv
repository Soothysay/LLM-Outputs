   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 5118**] is an 85 yo male with CAD s/p MI, CVA, now with lower GI
   bleed for 4 days requiring 13 units of PRBCs.
   .
   1. GI bleed.  Patient admitted with ongoing lower GI bleed.  Initial
   bleeding scan at OSH on [**10-17**] revealed right sided bleeding, however
   colonoscopy x 2 failed to identify source of bleeding but there was
   concern for AVMs versus divertular bleed versus bleed proximal to the
   ileocecal valve.  Currenly hemodynamically stable with ongoing
   bleeding.  Will pursue tagged RBC today and then proceed to angiography
   versus surgery.
   - serial Hcts (q4 hours)
   - right IJ from OSH --> will need to replace in AM
   - type and cross 2 units
   - tagged RBCs today
   - Surgery consult given extent of bleed
   - GI consult
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], though less likely to be upper bleed
   .
   2.  CAD.  Patient has history of CAD with EF of 45%.  Cardiac cath in
   [**2118**] showed 3 vessel disease.  No history of stents per patient.  On
   Aspirin, lasix, atorvastatin, zetia, and metoprolol at home.  However,
   given extensive bleed, will avoid antiplatelet therapy and
   antihypertesnives.  Got DDAVP at OSH.
   - continue atorvastatin, zetia
   - hold BB, lasix, isosorbide mononitrate
   - hold aspirin
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30 given CAD and active bleed
   - check EKG
   .
   3.  H/o stroke.  Patient has history of CVA.  However, given
   significant and prolonged bleed, will hold aggrenox.
   - hold agrenox
   4.  FEN: IVF @ 150cc/hour, NPO for now.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), who presented with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding for four days. He required 13 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Initial bleeding scan revealed right-sided bleeding, but colonoscopy failed to identify the source. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, but ongoing bleeding has been observed. A tagged red blood cell scan is planned today, followed by angiography or surgery as needed. The patient's current medications include aspirin, lasix, atorvastatin, zetia, and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient has been experiencing lower GI bleeding for four days, requiring blood transfusions. Further evaluation and management are necessary to identify and control the source of bleeding.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CAD and previous MI, with an ejection fraction of 45%. He also has 3-vessel disease based on cardiac catheterization. Due to the extensive GI bleed, antiplatelet therapy and antihypertensive medications have been held.
3. History of CVA: The patient has a history of stroke. Prolonged bleeding may increase the risk of neurological complications.
4. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is positive at 814 mL"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular accident. He was admitted with ongoing lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding that required 13 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The source of bleeding could not be identified through colonoscopy, but there was concern for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), diverticular bleed, or bleeding proximal to the ileocecal valve. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but with ongoing bleeding. A tagged red blood cell scan will be performed today, followed by angiography or surgery as necessary. The patient's cardiac medications have been adjusted due to the extensive bleed, and antiplatelet and antihypertensive therapies have been held. The patient's code status is full code. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued lower GI bleeding: Despite initial interventions, the patient continues to experience ongoing bleeding, which may require further surgical or endoscopic intervention.
2. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobilization and history of atrial fibrillation increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Due to the patient's age, ongoing bleeding, and potential transfusion requirements, there is a risk of developing AKI.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular accident. He was admitted with ongoing lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, requiring 13 units of packed red blood cells. The initial bleeding scan revealed right-sided bleeding, but colonoscopy failed to identify the source. The tagged red blood cell scan was negative, but the patient is currently hemodynamically stable with ongoing bleeding. A total colectomy has been planned for today. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a slight decrease in blood pressure. He has peripheral edema and right facial droop, but clear lungs and abdomen. Lab results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and hematocrit, along with normal electrolyte levels. The patient's cardiac ejection fraction is 45%, and he has extensive coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient's ongoing lower GI bleed is a significant concern. Despite the planned total colectomy, there is a risk of re-bleeding or complications during surgery.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CAD and previous MI, with an EF of 45%. His current condition may put him at risk for cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Stroke: The patient's history of CVA increases the risk of recurrent stroke, especially if there are any complications during surgery or changes in blood"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Fellow for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   85 yo male admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-17**] with BRBPR.  Initial Hct there
   31, transfused, hemodynamically stable.  Got tagged RBC scan there
   which showed bleeding localized to ascending colon.  Colonoscopy showed
   several R-sided AVMs and scattered diverticuli, no active bleeding.
   AVMs were cauterized.  Bleeding appears to have stopped temporarily
   after that, but then he rebled.  Got repeat colonoscopy which showed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted to the hospital with BRBPR (blood-related blood pressure reading), indicating a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He required 13 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and underwent a tagged RBC scan at another hospital, which showed bleeding localized to the ascending colon. A colonoscopy was performed, revealing several right-sided arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and scattered diverticuli, with no active bleeding. The AVMs were cauterized, but the patient continued to bleed, and cauterized ulcers were seen during a repeat colonoscopy. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level decreased from 31 to 29.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and had a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at this hospital. He is currently on pantoprazole, lipitor, and zetia. His allergies include no known drug allergies, and his last dose of antibiotics was on [date]. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/76 to 98/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. His review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for gastrointestinal"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Fellow for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   85 yo male admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-17**] with BRBPR.  Initial Hct there
   31, transfused, hemodynamically stable.  Got tagged RBC scan there
   which showed bleeding localized to ascending colon.  Colonoscopy showed
   several R-sided AVMs and scattered diverticuli, no active bleeding.
   AVMs were cauterized.  Bleeding appears to have stopped temporarily
   after that, but then he rebled.  Got repeat colonoscopy which showed
   cauterized ulcers, not bleeding.  Received 13U PRBCs total while there,
   transferred here for possible surgery.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He required 13 units of blood transfusion and a tagged red blood cell scan showed bleeding localized to the ascending colon. Colonoscopy revealed several right-sided arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and scattered diverticuli, but no active bleeding. The AVMs were cauterized, but the patient continued to bleed, suggesting that the source of bleeding may be from diverticuli. He has been transferred to the ICU for possible surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient continues to bleed despite cauterization of AVMs, indicating that there might be another source of bleeding, possibly diverticuli. There is a risk of further blood loss and the need for additional blood transfusions.
2. Hx CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) previously. There is a concern for potential cardiac complications during surgery or due to the ongoing stress of the bleeding.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could be a result of the ongoing blood loss and may lead to inadequate organ perfusion.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is currently at 100% but there is a risk of developing hypoxia if the bleeding continues or during surgery.
