   Assesment:
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of HTN who presents with a
   right hip fracture.
   .
   Plan:
   .
   #. Hip Fracture: Pt with right femoral neck fracture.  Needs surgery
   and currently optimized medically, cleared for surgery. Per the Revised
   [**Doctor Last Name 8364**] cardiac risk index (RCRI) pt with 1 risk factor given q-waves
   on ECG.  By adding a beta-blocker the patient's  perioperative rate of
   cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal cardiac
   arrest is approximately- 0.8 to 1.6% (versus 2.2 to 6.6% without a
   beta-blocker)
   (Auerbach, A, [**Doctor Last Name 8364**], L. Circulation [**2135**]; 113:1361)
   - OR tomorrow
   - will make pt NPO at midnight
   - heparin sq for ppx
   - start metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Ca & Vit D
   - Tylenol 1g q8 for pain
   - Dilaudid 0.125mg IV prn (pt with morphine allergy)
   - T&S
   .
   # Hypoxemia / Tachypnea: In setting of recent fracture, concerning for
   PE vs fat embolus. Pt also at risk of aspiration and pneumonia, however
   CTA chest without any evidence of this. Patient does not appear to be
   in volume overload, and it is unclear if she has any component of
   hypoxia at baseline
   - Supplemental O2 as needed
   - Not wheezing or requiring bronchodilators, will monitor
   - If fever / worsens, would consider interval chest x-ray
   .
   #. Demand Ischemia: Pt with elevated trop of 0.11 on admission and
   repeat, however with CK 233 to 182 and MB 6 -> 6, suggesting demand
   event and does not represent acute thrombus.  Spoke with cardiology who
   recommended no need for heparin.
   -- ASA 81mg daily, ok with ortho
   -- start metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -- cont home Lisinopril, hold morning of surgery
   -- no indication for heparin gtt
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Pt with elevated WBC of 13.8 and lactate of 4.2 on
   admission. No localizing signs of infection. CT did not show pneumonia.
   Pt without urinary complaints. No F/C. Likely reactive in the setting
   of her hip fracture. Additionally, lactate can be elevated in the
   setting of tachypnea. Pt hemodynamically stable.
   -- send UA and blood cx
   -- no indication for antibiotics at this time
   -- cont to trend fever and WBC
   .
   #. Fall: Pt with witnessed fall while walking with nurses aide. No
   history of head trauma and neurologically intact. Likely mechanical
   fall
   -- trend CE
   -- monitor on tele for arrhythmia
   -- consider CT-head if neuro exam changes
   .
   #. Delerium: Pt confused and delerious in the setting of her hip
   fracture.  Neuologically intact. No h/o of head trauma with fall.
   -- pain control as above
   -- zydis 2.5mg prn for agitation
   -- consider head CT-scan if neuro exam changes
   .
   #. HTN: On admission BP 155/64.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presents with a right hip fracture. She has been diagnosed with a myocardial infarction (heart attack), and her cardiac risk index indicates a moderate risk for cardiac complications during surgery. The patient is currently optimized medically and cleared for surgery. The plan is to take her to the operating room tomorrow, make her NPO (nothing by mouth) at midnight, start her on heparin for prophylaxis, metoprolol for cardiac protection, calcium, vitamin D, Tylenol for pain, and Dilaudid IV as needed due to her morphine allergy. She also requires lab tests and a chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia/Tachypnea: The patient is at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE) or fat embolus due to the recent fracture. She may also be at risk of aspiration and pneumonia, but a CT angiogram (CTA) chest did not show any evidence of this. Since she does not appear to be in volume overload and it is unclear if she has any component of hypoxia at baseline, supplemental oxygen should be provided as needed.

2. Demand Ischemia: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating demand ischemia rather than an acute thrombus. Cardiology recommends no need for heparin. The patient should continue taking her prescribed medications, including ASA, metoprolol"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presents with a right hip fracture.
- The patient has been receiving small 500cc boluses to maintain urine output.
- The patient's blood pressure is still elevated at around 160's/60's despite uptitrating the beta-blocker to 25mg TID.
- The patient is scheduled to go to the operating room in the morning around noon.
- The patient has active type and cross matching.
- The patient has allergies to penicillins and morphine, causing agitation.
- The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on [**2139-3-16**] 04:51 AM.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 153/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.
- The patient is on a beta-blocker and has been optimized medically for surgery.
- The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.9 g/dL, hematocrit of 36.2%, platelet count of 168 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.11 ng/mL, and glucose level of 119 mg/dL.
- The patient has an elevated WBC count of 13.8 K/uL and lactate level of 4.2 on admission.
- The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on ASA 81mg daily.
- The patient's medical plan includes undergoing surgery for the hip fracture, supplementing with oxygen as needed, monitoring for any signs of wheezing or requiring bronchodilators, considering an interval chest x-ray if the patient worsens, and sending a urine analysis and blood culture.
- The patient's other plans include sending a toxicology screen, continuing metoprolol 25mg TID, administering Tylenol 1g q8 for pain, Dilaudid 0.125mg IV prn, and calcium and vitamin D supplements.
- The patient's family has reversed the DNR/DNI code status to full code.
- The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hip Fracture: The patient has a right femoral neck fracture, which requires surgery. Surgical complications such as bleeding, infection, or blood clots can occur.
2. Hypoxemia/Tachypnea: The patient is at risk of developing hypoxemia and tachypnea due to recent fracture and potential pulmonary embolism or fat embolism. This can lead to respiratory distress and failure.
3. Demand Ischemia: The patient's elevated troponin-T level on admission suggests myocardial injury, but subsequent CK and CK-MB levels indicate a demand ischemia rather than an acute thrombus. However, the patient may still be at risk for further cardiac events.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated WBC count, which could be a sign of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and conducting appropriate cultures is important.
5. Fall: The patient had a witnessed fall while walking with nurses, which could have led to mechanical injury. Monitoring for any neurological changes or head trauma symptoms is necessary.
6. Delirium: The patient is confused and delirious, which is common in elderly patients with hip fractures. Adequate pain control and addressing potential causes such as medication side effects or infection is important.
7. HTN: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medication adjustments. Continued monitoring and management of hypertension is necessary.
8. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's prolonged immobilization increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and skin assessment are recommended.
9. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immob"

","The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presents with a right hip fracture. She is currently in the ICU and has undergone several medical interventions.

1. Hip Fracture: The patient has a right femoral neck fracture and is cleared for surgery. Her pain is well-controlled, and she has been optimized medically.

2. Hypoxemia/Tachypnea: The patient is improving, likely secondary to atelectasis. Supplemental oxygen is being provided as needed, and incentive spirometry is being used to prevent further respiratory complications.

3. Demand Ischemia: The patient had elevated troponin levels on admission but repeat tests show a decrease, indicating a demand ischemia event rather than an acute thrombus. Cardiology recommends no need for heparin.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient initially had an elevated white blood cell count, but it has normalized. 

5. Fall: The patient experienced a witnessed fall while walking with a nurse's aide. There was no history of head trauma, and she remains neurologically intact.

6. Delirium: The patient is confused and delirious due to her hip fracture. Pain control measures are in place, and consideration is being given to a head CT-scan if there are changes in her neurologic exam.

7. HTN: The patient's blood pressure on admission was 155/64. Her current medication regimen includes lisinopril and metoprol"

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a chief complaint of a right hip fracture. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and morphine, and is currently on several medications including ASA 81mg, protonix, tylenol, heparin subcutaneously three times a day, colace, vitamin D, calcium carbonate, lisinopril 20mg orally daily, tylenol, lopressor 25mg orally three times a day.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure of 139/58mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. However, there is an elevated troponin level of 0.11, indicating potential myocardial injury.

The patient's imaging reveals a clear chest X-ray with no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) on CT scan. The assessment and plan include managing hypoxemia, myocardial infarction, hip fracture, delirium, and ICU care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of right hip fracture. The patient has a history of penicillin allergy, agitation with morphine, and other medical conditions including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/54-139/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of delirium. 

Lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. However, the creatinine level is elevated at 1.1 mg/dL compared to previous readings of 0.8 and 1.0 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels have decreased from 0.11 to 0.07 ng/mL, indicating improvement in myocardial injury. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's imaging studies reveal no pulmonary embolism on CT scan, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of hypoxemia. The patient's CXR shows clear lungs with no evidence of atelectasis or pneumonia. 

Assessment and plan include hypoxemia, myocardial infarction (troponin trending down), hip fracture,"

","The patient is a 90-year-old female admitted with a right hip fracture. She has been in the ICU and her vital signs are stable. She is currently on multiple medications including ASA, protonix, tylenol, heparin, colace, vitamin D, calcium carbonate, lisinopril, tylenol, and lopressor.

Her allergies include penicillins and morphine. The patient has a history of hives with penicillins and agitation with morphine.

The patient's lab results show normal levels for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. However, her troponin levels are slightly elevated, indicating possible myocardial injury. Her blood gases indicate hypoxemia, which may be due to atelectasis or fat embolism.

The patient has been diagnosed with delirium, hypoxemia, acute myocardial infarction, and a hip fracture. She is scheduled for surgery to repair her hip fracture today.

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, cardiac complications due to the ongoing myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, and pressure ulcers."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [**Age over 90**]-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with a right hip fracture. The patient underwent an orthopedic procedure for the hip fracture yesterday. 

24-hour events include being sent to the operating room, invasive ventilation started, received back in the ICU, invasive ventilation stopped, successful right hip repair, transient hypotension to 60/40, dopamine peripheral started, sedation weaned, able to wean dopamine, and successful extubation around midnight.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, causing hives, and agitation with morphine. The last dose of antibiotics given was clindamycin at 08:30 PM on 03/17/2139.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 75 bpm (62-91 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 132/75 mmHg to 90/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (14-34 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,834 mL, including 755 mL through intravenous fluids. The total output was 898 mL, with 220 mL as urine output. The blood products used were 898 mL, and the patient's urine output was 553 mL. The patient received 2,834 mL of intravenous fluids and had a balance of 1,936 mL.

The patient is receiving oxygen through a face tent and mechanical ventilation with settings such as a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 24 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O, and compliance of 33.3 cmH2O/mL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are pending.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not performed, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment also not performed.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.0 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) of 8.3 x 10^9/L, platelet count (Plt) of 168 x 10^9/L, creatinine (Cr) of 1.1 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.11 ng/mL, and blood glucose of 153 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and plan include hypoxemia, myocardial infarction (MI), hip fracture, leukocytosis, fall, delirium, hypertension (HTN), nothing by mouth (NPO), peripheral intravenous (PIV"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction, hip fracture (femoral neck fracture), and hypoxemia. The patient underwent successful repair of the right hip overnight, transiently became hypotensive to 60/40, and received dopamine peripheral. Sedation was weaned, and the patient was extubated around midnight. The patient has allergies to penicillins and morphine, and has received antibiotics, heparin sodium, and other medications as needed. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90-175 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 100%. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels, except for slightly elevated potassium and magnesium. The patient's troponin T level is within normal range, while glucose levels are well controlled. The patient has an upcoming blood culture pending and no significant findings in the urine or stool.

   This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of HTN who presents with a
   right hip fracture.
   .
   Plan:
   .
   #. Hip Fracture: Pt with right femoral neck fracture.  Needs surgery
   and currently optimized medically, cleared for surgery. Pain well
   controlled.  Per the Revised [**Doctor Last Name 8364**] cardiac risk index (RCRI) pt with
   1 risk factor given q-waves on ECG.  By adding a beta-blocker the
   patient's  perioperative rate of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial
   infarction, and nonfatal cardiac arrest is approximately- 0.8 to 1.6%
   (versus 2.2 to 6.6% without a beta-blocker)
   (Auerbach, A, [**Doctor Last Name 8364**], L. Circulation [**2135**]; 113:1361)
   - OR today
   - NPO since midnight
   - heparin sq for ppx
   - continued metoprolol 25mg TID
   - Ca & Vit D
   - Tylenol 1g q8 for pain
   - Dilaudid 0.125mg IV prn (pt with morphine allergy)
 well controlled
   - T&S
   .
   # Hypoxemia / Tachypnea: Improving, likely secondary to atelectasis.
   - Supplemental O2 as needed
   - Not wheezing or requiring bronchodilators, will monitor
   - If fever / worsens, would consider interval chest x-ray
   - Incentive spirometer
   - Reassess after operation if diuresis may help.
   .
   #. Demand Ischemia: Pt with elevated trop of 0.11 on admission and
   repeat, however with CK 233 to 182 and MB 6 -> 6, suggesting demand
   event and does not represent acute thrombus.  Spoke with cardiology who
   recommended no need for heparin.
   -- ASA 81mg daily, ok with ortho
   -- start metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -- no indication for heparin gtt
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Pt with elevated WBC of 13.8 and lactate of 4.2 on
   admission. Currently normalized
   .
   #. Fall: Pt with witnessed fall while walking with nurses aide. No
   history of head trauma and neurologically intact. Likely mechanical
   fall
   .
   #. Delerium: Pt confused and delerious in the setting of her hip
   fracture.  Neuologically intact. No h/o of head trauma with fall.
   -- pain control as above
   -- zydis 2.5mg prn for agitation
   -- consider head CT-scan if neuro exam changes

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of hypertension who presented with a right hip fracture. The patient underwent surgery for the hip repair and was successfully extubated. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and morphine, which caused agitation. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 132/75 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a total fluid input of 2,834 mL and output of 898 mL, with a balance of 1,936 mL. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.8 K/uL, lactate level of 4.2, and troponin-T level of 0.11. The ECG shows q-waves, indicating previous myocardial infarction. 

The assessment and plan include management for hypoxemia, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), hip fracture, leukocytosis, fall, delirium, hypertension, and falls prevention. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypoxemia due to atelectasis or pneumonia, further cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or heart failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pressure ulcers, and delirium or confusion."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of right hip fracture, demand ischemia, and hypoxia. The patient underwent hip fracture repair yesterday and was admitted to the MICU still intubated. She was extubated at midnight and oxygen was weaned off. Initially, the patient was hypotensive post-op, but blood pressure improved after sedation weaning. The patient is currently without complaints, appears comfortable, and states pain is controlled. Her oxygen saturation levels are within normal range.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's hypoxia and previous need for invasive ventilation indicate a risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or further deterioration in lung function.

2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes suggest a potential demand ischemia or underlying cardiac issues. This increases the risk of cardiovascular complications such as heart attack, arrhythmias, or heart failure.

3. Thromboembolic complications: As the patient has undergone surgery, she is at increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures such as LMW heparin and boots are being taken, but close monitoring for signs of thrombosis is important.

4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly in the postoperative period. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased white"

","The patient's chief complaint is hypoxia. The patient is currently receiving invasive ventilation support, which was started on 03/17/2139 at 06:37 PM and stopped on 03/18/2139 at 12:32 AM. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/66 to 175/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and morphine, resulting in hives and agitation respectively. The patient is currently on several medications, including clindamycin, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), vitamin D, calcium carbonate, lisinopril, docusate, and Tylenol. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory system, where there are decreased breath sounds anteriorly. The flow sheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 2,834 mL of fluids since admission, with a balance of 1,936 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 24 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 100% with the use of a nasal cannula. 

The patient's lab results show a hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL, leukocyte count of 163 K/uL, blood glucose level of 153 mg/dL, sodium level of 0.9 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T level is within normal range at 0.11 ng/mL. 

The patient's imaging includes a reviewed chest X-ray from yesterday. 

The patient's assessment includes hypoxemia, which has improved to 97% on room air, and demand ischemia preoperatively. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for a hip fracture and is doing well. The plan is to discuss physical therapy and weightbearing status with orthopedics. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and lines are being managed appropriately. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers are also being provided. 

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the disposition is planned to be transferred to the floor. The total time spent with the patient is 30 minutes."
