   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   - family meeting as condition unlikely to improve and pt can not stay
   on pressors idefinitely
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.4, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Currently resolved and in sinus rhythm.  Given his
   multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly that benefits outweigh
   risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with subQ heparin
   -Pain management with tylenol prn
   # CODE: Confirmed full
   # COMM:  with daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 14322**] (HCP):  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14323**]
   # DISPO: CCU for now

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14262**] today.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Known severe amyloidosis involving bowel, myocardium, kidneys.    This
   has resulted in refractory edema and very low cardiac outputs.   He is
   hypotensive but mentating well.
   Medical Decision Making
   After extensive discussion with the family and the patient, he will be
   made DNR/DNI due to the poor prognosis of his disease.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 1914**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7145**], MD
   on:[**2120-2-22**] 20:41 ------
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of severe amyloidosis affecting the bowel, myocardium, and kidneys. He presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload. The patient has diastolic heart failure and chronic kidney disease. The patient's prognosis is poor due to cardiac and suspected renal involvement, as well as a possible plasma cell dyscrasia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can result in the buildup of waste products in the body and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Volume overload: The patient has fluid accumulation, which can lead to pulmonary edema and other complications related to congestive heart failure.
4. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's heart is affected by amyloid infiltration, leading to diastolic heart failure. This can result in reduced cardiac output and symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue.
5. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's kidneys are compromised, potentially leading to further decline in renal function and the need for dialysis.
6. Possible plasma cell dyscrasia: The presence of a monoclonal Ig spike raises suspicion for this condition, which can have a poor prognosis and require specific treatment.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is essential to consult"

   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.2, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Meets criteria for PPM, but we really need to
   address big picture, ie. HD stability first
 refractory hypotension
   now on pressors. CHADS score is [**11-25**] depending on whether age ought to
   be counted.  Given his multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly
   that benefits outweigh risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease, diastolic heart failure, and recently diagnosed amyloidosis. He presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload. The patient has multiple comorbidities including COPD, h/o alcohol abuse, iron deficiency anemia, and dyslipidemia. He is currently on norepinephrine and has been unresponsive to fluid bolus. The patient's prognosis is poor due to cardiac and renal involvement, as well as a suspected plasma cell dyscrasia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension, which may be due to amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium, as well as worsened cardiac function in the context of fluid overload. There is also a possibility of hypovolemia (intravascular depletion) due to poor PO intake and excessive thirst.
2. Acute Renal Failure on chronic kidney disease: The patient's current creatinine level is elevated, and there is evidence of poor perfusion and amyloid disease. Previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemic injury, or plasma cell dyscrasia, could also contribute to the renal failure.
3. Amyloidosis and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia: The patient has a monoclonal Ig spike, which raises suspicion for possible plasma cell dyscrasia. Given the cardiac and suspected renal involvement, the prognosis is very"

   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and recently diagnosed amyloidosis. He presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload. His current medications include norepinephrine, other ICU medications, and ASA. The patient's EKG shows atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block, and his 2D echocardiogram reveals mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal cavity size, and regional/global systolic function with an estimated ejection fraction greater than 55%. The patient also has a large left pleural effusion, trace aortic regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiogenic shock: Due to worsening cardiac function and fluid overload.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, and there are signs of renal dysfunction.
3. Amyloidosis-related complications: The patient has recently been diagnosed with amyloidosis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he may require ongoing vasopressor support.
5. Infection: Although no fever or leukocytosis is present, the patient is at risk for infections due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay.
6. Arrhythmias: The patient's EKG shows atrial fibrillation and sinus"

   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.2, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Meets criteria for PPM, but we really need to
   address big picture, ie. HD stability first
 refractory hypotension
   now on pressors. CHADS score is [**11-25**] depending on whether age ought to
   be counted.  Given his multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly
   that benefits outweigh risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with subQ heparin
   -Pain management with tylenol prn
   # CODE: Confirmed full
   # COMM:  with daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 14322**] (HCP):  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14323**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of diastolic heart failure and chronic kidney disease, recently diagnosed with amyloidosis. He presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload. The potential medical complications that can arise from his current condition include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and evidence of worsening cardiac function suggest that he may be at risk for cardiogenic shock. This is further supported by the presence of elevated troponin levels.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's current creatinine level of 4.2 is higher than his baseline of 2.5-2.9, indicating acute renal failure. The underlying cause could be hypoperfusion due to hypotension, as well as the possible contribution of amyloid infiltration of the kidneys.

3. Volume overload: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, poor air movement at the bases, and diffuse swelling in the arms and legs with pitting edema suggest fluid overload. This could be due to the administration of fluids and the inability to adequately excrete the excess volume.

4. Amyloidosis-related complications: The patient has recently been diagnosed with amyloidosis, which can affect multiple organ systems. Complications related to amyloid infiltration of the heart, kidneys, and other organs may occur.

5. Infection: Despite the absence of fever and leukocytosis,"

   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.2, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Meets criteria for PPM, but we really need to
   address big picture, ie. HD stability first
 refractory hypotension
   now on pressors. CHADS score is [**11-25**] depending on whether age ought to
   be counted.  Given his multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly
   that benefits outweigh risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with subQ heparin
   -Pain management with tylenol prn

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of diastolic heart failure and chronic kidney disease, recently diagnosed with amyloidosis. He presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload. The patient's vitals show tachycardia, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals cachectic appearance, temporal wasting, no signs of jaundice, and a jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 4-30 cm. The patient has irregularly irregular heart rhythm, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and no murmurs. Lung examination shows poor air movement at the bases with some diffuse lower crackles. Abdominal examination reveals mild tenderness at the site of a recent fat pad biopsy. The patient has diffuse swelling in his arms and legs with pitting edema, cool feet, and difficult-to-palpate pulses. Neurological examination is normal.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels. Electrolyte imbalances are present with high sodium and chloride levels, low bicarbonate and magnesium levels. Other lab results indicate elevated troponin T and lactic acid levels, as well as abnormal cardiac enzymes. Imaging studies"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with diastolic heart failure and chronic kidney disease, recently diagnosed with amyloidosis. He presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload. The patient has been on vasopressin and attempted norepinephrine but became tachycardic. He is currently experiencing anuria and has poor prognosis due to cardiac and renal involvement, as well as possible plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient's goals are to be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible, and his code status has been changed to DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is worsening despite being on vasopressin. Augmenting peripheral pressors and monitoring for signs of tachycardia and arrhythmia may be necessary.

2. Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease: The patient's acute renal failure is attributed to amyloid or plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient is intravascularly depleted while being volume overloaded, making management of renal failure challenging.

3. Amyloid and concern for plasma cell dyscrasia: Poor prognosis is expected due to cardiac and suspected renal involvement. Monitoring for further complications related to these conditions is essential.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has been intermittently in AFib, and monitoring the rate and continuing ASA may be necessary.

   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension:
   Heart failure, intravascular depletion and tissue edema. Has been
   worsening on one pressor
 vasopressin 2.4 overnight. Attempted
   norepinephrine, but patient became tachycardic.

 increase midodrine to 15 mg TID and
   start phenylephrine
 watch for signs of tachycardia and arrhythmia.
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Now intravascularly depleted while very volume overloaded. Failure
   worsens as patient has become anuric. Attributed to amyloid or plasma
   cell dyscrasia.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia:
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike.
   - have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible. In
   conjunction with family, goals may change today

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] today.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Known severe amyloidosis involving bowel, myocardium, kidneys.    This
   has resulted in refractory edema and very low cardiac outputs.   His
   condition continues to deteriorate.
   Medical Decision Making
   He will be continued on DNR/DNI due to the poor prognosis of his
   disease.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis. He presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload. 

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing worsening hypotension despite being on vasopressin. This may be due to heart failure, intravascular depletion, and tissue edema. There is a plan to augment peripheral pressors and increase midodrine to 15 mg TID while monitoring for signs of tachycardia and arrhythmia.

2. Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease: The patient is intravascularly depleted while being volume overloaded. He has become anuric, indicating a severe decrease in urine output. This renal failure is attributed to amyloidosis or plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient's prognosis is poor due to cardiac and suspected renal involvement.

3. Amyloid and concern for plasma cell dyscrasia: The patient has a monoclonal Ig spike, which raises suspicion for possible plasma cell dyscrasia. This is a type of blood cancer that can cause multiple myeloma or related conditions.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has intermittent atrial fibrillation, which needs to be monitored and managed to control the heart rate.

5. Chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient is an"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension:
   Felt to be due to autonomic dysfunction and inappropriate
   vasodilation.  Note that he often had episodes of hypotension with SBPs
   in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He endorses poor PO intake
   and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there may be a component of
   hypovolemia.  No fevers, leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an
   infection.  Cardiogenic shock unlikely unless he suffered new insult,
   and although his troponin is elevated, this is in the setting of
   worsening renal failure.  His EKG does not show evidence of new
   ischemia and he denies chest pain.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - wean norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease:  current Cr 4.2,
   baseline Cr 2.5-2.9:
   Likely due to poor renal perfusion in setting of hypotension
   superimposed on progressively worsening renal dysfunction that has been
   attributed to amyloid or plasma cell dyscrasia.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - will contact renal in AM for assistance with spinning urine
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia:
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike.
   - will contact [**Name (NI) **]/Onc in AM regarding possibility of inpatient BM
   biopsy
   - have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear upon review of discharge summary if
   team was aware that he had been in AFib during recent hospital stay.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and recently diagnosed amyloidosis. He presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload. His current medications include vasopressin, heparin sodium, and dextrose 50%. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), blood pressure ranging from 67/38 mmHg to 96/57 mmHg, heart rate of 63 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals cachexia, temporal wasting, scleral icterus, and bilateral pitting edema. Laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. The patient's ECG shows no new changes, and his blood cultures are negative. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple comorbidities, including amyloidosis, chronic kidney disease, and possible plasma cell dyscrasia. He has poor prognosis due to cardiac and renal involvement. The patient has chosen a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status and wishes to return home with consideration of home hospice care. Potential medical complications that can arise include hypotension, acute renal failure, volume overload, atrial fibrillation, chronic diast"
