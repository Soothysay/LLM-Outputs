","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acetaminophen toxicity after a suicide attempt. His Tylenol level is elevated, but trending down. He has negative urine and serum tox screen for other substances. Lactate levels are decreasing, but INR and liver function tests (LFTs) continue to rise. The patient's condition is concerning for acute hepatic injury and possible liver failure. He requires high-dose IV N-acetylcysteine infusion, close monitoring of LFTs, electrolytes, coagulation profile, and lactate every six hours. A workup for possible liver transplant is being initiated, including hepatitis A, B, C serologies, thyroid function tests, CMV IgG/IgM Ab panel, EBV Ab, AFP, CA-19-9, PSA, herpes 1 & 2 IgG, CEA, RPR, ECG, and Echo. The patient's psychiatric history includes a recent suicidal attempt. He has an open laceration above his right eye, for which he received a tetanus shot in the emergency department. His code status is full code, and he is currently dispositioned to the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute liver failure: The patient's elevated INR, rising LFTs, and acetaminophen toxicity indicate a potential for acute liver failure. This condition can lead to hepatic encephalopathy,"

Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, except for a laceration above the right eye, which was not closed in the emergency department. 

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated total white blood cell count, prolonged prothrombin time/INR, and slightly low potassium levels. The acetaminophen level at 2:35 pm was 272, and the level at 6 pm was 175. Urine and serum toxic screens are otherwise negative. Lactate levels are trending down.

The patient is currently receiving aggressive supportive care in the ICU, including IV fluids, antiemetics, and close monitoring of liver function tests, electrolytes, coagulation profile, and lactate levels every 4-6 hours.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old male who presents with acetaminophen toxicity after a suicide attempt. The patient admitted to possibly ingesting Tylenol around 10:30 pm. Tylenol levels were measured at different times and showed decreasing concentrations (272 at 2:35 pm, 175 at 6 pm, and 75 at 4 am). Urine and serum toxicology screens were negative except for acetaminophen. The patient's lactate levels are trending down, but the INR is elevated at 2.3, and liver function tests (LFTs) continue to rise. The patient is being consulted by toxicology, hepatology, and transplant specialists. 

The assessment and plan include high-dose IV N-acetylcysteine infusion for acetaminophen toxicity, close monitoring of LFTs, electrolytes, coagulation profile, and lactate every six hours. The patient is also being evaluated for possible liver transplantation, including hepatitis A, B, and C serologies, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG/IgM antibody panel, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), herpes simplex virus 1 & 2 IgG, carcinoembryonic antigen"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 20-year-old male who presented with acetaminophen toxicity after a suicide attempt. The patient ingested Tylenol around 10:30 pm, and subsequent blood tests showed decreasing levels of acetaminophen in the serum and urine. Other toxicology screens were negative. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs), lactate, and liver fraction (LFT) levels are trending down. 

The patient has been started on IV N-acetylcysteine infusion for acetaminophen toxicity and will continue it until the acetaminophen level becomes undetectable. LFTs, electrolytes, coagulation profiles, and lactate levels will be monitored every 6 hours. 

The patient is also being evaluated for possible liver transplantation, including hepatitis A, B, and C serologies, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG/IgM antibody panel, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), herpes simplex virus 1 & 2 IgG, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), rapid plasma reagin (RPR) with syphilis testing, electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiogram (Echo). 

Additionally, the patient's diet will be advanced to clear liquids and then a full diet if tolerated, with close monitoring of liver function. The patient will also undergo psych evaluation due to a suicidal attempt and will require psychiatric hospitalization after resolving medical issues. A 1:1 sitter will be provided for constant supervision. 

The patient has a laceration above the right eye, which was not closed in the emergency department. The patient received a tetanus shot and does not show any signs of infection. 

The patient's current medications include IV N-acetylcysteine, pantoprazole (Protonix), and prophylactic medications such as pneumococcal vaccine, penicillin, and H2 blocker. The patient's code status is full code, and the current disposition is in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   20 year old gentleman presents with acetaminophen toxicity after a
   suicide attempt.
   .
   # Tylenol OD/ Acute Hepatic Injury:  Time of ingestion around 10:30pm.
   Tylenol level at 2:35 pm 272, 6 pm 175, 75 at 4AM.  Tylenol level
   negative today. Urine and serum tox screen is otherwise negative.
   Lactate and LFts, INR all  trending down. Bilirubin had bumped slightly
   overnight but back down again.  Toxicology, Hepatology neurosurgery and
   Transplant on board. Creatinine trending up last 48 hours as discussed
   below.  Also monitoring for benadryl toxicity with ECGs and has not had
   any evidence of anticholinergic toxicity. Pt also without complaints of
   abdominal pain, vomiting, although did have some nausea overnight. Has
   been normoglycemic off D10 without e/o impaired gluconeogenesis
   - Continuing IV N-acetylcysteine, 17 mg/kg/hr infusion, will consider
   d/c since acetaminophen level undetectable and tox recommended 24 more
   hours. Also, NAC not known to help with renal failure associated with
   Tylenol OD
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lytes, coags, lactate q 6 hours
   - Started w/u for possible transplant including hepatitis A,B,C
   serologies, TSH; CMV IgG/IgM Ab panel; EBV Ab; AFP, CA [**80**]-9; PSA;
   Herpes 1 & 2 IgG ; CEA; RPR (STS); ECG , Echo, transplant social work
   - has not met  any Kings College Criteria for transplant, include
   acidosis (pH < 7.3), PT >100 (INR > 6), Cr>3.7, hepatic encephalopathy
   grade [**3-28**]
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u recs from transplant, hepatology, neurosurg
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Pt with continued steady rise in creatinine last
   48 hours. Fena 1.2 so mixed picture. Tried 500cc bolus yesterday which
   did not seem to do much. Has had adequate UOP, 30-50cc/hour. Since NPO,
   may be dry and prerenal azoetmia component but likely from Tylenol OD
   (renal impairment usually occurs at 48-72 hours) from direct
   toxicity/ATN picture.
   -          Maintenance fluids while NPO
   -          Follow Cr, UOP, bolus for UOP<30cc/hr
   .
   #  Suicidal attempt.
   - Psych consulted
   - cont 1:1 sitter
   - will need psych hospitalization after medical issues resolve
   .
   # Laceration above right eye:  Not closed in ED given given length of
   time wound remained open
   - received tetanus shot in ED
   - no s/s infection
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now; replete lytes prn and will advance diet to clears
   if ok with hepatology and transplant
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPi (can d/c if tolerates PO intake)

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old male who presented with acetaminophen toxicity after a suicide attempt. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his condition.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 38.1 C (100.6 F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/66 to 152/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT), increased bilirubin levels, and rising creatinine levels, indicating possible hepatic injury and acute renal failure. The acetaminophen level is undetectable, suggesting that the patient is no longer experiencing toxicity from acetaminophen overdose. However, the patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels.

The patient has been started on IV N-acetylcysteine infusion to prevent further liver damage, and it is recommended to continue this treatment for another 24 hours. The patient's LFTs, electrolytes, coagulation profile, and lactate levels are being monitored every 6 hours.

The patient is also being evaluated for possible organ transplantation, including hepatitis A, B, and C serologies, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), cytomegalov"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the laboratory results, there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The rising creatinine levels indicate a decline in kidney function, which may be due to dehydration or other factors. Close monitoring of fluid balance and urine output is necessary.

2. Hepatic dysfunction: Elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT) suggest liver injury or damage. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.

3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, such as low potassium (K+), low sodium (Na+), and high chloride (Cl-), require attention and correction to maintain electrolyte balance.

4. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels may indicate an infection. Cultures should be obtained to identify the causative organism, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated.

5. Coagulation abnormalities: Prolonged PT/INR values indicate impaired blood clotting function. This may increase the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring and appropriate coagulation factor replacement may be necessary.

6. Cardiovascular instability: The fluctuating blood pressure readings suggest episodes of hypotension or hypertension. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic status is crucial to ensure adequate organ perfusion.

7. Respiratory compromise: Although the patient"

   # Tylenol OD/ Acute Hepatic Injury:  Time of ingestion around 10:30pm.
   Tylenol level at 2:35 pm 272, 6 pm 175, 75 at 4AM.  Tylenol level
   negative today. Urine and serum tox screen is otherwise negative.
   Lactate and LFts, INR all  trending down. Bilirubin had bumped slightly
   overnight but back down again.  Toxicology, Hepatology neurosurgery and
   Transplant on board. Creatinine trending up last 48 hours as discussed
   below.  Also monitoring for benadryl toxicity with ECGs and has not had
   any evidence of anticholinergic toxicity. Pt also without complaints of
   abdominal pain, vomiting, although did have some nausea overnight. Has
   been normoglycemic off D10 without e/o impaired gluconeogenesis
   - Continuing IV N-acetylcysteine, 17 mg/kg/hr infusion, will consider
   d/c since acetaminophen level undetectable and tox recommended 24 more
   hours. Also, NAC not known to help with renal failure associated with
   Tylenol OD
   - Continue to trend LFTs, lytes, coags, lactate q 6 hours
   - Started w/u for possible transplant including hepatitis A,B,C
   serologies, TSH; CMV IgG/IgM Ab panel; EBV Ab; AFP, CA [**80**]-9; PSA;

   acidosis (pH < 7.3), PT >100 (INR > 6), Cr>3.7, hepatic encephalopathy
   grade [**3-28**]
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u recs from transplant, hepatology, neurosurg
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Pt with continued steady rise in creatinine last
   48 hours. Fena 1.2 so mixed picture. Tried 500cc bolus yesterday which
   did not seem to do much. Has had adequate UOP, 30-50cc/hour. Since NPO,
   may be dry and prerenal azoetmia component but likely from Tylenol OD
   (renal impairment usually occurs at 48-72 hours) from direct
   toxicity/ATN picture.
   -          Maintenance fluids while NPO
   -          Follow Cr, UOP, bolus for UOP<30cc/hr
   .
   # Low grade fever: had isolated fever spike but afebrile currently, not
   cultured since not aware of fever overnight. Lungs clear. Possible
   source of infection includes foley. Will remove foley since good UOP,
   and get U/A and cx. Lungs clear. No lines or other source infection but
   could consider CXR if develops symptoms.
   - Remove foley
   - Check U/A and urine cx
   - CIS

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 20-year-old male who presented with acetaminophen toxicity after a suicide attempt.
- He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently showing signs of improvement, with decreasing liver function tests (LFTs), improving international normalized ratio (INR), and negative acetaminophen levels.
- However, the patient's creatinine levels are trending upwards, indicating a potential rise in kidney function.
- The patient's bilirubin levels have slightly increased but then decreased again.
- He has a low-grade fever, but no other sources of infection have been identified.
- The patient attempted suicide and is at risk for further self-harm. Psychiatric consultation has been requested.
- The patient has a laceration above his right eye, which was not closed in the emergency department. He received a tetanus shot.
- The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) at the moment and will be advanced to clear liquids if tolerated, with the approval of hepatology and transplant.
- The patient's family has been informed of his condition, and code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's continued rise in creatinine levels suggests a potential development of acute renal failure. This could be due to direct renal toxicity from acetaminophen overdose or pre-renal azotemia caused by dehydration.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: As the patient's liver function continues"
