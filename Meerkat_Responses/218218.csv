","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure, shock, and fever. He is suspected to have pneumonia (pna) and sepsis, although the acuity and prodrome are not entirely consistent. The patient has a history of morbid obesity and obesity hypoventilation, which may have contributed to his respiratory failure. He also has an underlying risk factor for pulmonary embolism (pe), and further investigation is needed to rule out this possibility. The patient has been treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation and has had multiple lines placed, including an arterial line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia (pna): Given the patient's symptoms and risk factors, pneumonia is a likely complication. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started to cover potential pathogens.
2. Sepsis: The patient's presentation suggests sepsis, which is a systemic inflammatory response to infection. Immediate management includes source control and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Pulmonary embolism (pe): The patient's immobilization and underlying risk factors raise concern for a pe. Although the initial CT angiogram was negative, further investigation with lower extremity Doppler ultrasound (LENS) and empirical anticoagulation should be considered.
4. Cardiogenic shock: The presence of right ventricular strain on the EKG and ST depression raises the possibility of cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring and aggressive"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old with hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure, shock, and fever. Possible sources of infection include the left leg, pneumonia, and abdominal infection. The patient requires a high level of ventilatory support and is receiving low tidal volume ventilation. Despite a negative computed tomography angiography (CTA), heparin infusion has been continued due to clinical suspicion of thromboembolism. The patient is being treated for septic shock with vancomycin and zosyn, and additional imaging studies such as CT of the lower extremity (LE) and abdomen are planned. Clindamycin has been added to the treatment regimen. Pressors are being administered as needed. The patient's condition is critically ill, and they remain in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require a high level of ventilatory support, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. Complications may include further deterioration in oxygenation, increased carbon dioxide levels, and potential lung injury due to ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI).

2. Thromboembolism: Although the CTA was negative, clinical suspicion of thromboembolism persists, leading to the continuation of heparin infusion. This suggests the possibility of a pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Complications may include worsening shock, pulmonary hypertension, or even massive pulmonary embolism leading to"

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 51M with HTN, OSA, morbid obesity now
   with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and fever
   with leukocytosis and bandemia.
   #  Hypoxic Hypercarbic Respiratory failure: Pt admitted with acute
   onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of left
   leg pain and fever which is concerning for PE vs infection/PNA. Acuity,
   low grade fevers, ECG, tachycardia all consistent with PE, however, no
   large PE seen on CTA, no LE DVT on prelim, and no RV strain on echo
   which would expect based on current hemodynamics. Fever to 104 also
   atypical for PE.
   - d/c Heparin gtt; f/u final CTA/ US read
   - empiric abx for now given likely aspiration, possible PNA, although
   more likely acute pneumonitis
   - ABGs after vent changes as has been stable
   - wean to PSV today
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely related to sepsis vs cardiogenic shock as above.
   MAPs currently 60s off of pressors.  CVP at 13.
   - maintain peripheral access
   - IVF boluses prn, can add back neo if needed
   - CEs negative X3
   - hold home antihypertensives
   - TTE showed increased EF,  Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   #  Fever, leukocytosis: Fever and leukocytosis with bandemia suggest
   acute onset of infection, however no obvious source other than
   pulmonary vs skin/soft tissue. Would expect to have more subacute
   presentation with ongoing infection rather than acute decompensation
   over hours but fever to 104 and bandemia suggest infectious process.
   Intraabdominal process also concerning given tenderness on exam however
   improved today and prelim negative CT.
   - good response to antibioitics
   - continue (Vanco/Zosyn D1 [**8-19**]) for now guided toward pneumonia vs
   skin infection in pt recently on antibiotics as well as covering
   anaerobes given possible aspiration with zosyn; consider d/c Zosyn
   given sputum and blood ctxs and narrow as appropriately after speciated
   - monitor skin/soft tissue, left leg for signs of infection
   - f/u peripheral smear
   - call radiology to be sure got CT of foot and is not osteo.

   # ECG changes: Pt has lateral ST depressions when tachycardic likely
   demand related ischemia since have resolved with rate improvement. Also

   Disposition: ICU pending extubation/BP stabilization
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He was admitted with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and fever, along with leg pain. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, which indicates a severe impairment in oxygenation and ventilation. This could be due to pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), or aspiration.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia suggest an infectious process. The presence of patchy areas of alveolar infiltrate on the chest X-ray may represent fluid overload or pneumonia. Empiric antibiotics have been started to cover possible aspiration pneumonia.

3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's symptoms of leg pain and fever raise suspicion for PE. However, the CT angiography (CTA) did not show any large PE, and the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed no right ventricular strain. Further evaluation is needed to confirm or rule out PE.

4. Sepsis: The patient's systemic inflammatory response, characterized by fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia, along with the presence of pneumonia or skin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He was admitted with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and fever. The patient has leukocytosis and bandemia, suggesting an acute onset of infection. There is concern for pulmonary embolism (PE) versus infection/pneumonia. The patient's condition is complicated by impaired skin integrity, pneumonia, acute PE, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, indicating a potential complication related to his respiratory system.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has erythema, warmth, and purulent discharge from the right first toe, which suggests a potential skin infection.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia, are consistent with a possible pneumonia diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of fever to 104°F and atypical for PE raises concerns for an infectious process, including aspiration pneumonia.
4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings are suggestive of a possible PE. Although no large PE was seen on the CT angiogram, and no left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was detected on the preliminary read, there is still a concern for PE due to the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 51M with HTN, OSA, morbid obesity now
   with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and fever
   with leukocytosis and bandemia.
   #  Hypoxic Hypercarbic Respiratory failure: Pt admitted with acute
   onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of left
   leg pain and fever which is concerning for PE vs infection/PNA. Acuity,
   low grade fevers, ECG, tachycardia all consistent with PE, however, no
   large PE seen on CTA, no LE DVT on prelim, and no RV strain on echo
   which would expect based on current hemodynamics. Fever to 104 also
   atypical for PE.
   - heparin gtt for empiric PE/DVT while awaiting final reads on CTA, U/S
   - empiric abx for now given likely aspiration, possible PNA, although
   more likely acute pneumonitis
   - ABGs after vent changes as has been stable
   - increase PEEP as BP tolerates
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely related to sepsis vs cardiogenic shock as above.
   MAPs currently 60s off of pressors.  CVP at 13.
   - maintain peripheral access
   - IVF boluses prn, can add back neo if needed
   - CEs negative X3
   - hold home antihypertensives
   - TTE showed increased EF,  Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   #  Fever, leukocytosis: Fever and leukocytosis with bandemia suggest
   acute onset of infection, however no obvious source other than
   pulmonary vs skin/soft tissue. Would expect to have more subacute
   presentation with ongoing infection rather than acute decompensation
   over hours but fever to 104 and bandemia suggest infectious process.
   Intraabdominal process also concerning given tenderness one xam but
   would be tenuous for travel.
   - good response to antibioitics
   - continue (Vanco/Zosyn) for now guided toward pneumonia vs skin
   infection in pt recently on antibiotics as well as covering anaerobes
   given possible aspiration with zosyn
   - monitor skin/soft tissue, left leg for signs of infection
   - check amylase, lipase, LFTS for other possible sources given nausea
   and vomiting
   - peripheral smear given leukocytosis
   - serial lacate
   - rapid resp viral panel and r/o flu given high fever, acute onset
   - consider abd imaging given tenderness on exam
   - consider CT abd to eval for intrabd process
   .
   #  Hyperglycemia: Likely related to infection
   - HISS
   .
   # ECG changes: Pt has lateral ST depressions when tachycardic likely
   demand related ischemia since have resolved with rate improvement. Also
   has evidence of right heart strain which may be chronic due to OSA and
   ? pulm HTN
   - consider cards consult
   - monitor ECG changes and tele
   - monitor ECG when rate more well controlled

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. 
- He presented with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, fever, and leukocytosis with bandemia.
- Possible diagnoses include respiratory failure, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and impaired skin integrity.
- The patient has been receiving empiric antibiotics, systemic anticoagulation for suspected PE/DVT, and supportive care in the ICU.
- Imaging and microbiology results are pending.
- The patient's condition is stable but still requires close monitoring and further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure. This condition can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation if not managed properly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may have aspiration pneumonia due to his obesity and risk factors. This could progress to severe infection if not appropriately treated.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the initial CT angiogram did not show large PE, there is still a possibility of a smaller embolism or a developing clot. This can lead to further respiratory compromise and potentially circulatory collapse.
4. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia suggest an infectious process. If not managed promptly, this could progress to se"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia caused by aspiration. The patient also has bacteremia with GPC. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia specifically associated with the use of the ventilator.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of blood clots forming in the deep veins of the legs, which can then travel to the lungs causing a potentially life-threatening pulmonary embolism.
3. Sepsis: The patient already has bacteremia with GPC, and if not properly managed, it can lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The presence of bullous/erythematous lesions on the left shin indicates impaired skin integrity, which can be a result of prolonged immobility, poor circulation, or pressure sores.
5. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk of developing stress ulcers due to increased gastric acid secretion. Prophylaxis with H2 blockers is recommended to prevent this complication.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, GPC bacteremia, and septic shock. The patient has been sedated and intubated, requiring mechanical ventilation. He has a fever and positive blood cultures. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is critically ill. There are concerns about potential sources of infection, including a leg infection, pneumonia, or abdominal infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated and on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia as a hospital-acquired infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of blood clots in the deep veins of the legs, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.
3. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, and there is a possibility of further deterioration if the infection spreads or if the antibiotics are not effective.
4. Multi-organ dysfunction: In severe cases of sepsis and septic shock, multiple organs can fail, leading to complications such as acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or hepatic dysfunction.
5. Nosocomial infections: Given the prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of acquiring additional hospital-acquired infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or pressure ulcers."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity.
- He was admitted with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and fever.
- The patient has leukocytosis and bandemia, which suggests an acute infection.
- Initial assessment included respiratory failure, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), and sepsis without organ dysfunction.
- The patient's condition improved with the removal of heparin, initiation of antibiotics, and changes in ventilator settings.
- Imaging studies revealed no evidence of osteomyelitis in the left great toe.
- The patient's ECG showed resolution of prior ST depressions.
- The patient has been receiving tube feeds, and his glucose levels have been managed with insulin.
- The patient's blood cultures are pending.
- The patient's condition remains stable, but he continues to require intensive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and fever suggest an underlying lung infection. It is important to continue monitoring his oxygenation, chest x-rays, and sputum cultures to guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's presentation of fever, leukocytosis, and hypoxic respiratory failure raises concerns for a possible PE. Further evaluation with CT pulmonary angiography or V/Q scan may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
3. Sepsis:"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He was admitted with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, fever, and leukocytosis with bandemia. The initial assessment included respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, pneumonia aspiration, pulmonary embolism, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. 

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to either a pulmonary embolism or infection/pneumonia. Despite the low-grade fevers, ECG changes, and tachycardia, which are consistent with a pulmonary embolism, no large embolism was seen on computed tomography angiography (CTA), no lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was detected, and no right ventricular strain was observed on echocardiogram. 

The patient's fever reached 104°F, which is atypical for a pulmonary embolism. Therefore, it is more likely that the patient has pneumonia aspiration with acute pneumonitis, especially given the presence of fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia. Empiric antibiotics were started to cover likely aspiration, possible pneumonia, although acute pneumonitis is more likely.

The patient's hypotension is likely related to sepsis versus cardiogenic shock. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) is currently in the 60s off of pressors, and the central venous pressure (CVP"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old male with respiratory failure and GPC bacteremia due to septic shock. The source of infection is most likely cellulitis, and there is no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis or gas-forming organisms. The patient's condition has improved, with the resolution of shock.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Development of antibiotic resistance: Prolonged use of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It is important to monitor the effectiveness of the current antibiotics and consider changing them if necessary.

2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's respiratory failure indicates compromised lung function. Close monitoring of vital signs and respiratory parameters is crucial to prevent further deterioration of respiratory status.

3. Nosocomial infections: Given the patient's prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures such as mechanical ventilation and arterial lines, there is a risk of acquiring nosocomial infections. Proper infection control measures should be followed to minimize this risk.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness are risk factors for DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as boots and subcutaneous heparin should be continued to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events.

5. Tracheostomy complications: If the patient requires a tracheostomy due to challenging intubation, potential complications include bleeding, tracheal st"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with respiratory failure and GPC bacteremia caused by septic shock. The source of bacteremia is most likely from cellulitis. The patient's current condition shows that the shock has been resolved, and he is being kept on the current antibiotics while awaiting speciation and sensitivities.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: Although there is currently no microbiologic source, pneumonia is still a possibility and should be monitored for.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's critical condition makes him at risk for endocarditis, which should also be monitored.
3. Tracheostomy: Considering the challenging intubation and the patient's habitus, the physician suggests considering an early tracheostomy if the patient's progress warrants it.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility, and prophylaxis measures such as boots and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin are in place.
5. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to his critical illness, and prophylaxis measures should be maintained.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP, and measures such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls are being implemented to reduce the risk.

 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 51M with HTN, OSA, morbid obesity now
   with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and fever
   with leukocytosis and bandemia.
   #  Hypoxic Hypercarbic Respiratory failure: Pt admitted with acute
   onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of left
   leg pain and fever which is concerning for PE vs infection/PNA. Acuity,
   low grade fevers, ECG, tachycardia all consistent with PE, however, no
   large PE seen on CTA, no LE DVT on prelim, and no RV strain on echo
   which would expect based on current hemodynamics. Fever to 104 also
   atypical for PE.
   - Required aggresive suctioning o/n with desats on 100%FiO2, likely due
   to mucus plugs.  Plan to bronch today to both clear plugs and retrieve
   cx.
   -attempt to switch to PSV  and wean through day as pt tolerates, with
   goal PSV 12/8 for the day.
   - currently on clinda and unasyn, not covered for VAP.
   #  Fever, leukocytosis: Fever and leukocytosis with bandemia suggest
   acute onset of infection, however no obvious source other than
   pulmonary vs skin/soft tissue. Would expect to have more subacute
   presentation with ongoing infection rather than acute decompensation
   over hours but fever to 104 and bandemia suggest infectious process.
   Intraabdominal process also concerning given tenderness on exam however
   improved today and prelim negative CT.
   - Unasyn for strep spp cultured from blood.  No VAP coverage.
   - monitor skin/soft tissue, left leg for signs of infection-marked
   today
   - f/u peripheral smear pending
   -call home podiatrist for cx and sensitivities from R great toe
   parnychial cx.
   #Access-PICC palced yesterday not in correct position
   -IR this AM for PICC repositioning
   -continue using triple lumen until PICC suitable for use.
   #  Hyperglycemia: controlled on HISS.
   - HISS
   # Hypotension: Likely related to sepsis vs cardiogenic shock as above.
   MAPs currently 60s off of pressors.  CVP at 13.
   - maintain peripheral access
   - IVF boluses prn, can add back neo if needed
   - CEs negative X3
   - hold home antihypertensives
   - TTE showed increased EF,  Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   # ECG changes: Pt has lateral ST depressions when tachycardic likely
   demand related ischemia since have resolved with rate improvement. Also
   has evidence of right heart strain which may be chronic due to OSA and
   ? pulm HTN
   - consider cards consult if not improved
   - tachycardia unclear etiology

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He was admitted with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia. The patient's condition suggests the possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE), infection, or pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, which indicates difficulty in breathing and inadequate oxygenation. This can be a life-threatening condition if not managed properly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been experiencing fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia, which are suggestive of an infection. Since there are no obvious sources of infection, pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia should be considered as potential complications.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient presented with symptoms such as left leg pain, fever, and low-grade fevers. These symptoms are concerning for PE, although no large PE was seen on computed tomography angiography (CTA). The patient's tachycardia and elevated troponin levels also raise concerns for PE.
4. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia suggest an acute onset of infection. The lack of an obvious source of infection indicates the possibility of sepsis or an intra-abdominal process.

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He was admitted with acute onset hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia. The patient requires aggressive suctioning due to mucus plugs and has been placed on mechanical ventilation. There is suspicion for aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary embolism.

 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 51M with HTN, OSA, morbid obesity now
   with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and fever
   with leukocytosis and bandemia.
   #  Hypoxic Hypercarbic Respiratory failure: Pt admitted with acute
   onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of left
   leg pain and fever which is concerning for PE vs infection/PNA. Acuity,
   low grade fevers, ECG, tachycardia all consistent with PE, however, no
   large PE seen on CTA, no LE DVT on prelim, and no RV strain on echo
   which would expect based on current hemodynamics. Fever to 104 also
   atypical for PE.
   - Required aggresive suctioning o/n with desats on 100%FiO2, likely due
   to mucus plugs.  Plan to bronch today to both clear plugs and retrieve
   cx.
   -attempt to switch to PSV  and wean through day as pt tolerates, with
   goal PSV 12/8 for the day.
   - currently on clinda and unasyn, not covered for VAP.
   #  Fever, leukocytosis: Fever and leukocytosis with bandemia suggest
   acute onset of infection, however no obvious source other than
   pulmonary vs skin/soft tissue. Would expect to have more subacute
   presentation with ongoing infection rather than acute decompensation
   over hours but fever to 104 and bandemia suggest infectious process.
   Intraabdominal process also concerning given tenderness on exam however
   improved today and prelim negative CT.
   - Unasyn for strep spp cultured from blood.  No VAP coverage.
   - monitor skin/soft tissue of LLE, likely cellulitis.  Seems improved
   since yesterday. Re-mark extent of erythema.
   - f/u peripheral smear pending
   -call home podiatrist for cx and sensitivities from R great toe
   parnychial cx.
   #Access-PICC placed yesterday not in correct position
   -IR this AM for PICC repositioning
   -continue using triple lumen until PICC suitable for use.
   #  Hyperglycemia: controlled on HISS.
   - HISS
   # Hypotension: Likely related to sepsis vs cardiogenic shock as above.
   MAPs currently 60s off of pressors.  CVP at 13.
   - maintain peripheral access
   - IVF boluses prn, can add back neo if needed
   - CEs negative X3
   - hold home antihypertensives
   - TTE showed increased EF,  Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   # ECG changes: Pt has lateral ST depressions when tachycardic likely
   demand related ischemia since have resolved with rate improvement. Also
   has evidence of right heart strain which may be chronic due to OSA and
   ? pulm HTN
   - consider cards consult if not improved

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He was admitted with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia. The patient's condition is concerning for pulmonary embolism versus infection/pneumonia. The patient required aggressive suctioning overnight due to desaturation on 100% FiO2, likely caused by mucus plugs. 

The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest an acute infection, but no obvious source has been identified. The patient has tenderness on examination, which may indicate an intra-abdominal process, although a preliminary negative CT scan was obtained. 

The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and there is no information on the neurologic examination. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of lactate, lactic acid, and lipase. Imaging reveals an endotracheal tube placed appropriately above the carina and a right internal jugular central venous catheter in place in the superior vena cava. 

The patient is currently on clindamycin and ampicillin-sulbactam for infection coverage, but no coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's blood culture shows growth of ID: beta-streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. equisimilis, and the patient is being started on Unasyn for strep spp. cultured from blood. 

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 16 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%, and a respiratory system resistance and compliance within normal limits. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, which suggests impaired gas exchange and inadequate oxygenation. This can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function and potentially progress to severe respiratory failure or ARDS.

2. Pneumonia: The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia suggests an infectious process, possibly pneumonia. If left untreated or inadequately treated, this can lead to worsening infection, sepsis, and multiorgan dysfunction.

3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's symptoms, including leg pain and fever, raise suspicion for PE. If a PE is confirmed or strongly suspected, it can lead to significant hemodynamic instability and respiratory compromise.

4. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, bandemia, and hypotension are concerning for sepsis. Sepsis can rapidly progress to septic shock, multiorgan dysfunction, and potentially death if not promptly recognized and managed.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with respiratory failure and Streptococcus dysgalactiae sepsis. He has been diagnosed with bacteremia/ sepsis and is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is likely due to severe hypoxemia. This can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) if not managed properly.

2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis caused by Streptococcus dysgalactiae bacteremia. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylaxis measures such as boots, SQ UF Heparin, and monitoring of PTT should be continued to prevent the development of DVT.

4. Stress Ulcer: Critically ill patients are at an increased risk of stress ulcers. Prophylaxis with H2 blockers should be continued to prevent gastric ulcers.

5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing mouth care, and daily awakenings should be implemented to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He was admitted to the ICU with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia. The patient has been intubated nasotracheally and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if he does not respond well to the trial spontaneous breathing test (SBT) and cannot be extubated.
2. Pneumonia, Aspiration: The patient's risk for aspiration pneumonia is increased due to his morbid obesity and nasotracheal intubation. Monitoring for signs of infection and considering early tracheostomy if prolonged intubation is anticipated.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE), Acute: The patient is at risk for developing a pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and obesity. Close monitoring for symptoms such as sudden onset of dyspnea, chest pain, or hemodynamic instability.
4. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has shown signs of infection with leukocytosis and fever. Continuous monitoring for any signs of sepsis progression, including worsening vital signs, increased inflammatory markers, or organ dysfunction.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has evidence of impaired skin integrity with cellulitis and erythema"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He presented with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and fever, along with leukocytosis and bandemia. The patient is currently intubated nasotracheally and has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by aspiration. He also has impaired skin integrity, pulmonary embolism, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient is being treated with mechanical ventilation and sedation, and his blood glucose levels are being monitored and controlled using HISS. He is also on medication for hypertension and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining proper hygiene and elevating the head of the bed.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheter use increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as boots and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin are being used to prevent this.
3. Sepsis and organ dysfunction: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and organ function is necessary to prevent progression to septic shock and organ dysfunction.
4. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity"

   ADDENDUM
   Seen multiple times throughout day.  Did well with SBT; able to pull
   >1000 Vt on PSV 5.  Although relatively hypoxemic, we elected to
   extubate due to excellent mental status, good ventilation, and
   likelihood that he has relatively chronic hypoxemia.  Airway assessed
   with anesthesia staff:  exam and history of multiple successful
   intubations do not predict overly difficult reintubation (though risk
   of course exists).  Throughout the day, able to maintain sats 88-90%.
   Out to chair (!) with physical therapy.  All questions of patient and
   wife answered.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with respiratory failure and Streptococcus dysgalactiae sepsis. The patient has been critically ill but has shown improvement. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is closely monitored due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure, which may require reintubation or mechanical ventilation support.

2. Sepsis: The patient has Streptococcus dysgalactiae sepsis, which can lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction, septic shock, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential to detect any signs of deterioration.

3. Necrotizing fasciitis: Although there is no clinical or imaging evidence for necrotizing fasciitis, this condition should still be considered due to the presence of cellulitis. Early recognition and prompt treatment are crucial to prevent further complications.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobility. Prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin has been initiated, but close monitoring for signs of DVT is necessary.

5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to mechanical ventilation. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation, daily awakening, and oral hygiene have been"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He was admitted with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and fever with leukocytosis and bandemia. The patient was intubated but successfully extubated yesterday.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/81 mmHg to 187/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including invasive ventilation, lasix, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), furosemide, and different antibiotics such as piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, clindamycin, and ampicillin.

The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, along with slightly low platelet count and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging shows increased lung volumes bilaterally with right lower lobe infiltrate and air bronchograms.

The patient's assessment includes hypertension, impaired skin integrity, obstructive sleep apnea, and cellulitis. The plan includes continuing to monitor oxygen saturation, using bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) at night, administering home"

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He was admitted to the ICU with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and fever with leukocytosis and bandemia. The patient was previously intubated but has been extubated and is now on BIPAP. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 139/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

The patient has received various medications including lasix, Unasyn, and HISS for glycemic control. 

The physical examination shows that the patient has general oxygenation, no jugular venous distention, and end-expiratory rhonchi bilaterally. The cardiovascular examination reveals S1 and S2 without murmurs or extra heart sounds. The abdominal examination notes that the patient is obese with soft and non-tender nondescript abdominal wall. The extremities show erythema appearing unchanged from yesterday, as well as left lower extremity edema.

The laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated troponin-T levels. The imaging shows increased lung volumes bilaterally"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and morbid obesity. He presented with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and fever. The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but was extubated yesterday. He experienced one episode of desaturation overnight while using BiPAP. He has been prescribed Unasyn for suspected streptococcal infection, and his fever and leukocytosis are being monitored. The patient's hyperglycemia is controlled on HISS, and his hypertension is better managed with metoprolol and captopril. The patient has impaired skin integrity and cellulitis in his right great toe. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure indicates a potential risk for further respiratory complications. Monitoring oxygen saturation and continuing BiPAP therapy at night can help prevent desaturation episodes.
2. Infection: The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and suspected streptococcal infection suggests a possibility of worsening infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood counts, and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent complications related to infection.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels require careful management to prevent hyperglycemic crises. Continuation of HISS therapy and regular monitoring of blood glucose levels are essential.
4. Hypertension:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with respiratory failure and severe sepsis. He was extubated yesterday and continues to be hypoxemic. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia/sepsis caused by Streptococcus dysgalactiae. The ID team has recommended discontinuing clindamycin and continuing Unasyn for two weeks.

The patient's respiratory failure and hypoxemia have improved but still require close monitoring. Diuretics have been started to achieve negative fluid balance. The patient is also encouraged to practice incentive spirometry and be out of bed. Due to the high FiO2 requirements, the patient will remain in the ICU.

The patient has a history of sleep apnea and may also have obesity-hypoventilation syndrome. The plan is to discuss the reasons for declining BiPAP, try autoset vs. empiric adjustment, and introduce a mask during the day.

The CXR shows some abnormality, but it is unclear if it represents pneumonia. Additional antibiotics will be held for now, but if the patient experiences worsening or decompensation, coverage for nosocomial pneumonia will be initiated.

Access to the patient includes a PICC line and an arterial line, which will be discontinued tomorrow if the patient remains stable. Other issues discussed by the ICU team include nutrition through a PO diet and glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale.

Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with boots and sub"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He presents with acute onset hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and fever with leukocytosis and bandemia. The patient was extubated yesterday and attempted to use bipap overnight, but experienced desaturation. He is currently on various medications including Unasyn for suspected strep spp infection, and cultures show sensitivity to clindamycin. The patient also has controlled hyperglycemia on his HISS and improved hypertension management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation included hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
2. Cellulitis: The patient has impaired skin integrity, and there is a concern for cellulitis, especially since the cultures from the PCP show resistance to ampicillin but sensitivity to clindamycin.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infection. The source of infection could be related to his wound or another site. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis: Although the patient's blood glucose levels are mentioned as well-controlled, there is a possibility of developing diabetic ketoacidosis due to the patient's obesity and potential underlying diabetes.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk for"

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 51M with HTN, OSA, morbid obesity now
   with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and fever
   with leukocytosis and bandemia.
   #  Hypoxic Hypercarbic Respiratory failure: extubated yesterday, BIPAP
   overnight, with one episode of desaturation overnight.
   - Sleep study at some point during hospital stay would be beneficial to
   patient.
   - IS, out of bed to chair, pulmonary toilet
   - Lasix 20IV, goal UOP -1L
   - Will get CXR this AM to monitor for fluid overload affecting lungs
    #  Fever, leukocytosis: WBC 11.6 today up from 9.7 yesterday. No
   fevers o/n.
   - Unasyn [**8-8**]  (D1 [**8-18**]) for strep spp
   - Cultures from PCP for toe shows resistance to Ampicillin. Sensitive
   to Clinda. However, only a skin swab and pt was already treated with
   Keflax and Doxy a week prior to presentation. ID does think extra
   treatment needed at this time.
   - monitor skin infection
   #  Hyperglycemia: controlled on HISS. BG well controlled o/n.
   - HISS
   # Hypertension: better controlled last 24 hrs.  On metoprolol and
   captopril
   -Will restart home meds, except Clonidine

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He was admitted with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and fever, along with leukocytosis and bandemia. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, fever, leukocytosis, and cellulitis. 

The patient was extubated yesterday and attempted to use BIPAP overnight, but experienced an episode of desaturation. It is recommended to perform a sleep study during the hospital stay. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 121/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab results show elevated levels of lactate, lactic acid, and troponin T, while being within normal range for creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, and calcium. 

The patient has been prescribed Unasyn for streptococcus infection, but the culture from the PCP shows resistance to ampicillin and sensitivity to clindamycin. The patient was previously treated with ceflax and doxy a week prior to presentation. 

The patient's plan includes monitoring skin infection, restarting home"

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and morbid obesity. He presents with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and cellulitis. He was extubated yesterday and attempted bipap overnight but had an episode of desaturation. The patient has impaired skin integrity with trace edema in the ankles bilaterally, and his vital signs are within normal limits. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Prolonged respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may persist or worsen if the underlying cause is not appropriately addressed. This could lead to further hypoxia and hypercapnia, potentially resulting in respiratory acidosis and multiorgan dysfunction.

2. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis indicate an inflammatory response, suggesting a possible infection. The presence of cellulitis and a history of being treated with antibiotics prior to presentation increases the risk of antibiotic resistance. Continuous monitoring and appropriate management of infection are crucial to prevent its progression and systemic involvement.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's trace edema in the ankles bilaterally may indicate an early stage of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, are being implemented to prevent the development of DVT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and septic shock secondary to a staphylococcal lower extremity infection. He is currently extubated but requires high FiO2 due to ongoing hypoxemia. The patient's respiratory status is unstable and did not tolerate NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation) overnight. There are plans to continue diuresis with the goal of achieving 1L negative fluid balance, and a chest X-ray will be obtained today. The patient also has a lower extremity S. dysgalactiae infection and toxic shock syndrome, for which Unasyn will be continued. Additionally, the patient has OSA (obstructive sleep apnea), which may benefit from an inpatient sleep evaluation once on the floor. Other issues are being addressed by the ICU team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing hypoxemia and inability to tolerate NIPPV indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Continued hypoxemia can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and potential organ damage.
2. Infection: The patient's lower extremity S. dysgalactiae infection and toxic shock syndrome pose a risk of continued infection and sepsis. Failure to adequately treat the infection may result in worsening sepsis and potential complications such as organ failure.
3. OSA: The patient's OSA increases the risk of respiratory compromise during periods"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. They have been receiving respiratory support, initially with NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation) but switched back to a high flow mask due to intolerance. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, streptococcal infection, and is currently experiencing ongoing hypoxemia. They are also experiencing wheezing in their respiratory system. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/82 mmHg to 154/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. Their review of systems is unchanged from admission except for wheezing in the respiratory system and no abdominal pain or pain. 

Flowsheet data indicates that the patient has received various medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, clindamycin, ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn), and ampicillin. They have also received intravenous fluids and blood products. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's electrolytes are also abnormal, with elevated potassium and sodium levels. 

Assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure with hypoxemia that did not tolerate NIPPV overnight, so further attempts"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and cellulitis. He was admitted to the ICU with acute onset hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.3°F, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 147/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is currently being managed with mechanical ventilation. Monitoring the patient's oxygen saturation levels and ensuring adequate ventilation is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. Infection: The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia suggests an ongoing infection. Cultures from the patient's peripheral blood and toe cultures have been obtained, and antibiotic therapy has been initiated based on suspected Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Close monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or antibiotic resistance is necessary.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has controlled hyperglycemia, and it is essential to maintain glycemic control to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.
4. Hypertension: Although the patient's blood pressure is better controlled,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He was admitted to the ICU with acute onset hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.3°F (37.9°C), blood pressure ranging from 103-148/59-95 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91%. The patient is receiving various medications including heparin sodium, furosemide, ampicillin-sulbactam, amlodipine, captopril, and acetaminophen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may require ongoing respiratory support and close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels. Potential complications could include further deterioration in oxygenation, respiratory acidosis, and potential need for intubation.
2. Infection: The patient has a fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia, which suggest an ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms is necessary to identify any worsening of the infection. Potential complications could include sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, fever with leukocytosis, and bandemia. The patient is still requiring high-flow oxygen due to persistent desaturation. His vital signs are stable, but he has developed a florid drug rash after being treated with Unasyn, leading to the discontinuation of the medication and initiation of Clindamycin. The patient also has a history of obesity, hypertension, and a potential fungal infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory condition requires close monitoring and management. If not properly treated, it can lead to further respiratory distress, respiratory acidosis, and potential organ dysfunction.

2. Drug Rash: The development of a drug rash due to an allergic reaction to Unasyn indicates a potential hypersensitivity reaction. If not promptly addressed, it may progress to more severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis.

3. Infection: The presence of fever with leukocytosis and bandemia suggests an ongoing infection. Failure to identify and treat the infection appropriately can result in the spread of infection, sepsis, and septic shock.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure appears to be better controlled, but continued monitoring is necessary. Poorly controlled hypertension can"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He was admitted with acute onset of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and fever, along with leukocytosis and bandemia. The patient has been kept in the ICU due to desaturation in the 70s while on high-flow oxygen.

The patient developed a florid drug rash after being treated with Unasyn (ampicillin/sulbactam), and the antibiotic was subsequently changed to Clindamycin. The patient's allergies are unknown, and a urine eosinophil test has been sent to check for drug-induced eosinophilia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/84 mmHg to 155/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient has received multiple doses of IV Lasix to achieve a goal urine output of 2 liters, but his actual output has been around 3 liters. The patient has also been given dietary recommendations.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 13.0 g/dL, sodium level of 106 mg/dL, potassium level of 0.7 mg/dL, chloride level of 36 mEq/L, magnesium level of 2.0 mEq/L, and bicarbonate level of 41.5%. The blood glucose level is 103 mg/dL, creatinine level is 0.6 mg/dL, and lactate level is 0.8 mmol/L. Other lab results include elevated CK, CKMB, Troponin-T, ALT, AST, and LDH levels, as well as abnormal electrolyte and kidney function test results.

The patient's imaging and microbiology reports are unremarkable.

The assessment and plan include several conditions:
1. RASH: The patient developed a drug rash after taking Unasyn, which led to the discontinuation of the medication and initiation of Clindamycin.
2. HYPOXEMIA: The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. A sleep study is recommended during the hospital stay.
3. OBESITY (INCLUDING OVERWEIGHT, MORBID OBESITY): The patient is motivated to change and may consider lap-band surgery. A nutrition consultation has been arranged.
4. FUNGAL INFECTION, OTHER: No new information regarding this condition is provided.
5. HYPERTENSION, BENIGN: The patient's blood pressure is better controlled with metoprolol and lisinopril. The patient will continue taking home medications, except for Clonidine, and will also continue with Lasix.
6. OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA): The patient's sleep apnea is being managed with in situ thrombosis and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
7. CELLULITIS: No new information regarding this condition is provided.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure could worsen if adequate oxygenation and ventilation are not maintained.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and fever suggest an ongoing infection, which may require further investigation and management.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure fluctuations indicate a risk of hypotension, especially during medication administration or changes.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests possible kidney dysfunction, which needs close monitoring and management.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels (potassium, magnesium) indicate a risk of electrolyte imbalance, requiring careful monitoring and correction.
6. Drug allergy: The patient's drug rash after taking Unasyn raises concern for potential drug allergies"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea. He was admitted with lower limb pain and hypoxia from a work-related incident. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) did not show any pulmonary embolism (PE), but subsegmental PE was not ruled out. The patient developed left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis and was initially started on Unasyn but developed a drug reaction, so he was changed to clindamycin on [**2102-8-26**].

24-hour events:
The patient has been significantly volume overloaded and is being diuresed with lasix, achieving a goal diuresis of 3 liters per day. The patient is much improved, ambulating around the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with assistance. He was on CPAP autoset all night, maintaining oxygen saturation levels in the 90's, typically desaturating with his home machine.
