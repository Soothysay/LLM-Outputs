   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) who presented with an esophageal junction tear and neutropenic fever of unknown origin. The patient has been extubated successfully without any incidents. She has received various antibiotics and antifungal medications, including Voriconazole, Acyclovir, Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Metronidazole.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 38.9°C (102.7°F), which is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range. Her heart rate is 85 beats per minute, blood pressure is 130/71 mmHg, respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,093 mL and total output of 200 mL since midnight. The patient's urine output is 200 mL. The respiratory support indicates that she is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 370 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Physical examination reveals a pleasant and conversant patient with decreased breath sounds in the bases bilaterally. There is no evidence of edema, and her extremities have 2+ dorsalis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), an esophagus-gastrointestinal junction tear, and neutropenic fever of unknown origin (FUO). She is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 115/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has decreased breath sounds in the bases bilaterally, tympanitic and hyperactive bowel sounds, and mildly tender abdomen. Her labs show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.2 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 39. Her hematocrit (Hct) levels have been fluctuating between 22.2% and 27.8%. The patient's blood cultures have grown gram-negative rods, which are being sent to the lab for identification. She also has evidence of mucositis, but her stool studies have been negative for Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's fever persists, and there is a concern for possible pneumonia given a new infiltrate on her chest X-ray. She is currently on aggressive antiemetic medications, proton pump inhibitors, and pain management with morphine PCA."

","The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), EG junction tear, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). She presented to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), for which she received pantoprazole and transfusions. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 137/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg and a plateau pressure of 30 cmH2O. She is also receiving empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem) for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.2 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 39 K/uL. Her hemoglobin level is stable, and her blood cultures are pending. Other lab results include elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low albumin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Imaging studies reveal possible fungal sinusitis on CT scan, but the ENT team is not impressed, and cultures are pending.

The patient's current plan includes aggressive antiemetics, continuing voriconazole, monitoring fever curve, and following up with ENT recommendations. She also requires continued meropenem for suspected"
