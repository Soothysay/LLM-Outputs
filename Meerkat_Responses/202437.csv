   Assessment & Plan:
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old gentleman with relapsed Hodgkin's disease
   admitted with fever, transferred to the ICU for Afib with RVR.
   #Afib with RVR - Asymptomatic with HR in 150's.  Converted back to
   sinus with rate in the 80's prior to transfer to the ICU after getting
   20mg IV diltiazem on the floor.  No hypotension in response to IV
   dilt.   He has been prone to paroxysms of atrial fibrillation in the
   setting of chemotherapy, volume overload in the past.  BMT team
   concerned for possible pulmonary process such as PE as cause for acute
   afib given elevated lactate, LDH and hypoxia, however prelim report of
   CTA negative.  He may benefit from antiarrhythmic therapy to better
   control and prevent his paroxysms of Afib.  Anemia could also be
   contributing to current Afib given HCT of only 23 and hypoxia.  Was
   seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in cardiology clinic recently who felt that he
   may benefit from metoprolol if not contraindicated from a pulmonary
   stand point.
   -IV diltiazem 10-20mg prn for Afib with RVR
   -continue po diltiazem in the meantime
   -will discuss adding digoxin vs metoprolol with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   -Check cardiac enzymes
 neg x2.  will obtain 3^rd set.
   -f/u repeat HCT, consider transfusing for HCT <25  -- will transfuse 1
   unit of PRBC with lasix 20 mg IV as patient is already volume
   overloaded.
   -consider PFT's to further characterize underlying lung dz
   -will walk patient around and try to precipitate Afib while in the ICU.
   #Hypoxia - new asymptomatic hypoxia of unclear etiology with [**Name (NI) 3626**] of 52
   on ABG today in the setting of Afib with RVR.  BMT team concerned for
   pulmonary embolism given elevated lactate, new hypoxia and concern for
   L > R le swelling.  Preliminary report of CTA negative for PE.  Also
   concerning for possible pulmonary infection such as PCP given elevated
   LDH and h/o PCP and recent [**Name9 (PRE) 3223**] however CXR and CT unremarkable and
   has been on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1374**].  No significant pulmonary edema,
   infiltrate or pleural effusion on CT scan.  Could be exacerbated by
   anemia with HCT of 23 on admission in the setting of pulmonary
   fibrosis.
   -continue O2 by NC as needed
   -f/u final report of CTA
   -add on B-glucan to eval for PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) 3643**] PRN, will add advair.
   # Fever - patient is s/p ICE on [**2130-6-2**], last granulocyte count on [**6-9**]
   was 30, has been given neulasta in the meantime with WBC count up to
   23.  No localizing symptoms or signs to indicate pneumonia or UTI.  CXR
   and CTA unremarkable.  Has been treated with cefepime for febrile
   neutropenia by the BMT service.
   -f/u blood and urine cultures
   -continue cefepime for the time being
   -continue levofloxacin which he has been on since recent discharge
   -continue bactrim 3x/wk for PCP prophylaxis
   [**Name9 (PRE) 1710**] overnight will follow up with onc re: when to d/c abx.
   #Anemia - possibly due to recent chemotherapy with HCT down to 23 from
   26 on admission.  No evidence of blood loss at this time however will
   monitor closely.
   -repeat CBC
   -transfuse for HCT >25 given new hypoxia and Afib

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68-year-old gentleman with relapsed Hodgkin's disease. He was admitted with fever and transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6째C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 119/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. He is currently in sinus rhythm. He has been receiving IV diltiazem for AFib with RVR and has had episodes of atrial fibrillation in the past during chemotherapy and volume overload. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing new asymptomatic hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 52 on ABG. This could be due to pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infection such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or exacerbated by anemia with a hematocrit (HCT) of 23. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low at 104, indicating acute thrombocytopenia. This can increase the risk of bleeding.

3. Anemia: The patient's HCT is 23, indicating anemia. This can contribute to hypoxia and may require transfusion"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's medical history includes neutropenic fever, anemia, and ongoing treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma.

During the current ICU stay, the patient received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and was given intravenous diltiazem for rate control during episodes of RVR. The patient is currently asymptomatic, normotensive, and responding to IV diltiazem. 

Laboratory findings show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. 

The plan includes continuing IV diltiazem for rate control, gentle diuresis to improve atrial size, and regular diet. The patient's neutropenic fever has resolved, and there are no signs of focal infection or positive culture results. Empiric coverage with cefepime and levofloxacin will be continued, along with prophylactic B-glucan assay for possible Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). 

The patient's anemia is stable after receiving two units of PRBCs, and ongoing monitoring for bleeding and transfusion reaction will be done."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old gentleman with relapsed Hodgkin's disease admitted with
   fever, transferred to the ICU for Afib with RVR.
   #Afib with RVR - Asymptomatic with HR in 150's.  Converted back to
   sinus with rate in the 80's prior to transfer to the ICU after getting
   20mg IV diltiazem on the floor.  No hypotension in response to IV
   dilt.   He has been prone to paroxysms of atrial fibrillation in the
   setting of chemotherapy, volume overload in the past.  BMT team
   concerned for possible pulmonary process such as PE as cause for acute
   afib given elevated lactate, LDH and hypoxia, however prelim report of
   CTA negative.  He may benefit from antiarrhythmic therapy to better
   control and prevent his paroxysms of Afib.  Anemia could also be
   contributing to current Afib given HCT of only 23 and hypoxia.  Was
   seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in cardiology clinic recently who felt that he
   may benefit from metoprolol if not contraindicated from a pulmonary
   stand point.
   -IV diltiazem 10-20mg prn for Afib with RVR
   -continue po diltiazem in the meantime
   -will discuss adding digoxin vs metoprolol with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   -Check cardiac enzymes
 neg x2.  will obtain 3rd set.
   -f/u repeat HCT, consider transfusing for HCT <25  -- will transfuse 1
   unit of PRBC with lasix 20 mg IV as patient is already volume
   overloaded.
   -consider PFT's to further characterize underlying lung dz
   -will walk patient around and try to precipitate Afib while in the ICU.
   #Hypoxia - new asymptomatic hypoxia of unclear etiology with [**Name (NI) 3626**] of 52
   on ABG today in the setting of Afib with RVR.  BMT team concerned for
   pulmonary embolism given elevated lactate, new hypoxia and concern for
   L > R le swelling.  Preliminary report of CTA negative for PE.  Also
   concerning for possible pulmonary infection such as PCP given elevated
   LDH and h/o PCP and recent [**Name9 (PRE) 3223**] however CXR and CT unremarkable and
   has been on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1374**].  No significant pulmonary edema,
   infiltrate or pleural effusion on CT scan.  Could be exacerbated by
   anemia with HCT of 23 on admission in the setting of pulmonary
   fibrosis.
   -continue O2 by NC as needed
   -f/u final report of CTA
   -add on B-glucan to eval for PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) 3643**] PRN, will add advair.
   # Fever - patient is s/p ICE on [**2130-6-2**], last granulocyte count on [**6-9**]
   was 30, has been given neulasta in the meantime with WBC count up to
   23.  No localizing symptoms or signs to indicate pneumonia or UTI.  CXR
   and CTA unremarkable.  Has been treated with cefepime for febrile
   neutropenia by the BMT service.
   -f/u blood and urine cultures
   -continue cefepime for the time being
   -continue levofloxacin which he has been on since recent discharge
   -continue bactrim 3x/wk for PCP prophylaxis
   [**Name9 (PRE) 1710**] overnight will follow up with onc re: when to d/c abx.
   #Anemia - possibly due to recent chemotherapy with HCT down to 23 from
   26 on admission.  No evidence of blood loss at this time however will
   monitor closely.
   -repeat CBC
   -transfuse for HCT >25 given new hypoxia and Afib
 give 1 unit of PRBC
   now.  And check Hct later today.
   -transfuse for PLT <[**9-28**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation (AFib) and rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the presence of tachycardia and absence of cough. The patient is currently receiving diltiazem for AFib management and has been on mild diuresis and mild increase of hematocrit (HCT) stabilization.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent AFib: The patient experienced transient recurrent tachycardia this morning due to AFib. It is important to optimize the treatment plan for AFib to prevent further episodes.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation level is 93%, indicating potential hypoxemia. Further evaluation and management may be required.
3. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing fever, but the origin of the fever is unknown. In the setting of neutropenia, this could be a cause for concern and requires further investigation.
4. Lymphoma (Cancer, Malignant Neoplasm, Lymphoid): The patient has a history of lymphoma, which can have various complications and requires ongoing monitoring and management.
5. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and acute thrombocytopenia. These conditions need to be monitored and managed appropriately"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma, who presented with an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient's condition has been improving, with his heart rhythm now in sinus rhythm. He is alert and awake, with no signs of distress. The patient's vital signs are stable, and his blood glucose levels are well-controlled. His fluid balance is negative, indicating diuresis. The patient's white blood cell count has decreased from 43.4 to 38.3 K/uL, and his hemoglobin level has slightly increased from 23.3 to 26.3 g/dL. His platelet count remains within normal range. Renal function tests show normal values for creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level. The patient has completed one cycle of chemotherapy (ICE regimen) and is scheduled for further treatment with the bone marrow transplant team. He is currently not neutropenic and does not have a fever. The patient's anemia has been managed with blood transfusions, and he is following a regular diet.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma, who presented to the ICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib w/ RVR). The patient's condition has been monitored closely, and several interventions have been implemented. 

The patient had a negative lower extremity duplex ultrasound for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and experienced a brief episode of Afib w/ HR 120s associated with palpitations, but was normotensive and spontaneously resolved. The patient's dilt CR was increased to 180 mg PO daily. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent episode of Afib. The patient denies fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. 

Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs, with a temperature of 37.3째C (99.2째F), current temperature of 36.2째C (97.2째F), heart rate between 60-104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/64 mmHg to 128/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's heart rhythm has converted to sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 100 mL and output of 3,215 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3,115 mL. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is awake, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. The patient's respiratory system shows bibasilar crackles but no wheeze. The abdominal examination is notable for softness, negative for tenderness, and positive bowel sounds. 

Laboratory results show leukocyte count ranging from 35.3 to 43.4 K/uL, hemoglobin levels between 22.5 and 27.3 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 86 to 179 K/uL, and creatinine levels between 0.9 and 1.1 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels have consistently been below 0.01 ng/mL. Other lab values include sodium of 132 mg/dL, potassium of 4.2 mg/dL, chloride of 99 mEq/L, magnesium of 2.1 mg/dL, and albumin of 3.7 g/dL. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient is a 68-year-old male with recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma who was transferred to the ICU for Afib w/ RVR. 
   - Less frequent runs of tachycardia as volume status improves.
   - Normotensive during episodes of RVR, responds to IV dilt; long-acting CCB uptitrated per cards.
   - Gentle diuresis to improve atrial size; volume goal: -500 to -1000"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's condition has been improving, with resolution of neutropenic fever and no evidence of pulmonary embolism on CT scan. The patient is now normotensive during episodes of RVR and responds to intravenous diltiazem. The long-acting calcium channel blocker dose has been increased to 180 mg daily, and the patient will continue to receive diltiazem as needed for RVR if it does not spontaneously resolve. Gentle diuresis is being used to improve atrial size, aiming for a volume goal of -500 to -1000 mL. The patient's anemia has been managed with two units of packed red blood cells, and they remain hemodynamically stable without any signs of bleeding. The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, and they are currently on a regular diet. Glycemic control is well managed, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is in place. The patient's code status remains as full code, and they are stable for transfer to the bone marrow transplant service. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's current condition is well managed with medication, but ongoing monitoring and adjustment of the treatment plan may be necessary to prevent"

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of recurrent follicular lymphoma who presented to the ICU with recurrent atrial fibrillation and respiratory volume-related breathing. The patient has been diagnosed with febrile neutropenia and is currently receiving antibiotics (Cefepime/Levo), as well as antifungal prophylaxis (Brim). His neutropenia has resolved, but he still has a fever. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3째C, heart rate in the 80s, blood pressure ranging from 129/68 to 98/48 mmHg, respiratory rate in the 20s, and oxygen saturation at 93% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance without acute distress. His cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds with no murmurs. His extremities are warm and well-perfused without cyanosis or clubbing. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count at 43.4 K/uL, and a platelet count of 104. Other lab results are within normal ranges, except for elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 788 IU/L and slightly low potassium levels. 

The patient's imaging and microbiology results are unremarkable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma, who presented with neutropenic fever and was transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently afebrile and no longer neutropenic, with unrevealing culture data. He has received empiric coverage with cefepime and levo. Bactrim has been prescribed for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis, and a B-glucan assay is pending. The patient underwent 2 units of packed red blood cells due to anemia and is being followed closely for signs of bleeding. He has completed one cycle of chemotherapy (ICE regimen) for recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma and will continue treatment as per the primary bone marrow transplant team. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 99/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient is expected to have gentle diuresis to improve atrial size and may require a pulmonary evaluation prior to adding a beta-blocker. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism on CT scan. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is unknown.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma who presented to the ICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR). He was previously admitted for neutropenic fever, which has now resolved. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is in sinus rhythm. His fluid balance shows a negative balance of 570 mL since midnight, indicating ongoing diuresis. The patient's laboratory results are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated leukocyte count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient's AFib was precipitated by volume overload, which has been well-controlled with a higher dose of diltiazem. Close monitoring of fluid balance and continued gentle diuresis will be necessary to prevent recurrence.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently on diltiazem 180 mg daily and IV diltiazem PRN for runs of RVR. The goal is to maintain sinus rhythm and control heart rate. Pulmonary evaluation may be required prior to adding a beta-blocker, considering the patient's pulmonary function test results.
3. Neutropenic Fever: Although the patient is no longer neutropenic and afebrile, culture data remains unrevealing. Empiric coverage with cefepime and levofoxacin will be continued at the discretion of the BMT team. Bactrim for P."
