She presents with dyspnea and altered mental status since discharge from the hospital. The patient was previously hospitalized for the same complaints and was discharged on [**2194-8-30**]. On admission, she had thumb twitching and picking at her port-a-catheter, as well as new incontinence noted by her daughter.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient's condition has been monitored closely. A chest X-ray showed persistent retrocardiac opacity and pulmonary edema. She was switched to equivalent dose solumedrol due to poor oral intake. The patient spent the day on intravenous fluids with supplemental oxygen, desaturating into the 80's consistently. Bipap was reapplied at 8pm, but venous blood gas remained unchanged, indicating metabolic alkalosis and hypoxemia.

The patient's allergies include Belladonna alkaloids, causing itching and swelling. She received ciprofloxacin and cefepime on [**2194-8-31**]. Her medications"

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with decreased mental status, hypoxia, and a history of multiple medical conditions including MDS, Crohn's disease, CAD, s/p NSTEMI, CRI, and h/o DVT with saddle embolus. She is currently on weekly Lovenox due to GIBs and has a history of breast cancer. The patient was previously hospitalized for the same complaints and was noted to be somnolent since discharge on home O2. Her daughter reported thumb twitching and picking at the port-a-cath, and VNA visited for line check reporting new incontinence.

On admission, the patient's CXR showed persistent retrocardiac opacity, decreased interstitial markings, and cephalization suggesting a decrease in fluid overload. She has been taking poor p.o. since admission given poor mental status and was switched from methylprednisolone to an equivalent dose of solumedrol. The patient spent the day on IL NC with sAO2 of 100% but desaturated into the 80's consistently when O2 was dec'd. BIPAPA was reapplied at 8pm, and repeat venous blood gas showed compensated respiratory acidosis.

The patient has a history of allergies to Belladonna alkaloids causing itching and swelling. Her last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin on 2194-8-31 at 06:30 AM and cefepime on 219"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman admitted with altered mental status, hypoxia, and pulmonary edema secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has shown improvement in her mental status throughout the day, tolerating oral intake and meeting her goal diuresis. However, she developed loose stools that were guiac positive, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting a bacterial infection. The patient has been on antibiotics and continues to receive surveillance cultures. She also has a history of allergies to Belladonna alkaloids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters from blood cultures indicates a bacterial infection. The patient is already on antibiotics, but it is important to continue monitoring and follow up with the results of surveillance cultures. The source of infection remains unclear, and there is a concern for a possible nidus of infection, as evidenced by the recurrence of bacteremia despite previous treatment.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient initially presented with high potassium levels. Although there has been some improvement, it is essential to continue monitoring and repeat the measurement of potassium levels.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure is exacerbating her condition, and it is necessary to identify and address the underlying cause. In this case, infection has been identified as an exacerbating factor.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old woman admitted with altered mental status, hypoxia, and pulmonary edema secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's mental status has improved since admission, and she is now able to tolerate oral intake. However, she developed loose stools that were guaiac positive, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient met her goal diuresis with intravenous lasix and maintained oxygen saturation in the 90s on 0.5LNC. She wore CPAP overnight but refused it. Blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in clusters, and surveillance cultures were also taken. The patient has allergies to belladonna alkaloids and experienced itching and swelling as a result. She received antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and vancomycin. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 67 bpm (65-85 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 114/42 mmHg to 174/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute (17-35 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight has decreased from 68.5 kg to 64 kg since admission. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,090 mL and output of 2,155 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,065 mL.

","Summary of Progress Note:

An 82-year-old woman was admitted with altered mental status, hypoxia, and pulmonary edema secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF). She developed loose stools, which were guaiac positive once, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting a bacterial infection. The patient was started on antibiotics, but her source of infection remains unclear. She also had hyperkalemia, which improved over time. Her nutrition and glycemic control are being closely monitored. The patient has a history of CHF, possible exacerbating factors including volume overload, and a previous admission treated with vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's initial presentation included altered mental status and hypoxia, which improved after starting antibiotics. However, the source of infection is still unclear, and surveillance cultures are pending. There is a possibility of ongoing infection, and close monitoring is necessary.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory condition worsened, leading to acute respiratory failure. Exacerbating factors include her underlying CHF and possible infection. Continued monitoring and management of her respiratory status are crucial.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient had guaiac positive stools, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. Although her hematocrit remained stable, further evaluation and monitoring are needed to rule out significant bleeding or its progression.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient initially presented with hyperkalemia"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. These complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been intermittently hypotensive while sleeping, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the low 60s and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the 20s. This suggests possible poor perfusion and may indicate septic shock or another underlying cause.

2. Infection: The patient's source of infection remains unclear. They have shown improvement with antibiotic therapy, but there is a possibility of a coag-neg staphylococcal infection, as evidenced by the identification of this bacteria in the blood cultures.

3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing exacerbating factors for acute respiratory failure, which may be related to infection or other causes. They are currently on CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) at night and using a nasal cannula during the day. 

4. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure): The patient has had a negative fluid balance of 1.3 liters yesterday. They are being diuresed with Lasix IV to achieve a goal of negative 1 liter. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload or worsening heart failure is important.

5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels have been stable, but there is a risk of further increases. They have been given Kayexelate to help lower the potassium levels.

6. Anemia: The patient"
