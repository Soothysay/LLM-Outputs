","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a chief complaint of coma. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure of 110/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,846 mL, including 2,053 mL of IV fluids, and a total output of 1,153 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging studies such as an MRI and MRA have been performed. The patient has multiple medical complications including aortic dissection, stroke, renal failure, anemia, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic Dissection: This is a serious condition where the inner layer of the aorta tears, allowing blood to flow between the layers and causing the layers to dissect or separate. It can lead to complications such as rupture, organ damage, or dissection extension.

2. Stroke (CVA): A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. It can result in neurological deficits, paralysis, speech difficulties, and other complications depending on the affected area of the brain.

3. Renal Failure: Acute renal failure refers to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1050**] is a 54yo male with recent type B aortic dissection,
   transferred to the MICU for further managment of his acute medical
   issues.
   .
   1)Aortic dissection: Agressive BP control with goal of SBP < 130 and HR
   < 60
   -- Labetolol gtt for goal SBP<130
   -- Additional Labetolol 600mg TID, would titrate up as Labetolol gtt is
   titrated down
   -- Continue Hydralazine with PRN doses as necessary
   -- continue ASA 325mg PO daily
   -- No surgical intervention anticipated per vascular team
   .
   #) Anemia: Concerning given above dissection.
   -- Active type and screen
   -- Would transfuse today, goal > 25 given potential for catastrophic
   hemorrhage
   -- Would re-scan abdomen to clarify if dissection has progressed to
   renal arteries or if flap has been formed with RP bleed, however given
   ARF contrast load may acutely worsen failure and cause CIN
   -- Discuss with team in AM
   2) Coma: Mild improvement after sedation held
   -- Appreciate neuro follow up
   -- F/U MRI/MRA to help guide prognosis
   -- Although etiology remains unclear, strokes likely represent embolic
   phenomena
   .
   3) Bacteremia: GPCs in blood cultures from a-line. He had a TTE and TEE
   which do not suggest endocarditis.
   -- Unlikely to represent endocarditis without persistant positive
   cultures or vegetations on TTE/TEE
   -- Continue Vancomycin 1gm IV Q12 x 7d course; check trough prior to
   4th dose
   -- Appreciate ID reccs
   -- f/u surveillance cultures
   .
   4)Respiratory: Patient was intubated on [**6-23**] for airway protection in
   the setting of acute mental status changes. Currently on MMV and
   oxygenating appropriately.
   - Ct current vent settings
   - Consider extubation once mental status has improved
   .
   5)Renal failure: Patient presented with Cr of 1.9 on admission; peaked
   to 2.4 and now at 2.3.
   -- Unclear if dissection has extended and is affecting renal arteries.
   -- Would also consider embolic phenomena causing renal infarction;
   evaluate with ultrasound with dopplers
   -- Urine electrolytes with FENA of 0.2 / FE Urea > 41%, unclear if
   patient received any diuretics, but would suspect ATN in setting of
   agressive BP control and prior severe hypertension
   -- Negative eos suggesting against cholesterol emboli
   -- Renally dose medications
   .
   6) EKG changes: Patient has impressive EKG changes with ST depressions
   in lateral leads V3-V6. Cardiology is following closely and feels that
   this is demand ischemia. He has elevated CK and troponin is elevated
   which is likely due to demand ischemia.
   -- f/u cardiology reccs
   -- Ct ASA 325mg PO daily
   -- Check lipid panel
   -- When medically stable will need stress test
   .
   7)Anemia: Patient presented with Hct~36.5 on admission; decreased to 29
   today. Possible dilutional effect given all the IVFs he has received.
   - Continue to trend daily Hct
   .
   8)FEN: NPO for now; consider starting tube feeds in AM
   .
   9)Prophylaxis: Heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis
   .
   10)Access: A-line, 2 PIV
   .
   11)Dispo: Pending above

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with recent type B aortic dissection, transferred to the MICU for further management of his acute medical issues. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Aortic dissection: Aggressive blood pressure control with a goal of systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 130 and heart rate (HR) < 60. Medications such as labetalol and hydralazine are being used for this purpose. No surgical intervention is anticipated per vascular team.

2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 36.5 on admission to 29 today. This could be due to dilutional effect from receiving a significant amount of intravenous fluids. Active type and screen has been ordered, and the patient will be transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) today, aiming for a hemoglobin level > 25 given the potential for catastrophic hemorrhage. A repeat scan of the abdomen will be performed to clarify if the dissection has progressed to the renal arteries or if a flap has been formed with retroperitoneal bleed, although it may acutely worsen renal failure and cause contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).

3. Coma: There has been a mild improvement in the patient's awareness and ability to follow commands after holding propofol. An MRI/MRA will be performed to help guide prognosis. The etiology of the coma remains unclear, but"

   Imaging: MRI Brain: prelim read: Innumerable small infarcts seen in
   both hemispheres involving the supratentorial and infratentorial
   compartments as well as portions of the corpus callosum. These infarcts
   may be from an embolic source including the heart or aorta. Small
   vessel vasculitis and toxic insult to the brain are also
   considerations. These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1072**] on
   [**2159-6-27**].
   Renal U/S with doppler:
   1. Asymmetry in the peak systolic velocities of the main renal
   arteries, with the left measuring considerably slower than the right.
   Given that the abdominal aorta and the dissection flap are not
   visualized, involvement of the
   left renal artery origin cannot be excluded.
   2. No hydronephrosis.
   3. Trace free fluid in the abdomen.
   Microbiology: Blood [**6-23**]: Coag neg staph

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1050**] is a 54yo male with recent type B aortic dissection,
   transferred to the MICU for further management of his acute medical
   issues.
   1) Mental status: Likely [**12-23**] innumerable infarcts in both hemispheres
   involving supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum.
   Preliminary MRI report suggestive of embolic source but TTE/TEE were
   unrevealing.  Given growth of strep viridans in blood cultures, would
   be concerned about an infected aortic aneurysm with septic emboli to
   the brain.
   -- f/u neuro reccs
   -- f/u MRI/MRA final report
   -- Load OSH MRI onto PACS
   2)Aortic dissection: Patient presented to OSH with back pain and
   SBP~210
s and was found to have type B dissection. Agressive BP control
   with goal of SBP < 130 and HR < 60. Labetalol gtt was titrated off
   yesterday and then restarted overnight. Limited by PO beta blocker
   given bradycardia. One set of blood cultures growing strep viridans;
   this would be concerning for endocarditis but TEE was negative for
   vegetations. Now, we would be most concerned about an infected aortic
   aneurysm throwing septic emboli.
   -- Re-consult vascular surgery regarding further intervention given
   high suspicion of infected graft (? endovascular stent) and/or further
   imaging with MRI/CT scan of aorta and kidneys
   -- Ct Labetolol gtt for goal SBP<130
   -- Start Clonidine patch
   -- Consider ace-inhibitor for tighter BP control; first talk with
   vascular regarding renal involvement
   -- Continue Hydralazine with PRN doses as necessary
   -- Continue ASA 325mg PO daily
   3) Anemia: Hematocrit has been slowly trending downwards during
   hospital stay but now stable at 26.
   -- Transfuse for Hct<21
   -- If  Hct continues to trend downwards, consider CT scan to r/o RP
   bleed
   4) Bacteremia: Patient growing coag negative staph and viridans strep
   in blood cultures, likely from a-line. Currently on Vancomycin. He had
   a TTE and TEE which do not suggest endocarditis.  ID had been following
   -- Continue Vancomycin 750mg IV Q24
   -- f/u surveillance cultures
   5)Respiratory: Patient was intubated on [**6-23**] for airway protection in
   the setting of acute mental status changes. He was extubated yesterday
   with no complications. He has been maintaining excellent oxygen
   saturations.
   6)Renal failure: Patient presented with Cr of 1.9 on admission; peaked
   to 2.4 and now stable at 2.2.  He had a renal ultrasound yesterday
   which was not very revealing.  Unclear if dissection has extended and
   is affecting renal arteries.
   -- Renally dose medications
   - Monitor daily Cr
   7) EKG changes: Patient has impressive EKG changes with ST depressions
   in lateral leads V3-V6. Cardiology was initially consulted on admission
   and felt that this was [**12-23**] demand.
   -- Ct ASA 325mg PO daily

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 54-year-old male with a recent type B aortic dissection, transferred to the MICU for further management of acute medical issues.
- The patient presented to the hospital with back pain and high blood pressure, and was found to have a type B dissection. Aggressive blood pressure control is being maintained with a goal of systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 130 and heart rate (HR) < 60.
- The patient has had multiple infarcts in both hemispheres of the brain, which may be due to an embolic source, including the heart or aorta. Small vessel vasculitis and toxic insult to the brain are also considerations.
- Blood cultures have grown coag-negative staph and strep viridans, suggesting a possible infected aortic aneurysm with septic emboli to the brain.
- The patient was intubated for airway protection due to acute mental status changes but was extubated without complications.
- The patient's renal function has improved but there is a concern about potential renal artery involvement in the dissection.
- The patient has EKG changes with ST depressions in lateral leads V3-V6, which were initially thought to be demand ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The presence of coag-negative staph and strep viridans in blood cultures raises concern for endocarditis or an infected aortic aneur"

   compartments as well as portions of the corpus callosum. These infarcts
   may be from an embolic source including the heart or aorta. Small
   vessel vasculitis and toxic insult to the brain are also

   [**2159-6-27**].
   Renal U/S with doppler:
   1. Asymmetry in the peak systolic velocities of the main renal
   arteries, with the left measuring considerably slower than the right.
   Given that the abdominal aorta and the dissection flap are not

   left renal artery origin cannot be excluded.
   2. No hydronephrosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1050**] is a 54yo male with recent type B aortic dissection,
   transferred to the MICU for further management of his acute medical
   issues.
   1) Mental status: Likely [**12-23**] innumerable infarcts in both hemispheres
   involving supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum.
   Preliminary MRI report suggestive of embolic source but TTE/TEE were
   unrevealing.  Given growth of strep viridans in blood cultures, would
   be concerned about an infected aortic aneurysm with septic emboli to
   the brain.
   -- f/u neuro reccs
   -- f/u MRI/MRA final report
   -- Load OSH MRI onto PACS
   2)Aortic dissection: Patient presented to OSH with back pain and
   SBP~210
s and was found to have type B dissection. Agressive BP control
   with goal of SBP < 130 and HR < 60. Labetalol gtt was titrated off
   yesterday and then restarted overnight. Limited by PO beta blocker
   given bradycardia. One set of blood cultures growing strep viridans;
   this would be concerning for endocarditis but TEE was negative for
   vegetations. Now, we would be most concerned about an infected aortic
   aneurysm throwing septic emboli.
   -- Re-consult vascular surgery regarding further intervention given
   high suspicion of infected graft (? endovascular stent) and/or further
   imaging with MRI/CT scan of aorta and kidneys
   -- Ct Labetolol gtt for goal SBP<130
   -- Start Clonidine patch
   -- Consider ace-inhibitor for tighter BP control; first talk with
   vascular to exclude renal involvement
   -- Continue Hydralazine with PRN doses as necessary
   -- Continue ASA 325mg PO daily
   3)Renal failure: Patient presented with Cr of 1.9 on admission; peaked
   to 2.4 and now stable at 2.2.  He had a renal ultrasound yesterday
   which could not r/o dissection.
   -- Vascular surgery consult to address further imaging
   -- Renally dose medications
   --Monitor daily Cr
   4) Bacteremia: Patient growing coag negative staph and viridans strep
   in blood cultures. Currently on Vancomycin. He had a TTE and TEE which
   do not suggest endocarditis.  Concerned about an infected aortic
   graft.  ID had been following but signed off yesterday.
   -- Continue Vancomycin 750mg IV Q24
   -- Consider starting Naficillin
   -- Reconsult ID
   -- f/u surveillance cultures
   5)Respiratory: Patient was intubated on [**6-23**] for airway protection in
   the setting of acute mental status changes. He was extubated yesterday
   with no complications. He has been maintaining excellent oxygen
   saturations.  He has some disynchrony between mouth breathing and chest
   wall.
   -- Check ABG
   6) Anemia: Hematocrit has been slowly trending downwards during
   hospital stay but now stable at 26.
   -- Transfuse for Hct<21

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute onset of left-sided chest pain. The patient has a history of aortic dissection and presents with symptoms consistent with a stroke, including altered mental status and right-sided weakness. The patient's blood culture is positive for strep viridans, indicating a possible infective endocarditis.

The patient underwent an ultrasound, which revealed slower peak systolic velocities of the left renal artery compared to the right, suggesting potential involvement of the left renal artery in the dissection. Additionally, the patient had an MRI/MRA, which confirmed diffuse cortical infarction, but the exact cause (embolic, vasculitis, or toxic insult) is still uncertain.

The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated without problems. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 164/92 to 170/128 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and normal platelet count. Imaging studies reveal numerous small infarcts in both hemispheres of the brain, suggesting embolic source including the heart or aorta, small vessel vasculitis, or toxic insult"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1050**] is a 54yo male with recent type B aortic dissection,
   transferred to the MICU for further managment of his acute medical
   issues.
   .
   1)Aortic dissection: Agressive BP control with goal of SBP < 130 and HR
   < 60
   -- Labetolol gtt for goal SBP<130
   -- Additional Labetolol 600mg TID, would titrate up as Labetolol gtt is
   titrated down
   -- Continue Hydralazine with PRN doses as necessary
   -- continue ASA 325mg PO daily
   -- No surgical intervention anticipated per vascular team
   .
   #) Anemia: Concerning given above dissection.
   -- Active type and screen
   -- Would transfuse today, goal > 25 given potential for catastrophic
   hemorrhage
   -- Would re-scan abdomen to clarify if dissection has progressed to
   renal arteries or if flap has been formed with RP bleed, however given
   ARF contrast load may acutely worsen failure and cause CIN
   -- Discuss with team in AM
   2) Coma: Mild improvement after sedation held
   -- Appreciate neuro follow up
   -- F/U MRI/MRA to help guide prognosis
   -- Although etiology remains unclear, strokes likely represent embolic
   phenomena
   .
   3) Bacteremia: GPCs in blood cultures from a-line. He had a TTE and TEE
   which do not suggest endocarditis.
   -- Unlikely to represent endocarditis without persistant positive
   cultures or vegetations on TTE/TEE
   -- Continue Vancomycin 1gm IV Q12 x 7d course; check trough prior to
   4th dose
   -- Appreciate ID reccs
   -- f/u surveillance cultures
   .
   4)Respiratory: Patient was intubated on [**6-23**] for airway protection in
   the setting of acute mental status changes. Currently on MMV and
   oxygenating appropriately.
   - Ct current vent settings
   - Consider extubation once mental status has improved
   .
   5)Renal failure: Patient presented with Cr of 1.9 on admission; peaked
   to 2.4 and now at 2.3.
   -- Unclear if dissection has extended and is affecting renal arteries.
   -- Would also consider embolic phenomena causing renal infarction;
   evaluate with ultrasound with dopplers
   -- Urine electrolytes with FENA of 0.2 / FE Urea > 41%, unclear if
   patient received any diuretics, but would suspect ATN in setting of
   agressive BP control and prior severe hypertension
   -- Negative eos suggesting against cholesterol emboli
   -- Renally dose medications
   .
   6) EKG changes: Patient has impressive EKG changes with ST depressions
   in lateral leads V3-V6. Cardiology is following closely and feels that
   this is demand ischemia. He has elevated CK and troponin is elevated
   which is likely due to demand ischemia.
   -- f/u cardiology reccs
   -- Ct ASA 325mg PO daily
   -- Check lipid panel
   -- When medically stable will need stress test
   .
   7)Anemia: Patient presented with Hct~36.5 on admission; decreased to 29
   today. Possible dilutional effect given all the IVFs he has received.
   - Continue to trend daily Hct
   .
   8)FEN: NPO for now; consider starting tube feeds in AM
   .
   9)Prophylaxis: Heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a recent type B aortic dissection. He was transferred to the MICU for further management of his acute medical issues. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation but has been extubated without problems. An MRI/MRA confirmed diffuse cortical infarction, with the cause still unclear but potentially due to an embolic phenomenon.

The patient has several ongoing medical complications:

1. Aortic dissection: Aggressive blood pressure control is being maintained with a goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 130 and heart rate (HR) less than 60. Labetalol is being administered as a continuous infusion for blood pressure control, and additional doses of labetalol are being titrated up. Hydralazine is also being given as needed. The patient is continuing to take aspirin (ASA) 325mg daily. No surgical intervention is anticipated at this time.

2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 36.5 on admission to 29 today. This is concerning given the aortic dissection and the potential for catastrophic hemorrhage. A type and screen has been ordered, and the patient will be transfused today with a goal hemoglobin level greater than 25. Further evaluation is needed to determine if the dissection has progressed to involve the renal arteries or if a flap has formed with retroperitoneal bleed.

   Imaging: MRI Brain: prelim read: Innumerable small infarcts seen in
   both hemispheres involving the supratentorial and infratentorial
   compartments as well as portions of the corpus callosum. These infarcts
   may be from an embolic source including the heart or aorta. Small
   vessel vasculitis and toxic insult to the brain are also
   considerations. These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1072**] on
   [**2159-6-27**].
   Renal U/S with doppler:
   1. Asymmetry in the peak systolic velocities of the main renal
   arteries, with the left measuring considerably slower than the right.
   Given that the abdominal aorta and the dissection flap are not
   visualized, involvement of the
   left renal artery origin cannot be excluded.
   2. No hydronephrosis.
   3. Trace free fluid in the abdomen.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1050**] is a 54yo male with recent type B aortic dissection,
   transferred to the MICU for further management of his acute medical
   issues.
   1) Mental status: Likely [**12-23**] innumberable infarcts in both hemispheres
   involving supratentorial/infratentorial and corpos collosum.
   Preliminary MRI report suggestive of embolic source but TTE/TEE were
   unrevealing.  Overall prognosis is unclear at this time.
   -- f/u neuro reccs
   -- f/u MRI/MRA final report
   2)Aortic dissection: Patient presented to OSH with back pain and
   SBP~210
s and was found to have type B dissection. Agressive BP control
   with goal of SBP < 130 and HR < 60. Labetalol gtt was titrated off
   yesterday and then restarted overnight. Limited by PO beta blocker
   given bradycardia.
   -- Labetolol gtt for goal SBP<130
   -- Continue Hydralazine with PRN doses as necessary
   -- Continue ASA 325mg PO daily
   -- No surgical intervention anticipated per vascular team
   3) Anemia: Hematocrit has been slowly trending downwards during
   hospital stay but now stable at 26.
   -- Transfuse for Hct<21
   -- If  Hct continues to trend downwards, consider CT scan to r/o RP
   bleed
   4) Bacteremia: Patient growing coag negative staph and viridans strep
   in blood cultures, likely from a-line. Currently on Vancomycin. He had
   a TTE and TEE which do not suggest endocarditis.  ID had been following
   -- Continue Vancomycin 750mg IV Q24
   -- f/u surveillance cultures
   5)Respiratory: Patient was intubated on [**6-23**] for airway protection in
   the setting of acute mental status changes. He was extubated yesterday
   with no complications. He has been maintaining excellent oxygen
   saturations.
   6)Renal failure: Patient presented with Cr of 1.9 on admission; peaked
   to 2.4 and now stable at 2.2.  He had a renal ultrasound yesterday
   which was not very revealing.  Unclear if dissection has extended and
   is affecting renal arteries.
   -- Renally dose medications
   - Monitor daily Cr
   7) EKG changes: Patient has impressive EKG changes with ST depressions
   in lateral leads V3-V6. Cardiology was initially consulted on admission
   and felt that this was [**12-23**] demand.
   -- Ct ASA 325mg PO daily

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1050**] is a 54yo male with recent type B aortic dissection,
   transferred to the MICU for further management of his acute medical
   issues.
   1)Aortic dissection: Patient presented to OSH with back pain and
   SBP~210
s and was found to have type B dissection. Agressive BP control
   with goal of SBP < 130 and HR < 60. Labetalol gtt was titrated off
   yesterday and then restarted overnight. Limited by PO beta blocker
   given bradycardia. One set of blood cultures growing strep viridans;
   this would be concerning for endocarditis but TEE was negative for
   vegetations. Now, we would be most concerned about an infected aortic
   aneurysm throwing septic emboli.
   -- Re-consult vascular surgery regarding further intervention given
   high suspicion of infected graft (? endovascular stent) and/or further
   imaging with MRI/CT scan of aorta and kidneys
   -- Ct Labetolol gtt for goal SBP<130
   -- Start Clonidine patch
   -- Consider ace-inhibitor for tighter BP control; first talk with
   vascular to exclude renal involvement
   -- Continue Hydralazine with PRN doses as necessary
   -- Continue ASA 325mg PO daily
   2) Mental status: Likely [**12-23**] innumerable infarcts in both hemispheres
   involving supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum.
   Preliminary MRI report suggestive of embolic source but TTE/TEE were
   unrevealing.  Given growth of strep viridans in blood cultures, would
   be concerned about an infected aortic aneurysm with septic emboli to
   the brain.
   -- f/u neuro reccs
   -- f/u MRI/MRA final report
   3)Renal failure: Patient presented with Cr of 1.9 on admission; peaked
   to 2.4 and now stable at 2.2.  He had a renal ultrasound yesterday
   which could not r/o dissection.
   -- Vascular surgery consult to address further imaging
   -- Renally dose medications
   --Monitor daily Cr
   4) Bacteremia: Patient growing coag negative staph and viridans strep
   in blood cultures. Currently on Vancomycin. He had a TTE and TEE which
   do not suggest endocarditis.  Concerned about an infected aortic
   graft.  ID had been following but signed off yesterday.
   -- Continue Vancomycin 750mg IV Q24
   -- Consider starting Naficillin
   -- Reconsult ID
   -- f/u surveillance cultures
   5)Respiratory: Patient was intubated on [**6-23**] for airway protection in
   the setting of acute mental status changes. He was extubated yesterday
   with no complications. He has been maintaining excellent oxygen
   saturations.  He has some disynchrony between mouth breathing and chest
   wall.
   -- Check ABG
   6) Anemia: Hematocrit has been slowly trending downwards during
   hospital stay but now stable at 26.

- Patient is a 54-year-old male with recent type B aortic dissection.
- He presented with back pain and high blood pressure, and was found to have a type B dissection.
- The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to control, with episodes of elevated blood pressure requiring intervention.
- There is a concern for an infected aortic aneurysm or endocarditis, as evidenced by growth of strep viridans in blood cultures.
- The patient's mental status has fluctuated, with MRI findings suggestive of multiple infarcts in both hemispheres.
- The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a creatinine level of 2.2.
- He has been treated with various medications, including labetalol, captopril, lasix, and vancomycin.
- The patient was intubated for airway protection but was successfully extubated yesterday.
- His oxygen saturations have been good, but there is some disynchrony between mouth breathing and chest wall movement.
- The patient's hematocrit has been trending downwards but is currently stable at 26.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1050**] is a 54yo male with recent type B aortic dissection,
   transferred to the MICU for further management of his acute medical
   issues.
   1)Aortic dissection: Patient presented to OSH with back pain and
   SBP~210
s and was found to have type B dissection. Agressive BP control
   with goal of SBP < 130 and HR < 60. Labetalol gtt was titrated off
   yesterday and then restarted overnight. Limited by PO beta blocker
   given bradycardia. One set of blood cultures growing strep viridans;
   this would be concerning for endocarditis but TEE was negative for
   vegetations. Now, we would be most concerned about an infected aortic
   aneurysm throwing septic emboli.
   -- Re-consult vascular surgery regarding further intervention given
   high suspicion of infected graft (? endovascular stent) and/or further
   imaging with MRI/CT scan of aorta and kidneys
   -- Ct Labetolol gtt for goal SBP<130
   -- Start Clonidine patch
   -- Consider ace-inhibitor for tighter BP control; first talk with
   vascular to exclude renal involvement
   -- Continue Hydralazine with PRN doses as necessary
   -- Continue ASA 325mg PO daily
   2) Mental status: Likely [**12-23**] innumerable infarcts in both hemispheres
   involving supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum.
   Preliminary MRI report suggestive of embolic source but TTE/TEE were
   unrevealing.  Given growth of strep viridans in blood cultures, would
   be concerned about an infected aortic aneurysm with septic emboli to
   the brain.
   -- f/u neuro reccs
   -- f/u MRI/MRA final report
   3)Renal failure: Patient presented with Cr of 1.9 on admission; peaked
   to 2.4 and now stable at 2.2.  He had a renal ultrasound yesterday
   which could not r/o dissection.
   -- Vascular surgery consult to address further imaging
   -- Renally dose medications
   --Monitor daily Cr
   4) Bacteremia: Patient growing coag negative staph and viridans strep
   in blood cultures. Currently on Vancomycin. He had a TTE and TEE which
   do not suggest endocarditis.  Concerned about an infected aortic
   graft.  ID had been following but signed off yesterday.
   -- Continue Vancomycin 750mg IV Q24
   -- Consider starting Naficillin
   -- Reconsult ID
   -- f/u surveillance cultures
   5)Respiratory: Patient was intubated on [**6-23**] for airway protection in
   the setting of acute mental status changes. He was extubated yesterday
   with no complications. He has been maintaining excellent oxygen
   saturations.  He has some disynchrony between mouth breathing and chest
   wall.
   -- Check ABG
   6) Anemia: Hematocrit has been slowly trending downwards during
   hospital stay but now stable at 26.
   -- Transfuse for Hct<21

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a recent type B aortic dissection, transferred to the MICU for management of acute medical issues. He presented with back pain and high blood pressure and was found to have a type B dissection. Aggressive blood pressure control is being pursued with a goal of systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 130 and heart rate (HR) less than 60. Labetalol was initially titrated off but then restarted overnight due to elevated blood pressures. There are concerns about an infected aortic aneurysm or infected graft, which could be causing septic emboli. Imaging and vascular surgery consultation are recommended. The patient also has mental status changes, likely due to multiple infarcts in both hemispheres. Blood cultures show growth of coag negative staph and viridans strep, leading to concerns about bacteremia and possible endocarditis. Renal failure is also present, with a creatinine level of 2.2. The patient is currently on vancomycin for suspected bacteremia and is being monitored closely. Respiratory support was provided initially but has been weaned off. Anemia is being managed with transfusions as needed. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and multidisciplinary care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infected aortic aneurysm or infected graft leading to septic emboli.
2. Endocarditis, particularly given the growth of vir"

The patient's recent medical events include being weaned off labetalol IV, restarting it overnight for elevated blood pressures, and then stopping it this morning. The dose of labetalol by mouth was increased, and the patient was started on captopril. Lasix was given IV for increased B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and congestion on chest X-ray.

The patient has a swollen left hand likely due to IV infiltration, and IVs were decanned in the left hand with a new IV placed in the right hand. Troponins are elevated, and there are slightly worsening ST depressions in leads V4-6 on the EKG. The patient started receiving tube feeds for nutrition.

The patient has no known drug allergies, and the last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin on [**2159-6-27**] at 08:38 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/52 to 163/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight is currently 89"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of aortic dissection, stroke, acute renal failure, anemia, and other comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU with elevated blood pressures, congestion on chest X-ray, and signs of infection. The patient's condition has been unstable with frequent changes in medication, including labetalol for blood pressure control, captopril for heart failure, and vancomycin for streptococcal infection. He has also received Lasix for increased B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and congestion. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury. He has been on tube feeds for nutrition and has been monitored closely with arterial line placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest myocardial injury, which can be a result of the aortic dissection or ongoing ischemia. There are also worsening ST depressions in V4-6 on the EKG, indicating possible ongoing cardiac ischemia or infarction.
2. Renal Complications: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and his current lab results show abnormal kidney function tests such as elevated creatinine and BUN levels.
3. Infection: The patient has been treated with vancomycin for a suspected streptococcal infection. It is crucial to monitor for signs of infection and adjust treatment accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1050**] is a 54yo male with recent type B aortic dissection,
   transferred to the MICU for further management of his acute medical
   issues.
   1)Aortic dissection: Patient presented to OSH with back pain and
   SBP~210
s and was found to have type B dissection. Agressive BP control
   with goal of SBP < 130 and HR < 60. Labetalol gtt was titrated off
   yesterday and then restarted overnight which is now weaned off.
   Captopril also started overnight.  Vascular surgery does not feel any
   further imaging or work-up is necessary at this time.
   -- Ct Labetolol 800mg PO Q6H
   -- Continue Captopril 12.5mg TID; titrate up as BP and Cr able to
   tolerate
   -- Continue Hydralazine for now but wean down as ace-inhibitor and
   beta-blocker are titrated up
   -- Continue ASA 325mg PO daily
   2) Mental status: Likely [**12-23**] innumerable infarcts in both hemispheres
   involving supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum.
   Preliminary MRI report suggestive of embolic source but TTE/TEE were
   unrevealing.  ID does not feel that he has an infected aortic aneurysm
   and recent infarct unlikely septic emboli.
   -- f/u neuro reccs
   -- f/u MRI/MRA final report
   -- Upload OSH MRI report
   3)Renal failure: Patient presented with Cr of 1.9 on admission; peaked
   to 2.4 and now stable at 2.2.  He had a renal ultrasound which per
   vascular is not suggestive of renal artery involvement from the
   dissection.
   -- f/u daily Cr
   -- Renally dose medications
   -- No further imaging necessary at this time
   4) Bacteremia: Patient growing coag negative staph and viridans strep
   in blood cultures. Currently on Vancomycin. He had a TTE and TEE which
   do not suggest endocarditis although we are still concerned about an
   infected aortic aneurysm.  ID was re-consulted and did not feel that
   the aneurysm was infected; felt that this was [**12-23**] line infection.
   -- Continue Vancomycin 750mg IV Q24 for undefined course
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- f/u surveillance cultures
   5)Respiratory: Patient was intubated on [**6-23**] for airway protection in
   the setting of acute mental status changes. He was extubated yesterday
   with no complications. He has been maintaining excellent oxygen
   saturations.
   6) EKG changes/elevated troponins: Elevated to 1.50 yesterday. EKG not
   changed significantly.  No need to monitor further.
   7) Anemia: Hematocrit remains stable at 26.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1050**] is a 54yo male with recent type B aortic dissection,
   transferred to the MICU for further management of his acute medical
   issues.
   1)Aortic dissection: Patient presented to OSH with back pain and
   SBP~210
s and was found to have type B dissection. Agressive BP control
   with goal of SBP < 130 and HR < 60. Labetalol gtt was titrated off
   yesterday and then restarted overnight which is now weaned off.
   Captopril also started overnight.  Vascular surgery does not feel any
   further imaging or work-up is necessary at this time.
   -- Ct Labetolol 800mg PO Q6H
   -- Increase Captopri to 37.5mg TID; titrate up as BP and Cr able to
   tolerate
   -- Continue Hydralazine for now but wean down as ace-inhibitor and
   beta-blocker are titrated up
   -- Continue clonidine, uptitrate in alternating fashion with ACEI
   -- Continue nitro drip for now
   -- Continue ASA 325mg PO daily
   2) Mental status: Likely [**12-23**] innumerable infarcts in both hemispheres
   involving supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum.
   Preliminary MRI report suggestive of embolic source but TTE/TEE were
   unrevealing.  ID does not feel that he has an infected aortic aneurysm
   and recent infarct unlikely septic emboli.
   -- f/u neuro reccs
   -- f/u MRI/MRA comparison as prior scans have been marged onto medical
   record (patient initially listed as EU Critical)
   3)Renal failure: improving in spite of increasing ACEI, suggesting a
   chronic insufficiency
   -- f/u daily Cr
   -- Renally dose medications
   -- No further imaging necessary at this time
   4) Bacteremia: Patient growing coag negative staph and viridans strep
   in blood cultures. Currently on Vancomycin. He had a TTE and TEE which
   do not suggest endocarditis although we are still concerned about an
   infected aortic aneurysm.  ID was re-consulted and did not feel that
   the aneurysm was infected; felt that this was [**12-23**] line infection.
   -- Continue Vancomycin 750mg IV Q24 for 7 day total
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- f/u surveillance cultures
   5)Respiratory: Patient was intubated on [**6-23**] for airway protection in
   the setting of acute mental status changes. He was extubated yesterday
   with no complications. He has been maintaining excellent oxygen
   saturations.
   6) EKG changes/elevated troponins: Elevated to 1.50 yesterday. EKG not
   changed significantly.  No need to monitor further.
   7) Anemia: Hematocrit remains stable at 26.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a recent type B aortic dissection, who was transferred to the MICU for management of acute medical issues. He is currently experiencing several health complications including mental status changes, renal failure, bacteremia, respiratory issues, EKG changes with elevated troponins, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic dissection: The patient's aortic dissection needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications such as rupture or extension of the dissection.
2. Mental status changes: The patient's altered mental status could indicate multiple infarcts in both hemispheres of the brain, which may lead to neurological deficits and impaired cognitive function.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency needs to be managed carefully to avoid further deterioration of kidney function and potential accumulation of waste products in the body.
4. Bacteremia: The patient had positive blood cultures indicating bacteremia, which requires ongoing treatment with antibiotics to prevent the spread of infection.
5. Respiratory issues: The patient's respiratory status has improved, but close monitoring is necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
6. EKG changes and elevated troponins: These findings suggest myocardial ischemia or injury. Serial ECGs and cardiac enzyme levels should be monitored to assess for ongoing cardiac damage.
7. Anemia: The patient's stable hematocrit level should be maintained, and transfusion should be"

- The patient has arterial and PICC lines in place.
- Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with heparin subcutaneously and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Aortic dissection: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite treatment, which indicates that the current management plan may not be effectively controlling the dissection. This could lead to further complications such as rupture or extension of the dissection.
2. Infection: The patient's"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 1050**] is a 54yo male with recent type B aortic dissection,
   transferred to the MICU for further management of his acute medical
   issues.
    1)Aortic dissection: Stable, need to maintain SBP less than 130
   -- Ct Labetolol 800mg PO Q6H
   -- Increase Captopri to 50mg TID; titrate up as BP and Cr able to
   tolerate
   -- Continue Hydralazine for now but wean down as ace-inhibitor and
   beta-blocker are titrated up
   -- Continue clonidine, uptitrate in alternating fashion with ACEI
   -- Continue nitro drip for now
   -- Continue ASA 325mg PO daily
   2) Mental status: Likely [**12-23**] innumerable infarcts in both hemispheres
   involving supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum.
   Preliminary MRI report suggestive of embolic source but TTE/TEE were
   unrevealing.  ID does not feel that he has an infected aortic aneurysm
   and recent infarct unlikely septic emboli.
   -- f/u neuro reccs
   -- f/u MRI/MRA comparison as prior scans have been marged onto medical
   record (patient initially listed as EU Critical)
   3)Renal failure: improving in spite of increasing ACEI, suggesting a
   chronic insufficiency
   -- f/u daily Cr
   -- Renally dose medications
   -- No further imaging necessary at this time
   4) Bacteremia: No more positive cultures.
   -- Continue Vancomycin 750mg IV Q24 for 7 day total
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- f/u surveillance cultures
   5)Respiratory: Improved, with good sats in room air
    6) EKG changes/elevated troponins: Serial ECGs only given demand
   ischemia from hypertensive urgency.
   7) Anemia: Hematocrit remains stable at 26.

","Based on the provided progress note, Mr. [**Known lastname 1050**] is a 54-year-old male with recent type B aortic dissection, currently in the MICU for further management of his acute medical issues. The note highlights several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Aortic dissection: The patient's aortic dissection is stable, and efforts are being made to maintain systolic blood pressure (SBP) below 130 mmHg. Medications such as labetalol, captopril, hydralazine, clonidine, and nitro drip are being used to manage the condition. However, there is a risk of complications related to hypertension and potential organ damage.

2. Mental status: The patient's mental status is likely due to innumerable infarcts in both hemispheres involving supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum. This suggests a significant neurological impairment, which could be caused by multiple embolic events. Further follow-up with neurology is recommended, and comparison MRI/MRA scans should be performed.

3. Renal failure: The patient is showing signs of improving renal function despite increasing ACE inhibitors. This suggests a chronic renal insufficiency. Close monitoring of daily creatinine levels is advised, and medications should be adjusted accordingly.

4. Bacteremia: The patient previously had positive cultures indicating bacteremia. Vancomycin therapy has been continued for a total of 7 days,"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 1050**] is a 54yo male with recent type B aortic dissection,
   transferred to the MICU for further management of his acute medical
   issues.
    1)Aortic dissection: BP still remains elevated despite being nitro
   drip and multiple oral medications.
   -- d/c nitro gtt and transition to labetolol gtt
   -- Ct Labetolol 800mg PO Q6H
   -- Increase Captopri to 75mg TID
   -- Continue Hydralazine 25mg Q6
   -- Increase Clonidine to 0.2mg TID
   -- Start Norvasc 5mg PO daily
   -- Continue ASA 325mg PO daily
   2) Fevers: Patient currently on Vancomycin for a-line infection. There
   was some concern for an infected aortic aneurysm but ID does not feel
   that this is the case.  He spiked a temperature yesterday evening and
   he was pan-culture.
   -- Continue Vancomycin 750mg IV Q24 for 7 day total
   -- f/u culture data
   -- Send sputum cx
   3) Neuro: Likely [**12-23**] innumerable infarcts in both hemispheres involving
   supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum. Preliminary MRI
   report suggestive of embolic source but TTE/TEE were unrevealing.  ID
   does not feel that he has an infected aortic aneurysm and recent
   infarct unlikely septic emboli.
   -- f/u neuro reccs
   4)Renal failure: Cr improved from 2.2 to 1.7 yesterday; increased to
   1.9 this morning.
   -- f/u daily Cr
   -- Renally dose medications
   5) EKG changes/elevated troponins: No further work-up at this time.
   6) Anemia: Hct continues to slowly drop to ~22 this morning. No clear
   source.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recent type B aortic dissection, who was transferred to the MICU for further management of his acute medical issues. He remains in the ICU due to persistent high blood pressure despite medication, fevers, neurological deficits, renal failure, elevated troponin levels, and anemia. The patient is currently on multiple medications including labetalol, captopril, clonidine, norvasc, and aspirin. He is also receiving IV fluids and has an arterial line in place. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and ongoing treatment adjustments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic Dissection: The patient's elevated blood pressure may indicate ongoing stress on the aorta, which could lead to complications such as further dissection or rupture.
2. Infection: The patient is currently on vancomycin for an arterial line infection. If the infection is not properly managed, it could lead to sepsis or spread to other sites.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient has had multiple infarcts in both hemispheres of the brain, which can result in long-term neurological deficits or even death.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been fluctuating, indicating possible renal dysfunction. If left untreated, renal failure could progress and require dialysis.
5. Cardiac Complications: Elevated troponin levels suggest cardiac injury, which could be due to myocardial"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with recent type B aortic dissection, admitted to the MICU for management of acute medical issues. He has been on various medications including nitro drip, labetalol, captopril, hydralazine, clonidine, Norvasc, and aspirin. The patient also has fevers, likely multiple infarcts in both hemispheres involving supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum, renal failure with improved creatinine levels, elevated troponins, anemia with decreasing hematocrit levels, and elevated white blood cell count.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Aortic dissection: The patient's elevated blood pressure despite multiple oral medications indicates that there is a potential risk of complications related to the aortic dissection. Close monitoring of blood pressure and adherence to the prescribed medications are crucial to prevent further complications.

2. Fevers: Although the patient is currently on Vancomycin for an arterial line infection, there is still a possibility of other infections. Monitoring for any signs of infection and following up with culture data will help in identifying and treating any potential infections promptly.

3. Neurological issues: The presence of likely innumerable infarcts in both hemispheres suggests a high risk of neurological complications. Monitoring for any changes in neurological status and following up with neurologic recommendations are important to manage any potential complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with recent type B aortic dissection, admitted to the MICU for management of acute medical issues. The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite being on labetalol gtt and other oral medications. There is likely a component of agitation as well. The plan is to decrease labetalol gtt and increase captopril dosage. The patient also has fevers and asymmetrical lower extremity edema, which raises concern for a possible lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Neurological examination shows likely innumerable infarcts in both hemispheres involving supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum. Renal function is improving, but the patient has anemia with a dropping hematocrit level. EKG changes and elevated troponins are present, but no further work-up is needed at this time. The patient's current ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is to remain in the MICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Uncontrolled blood pressure: Despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications, the patient's blood pressure remains elevated. If not controlled, this could lead to further complications such as stroke or cardiac events.
2. Lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (D"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1050**] is a 54yo male with recent type B aortic dissection,
   transferred to the MICU for further management of his acute medical
   issues.
    1) Aortic dissection: BP still remains elevated despite being
   labetolol gtt and other oral medications.  Currently hoping for more
   realistic goal is between 140-150. There is likely a component of
   agitation as well.
   -- Ct Labetol gtt with goal to wean off for BP~140-150
   -- Decrease Labetolol PO to 600mg TID given bradycardia
   -- Increase Captopril to 100mg TID
   -- Continue Hydralazine 50mg Q6, HCTZ for the fluid retention it will
   cause (and also to help with BP)
   -- Continue Clonidine to 0.2mg TID
   -- If Nifedipine can be given via NG tube, would try this instead of
   hydralazine.
    -- Continue ASA 325mg PO daily
   -- Would D/C A-line today
   -- Zydis for anxiety
   2) Fevers: Patient currently on Vancomycin for a-line infection. There
   was some concern for an infected aortic aneurysm but ID does not feel
   that this is the case.  He has not spiked a temperature in the past 24
   hours.  Also concerned about possible LE DVT given asymmetrical LE
   edema.
   -- LE LENI
s negative
   -- Sputum with Staph, would continue Vancomycin 750mg IV Q24, until
   MRSA is r/o
   -- f/u culture data
   -- Send sputum sensitivity
   3) Neuro: Likely [**12-23**] innumerable infarcts in both hemispheres involving
   supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum. Preliminary MRI
   report suggestive of embolic source but TTE/TEE were unrevealing.  ID
   does not feel that he has an infected aortic aneurysm and recent
   infarct unlikely septic emboli.
   -- f/u neuro recs
   -- Patient will need aggressive rehabilitation.
   4)Renal failure: Creatinine is back to 2.0, unclear if this is close to
   his baseline. In light of life threatening aortic dissection, will
   tolerate slight increase in creatinine
   -- f/u daily Cr
   -- Renally dose medications
   -- Would consider stopping Lasix
   -- Would not decrease dose of ace-inhibitor
   -- Would still consider adding HCTZ as above
   5) EKG changes/elevated troponins: No further work-up at this time.
   6) Anemia: Hct continues to slowly drop to ~22 this morning. No clear
   source.  If continues to drop tomorrow, will need to discuss imaging of
   the abdomen/RP.
   -- Transfuse for Hct<21

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with recent type B aortic dissection, admitted to the ICU for management of acute medical issues. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/69 mmHg to 122/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's recent medical history includes elevated blood pressure despite medication, fevers, potential lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), neurological deficits consistent with multiple cerebral infarcts, renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, and elevated cardiac troponins. The patient's current medications include labetalol, furosemide, heparin sodium, and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aortic dissection: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite ongoing treatment with labetalol and other oral medications. The goal is to maintain blood pressure between 140-150 mmHg. If the patient's agitation is contributing to the elevated blood pressure, it should be addressed.

2. Fevers: The patient is currently on vancomycin for a suspected line infection. There was initial concern for an infected aortic aneurysm, but the ID physician does not believe this to be the case. The patient has not had a fever in the past 24"

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with recent type B aortic dissection, currently in the MICU for management of acute medical issues. The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite being on labetalol and other oral medications. There is also concern for possible lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to asymmetrical lower extremity edema. The patient has been febrile, but not in the past 24 hours. He is on vancomycin for an arterial line infection, and there was some concern for an infected aortic aneurysm, but the ID does not feel that this is the case.

The patient's neurologic status is concerning, with likely multiple infarcts in both hemispheres involving supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum. The preliminary MRI report suggests an embolic source, but transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was unrevealing. The ID does not feel that the patient has an infected aortic aneurysm and recent infarct unlikely septic emboli.

The patient's renal function has improved, with a creatinine level of 2.0. It is unclear if this is close to his baseline, but it is being tolerated due to the life-threatening aortic dissection. The patient's anemia is concerning, with a hematocrit (Hct) that continues to slowly drop to ~22 this morning. There is no clear source"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of aortic dissection. The patient's medical history includes CVAs, renal failure, and other anemias. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including labetalol, furosemide, heparin sodium, and nifedipine. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/69 to 122/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's urine output has been low, and there is a concern for acute kidney injury. The patient's sputum gram stain indicates the presence of multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora, and the respiratory culture shows moderate growth of Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive. The patient's blood cultures are pending. The patient's nutritional support includes receiving ProBalance at 70 mL/hour. The patient has an arterial line and PICC line in place for monitoring and medication administration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest the possibility of AKI. This could be due to factors such as hypot"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1050**] is a 54yo male with recent type B aortic dissection,
   transferred to the MICU for further management of his acute medical
   issues.
   1) Aortic dissection: BP.
   -- D/C Labetol gtt
   -- Increase Labetolol PO to 800mg TID
   -- Continue Captopril to 100mg TID
   -- Continue Hydralazine 50mg Q6,
   -- Continue Clonidine to 0.2mg TID
   -- If Nifedipine can be given via NG tube, would try this today
    -- Continue ASA 325mg PO daily
   -- Would D/C A-line today
   -- Zydis for anxiety
   2) Fevers: Patient currently on Vancomycin for a-line infection. There
   was some concern for an infected aortic aneurysm but ID does not feel
   that this is the case.  He has not spiked a temperature in the past 24
   hours.  Also concerned about possible LE DVT given asymmetrical LE
   edema.
   -- LE LENI
s negative
   -- Sputum with Staph, would f/u sensitivities, no evidence of pneumonia
   at this time
   -- f/u culture data
   -- Send sputum sensitivity
   3) Neuro: Likely [**12-23**] innumerable infarcts in both hemispheres involving
   supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum. Preliminary MRI
   report suggestive of embolic source but TTE/TEE were unrevealing.  ID
   does not feel that he has an infected aortic aneurysm and recent
   infarct unlikely septic emboli.
   -- f/u neuro recs
   -- Patient will need aggressive rehabilitation.
   4)Renal failure: Creatinine is back to 2.0, unclear if this is close to
   his baseline. In light of life threatening aortic dissection, will
   tolerate slight increase in creatinine
   -- f/u daily Cr
   -- Renally dose medications
   -- Would consider stopping Lasix
   -- Would not decrease dose of ace-inhibitor
   -- Would still consider adding HCTZ as above
   5) EKG changes/elevated troponins: No further work-up at this time.
   6) Anemia: Hct continues to slowly drop to ~22 this morning. No clear
   source.  If continues to drop tomorrow, will need to discuss imaging of
   the abdomen/RP.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/70 to 168/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium and has been transitioned from captopril to lisinopril. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent development of fevers, which are currently being treated with vancomycin. There is also concern for a possible lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to asymmetrical leg edema. 

The patient has likely suffered multiple infarcts in both hemispheres involving the supratentorial/infratentorial regions and corpus collosum. An MRI report suggests an embolic source, but transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was unrevealing. 

The patient's renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, which may be close to his baseline. 

There are also EKG changes and elevated troponin levels, but no further work-up is planned at this time.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1050**] is a 54yo male with recent type B aortic dissection,
   transferred to the MICU for further management of his acute medical
   issues.
   1) Aortic dissection: BP.
   -- D/C Labetol gtt
   -- Increase Labetolol PO to 800mg TID
   -- Continue Captopril to 100mg TID
   -- Continue Hydralazine 50mg Q6,
   -- Continue Clonidine to 0.2mg TID
   -- If Nifedipine can be given via NG tube, would try this today
    -- Continue ASA 325mg PO daily
   -- Would D/C A-line today
   -- Zydis for anxiety
   2) Fevers: Patient currently on Vancomycin for a-line infection. There
   was some concern for an infected aortic aneurysm but ID does not feel
   that this is the case.  He has not spiked a temperature in the past 24
   hours.  Also concerned about possible LE DVT given asymmetrical LE
   edema.
   -- LE LENI
s negative
   -- Sputum with Staph, would f/u sensitivities, no evidence of pneumonia
   at this time
   -- f/u culture data
   -- Send sputum sensitivity
   3) Neuro: Likely [**12-23**] innumerable infarcts in both hemispheres involving
   supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum. Preliminary MRI
   report suggestive of embolic source but TTE/TEE were unrevealing.  ID
   does not feel that he has an infected aortic aneurysm and recent
   infarct unlikely septic emboli.
   -- f/u neuro recs
   -- Patient will need aggressive rehabilitation.
   4)Renal failure: Creatinine is back to 2.0, unclear if this is close to
   his baseline. In light of life threatening aortic dissection, will
   tolerate slight increase in creatinine
   -- f/u daily Cr
   -- Renally dose medications
   -- Would consider stopping Lasix
   -- Would not decrease dose of ace-inhibitor
   -- Would still consider adding HCTZ as above
   5) EKG changes/elevated troponins: No further work-up at this time.
   6) Anemia: Hct continues to slowly drop to ~22 this morning. No clear
   source.  If continues to drop tomorrow, will need to discuss imaging of
   the abdomen/RP.
   -- Transfuse for Hct<21

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with recent type B aortic dissection, currently in the ICU for management of acute medical issues. The patient has been on various medications including labetalol, nifedipine, lisinopril, heparin sodium, and aspirin. There were concerns about an infected aortic aneurysm, but the patient has not had a fever in the past 24 hours. The patient also has asymmetrical lower extremity edema, which raises concern for a possible lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's neurological status is concerning, with multiple infarcts seen on MRI, but the source of the emboli is unclear. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.0, but this may be tolerated due to the life-threatening aortic dissection. The patient also has elevated troponin levels, anemia, and EKG changes, but no further work-up is planned at this time. The patient's nutritional needs are being met with a ProBalance solution, and he is receiving prophylactic treatments for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending further evaluation and management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic dissection: The patient's recent type B aortic dissection needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1050**] is a 54yo male with recent type B aortic dissection,
   transferred to the MICU for further management of his acute medical
   issues.
   1) Aortic dissection: BP.
   -- D/C Labetol gtt
   -- Increase Labetolol PO to 800mg Q6 hours
   -- Captopril transitioned to lisinopril
   -- Titrate nifedipine to 20 mg Q8 hours
   -- Continue Hydralazine 50mg Q6,
   -- Continue Clonidine to 0.2mg TID
   -- Continue ASA 325mg PO daily
   -- Zydis for anxiety
   2) Fevers: Patient currently on Vancomycin for a-line infection. There
   was some concern for an infected aortic aneurysm but ID does not feel
   that this is the case.  He has not spiked a temperature in the past 24
   hours.  Also concerned about possible LE DVT given asymmetrical LE
   edema.
   -- LE LENI
s negative
   -- Sputum with Staph, would f/u sensitivities, no evidence of pneumonia
   at this time
   -- f/u culture data
   3) Neuro: Likely [**12-23**] innumerable infarcts in both hemispheres involving
   supratentorial/infratentorial and corpus collosum. Preliminary MRI
   report suggestive of embolic source but TTE/TEE were unrevealing.  ID
   does not feel that he has an infected aortic aneurysm and recent
   infarct unlikely septic emboli, though this is possible.
   -- f/u neuro recs
   -- Patient will need aggressive rehabilitation.
   4)Renal failure: Creatinine is back to 2.0, unclear if this is close to
   his baseline. In light of life threatening aortic dissection, will
   tolerate slight increase in creatinine
   -- f/u daily Cr
   -- Renally dose medications
   -- Would not decrease dose of ace-inhibitor
   5) EKG changes/elevated troponins: No further work-up at this time.
   6) Anemia: Hct Stable
   -- Transfuse for Hct<21
