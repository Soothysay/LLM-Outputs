   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 12640**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with hx of sick sinus syndrome s/p
   pacer as well as recent admission for PNA, transaminitis, pancreatitis,
   MS changes, who presents from rehab with hypoxia, lethargy and was
   found to be hypotensive, likely early sepsis vs. CHF.
   1. Hypoxia: Differential includes worsening PNA with hypothermia.  WBC
   is down which does not favor this.  She also may be volume overloaded
   with pulmonary edema based on CXR.  Cardiac enzymes are negative which
   point away from acute ischemic event causing pulmonary edema.  She was
   receiving Lasix 20mg IV daily during her last admission and per family
   she is more swollen on admission today than on discharge yesterday.
   - treat PNA with vanc/zosyn/cipro for HCAP
   - f/u CXR in AM
   - attempt diuresis with lasix although limited by blood pressure
   - family is still discussing central venous line and pressors as GOC
   - echo in AM to assess heart function
   - AM ECG
   2. Hypotension: Baseline blood pressures are 130s-140s and patient was
   hypertensive at rehab.  Concern is for septic shock vs. cardiogenic
   shock.  No ischemic event to suggest cardiogenic shock, however she has
   received 3L of IVF in the ED for hypotension.
   - add on BNP
   - antibiotics for PNA as above
   - will hold on additional IVF given tenuous respiratory status and
   consider pressors if within GOC
   3. Elevated LFTs: Trending down compared to prior admission.  The
   thought during her past admission was that this was from statin vs.
   hypotension.
   - hold statin
   - check hepatitis serologies
   6. Hx of Pancreatitis: unable to assess abdominal pain currently but no
   tenderness on palpation and abdomen is soft.  Lipase is trending down.
   - continue to monitor
   7. Hx of hypertension: hold Toprol XL and Nifedipine while hypotensive
   8. Dementia: hold Donepezil while mental status is suppressed.
   9. Mental Status Changes: likely from acute medical issues and
   underlying dementia
   - continue to monitor, will likely need repeat speech and swallow
   evaluation when more medically stable

","Summary:
- The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of sick sinus syndrome, recent pneumonia (PNA), transaminitis, pancreatitis, and mitral valve changes.
- She presents from rehab with hypoxia, lethargy, and hypotension, possibly due to early sepsis or congestive heart failure (CHF).
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 113/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on high-flow nasal cannula.
- Physical examination reveals bilateral crackles in the lungs, regular heart rhythm, and mild distension in the abdomen.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal cardiac enzymes.
- The patient is being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin.
- The assessment and plan include treating PNA with antibiotics, attempting diuresis with Lasix, following up with a chest X-ray, and assessing heart function through an echocardiogram.
- Other concerns include hypotension, elevated liver function tests, history of pancreatitis, hypertension, dementia, and mental status changes.
- The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU pending clinical improvement"

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypoxemia:  CXR looks more like pulmonary edema rather than PNA.   No
   focal infiltrates, and WBC is no elevated.     Will stop antibiotics
   and continue lasix duresis.  If does not improve with diuresis,
   consider CTPA to r/o PE.
   acute on chronic diastolic CHF:  continue diuresis, recheck echo
   today.
   HOTN:  doubt sepsis.  More related to when she is sleeping.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 12640**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with hx of sick sinus syndrome s/p
   pacer as well as recent admission for PNA, transaminitis, pancreatitis,
   MS changes, who presents from rehab with hypoxia, lethargy and was
   found to be hypotensive, likely early sepsis vs. CHF.
   1. Hypoxia: Differential includes worsening PNA with hypothermia.  WBC
   is down which does not favor this.  She also may be volume overloaded
   with pulmonary edema based on CXR.  Cardiac enzymes are negative which
   point away from acute ischemic event causing pulmonary edema.  She was
   receiving Lasix 20mg IV daily during her last admission and per family
   she is more swollen on admission today than on discharge yesterday.
   - D/C Abx as overall picture most consistent with pulmonary edema
   - f/u CXR final read
   - attempt diuresis with lasix although limited by blood pressure
 will
   repeat 10 mg IV Lasix after SBP > 110 (goal negative 1 L/day)
   - family is still discussing central venous line and pressors as GOC
   - wean oxygen as tolerated.
   .
   2. Hypotension: Baseline blood pressures are 130s-140s and patient was
   hypertensive at rehab.  Concern is for septic shock vs. cardiogenic
   shock.  No ischemic event to suggest cardiogenic shock, however she has
   received 3L of IVF in the ED for hypotension.
   - antibiotics for PNA as above
   - will hold on additional IVF given tenuous respiratory status and
   consider pressors if within GOC
   3. Elevated LFTs: Trending down compared to prior admission.  The
   thought during her past admission was that this was from statin vs.
   hypotension.
   - hold statin
   - check hepatitis serologies
   6. Hx of Pancreatitis: unable to assess abdominal pain currently but no
   tenderness on palpation and abdomen is soft.  Lipase is trending down.
   - continue to monitor
   7. Hx of hypertension: hold Toprol XL and Nifedipine while hypotensive
   8. Dementia: hold Donepezil while mental status is suppressed.
   9. Mental Status Changes: likely from acute medical issues and
   underlying dementia
   - continue to monitor
   - will likely need repeat speech and swallow evaluation when more
   medically stable
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now (will ADAT with
   improved mental status)

","The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of sick sinus syndrome who presented from rehab with hypoxia, lethargy, and hypotension. She was found to have severe diastolic left ventricular failure and secondary right ventricular failure. The patient also has severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension, which were not evident in a previous study. 

She is currently receiving IV antibiotics for possible pneumonia and has been diuresed with Lasix due to pulmonary edema. Her blood pressure is relatively stable, but her oxygen saturation is low at 90%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, low glucose levels, and normal cardiac enzymes. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range. 

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxia, hypotension, elevated liver function tests, history of pancreatitis, hypertension, and dementia. 

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening pulmonary edema, septic shock, cardiogenic shock, and hepatic dysfunction."

The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of sick sinus syndrome, recent admission for pneumonia, transaminitis, pancreatitis, mitral stenosis changes, who presents from rehab with hypoxia, lethargy, and hypotension. The patient was found to be hypotensive, likely due to early sepsis versus congestive heart failure (CHF). The differential diagnosis includes worsening pneumonia with hypothermia, volume overload with pulmonary edema, and acute ischemic event causing pulmonary edema. Cardiac enzymes are negative, pointing away from an acute ischemic event. The patient was receiving Lasix 20mg IV daily during her last admission and per family, she is more swollen on admission today than on discharge yesterday. 

The patient's blood pressure is in the 130s-140s, and she was hypertensive at rehab. Concern is for septic shock versus cardiogenic shock. No ischemic event to suggest cardiogenic shock, however, she has received 3L of IVF in the ED for hypotension. 

Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down compared to the prior admission. The thought during her past admission was that this was from statin versus hypotension. 

The patient has a history of pancreatitis, with lipase trending down. 

She also has a history of hypertension, and her current mental status changes are likely from acute medical issues"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure and right heart failure, admitted with hypoxemia. She has shown improvement overnight with diuretics. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/41 mmHg to 153/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen. Her physical examination reveals clear breath sounds with diminished bases, bilateral lower extremity edema, and soft non-tender abdomen. The patient's lab results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances. Her cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation of 92% indicates hypoxemia, which if prolonged, can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's history of congestive heart failure and the presence of bilateral lower extremity edema suggest fluid overload, which can worsen heart failure symptoms and increase the risk of complications such as pulmonary edema.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection, which can be a serious complication in patients with weakened immune systems or compromised cardiac function.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure and right heart failure, admitted with hypoxemia. She has improved overnight with diuretics. The patient has allergies to heparin agents and hypersensitivity. She received antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam on 05/11/2186. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/41 mmHg to 153/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 696 mL, output of 2800 mL, and negative balance of -2105 mL. The patient is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of /31. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds with diminished bases, right lower extremity edema at 2+, left lower extremity edema at 2+, soft non-tender abdomen, and attentive orientation. The patient's lab results show a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, leukocyte count of 391 K/uL, sodium level of 49 mg/dL, potassium level of 1.0 mg/dL, chloride level of 31 mEq/L, etc. The patient's WBC count decreased from 7.3 K/uL to 5.4 K/uL, Hct decreased from 25.7% to 25.2%, platelet count increased from 391 to 341, creatinine level remained stable at 1.0 mg/dL, and troponin-T level remained below 0.01. Other lab results are within normal ranges or show mild abnormalities. The patient's assessment and plan include pulmonary edema improvement, continuation of diuresis, acute on chronic diastolic HF with RV failure, and hypoglycemia. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is transfer to the floor. The total time spent with the patient is 35 minutes. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation was hypoxemia, which indicates inadequate oxygenation. If respiratory support is discontinued or ineffective, the patient may develop respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrest: Given the patient's history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure and right heart failure, there is a risk of cardiac arrest due to inadequate cardiac function.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant negative balance, indicating potential dehydration. Dehydration can lead to renal dysfunction, especially in an elderly patient with pre-existing conditions.
4. Infection: Despite receiving antibiotics, the patient remains at risk for infections, particularly in the ICU setting. Infections can worsen her underlying conditions and complicate her recovery.
5. Bleeding: The patient has allergies to heparin agents, which are commonly used anticoagulants. If she requires anticoagulation therapy, alternative options should be considered to avoid allergic reactions or bleeding complications.
6. Malnutrition: Prolonged ICU stay and inadequate nutritional intake can lead to malnutrition, which can impair healing and recovery.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and decreased venous return due to edema increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylaxis measures should be continued to prevent DVT formation.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of respiratory support increases the risk of developing VAP. Adequate lung hygiene, proper secretion management, and regular assessment of respiratory status are essential to minimize this risk."
