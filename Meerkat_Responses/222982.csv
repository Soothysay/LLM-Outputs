   39M with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, chronic vent dependency,
   presenting with acute onset of RUQ pain, nausea, acute jaundice with
   findings of gallstones on RUQ US.
   .
   #. Acute jaundice: likely [**1-3**] gallstones with finding on RUQ US which
   could cause obstructive jaundice, however, no ductal dilatation or
   other abnomalities on ultrasound. No indication for cholangitis without
   fever, tenderness, or leukocytosis. Has no reported history of
   hyperlipidemia, or genetic disorders of bilirubin metabolism. Most
   consistent with obstructive jaundice as with pale stools and dark
   urine, and elevated alk phos. However, also with transaminitis which
   would indicate hepatic process such as acute hepatitis. No history of
   alcoholic liver disease or excessive tylenol use. No elevation in
   lipase to suggest pancreatic mass, pancreatitis. Albumin, platelets,
   coags normal so not suggestive of decreased liver function/liver
   failure.
   - plan for urgent ERCP in AM
   - keep NPO overnight
   - check hepatitis serologies, lipid panel
   - check hemolysis labs

   #. Chronic respiratory failure: s/p trach, vent dependent since '[**70**]. At
   home baseline, he is vent dependent, suctioned twice a day and is using
   a mechanical cough supplementation device. Patient without respiratory
   complaints currently.
   - continue home albuterol and atrovent standing nebs

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy who has been ventilator-dependent since 2010. He presented with acute onset of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, nausea, and acute jaundice. Gallstones were found on RUQ ultrasound, but there is no evidence of cholangitis or ductal dilation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, transaminitis, and normal albumin and platelet levels, suggesting an obstructive process rather than liver failure. An urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been planned. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute cholangitis: Although the patient's current ultrasound does not show any signs of cholangitis, it is essential to monitor for signs of infection such as fever, tenderness, and leukocytosis.
2. Hepatitis: The presence of transaminitis raises the possibility of acute hepatitis. Further evaluation of hepatitis serologies is needed.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms could be related to pancreatitis. However, the normal lipase levels make this less likely.
4. Hepatic failure: Although the patient's albumin and platelet levels are normal, the elevated alkaline phosphatase suggests an obstructive process rather than hepatic failure.
5. Respiratory failure: As a chronic ventilator-dependent patient, the patient is at risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, chronic ventilator dependency, who presented with acute onset of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, nausea, and acute jaundice. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure since tracheostomy placement, bronchiectasis, long QT interval, known right bundle branch block (RBBB), and open gastrostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) due to the presence of a filling defect resembling a stone in the lower common bile duct (CBD), which was successfully removed along with some sludge. The patient is currently in the ICU, where he is being monitored and managed for various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Obstructive Jaundice: The patient's symptoms of RUQ pain, nausea, and acute jaundice, along with findings of gallstones on RUQ ultrasound, suggest the possibility of obstructive jaundice. This condition occurs when the flow of bile from the liver is blocked, leading to elevated bilirubin levels. It is important to monitor the patient's liver function tests and bilirubin levels closely.

2. Hepatitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) indicate transaminitis, suggesting a possible hepatic process such as acute hepatitis. Further investigation and follow-up"

   39M with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, chronic vent dependency, with 3
   days RUQ pain, nausea originally admitted to MICU Green on the night of
   [**8-20**].  Left-sided PICC was placed in ICU on [**8-21**] [**1-3**] poor access and
   inability to draw labs.  Patient was seen by general surgery and ERCP.
   It was decided that patient should have ERCP.
   Patient was stable overnight and transferred East on [**8-21**] for ERCP.
   ERCP performed under MAC anesthesia.  ERCP significant for a filling
   defect that appeared like a stone in the lower [**12-4**] of the CBD.
   Sphincterotomy was performed, the stone along with some sludge was
   extracted.  The patient was stable post-procedure and transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] as he is ventilator-dependent [**1-3**] muscular dystrophy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, chronic ventilator dependency, and a history of multiple medical complications. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute onset of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, nausea, and acute jaundice. Initial workup revealed gallstones on RUQ ultrasound, but no ductal dilatation or other abnormalities. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure, which showed a filling defect resembling a stone in the lower common bile duct. The stone along with some sludge was extracted, and the patient was stable post-procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Jaundice: The patient's presentation of acute jaundice, along with the findings of gallstones on RUQ US, suggests obstructive jaundice. However, further evaluation is needed to confirm the cause and determine the appropriate management.

2. Hepatitis: The patient also exhibits transaminitis, indicating a possible hepatic process such as acute hepatitis. Additional testing should be done to rule out viral causes of hepatitis and assess liver function.

3. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure and is dependent on a ventilator. Regular monitoring and maintenance of the ventilator settings are essential to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   39M with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, chronic vent dependency,
   presenting with acute onset of RUQ pain, nausea, acute jaundice with
   findings of gallstones on RUQ US.
   .
   #. Acute jaundice: Patient with choledocolythiasis s/p ERCP yesterday.
   Jaundice and bilirubin improving with rest of LFTs stable. They are
   expected to improve slowly within the next days. Albumin, platelets,
   coags normal so not suggestive of decreased liver function/liver
   failure.
   - s/p ERCP with sphincterotomy on [**8-21**]
   - trend bili
   - Start liquids per PEG and then advance as tolerated
   - follow-up hepatitis serologies, lipid panel
   - hemolysis labs negative, hapto up, not down
   - General surgery following - Gold team ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1201**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) aware of case but
   not acute surgical intervention currently
   # Low serum bicarb/anion gap: Not consistend with patient
s picture for
   now. Most likely lab abnormality; all labs are abnormal. Will repeat
   and work up if abnormal
   -          Repeat Chem-7
   -          Work up if abnormal
   .
   #. Chronic respiratory failure: s/p trach, vent dependent since '[**70**]. At
   home baseline, he is vent dependent, suctioned twice a day and is using
   a mechanical cough supplementation device. Patient without respiratory
   complaints currently.
   - continue home albuterol and atrovent standing nebs
   - continue home vent settings
   - obtain cough assist from [**Hospital Ward Name **] to be administered [**Hospital1 **]
   -Send home ASAP, before hosp acquired bacteria!
   -PT therapy
   .
   #. Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy:
   - continue on home vent settings, turn patient to prevent ulcers
   .
   #. h/o long QT interval, known RBBB: Patient had prior holter monitor
   which revealed isolated PVC's and infrequent ventricular couplets.
   - check EKG with AM rounds
   - monitor in telemetry
   - avoid haldol or other medications which prolong QT
   .
   #. HTN
   - continue home lisinopril
   .
   #. FEN - NPO for now, can advance to clears in am
   .
   #. Access
 Pt is very hard access; one 20g PIV - patient a difficult
   stick and also needs better access for ERCP. L PICC placed [**8-21**].

","The patient is a 39-year-old male with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, chronic ventilator dependency, and a history of long QT interval and right bundle branch block. He presented with acute onset of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, nausea, and acute jaundice. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) yesterday, during which a stone and sphincterotomy were performed.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 117/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 700 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 7 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 21%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.11, indicating respiratory acidosis.

The patient has a distended abdomen with normal bowel sounds, and his extremities show trace edema bilaterally. Neurologically, he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and oriented to person, place, and time. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and albumin levels. Liver function tests reveal elevated bilir"

   #. Acute jaundice: likely [**1-3**] gallstones with finding on RUQ US which
   could cause obstructive jaundice, however, no ductal dilatation or
   other abnomalities on ultrasound. No indication for cholangitis without
   fever, tenderness, or leukocytosis. Has no reported history of
   hyperlipidemia, or genetic disorders of bilirubin metabolism. Most
   consistent with obstructive jaundice as with pale stools and dark
   urine, and elevated alk phos. However, also with transaminitis which
   would indicate hepatic process such as acute hepatitis. No history of
   alcoholic liver disease or excessive tylenol use. No elevation in
   lipase to suggest pancreatic mass, pancreatitis. Albumin, platelets,
   coags normal so not suggestive of decreased liver function/liver
   failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, chronic ventilator dependency, presenting with acute onset of RUQ pain, nausea, acute jaundice, and findings of gallstones on RUQ US. The patient has a history of long QT interval, known RBBB, chronic respiratory failure, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, hypertension, and fen. The patient underwent ERCP yesterday and had sphincterotomy. The patient's vital signs are stable, but the patient is distended. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute jaundice: The patient has acute jaundice with findings of gallstones on RUQ US. This could cause obstructive jaundice. However, no ductal dilatation or other abnormalities were noted on ultrasound. There is no indication for cholangitis without fever, tenderness, or leukocytosis. The patient has no reported history of hyperlipidemia or genetic disorders of bilirubin metabolism. Most consistent with obstructive jaundice with pale stools and dark urine, and elevated alk phos. However, also with transaminitis indicating a hepatic process such as acute hepatitis. No history of alcoholic liver disease or excessive tylenol use. No elevation in lipase to suggest pancreatic mass, pancreatitis. Albumin, platelets, coags normal so not suggestive of decreased liver function/liver failure.

","The patient is a 39-year-old male with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, chronic ventilator dependency, presenting with acute onset of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, nausea, and acute jaundice. Gallstones were found on RUQ ultrasound, but there is no evidence of ductal dilation or other abnormalities. The patient does not have a history of hyperlipidemia or genetic disorders of bilirubin metabolism. The symptoms are consistent with obstructive jaundice, as indicated by pale stools and dark urine, along with elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. However, there is also evidence of transaminitis, suggesting a hepatic process such as acute hepatitis. There is no history of alcoholic liver disease or excessive Tylenol use, and no elevation in lipase to suggest a pancreatic mass or pancreatitis. The patient's albumin, platelets, and coagulation profile are normal, indicating that there is no evidence of decreased liver function or liver failure.

The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy on August 21st. He will be trended bilaterally, kept NPO overnight, and advanced to clear liquids in the morning. Follow-up hepatitis serologies and lipid panel are recommended. Hemolysis labs are negative, and he should be monitored for potential hepatobiliary issues.

The patient has chronic respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. He is currently ventilator-dependent"

   Assessment and Plan
   39M with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, chronic vent dependency,
   presenting with acute onset of RUQ pain, nausea, acute jaundice with
   findings of gallstones on RUQ US.
   .
   #. Acute jaundice: likely [**1-3**] gallstones with finding on RUQ US which
   could cause obstructive jaundice, however, no ductal dilatation or
   other abnomalities on ultrasound. No indication for cholangitis without
   fever, tenderness, or leukocytosis. Has no reported history of
   hyperlipidemia, or genetic disorders of bilirubin metabolism. Most
   consistent with obstructive jaundice as with pale stools and dark
   urine, and elevated alk phos. However, also with transaminitis which
   would indicate hepatic process such as acute hepatitis. No history of
   alcoholic liver disease or excessive tylenol use. No elevation in
   lipase to suggest pancreatic mass, pancreatitis. Albumin, platelets,
   coags normal so not suggestive of decreased liver function/liver
   failure.
   - s/p ERCP with sphincterotomy on [**8-21**]
   - trend bili
   - keep NPO overnight, advance to clear liquids in am
   - follow-up hepatitis serologies, lipid panel
   - hemolysis labs negative, hapto up, not down
   - General surgery following - Gold team ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1201**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) aware of case but
   not acute surgical intervention currently
   .
   #. Chronic respiratory failure: s/p trach, vent dependent since '[**70**]. At
   home baseline, he is vent dependent, suctioned twice a day and is using
   a mechanical cough supplementation device. Patient without respiratory
   complaints currently.
   - continue home albuterol and atrovent standing nebs
   - continue home vent settings
   - obtain cough assist from [**Hospital Ward Name **] to be administered [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #. Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy:
   - continue on home vent settings, turn patient to prevent ulcers
   .
   #. h/o long QT interval, known RBBB: Patient had prior holter monitor
   which revealed isolated PVC's and infrequent ventricular couplets.
   - check EKG with AM rounds
   - monitor in telemetry
   - avoid haldol or other medications which prolong QT
   .
   #. HTN
   - continue home lisinopril
   .
   #. FEN - NPO for now, can advance to clears in am

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 39-year-old male with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, chronic ventilator dependency, presenting with acute onset of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, nausea, and acute jaundice.
- RUQ ultrasound showed findings consistent with gallstones, but no ductal dilatation or other abnormalities.
- The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy on [**8-21**].
- Lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, suggesting hepatic involvement such as acute hepatitis or obstructive jaundice.
- There are no signs of cholangitis, pancreatitis, or decreased liver function/liver failure.
- The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, dependent on mechanical ventilation since [**70**]. He uses a mechanical cough supplementation device at home and is currently without respiratory complaints.
- Other medical conditions include Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, long QT interval, known right bundle branch block (RBBB), hypertension, and a difficult IV access.
- The patient is currently on a 20g peripheral intravenous (PIV) line and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line placed on [**8-21**].
- Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with subcutaneous he"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, chronic ventilatory dependency, presenting with acute onset of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, nausea, and acute jaundice with findings of gallstones on RUQ ultrasound. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and has improving bilirubin levels and stable liver function tests (LFTs). The patient's albumin, platelets, and coagulation parameters are normal, indicating no signs of decreased liver function or liver failure. Liver serologies are negative. The patient's low serum bicarbonate/anion gap may be secondary to ketosis, and the patient does not have any respiratory complaints currently. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, long QT interval, known right bundle branch block (RBBB), hypertension, and is on mechanical ventilation at home. The patient had a prior holder monitor showing isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and infrequent ventricular couplets, which is consistent with DMD and known cardiomyopathies. The patient's blood pressure was in the 70s overnight and received a bolus of 500cc, and lisinopril was discontinued due to hypotensive episodes. The patient's potassium levels are low, and electrolytes should be monitored and replenished as needed. The patient has a PICC line in place and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, chronic ventilator dependency, and a recent history of RUQ pain, nausea, acute jaundice, and findings of gallstones on RUQ US. He underwent an ERCP procedure on [**8-21**] and has improving bilirubin and jaundice. His LFTs are holding steady. There are no signs of decreased liver function or liver failure, and liver serologies are negative. The patient's low serum bicarb/anion gap may be secondary to ketosis, but he is clinically doing well and asymptomatic. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Choledocholithiasis: The patient's symptoms of RUQ pain, nausea, acute jaundice, and gallstones on RUQ US indicate a possible complication of choledocholithiasis. This condition occurs when gallstones obstruct the common bile duct, leading to liver enzyme abnormalities and jaundice.

2. Cholecystitis: The presence of gallstones and the patient's symptoms suggest the possibility of cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder often caused by gallstones.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's low serum bicarb/anion gap and presence of ketones in the urine may indicate an AKI. This condition can be caused by various factors such as dehydration, sepsis, or nephrotoxic drugs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with a chief complaint of low blood pressure overnight, which prompted a bolus of 500cc fluids and discontinuation of lisinopril. The patient has allergies to penicillins, cephalosporins, and erythromycin base. He received levofloxacin antibiotics on 08/22/2178 at 04:19 PM. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). He has a history of diarrhea following the last dose of antibiotics.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C (98.8Â°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 79/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,815 mL, with 867 mL since 12 AM. Output includes 1,740 mL of IV fluids, 60 mL of PO intake, 1,920 mL of total output, 850 mL of blood products, and 895 mL of urine output.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, set at a volume-controlled mode (PCV+) with a tidal volume of 700 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 7 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 21%, and plateau pressure of 28 cmH2O.

Physical examination findings are not documented. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 276 K/uL, low hemoglobin (Hgb) of 14.8 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 71 mg/dL, low sodium (Na+) of 106 mEq/L, high potassium (K+) of 4.1 mEq/L, low calcium (Ca++) of 9.9 mg/dL, low magnesium (Mg++) of 1.9 mg/dL, and low phosphate (PO4) of 2.5 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient has been monitored with an arterial line, central venous pressure (CVP) line, and urinary catheter. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating ongoing hypotension. This could be due to sepsis, fluid loss, or medication effects.
2. Diarrhea: The patient experienced diarrhea after receiving antibiotics, which may indicate a gastrointestinal infection or side effect of the medication.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory status should be closely monitored for signs of worsening respiratory distress or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Infection: The elevated WBC count and presence of fever suggest a possible infection, which could be contributing to the patient's overall condition.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an excessive intake compared to output, indicating a risk of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema or cardiac dysfunction.
6. Renal dysfunction: The elevated BUN and low urine output suggest potential renal dysfunction, which can be caused by dehydration, sepsis, or nephrotoxic medications.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has several electrolyte abnormalities, including low sodium, high potassium"
