   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo M CHF, CAD s/p CABG, CKD, DM2, who presents with shortness of
   breath most likely due to CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # Probable Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - most likely etiology to
   dyspnea is CHF exacerbation based on increased JVP, LE edema, elevated
   BNP, and current weight of 150 lbs, up from b/l 135-138. ther is no
   evidence of acute cardiac ischemia. Pneumonia is a possibility, but
   with lack of fever/chills or elevated WBC count, this is less
   compelling. Low probability for PE as alternative diagnosis is much
   more compelling.
   -- strict I/Os and daily weights
   -- goal to diurese 1L/day with lasix/diuril (dry weight 135-138 lbs)
   -- low sodium diet, fluid restrict to 1.5L
   -- NIPPV as needed for increased WOB
   -- prn nebs
   -- repeat CXR in AM
   -- hold on antibiotics for now - low threshold to start if febrile or
   infiltrates fail to improve with diuresis
   -- check urine legionella, f/u urine culture and blood cultures
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG - ACS much less likely to explain acute presentation
   -- hold home BB in acute setting of CHF
   -- continue aspirin 81 mg daily
   -- no need for statin per recent cards eval
   -- monitor on tele
   -- trend CE's in AM to complete r/o
   .
   # CHB s/p PPM -
   -- pt is [**Name (NI) 1700**], monitor on tele
   .
   # Stage 4 CKD - Likely from HTN or DM nephropathy, Cr is mildly
   elevated from baseline of [**1-23**]
   -- check urine lytes
   -- trend Cr with diuresis
   -- renally dose meds
   .
   # Hyperkalemia - mild and likely related to mild worsening of RF
   -- no peaked T waves on EKG
   -- will aggressively diurese, may reduce K
   -- trend K, consider kayexylate if no improvement
   .
   # DM - well controlled, last HbA1C 6.1% in [**8-29**]
   -- RISS, check FS QID, diabetic diet
   -- continue asa for ppx
   -- hold oral hypoglycemic while in-house
   .
   # Elevated INR - chronic, deemed nutritional during previous
   hospitalizations given poor albumin and underlying nutrition
   -- will give vitamin K 10mg po x 1
   -- trend coags
   .
   # Anemia: Chronic, and without prior colonoscopy (deferred [**1-22**] age)
   -- recent iron studies not consistent with iron deficiency or ACD.
   -- No evidence of acute blood loss or hemolysis on prior admissions
   -- trend HCT
   .
   # BPH-treated as outpatient.
   -- hold flomax to allow for BP usage in diuresis
   .
   #FEN:
   -- PO low sodium heart healthy diet
   -- follow and replete electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with diuresis
   .
   #PPx:
   -- sub Q hep, bowel regimen, H2 blocker

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presents with shortness of breath, most likely due to CHF exacerbation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 112/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Physical examination reveals mild labored breathing with expiratory moaning, jugular venous distention to the jaw, regular rhythm with no murmurs, bilateral inspiratory crackles, and 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema below the knee. Laboratory findings include elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 3.4 mg/dL. 

The patient's medical plan includes strict intake and output monitoring, daily weights, goal diuresis of 1 liter per day with lasix/diuril (dry weight 135-138 lbs), low sodium diet, fluid restriction to 1.5 liters, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) as needed for increased work of breathing, and repeat chest X-ray in the morning.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presents with shortness of breath likely due to an exacerbation of CHF. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Probable acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient's symptoms, including LE edema, crackles, and jugular venous distention, have improved today. 
   - Continue to monitor strict intake/output (I/O) and daily weights.
   - Goal to diurese 1L today, administer 100IV lasix and 500IV diuril.
   - Maintain a low sodium diet and restrict fluids to 1.5L.
   - Provide nebulizers as needed.
   - Hold on antibiotics for now, but start if febrile or infiltrates fail to improve with diuresis.
   - Follow up with urine culture and blood cultures, urine legionella.

2. CAD s/p CABG:
   - Restart low-dose carvedilol for additional afterload reduction.
   - Continue aspirin 81 mg daily.
   - No need for statin per recent card evaluation.
   - Monitor on tele.
   - Follow up with a second set of cardiac enzymes to rule out.

3. CHB s/p PPM:
   - Patient is [**Name (NI) 1700**], monitor on tele.

4. Stage 4 CKD:
   - Likely from hypertension or DM nephropathy.
   - Creatinine is mildly elevated from a baseline of [**1-23**]. Urine lytes consistent with pre-renal state, likely from poor forward flow.
   - Trend Cr with diuresis.
   - Renally dose meds.

5. Hyperkalemia:
   - Resolving with diuresis. No peaked T waves on EKG.
   - Continue diuresis.
   - Trend K, consider kayexylate if no clear improvement.

6. DM:
   - Well controlled, last HbA1C 6.1% in [**8-29**].
   - RISS, check FS QID, diabetic diet.
   - Continue ASA for ppx.
   - Holding oral hypoglycemic while in-house.

7. Elevated INR:
   - Chronic, deemed nutritional during previous hospitalizations given poor albumin and underlying nutrition.
   - Administered vitamin K 10mg po x 1.
   - Trend coags.

8. Anemia:
   - Chronic, and without prior colonoscopy (deferred [**1-22**] age).
   - Recent iron studies not consistent with iron deficiency or ACD.
   - No evidence of acute blood loss or hemolysis on prior admissions.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). The patient presents with shortness of breath, likely due to a CHF exacerbation, but is currently improving with diuresis.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/57 mmHg to 118/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

Physical examination reveals mild agitation and labored breathing, jugular venous distension (JVD) improved but still elevated, inspiratory crackles at the lung bases, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows decreased strength in the right upper extremity.

Lab results indicate elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels, which have improved with diuresis. The patient has a history of chronic anemia, hyperkalemia, and elevated INR, all of which are being monitored and managed accordingly.

The patient's current plan includes continuing diuretic therapy to achieve a dry weight of 135-138 lbs, fluid restriction to 1.5"

","The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with acute decompensated CHF requiring non-invasive ventilation (BIPAP). He was able to wean off BIPAP and received Lasix and Diuril last night. However, he still experiences significant dyspnea in the morning but is also anxious and speaking with his son. The patient has allergies to sulfonamides and ACE inhibitors, causing cough, and proton pump inhibitor Pantoprazole Sodium resulting in rash.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/51 to 118/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. His heart rhythm is ventricular-paced, and he has received a total of 320-460 mL of IV fluids, with a total output of 680-995 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hb) at 8.0 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count at 4.0 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 3.4-3.5 mg/dL, blood glucose at 198 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) at 135 mEq/L, potassium (K+) at 4.3 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) at 24.3 %, calcium (Ca++) at 9.2 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) at 2.8 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) at 5.3 mg/dL. Other lab values include troponin-T at 0.02, CK at 17, CKMB at 0, PT/INR at 19.0/38.3, PTT at 1.8, and electrolyte levels within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory distress due to severe CHF exacerbation, acute and chronic CHF, chronic renal failure (CRF), anemia, and right hand weakness. The plan involves initiating Lasix to achieve negative fluid balance, closely monitoring the patient's condition, and restarting BIPAP if necessary. Renal function is near baseline, and no active bleeding or transfusion is required. Right hand weakness will be further evaluated with a head CT when the patient's respiratory status stabilizes."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with respiratory distress. He was able to be weaned off BIPAP and received Lasix and Diuril in the evening. The patient has allergies to sulfonamides and ACE inhibitors, causing a rash. He is currently on various medications including Furosemide, Heparin sodium, and others.

Review of Systems:
The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate ranging from 70-71 bpm, blood pressure between 107/51 mmHg and 118/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's blood gases show normal values.

Physical Examination:
The patient appears to be in bad mood with respiratory distress. His head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination is clear. The cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm. The chest examination shows upper airway congestion. The abdominal examination shows a soft non-tender abdomen. The extremities reveal right lower extremity edema.

Lab Results:
The patient's lab results indicate a hemoglobin level of 8"

1. Exacerbation of CHF: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and findings of leg edema, crackles, and JVP suggest acute exacerbation of CHF. This condition can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and hypoxemia.

2. Kidney injury: The patient has stage 4 CKD, which puts him at risk for further renal deterioration. Diuretic therapy may help manage fluid balance but should be closely monitored"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The patient presents with shortness of breath most likely due to CHF exacerbation, now improving with diuresis. Physical examination findings include bilateral leg edema, crackles at lung bases, and jugular venous distention (JVD). Laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels. The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix), famotidine (Pepcid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and carvedilol. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 99/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and physical examination findings such as bilateral leg edema, crackles at lung bases, and JVD suggest worsening of his CHF. If not managed properly, this condition can lead to further fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
2. Right-sided weakness: The patient"

   improving. CXR much improved after diuresis, arguing against PNA. Less
   clear improvement today, but does not appear worse.  Was able to
   achieve goal of -1 L yesterday.
   -- continue to monitor strict I/Os and daily weights
   -- goal to diurese -1L again today. Will change the lasix drip to 40mg
   IV x 1 and reassess UOP, if needed, will increase dose to achieve
   diuresis goal
   -- low sodium diet, fluid restricted to 1.5L
   -- prn nebs
   -- no antibiotics, f/u urine culture and blood cultures, urine
   legionella

   # R-sided weakness ? CVA: pt observed to have right hand weakness. Has
   been present for several days, long outside window for TPA. Given acute
   on chronic renal failure, will not tolerate IV contrast at this time.
   Will need to consider possible sources for embolic stroke. TTE and and
   Neuro consult after Head CT
   - Head CT
   - Neurology consult

   # CHB s/p PPM -
   -- pt is [**Name (NI) 1700**], monitor on tele
   .
   # Stage 4 CKD - Likely from HTN or DM nephropathy, Cr is mildly
   elevated from baseline of [**1-23**]. Urine lytes c/w pre-renal state, likely
   from poor forward flow.
   -- trend Cr with diuresis, not yet improved. [**Month (only) 51**] need to live at a new
   baseline Cr if CHF is worsening
   -- renally dose meds
   .
   # Hyperkalemia
 resolved with diuresis, this am 3.3. Repleated with

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presents with shortness of breath, likely due to CHF exacerbation, but is improving with diuresis. Physical examination findings include bilateral leg edema, crackles at lung bases, and jugular venous distention (JVD). Chest X-ray shows improvement after diuresis, suggesting against pneumonia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 119/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient's presentation of shortness of breath, leg edema, crackles, and JVD indicates a possible exacerbation of his chronic systolic CHF. Continued monitoring of strict intake/output (I/O) balance, daily weights, and diuretic therapy will be important in managing this condition.
2. Coronary artery disease (CAD) post CABG: The patient has a history of CAD, which has been treated with CABG. This increases the risk of recurrent cardiac events. It is important to consider further anti-is"
