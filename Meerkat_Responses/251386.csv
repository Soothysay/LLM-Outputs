   Assessment and Plan
   19 yo F with frequent UTIs presents with:
          Sepsis (hypotension, fevers, tachycardia)
          Pyelonephritis
          NAGMA
          Anemia
          Coagulopathy
   Agree with plan to treat for sepsis from pyelonephritis/UTI with
   continuing  broad empiric antbx (vanco, zosyn) adjusting per  cx data.
   No evidence of hydro/ obstruction on CT, but may benefit from urology
   f/u as outpt given frequent UTIs.  Will further clarify ? renal infarct
   seen on imaging with radiology. Hypotension has improved with
   aggressive IVFs, but remains tachy likely driven by fevers and pain.
   Making good urine and mentating normally. Will continue IVF boluses,
   changing to LR given NGMA. If decline or recurrent hypotension will
   place CVL for cvp and possibly pressors. Anemia is likely dilutional in
   setting of aggressive fluids though will monitor for hemolysis. Now
   also with coagulopathy.  Will follow cbc and check DIC panel.  Pain
   control and zofran for nausea.
   Remainder as per housestaff.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 19-year-old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) who presented with sepsis from pyelonephritis. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues including necrotizing fasciitis of the right calf, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute hepatic failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of sepsis puts her at risk for further complications such as organ failure, shock, and death if not appropriately managed.

2. Pyelonephritis: This infection of the kidney can lead to complications such as kidney abscesses, scarring, or chronic kidney disease if not treated effectively.

3. Necrotizing fasciitis of the right calf: This severe bacterial infection of the tissue under the skin can spread rapidly and cause life-threatening complications if not promptly treated. It may require surgical debridement and aggressive antibiotic therapy.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's AKI could progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly. This may result in long-term renal dysfunction and the need for dialysis.

5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): ARDS is a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure. Complications may include the need for mechanical ventilation and prolonged ICU stay.

6. Acute hepatic failure:"

","The patient is a 19-year-old female presenting with sepsis from pyelonephritis, frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and no known drug allergies. She was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime, broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient received a total of 7 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF) for hypotension and tachycardia. 

Upon evaluation, the patient's vital signs included a temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 128 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/58 to 130/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's blood culture was taken at 05:10 AM on 08/21/2110.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. Her medical history, social history, and family history remain unchanged as well.

The patient's 24-hour events include fever, blood culture taken, and receiving a total of 7 liters of IVF for hypotension and tachycardia. She underwent an abdominal ultrasound showing increased echogenicity/size of the right kidney, possible hepatitis, no stones or hydronephrosis. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the torso was performed, revealing no pulmonary embolism and right pyelonephritis. In the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 19-year-old female with no prior medical history, now presenting with urosepsis and likely pyelonephritis. She has shown improvement with stable blood pressures without the need for intravenous fluids. Antibiotic therapy will be tailored once sensitivities for E. coli are available. The patient's anemia will require further investigation with Fe studies, Vit B12, and folate levels. Imaging suggests possible hepatitis due to fluid resuscitation rather than an actual case of hepatitis. The patient's condition is being managed in the ICU with advancements to a regular diet, arterial line placement, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status remains as full code, and she is scheduled for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal dysfunction: The patient's current diagnosis of pyelonephritis and history of urosepsis indicate a potential risk for renal dysfunction. Monitoring kidney function through regular assessment of serum creatinine and urine output is essential.

2. Hepatitis: Although imaging suggests that the patient's hepatitis may be due to fluid resuscitation rather than an actual case of hepatitis, it is still important to monitor liver function and consider other possible causes.

3. Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit (Hct) levels indicate anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 19-year-old female with no prior medical history, now presenting with urosepsis likely secondary to pyelonephritis. She has shown improvement in blood pressure with intravenous fluids but remains tachycardic and febrile. The sepsis and pyelonephritis are being managed with appropriate antibiotics, continued IV fluids, and monitoring of vital signs. 

There are several potential medical complications to consider in this case. Firstly, there is a possibility of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) based on the elevated D-dimer levels, low platelet count, and prolonged INR. Further evaluation of a DIC panel is recommended to confirm this diagnosis. 

Secondly, the patient has anemia with a low hematocrit level. This could be due to dilutional effects from fluid resuscitation or early stages of DIC. Close monitoring and potential workup for anemia in the future should be considered.

Thirdly, the patient may have possible hepatitis indicated by imaging findings on the abdominal ultrasound. However, this is likely due to fluid resuscitation rather than actual hepatitis. Continued monitoring of liver function tests is advised.

Lastly, the patient's condition will need to be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration, particularly if there is worsening renal function or evidence of obstructive uropathy. Consideration for involvement of a urologist for potential surgical intervention may be necessary in such cases."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 19-year-old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) who presented with sepsis secondary to pyelonephritis. The patient has been receiving appropriate treatment including antibiotics (cefipime and vancomycin), pain management, and antiemetic medication. 

The patient's condition has improved, with stabilization of vital signs, resolution of fever, and improved urine output. Blood cultures and urine cultures have been obtained, with the urine culture positive for E. coli, which is pending sensitivity results. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia, likely due to dilutional effects from aggressive fluid resuscitation. Other lab values are within normal limits, except for elevated D-dimer levels. There are no signs of hemolysis or evidence of hydro/obstruction or abscess on CT scan. 

The patient's NAGMA, coagulopathy, and hypotension have resolved. The plan is to continue treating pyelonephritis with empiric Zosyn, awaiting culture sensitivities. Foley catheter and arterial line can be discontinued, and the patient can be advanced to a chair for out-of-bed activities. Pain control, nausea management, and ICU prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin will be continued. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent or recurrent UTIs: Given the patient's history of frequent UTIs, there is a risk of recurrent infections, which may lead to"

","The patient is a 19-year-old female with no prior medical history who is currently admitted to the ICU with urosepsis likely secondary to pyelonephritis. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.7°C (101.7°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 94/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is alert and oriented, with clear lung sounds bilaterally. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and the Foley catheter is draining clear urine. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 10.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, platelet count of 156 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose of 115 mg/dL, and a D-dimer level of 5975 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal ranges. Urine culture results indicate the presence of pan-sensitive Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is sensitive to several antibiotics including cefepime, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin. 

The patient is currently being treated with intravenous cefepime and vancomycin, but these medications will be discontinued and the patient will be switched to oral ciprofloxacin based on susceptibilities"

","Summary:
The patient is a 19-year-old female with no previous medical history who is currently admitted to the ICU for urosepsis likely secondary to pyelonephritis. She has been treated with vancomycin and cefepime, both of which will be discontinued today. She will start oral ciprofloxacin based on susceptibility results. Blood cultures from admission and the previous night's cultures are pending. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but she continues to have a fever. Anemia is present with a low hemoglobin level, but vitamin B12 and folate levels are normal. Iron level is low, but ferritin is within normal range. Hepatitis seen on imaging is most likely due to fluid resuscitation rather than hepatitis, as liver function tests are normal. The patient is currently on regular diet, and her glycemic control is being monitored. She has an 18-gauge arterial line and is receiving prophylactic heparin subcutaneously for deep vein thrombosis prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be transferred to the floor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Pyelonephritis: The patient is currently experiencing urosepsis likely secondary to pyelonephritis. If not properly managed, this condition can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock.
2. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, indicating anemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 19 yo F with no PMH now with urosepsis likely [**1-20**] pyelonephritis.
   #. Sepsis/pyelonephritis- pt improved now with stable BPs without IVF
   - d/c Vanc, continue Cefepime for now, will tailor abx therapy once
   sensitivities come back for E coli
   - d/c A-line
   - f/u blood cx
   #. Anemia- Hct continues to be low
   - Fe studies, Vit B12, folate
   #. Hepatitis on imaging: most likely due to fluid resuscitation rather
   than hepatitis.
   - nothing to pursue
