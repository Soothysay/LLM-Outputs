   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   This is an 80 year old man, in fairly good general health, who presents
   with acute illness and labs and imaging consistent with stones in the
   common bile duct leading to cholangitis.
   .
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
   Long expiratory phase suggestive of airway inflammation though no
   wheezing heard on exam and air movement remains intact.  This is most
   likely due to pleural fluid.  Other possible causes  include upper
   airway constriction, laryngeal spasm, although any upper airway
   restriction doesn
t seem to be the case.  ABG showed an AG and NAG
   metabolic acidosis with a respiratory acidosis.  AG acidosis most
   likely due to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis.  NAG likely due
   to NS IVF. His respiratory acidosis is concerning due to his inability
   to fully compensate for his metabolic acidosis.  In spite of
   noninvasive interventions, his repeat ABGs have not shown much change.
   - anesthesia c/s with plan to intubate
   - repeat abgs
   - f/u as outpt for potential OSA
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Consistent with sepsis. Requiring decreasing amount of levophed.
   Continue aggressive IVF boluses, hope to dial down levophed.
   - consider a-line placement
   - MAP>65
   - replace cvl
   .
   CHOLANGITIS
   Currently requiring levophed; recent call from [**Hospital3 474**] yields
   news of confirmed GNRs on blood cx consistent with clinical history
   suggesting bacteremia. While writing this note, went to and returned
   from ERCP and had a stent with reportedly copious drainage.
   - post ERCP labs 2 hrs post procedure -- amylase/lipase to eval for
   pancreatitis, liver labs as post-procedure baseline to eval for ongoing
   improvement/failure to improve over next day
   - dilaudid for pain
   - zosyn q6h, renal dosing at 2.25 g IV q6h, follow Cr
   - f/u with OSH cx which grew [**3-22**] GNRs
   - once clearly stable, transfer West to surgery, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to be
   attending
   - add on vanc + cipro for broader coverage
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   C/w sepsis-induced pre-renal failure. Follow lytes in setting of BP
   support and aggressive hydration.
   - UA and urine lytes if Cr not improving
   - check previous outside records for baseline Cr values
   .
   ABDOMINAL PAIN
   Consistent with cholangitis. Non-peritoneal exam before going to ERCP.
   Expect some post-procedure pain. Treat with dilaudid. Follow serial
   abdominal exams to eval for emerging peritoneal process. Lipase has
   significantly increased.  This is concerning for post-ERCP pancreatitis
   - get PM lipase level
   - serial abdominal exams
   - consider IVF maintenance fluids
   .
   HYPERTENSION
   Holding lisinopril in setting of bacteremia, pressor need, elevated
   creatinine, etc.

   FEN: NPO. Fluid boluses.
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, SC heparin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of acute illness. The note highlights several medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing prolonged expiratory phase, suggesting airway inflammation. This could be due to pleural fluid or other causes such as upper airway constriction or laryngeal spasm. The ABG showed metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis, indicating an inability to fully compensate for the metabolic acidosis.

2. Hypotension: The patient is showing signs of sepsis and requires decreasing amounts of levophed. Aggressive IV fluid boluses are being administered to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. Consideration should be given to placing an arterial line and replacing the central venous line.

3. Cholangitis: The patient has confirmed gram-negative rods (GNRs) on blood culture, suggesting bacteremia. An ERCP procedure was performed, resulting in the placement of a stent with copious drainage. Post-ERCP labs are needed to evaluate for pancreatitis, and liver labs should be monitored for ongoing improvement or failure to improve.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is showing signs of sepsis-induced pre-renal failure. Close monitoring of electrolytes is necessary, along with aggressive hydration. If the creatinine does not improve, a urine analysis and urine electrolytes should be considered. Previous outside records should"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male who presented with acute illness and laboratory results consistent with stones in the common bile duct leading to cholangitis. 

The patient is currently requiring norepinephrine (Levophed) and had a confirmed gram-negative rod bacteremia. An ERCP procedure was performed, with a stent placed and reportedly copious drainage. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the note include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing consistent hypotension, which may be related to sepsis. There is a plan to aggressively bolus intravenous fluids (IVF) and decrease the amount of Levophed as the patient's condition improves.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, likely due to an altered gastrointestinal (AG) acidosis and non-anion gap (NAG) metabolic acidosis. 

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, which is believed to be sepsis-induced pre-renal failure. The plan is to follow electrolytes closely in conjunction with aggressive hydration and blood pressure support.

4. Respiratory Distress: The patient exhibits a long expiratory phase, suggesting airway inflammation. While no wheezing is heard on examination, there is an intact air movement. The plan includes an electrocardiogram (EKG) post-procedure, a vital sign monitor"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   This is an 80 year old man, in fairly good general health, who presents
   with acute illness and labs and imaging consistent with stones in the
   common bile duct leading to cholangitis.
   .
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
   Long expiratory phase suggestive of airway inflammation though no
   wheezing heard on exam and air movement remains intact.  This is most
   likely due to pleural fluid.  Other possible causes  include upper
   airway constriction, laryngeal spasm, although any upper airway
   restriction doesn
t seem to be the case.  ABG showed an AG and NAG
   metabolic acidosis with a respiratory acidosis.  AG acidosis most
   likely due to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis.  NAG likely due
   to NS IVF. His respiratory acidosis is concerning due to his inability
   to fully compensate for his metabolic acidosis.  In spite of
   noninvasive interventions, his repeat ABGs have not shown much change.
   - anesthesia c/s with plan to intubate
   - repeat abgs
   - f/u as outpt for potential OSA
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Consistent with sepsis. Requiring decreasing amount of levophed.
   Continue aggressive IVF boluses, hope to dial down levophed.
   - consider a-line placement
   - MAP>65
   - replace cvl
   .
   CHOLANGITIS
   Currently requiring levophed; recent call from [**Hospital3 474**] yields
   news of confirmed GNRs on blood cx consistent with clinical history
   suggesting bacteremia. While writing this note, went to and returned
   from ERCP and had a stent with reportedly copious drainage.
   - post ERCP labs 2 hrs post procedure -- amylase/lipase to eval for
   pancreatitis, liver labs as post-procedure baseline to eval for ongoing
   improvement/failure to improve over next day
   - dilaudid for pain
   - zosyn q6h, renal dosing at 2.25 g IV q6h, follow Cr
   - f/u with OSH cx which grew [**3-22**] GNRs
   - once clearly stable, transfer West to surgery, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to be
   attending
   - add on vanc + cipro for broader coverage
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   C/w sepsis-induced pre-renal failure. Follow lytes in setting of BP
   support and aggressive hydration.
   - UA and urine lytes if Cr not improving
   - check previous outside records for baseline Cr values
   .
   ABDOMINAL PAIN
   Consistent with cholangitis. Non-peritoneal exam before going to ERCP.
   Expect some post-procedure pain. Treat with dilaudid. Follow serial
   abdominal exams to eval for emerging peritoneal process. Lipase has
   significantly increased.  This is concerning for post-ERCP pancreatitis
   - get PM lipase level
   - serial abdominal exams
   - consider IVF maintenance fluids
   .
   HYPERTENSION
   Holding lisinopril in setting of bacteremia, pressor need, elevated
   creatinine, etc.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old man who presented with acute illness and labs and imaging consistent with stones in the common bile duct leading to cholangitis. He has been diagnosed with several medical complications including respiratory distress, hypotension, cholangitis, acute renal failure, abdominal pain, and hypertension.

Respiratory Distress: The patient's long expiratory phase suggests airway inflammation, possibly due to pleural fluid. Other possible causes include upper airway constriction or laryngeal spasm. The ABG showed an AG and NAG metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis, likely due to lactic acidosis from sepsis and NS IVF. His respiratory acidosis is concerning due to his inability to fully compensate for his metabolic acidosis.

Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is consistent with sepsis. He requires decreasing amounts of levophed, indicating a need for aggressive IVF boluses to maintain blood pressure and potentially dial down levophed.

Cholangitis: The patient has confirmed GNRs on blood culture consistent with bacteremia. He underwent ERCP with stent placement and reportedly copious drainage. Post-ERCP labs are pending to evaluate for pancreatitis and ongoing improvement or failure to improve over the next day.

Acute Renal Failure: The patient has pre-renal failure likely secondary to sepsis-induced hypotension. Follow-up with serial labs and consider"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   This is an 80 year old man, in fairly good general health, who presents
   with acute illness and labs and imaging consistent with stones in the
   common bile duct leading to cholangitis.
   .
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
   Long expiratory phase suggestive of airway inflammation though no
   wheezing heard on exam and air movement remains intact.  This is most
   likely due to pleural fluid.  Other possible causes  include upper
   airway constriction, laryngeal spasm, although any upper airway
   restriction doesn
t seem to be the case.  ABG showed an AG and NAG
   metabolic acidosis with a respiratory acidosis.  AG acidosis most
   likely due to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis.  NAG likely due
   to NS IVF. His respiratory acidosis is concerning due to his inability
   to fully compensate for his metabolic acidosis.  In spite of
   noninvasive interventions, his repeat ABGs have not shown much change.
   - anesthesia c/s with plan to intubate
   - repeat abgs
   - f/u as outpt for potential OSA
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Consistent with sepsis. Requiring decreasing amount of levophed.
   Continue aggressive IVF boluses, hope to dial down levophed.
   - consider a-line placement
   - MAP>65
   - replace cvl
   .
   CHOLANGITIS
   Currently requiring levophed; recent call from [**Hospital3 474**] yields
   news of confirmed GNRs on blood cx consistent with clinical history
   suggesting bacteremia. While writing this note, went to and returned
   from ERCP and had a stent with reportedly copious drainage.
   - post ERCP labs 2 hrs post procedure -- amylase/lipase to eval for
   pancreatitis, liver labs as post-procedure baseline to eval for ongoing
   improvement/failure to improve over next day
   - dilaudid for pain
   - zosyn q6h, renal dosing at 2.25 g IV q6h, follow Cr
   - f/u with OSH cx which grew [**3-22**] GNRs
   - once clearly stable, transfer West to surgery, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to be
   attending
   - add on vanc + cipro for broader coverage
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   C/w sepsis-induced pre-renal failure. Follow lytes in setting of BP
   support and aggressive hydration.
   - UA and urine lytes if Cr not improving
   - check previous outside records for baseline Cr values
   .
   ABDOMINAL PAIN
   Consistent with cholangitis. Non-peritoneal exam before going to ERCP.
   Expect some post-procedure pain. Treat with dilaudid. Follow serial
   abdominal exams to eval for emerging peritoneal process. Lipase has
   significantly increased.  This is concerning for post-ERCP pancreatitis
   - get PM lipase level
   - serial abdominal exams
   - consider IVF maintenance fluids
   .
   HYPERTENSION
   Holding lisinopril in setting of bacteremia, pressor need, elevated
   creatinine, etc.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old man with acute illness and labs and imaging consistent with stones in the common bile duct leading to cholangitis. The patient's respiratory distress may be due to pleural fluid, upper airway constriction, or laryngeal spasm. There is an AG and NAG metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis, likely caused by lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis and NS IVF. The patient's respiratory acidosis is concerning due to his inability to fully compensate for his metabolic acidosis.

The patient is experiencing hypotension consistent with sepsis, requiring decreasing amounts of levophed. There is a concern for acute renal failure due to sepsis-induced pre-renal failure. The patient has cholangitis, which is being treated with antibiotics and ERCP. There is also abdominal pain consistent with cholangitis, which may be due to post-ERCP pancreatitis.

The patient has hypertension, but lisinopril is being held in the setting of bacteremia, pressor need, elevated creatinine, etc. The patient is currently in the ICU, with plans for ongoing management and monitoring."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   This is an 80 year old man, in fairly good general health, who presents
   with acute illness and labs and imaging consistent with stones in the
   common bile duct leading to cholangitis.
   .
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
   ABG shows an AG and NAG metabolic acidosis with a respiratory
   acidosis.  AG acidosis most likely due to lactic acidosis in the
   setting of sepsis.  However, his NAG acidosis seems to be the
   predominant cause for his overall acidosis.  This is likely due to NS
   IVF or acute renal failure in lieu of his Cr bumping up to 2.9 this
   morning. He seems to be able to have respiratory compensation.
   - check urine anion gap to differentiate between ARF vs. NS IVF for the
   cause of his NAG acidosis
   - repeat abgs
   - 1L LR with consideration for bicarb if ABG does not improve
   - maintain on current vent settings
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   C/w sepsis-induced pre-renal failure. Urine lytes show a FeNa of 0.5,
   pointing to a prerenal cause.  Follow lytes in setting of BP support
   and aggressive hydration.
   - 1L LR as stated above for hydration in setting of his ARF of prerenal
   cause
   - monitor Cr levels
   - check previous outside records for baseline Cr values
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Consistent with sepsis. Requiring decreasing amount of levophed.
   Continue aggressive IVF boluses, hope to dial down levophed.
   - MAP>65 with LR IVF as needed
   .
   CHOLANGITIS
   Currently requiring levophed; recent call from [**Hospital3 474**] yields
   news of confirmed GNRs on blood cx consistent with clinical history
   suggesting bacteremia.  WBC is increasing although he remains afebile.
   - dilaudid for pain
   - continue zosyn q6h, renal dosing at 2.25 g IV q6h, follow Cr, vanc,
   and cipro
   - f/u with OSH cx  speciation which grew [**3-22**] GNRs
   - once clearly stable, transfer West to surgery, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to be
   attending
   - f/u on our cx
   .
   ABDOMINAL PAIN
   Consistent with cholangitis. Non-peritoneal exam before going to ERCP.
   Expect some post-procedure pain. Treat with dilaudid. Follow serial
   abdominal exams to eval for emerging peritoneal process. Lipase has
   significantly increased.  This is concerning for post-ERCP pancreatitis
   - post ERCP labs have shown amylase/lipase less than [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8414**], which
   carries a very low risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis
   - follow amylase/lipase levels
   - serial abdominal exams after weaning off sedation
   .
   HYPERTENSION
   Holding lisinopril in setting of bacteremia, pressor need, elevated
   creatinine, etc.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old man who presents with acute illness and labs and imaging consistent with stones in the common bile duct leading to cholangitis. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory distress, acute renal failure, hypotension, cholangitis, abdominal pain, and hypertension.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure with a significant increase in creatinine levels. There is a risk of worsening renal function and the need for renal replacement therapy.
3. Sepsis: The patient is septic with confirmed bacteremia and positive cultures for Gram-negative rods. There is a risk of septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
4. Cholangitis: The patient has cholangitis due to stones in the common bile duct. There is a risk of worsening infection, biliary sepsis, and possible need for biliary intervention.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's lipase levels have significantly increased, which is concerning for post-ERCP pancreatitis. There is a risk of pancreatic necrosis and complications related to pancreatitis.
6. Hypotension: The patient requires pressor support with levophed, indicating significant hypotension. There is"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo male with admission with sepsis with cholangitis as source and
   subsequent respiratory failure with sever metabolic acidosis and
   subsequent respiratory acidosis leading to intubation.
   1)Sepsis-
   -Vanco/Cipro/Zosyn
   -levophed to wean as possible
   -Will keep CVP at 10 and have very reasonable ScVO2 support has been
   adequate at this time.
   -LR for bolus as needed
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -Very well tolerated A/C support with a relatively small contribution
   from hypoxemia driving need for ventilatory support.
   _Versed decreased to 3 this morning/Fentanyl
   -Continue with A/C support
   3)Acidosis-He retains a significant metabolic acidosis which this

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   This is an 80 year old man, in fairly good general health, who presents
   with acute illness and labs and imaging consistent with stones in the
   common bile duct leading to cholangitis.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: s/p intubation. ABG on admission showed an AG
   and NAG metabolic acidosis with a respiratory acidosis.  Barriers to
   extubation include continued metabolic acidosis, altered mental status
   and bilateral pleural effusion.
   - change from AC to PS [**11-25**], check ABG
   - will ultimately need to diurese pt before extubation when his BP is
   more stable
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Pt continues to have anion gap and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis.  AG acidosis most likely due to lactic acidosis in
   the setting of sepsis and renal failure.  However, his NAG acidosis
   seems to be the predominant cause for his overall acidosis.  This is
   likely due to NS IVF or acute renal failure.  A positive UAG suggests
   impaired renal acidification (ie renal tubular acidosis I or IV, or
   renal failure). Given that patient had no h/o RTA, this is most likely
   renal failure-caused acidosis.
   - continue to monitor with ABGs
   - use LR for IVF boluses
   - no bicarb is indicated at this time
   - continue to monitor renal function
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: C/w sepsis-induced pre-renal failure [**1-20**]  ATN.
   Urine lytes show a FeNa of 0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause.  Pt
   appears to be in a diuresis phase.
   - Follow lytes in setting of BP support and aggressive hydration.
   - monitor Cr levels
   - check previous outside records for baseline Cr values
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Consistent with sepsis. Requiring decreasing amount of
   levophed. Continue aggressive IVF boluses, hope to dial down levophed.
   On levophed 0.05 now.
   - MAP>65 with LR IVF as needed
   - continue vanc, cipro and zosyn for cholangitis, and refine abx when
   culture come back
   .
   # CHOLANGITIS:
   Currently requiring levophed; recent call from [**Hospital3 474**] yields
   news of confirmed GNRs on blood cx consistent with clinical history
   suggesting bacteremia.  WBC is increasing although he remains afebile.
   - dilaudid for pain
   - continue zosyn q6h, renal dosing at 2.25 g IV q6h, follow Cr, vanc,
   and cipro
   - f/u with OSH cx  speciation which grew [**3-22**] GNRs
   - once clearly stable, transfer West to surgery, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to be
   attending
   - f/u on our cx
   .
   # ABDOMINAL PAIN
   Consistent with cholangitis. Non-peritoneal exam before going to ERCP.
   Expect some post-procedure pain. Treat with dilaudid. Follow serial
   abdominal exams to eval for emerging peritoneal process. Lipase has
   significantly increased.  This is concerning for post-ERCP pancreatitis
   - post ERCP labs have shown amylase/lipase less than [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8414**], which
   carries a very low risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis
   - follow amylase/lipase levels
   - serial abdominal exams after weaning off sedation
   .
   # HYPERTENSION
   Holding lisinopril in setting of bacteremia, pressor need, elevated
   creatinine, etc.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old man who presented with acute illness and labs and imaging consistent with stones in the common bile duct leading to cholangitis. He is currently in the ICU and requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient has several medical complications, including metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, hypotension, cholangitis, abdominal pain, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient continues to have anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. This is likely due to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis and renal failure. Monitoring with ABGs and using LR for IVF boluses are recommended. No bicarb is indicated at this time.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's urine lytes show a FeNa of 0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause. He appears to be in a diuresis phase. It is important to follow lytes in the setting of BP support and aggressive hydration. Monitor Cr levels and check previous outside records for baseline Cr values.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is consistent with sepsis. Aggressive IVF boluses and decreasing amounts of levophed are being used to maintain MAP > 65. Continue vanc, cipro, and zosyn for cholangitis, and refine abx when cultures come back.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   This is an 80 year old man, in fairly good general health, who presents
   with acute illness and labs and imaging consistent with stones in the
   common bile duct leading to cholangitis.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
   ABG shows an AG and NAG metabolic acidosis with a respiratory
   acidosis.  AG acidosis most likely due to lactic acidosis in the
   setting of sepsis.  However, his NAG acidosis seems to be the
   predominant cause for his overall acidosis.  This is likely due to NS
   IVF or acute renal failure in lieu of his Cr bumping up to 2.9 this
   morning. He seems to be able to have respiratory compensation.
   - check urine anion gap to differentiate between ARF vs. NS IVF for the
   cause of his NAG acidosis
   - repeat abgs
   - 1L LR with consideration for bicarb if ABG does not improve
   - maintain on current vent settings
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   C/w sepsis-induced pre-renal failure. Urine lytes show a FeNa of 0.5,
   pointing to a prerenal cause.  Follow lytes in setting of BP support
   and aggressive hydration. A positive UAG suggests impaired renal
   acidification (ie renal tubular acidosis).
   - 1L LR as stated above for hydration in setting of his ARF of prerenal
   cause
   - monitor Cr levels
   - check previous outside records for baseline Cr values
   .
   # HYPOTENSION
   Consistent with sepsis. Requiring decreasing amount of levophed.
   Continue aggressive IVF boluses, hope to dial down levophed.
   - MAP>65 with LR IVF as needed
   .
   # CHOLANGITIS
   Currently requiring levophed; recent call from [**Hospital3 474**] yields
   news of confirmed GNRs on blood cx consistent with clinical history
   suggesting bacteremia.  WBC is increasing although he remains afebile.
   - dilaudid for pain
   - continue zosyn q6h, renal dosing at 2.25 g IV q6h, follow Cr, vanc,
   and cipro
   - f/u with OSH cx  speciation which grew [**3-22**] GNRs
   - once clearly stable, transfer West to surgery, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to be
   attending
   - f/u on our cx
   .
   # ABDOMINAL PAIN
   Consistent with cholangitis. Non-peritoneal exam before going to ERCP.
   Expect some post-procedure pain. Treat with dilaudid. Follow serial
   abdominal exams to eval for emerging peritoneal process. Lipase has
   significantly increased.  This is concerning for post-ERCP pancreatitis
   - post ERCP labs have shown amylase/lipase less than [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8414**], which
   carries a very low risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis
   - follow amylase/lipase levels
   - serial abdominal exams after weaning off sedation
   .
   # HYPERTENSION
   Holding lisinopril in setting of bacteremia, pressor need, elevated
   creatinine, etc.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old man who presented with acute illness and imaging consistent with stones in the common bile duct leading to cholangitis. He has respiratory distress, acute renal failure, hypotension, cholangitis, abdominal pain, and hypertension. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving IV fluids, and being treated with antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has respiratory distress with a respiratory acidosis seen on ABG. There is a need to monitor his respiratory status closely for any signs of worsening respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure with an increase in serum creatinine levels. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte imbalances is necessary. The positive urine anion gap suggests impaired renal acidification, possibly due to renal tubular acidosis.

3. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension is consistent with sepsis. Aggressive IV fluid administration and careful monitoring of blood pressure are essential. Decreasing the need for vasopressors, such as levophed, is a priority.

4. Cholangitis: The patient has cholangitis secondary to common bile duct stones. Continued antibiotic therapy with Zosyn, Vancomycin, and Cipro is necessary. Close follow-up with cultures and clinical improvement is expected.

5. Post-ERCP Pancreatitis: Although the patient"

   with acute illness and labs and imaging consistent with stones in the
   common bile duct leading to cholangitis.

   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: s/p intubation. ABG on admission showed an AG
   and NAG metabolic acidosis with a respiratory acidosis.  Barriers to
   extubation include continued metabolic acidosis, altered mental status
   and bilateral pleural effusion.
   - change from AC to PS [**11-25**], check ABG
   - will ultimately need to diurese pt before extubation when his BP is
   more stable
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Pt continues to have anion gap and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis.  AG acidosis most likely due to lactic acidosis in
   the setting of sepsis and renal failure.  However, his NAG acidosis
   seems to be the predominant cause for his overall acidosis.  This is
   likely due to NS IVF or acute renal failure.  A positive UAG suggests
   impaired renal acidification (ie renal tubular acidosis I or IV, or
   renal failure). Given that patient had no h/o RTA, this is most likely
   renal failure-caused acidosis.
   - continue to monitor with ABGs
   - use LR for IVF boluses
   - no bicarb is indicated at this time
   - continue to monitor renal function

   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: C/w sepsis-induced pre-renal failure [**1-20**]  ATN.
   Urine lytes show a FeNa of 0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause.  Pt
   appears to be in a diuresis phase.
   - Follow lytes in setting of BP support and aggressive hydration.
   - monitor Cr levels
   - check previous outside records for baseline Cr values
   .
   # Sepsis: Likely source is cholangitis. Requiring decreasing amount of
   levophed. On levophed 0.05 now.
   - continue to wean levophed
   - MAP>65 with LR IVF as needed
   - goal CVP>10, ScvO2 >70%
   - continue vanc, cipro and zosyn for cholangitis, and refine abx when
   culture come back
   - continue to hold home lisinopril given hypotension

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old man who presented with acute illness and labs and imaging consistent with stones in the common bile duct leading to cholangitis. The patient has several medical complications that require close monitoring and management. 

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is intubated and requires ongoing respiratory support. Barriers to extubation include continued metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, and bilateral pleural effusion. The plan is to change from assisted control ventilation (AC) to pressure support (PS) mode, check arterial blood gas (ABG), and ultimately need to diurese the patient before extubation when his blood pressure is more stable.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient continues to have anion gap (AG) and non-anion gap (NAG) metabolic acidosis. The AG acidosis is likely due to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis and renal failure. However, the NAG acidosis seems to be the predominant cause for his overall acidosis, which is likely due to normal saline intravenous fluid (NS IVF) or acute renal failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo male with cholangitis and sepsis with subsequent respiratory
   failure in the setting of severe metabolic acidosis.  He has had a
   plateau in creatinine level but retains signficant pressor requirement
   and in that setting has had a decrease in WBC count.
   1) SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)-clearly biliary source as
   most likely and have some evidence of improvement with improvement in
   WBC and paucity of fever.  As far as source we do have a pan sensitive
   E. Coli in place.
   -Continue with Vanco/Cipro
   -Levophed at low dose continues and will look to wean
   -patient is apparently volume replete
   2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   -Versed and Fentanyl off since yesterday
   -Will move to PSV at this time
   -Barriers to extubation are
    mental status
versed/fentanyl held
   Acidemia
improved as renal function improves
   3)Acidemia
Metabolic Acidosis-
   -Does appear to be related to renal failure and saline
   -Will continue with LR for any fluild
   4)Acute Renal Failure
Likely ATN
   -Do see increase in urine flow
   -Do hope to see trend to improved creatinine across time as we move
   through the post ATN recovery phase
but this will have to be seen.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with cholangitis and sepsis who has developed respiratory failure. He has severe metabolic acidosis and a decrease in white blood cell count. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, pressors, and pain management. He is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's condition seems to be improving with better urine output and decreased fever. However, he still requires a significant amount of pressor support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a bacterial infection that has led to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. If not properly managed, sepsis can progress to septic shock and multiple organ failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and extubation failure if weaning from the ventilator is attempted prematurely.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a significant metabolic acidosis, which can lead to further organ dysfunction if not corrected. It is important to address the underlying cause of the acidosis and provide appropriate treatment.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. If left untreated, AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease and lead to complications such as fluid and electrolyte imbalances, anemia, and increased risk of infections.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   This is an 80 year old man, in fairly good general health, who presents
   with acute illness and labs and imaging consistent with stones in the
   common bile duct leading to cholangitis.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: s/p intubation. ABG on admission showed an AG
   and NAG metabolic acidosis with a respiratory acidosis.  Barriers to
   extubation include continued metabolic acidosis, altered mental status
   and bilateral pleural effusion. This morning, he also vomited with
   possibility for aspiration
   - maintain on current vent settings while monitoring for fevers,
   chills, bump in WBC
   - CXR tomorrow
   - if stable tomorrow, plan for SBT and eventual wean off vent.
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Pt continues to have a non-anion gap metabolic
   acidosis.  AG acidosis seems to be resolved, most likely due to lactic
   acidosis in the setting of sepsis and renal failure.  His NAG acidosis
   seems to be the predominant cause for his overall acidosis.  This is
   likely due to NS IVF and acute renal failure.  A positive UAG suggests
   impaired renal acidification (ie renal tubular acidosis I or IV, or
   renal failure). Given that patient had no h/o RTA, this is most likely
   renal failure-caused acidosis.
   - continue to monitor with ABGs
   - use LR for IVF maintenance at 125cc/hr
   - no bicarb is indicated at this time
   - continue to monitor renal function
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: C/w sepsis-induced pre-renal failure [**1-20**]  ATN.
   Urine lytes show a FeNa of 0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause.  Pt
   appears to be in a diuresis phase.
   - Follow lytes in setting of BP support and aggressive hydration.
   - monitor Cr levels
   - check previous outside records for baseline Cr values
   .
   # Sepsis: Likely source is cholangitis. Weaned off of levaphed today
   - MAP>65 with LR IVF as needed
   - goal CVP>10, ScvO2 >70%
   - continue vanc, cipro and zosyn for cholangitis, and refine abx when
   culture come back
   - continue to hold home lisinopril given hypotension
   .
   # CHOLANGITIS:  [**Hospital3 474**] blood cx grew out pan-sensitive
   E.coli.
   - dilaudid for pain
   - continue vanc, cipro and zosyn for cholangitis, and refine abx when
   culture come back
   - f/u on our cx
   - once clearly stable, transfer West to surgery, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to be
   attending
   - post ERCP labs have shown amylase/lipase less than [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8414**], which
   carries a very low risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis
   - follow amylase/lipase levels
   - serial abdominal exams after weaning off sedation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old man with acute illness and imaging consistent with stones in the common bile duct leading to cholangitis. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient is intubated and has a history of vomiting with a possibility for aspiration. There is also evidence of bilateral pleural effusion. The patient's current ventilator settings need to be maintained while monitoring for fevers, chills, and any changes in vital signs. A chest X-ray tomorrow will help assess the progression of the effusion and guide further management.

2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient continues to have a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis and renal failure. The positive UAG suggests impaired renal acidification, which may be caused by renal tubular acidosis I or IV, or renal failure. Close monitoring with ABGs and renal function tests is necessary. Adjustments in IV fluids and electrolyte management should be made accordingly.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has developed sepsis-induced pre-renal failure followed by acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Aggressive hydration and close monitoring of renal function are crucial.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   This is an 80 year old man, in fairly good general health, who presents
   with acute illness and labs and imaging consistent with stones in the
   common bile duct leading to cholangitis.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: s/p intubation. ABG on admission showed an AG
   and NAG metabolic acidosis with a respiratory acidosis.  Barriers to
   extubation include continued metabolic acidosis, altered mental status
   and bilateral pleural effusion.
   - change from AC to PS [**11-25**], check ABG
   - will ultimately need to diurese pt before extubation when his BP is
   more stable
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Pt continues to have anion gap and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis.  AG acidosis most likely due to lactic acidosis in
   the setting of sepsis and renal failure.  However, his NAG acidosis
   seems to be the predominant cause for his overall acidosis.  This is
   likely due to NS IVF or acute renal failure.  A positive UAG suggests
   impaired renal acidification (ie renal tubular acidosis I or IV, or
   renal failure). Given that patient had no h/o RTA, this is most likely
   renal failure-caused acidosis.
   - continue to monitor with ABGs
   - use LR for IVF boluses
   - no bicarb is indicated at this time
   - continue to monitor renal function
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: C/w sepsis-induced pre-renal failure [**1-20**]  ATN.
   Urine lytes show a FeNa of 0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause.  Pt
   appears to be in a diuresis phase.
   - Follow lytes in setting of BP support and aggressive hydration.
   - monitor Cr levels
   - check previous outside records for baseline Cr values
   .
   # Sepsis: Likely source is cholangitis. Requiring decreasing amount of
   levophed. On levophed 0.05 now.
   - continue to wean levophed
   - MAP>65 with LR IVF as needed
   - goal CVP>10, ScvO2 >70%
   - continue vanc, cipro and zosyn for cholangitis, and refine abx when
   culture come back
   - continue to hold home lisinopril given hypotension
   .
   # CHOLANGITIS:  Currently requiring levophed; [**Hospital3 474**] blood cx
   grew out pan-sensitive E.coli.  WBC is increasing although he remains
   afebile.
   - dilaudid for pain
   - continue vanc, cipro and zosyn for cholangitis, and refine abx when
   culture come back
   - f/u on our cx
   - once clearly stable, transfer West to surgery, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to be
   attending
   - post ERCP labs have shown amylase/lipase less than [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8414**], which
   carries a very low risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis
   - follow amylase/lipase levels
   - serial abdominal exams after weaning off sedation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of acute illness and imaging consistent with stones in the common bile duct leading to cholangitis. He presented with respiratory distress and was intubated. The patient continues to have metabolic acidosis, with both anion gap (AG) and non-anion gap (NAG) metabolic acidosis. The AG acidosis is likely due to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis and renal failure, while the NAG acidosis seems to be the predominant cause for his overall acidosis, likely due to IV fluids or acute renal failure. The patient also has acute renal failure, with a urine sodium fractional excretion (FeNa) of 0.5, pointing to a pre-renal cause. He is in a diuresis phase. The patient's sepsis is likely originating from cholangitis, and he is currently requiring levophed. Blood cultures have grown out pan-sensitive E.coli, and the patient is being treated with appropriate antibiotics. The patient's current condition includes poor mental status, haziness involving the lower portion of the lungs bilaterally with layering pleural effusions and adjacent compressive atelectasis, and low platelets. He has been given 2L NS boluses, changed to pressure support (PS) mode on the ventilator, and is awaiting further evaluation and management.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo male with presentation with cholangitis and with ERCP
   decompression complicated by sepsis with subsequent respiratory failure
   in the setting of severe metabolic acidosis.  He has been able to wean

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male who presented with cholangitis and underwent ERCP decompression. He developed sepsis, leading to respiratory failure and severe metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition has improved, with a decrease in ventilator support, increased urine flow, and declining creatinine levels. However, he maintains mild non-gap metabolic acidosis with a bicarbonate level of 17. There are concerns about aspiration due to episodes of emesis, but suctioning has been effective in clearing secretions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient is still on antibiotics, and pressor agents have been weaned off. The biliary source remains dominant.
2. Acute respiratory failure (not ARDS): The patient will be weaned off sedation further to allow for spontaneous breathing trials. PSV support will be maintained at current settings and re-evaluated with an ABG. Antibiotics will continue to be administered.
3. Cholangitis: Enzyme levels are improving, with expected biliary lag.
4. Metabolic acidosis: This is likely secondary to renal failure and normal saline administration. Urine flow and creatinine levels are improving, indicating hope for resolution of acidosis.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has experienced a significant decrease in platelet count. Monitoring will continue, and HIT antibodies have been sent for testing due to concerns about potential hepar"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male who presented with cholangitis and underwent ERCP decompression. He developed sepsis, which led to respiratory failure in the context of severe metabolic acidosis. The patient's current condition includes sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), cholangitis, and metabolic acidosis. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient already has sepsis with organ dysfunction, and it can potentially lead to multiple organ failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, and if not properly supported, there is a risk of worsening respiratory distress or respiratory arrest.
3. Cholangitis: The patient has cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile ducts. If left untreated or inadequately managed, it can progress to more severe infections or complications.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has severe metabolic acidosis. If not corrected promptly, it can lead to further deterioration of organ function, including the cardiovascular system.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, there is still a risk of developing blood clots,"

   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: s/p intubation. ABG on admission showed an AG
   and NAG metabolic acidosis with a respiratory acidosis.  Barriers to
   extubation include continued metabolic acidosis, altered mental status
   and bilateral pleural effusion. Yesterday morning he vomited with
   possibility for aspiration
   - maintain on current vent settings while monitoring for fevers,
   chills, bump in WBC
   - f/u CXR final read from this morning for possible evidence of
   aspiration pneumonia
   - plan for SBT and eventual wean off vent.
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Pt continues to have a non-anion gap metabolic
   acidosis.  AG acidosis seems to be resolved, most likely due to lactic
   acidosis in the setting of sepsis and renal failure.  His NAG acidosis
   seems to be the predominant cause for his overall acidosis.  This is
   likely due to NS IVF and acute renal failure.  A positive UAG suggests
   impaired renal acidification (ie renal tubular acidosis I or IV, or
   renal failure). Given that patient had no h/o RTA, this is most likely
   renal failure-caused acidosis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of acute illness, presenting with laboratory findings and imaging consistent with stones in the common bile duct leading to cholangitis. He has been intubated due to respiratory distress, and his current condition includes metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, sepsis, and cholangitis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with controlled blood pressure and heart rate within normal ranges. His respiratory support consists of mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's physical examination reveals slight icteric sclera, dry mucous membranes, regular heart rhythm, and clear lung sounds bilaterally. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows bilateral pleural effusion, which is slightly worse than yesterday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory distress and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma due to high airway pressures.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient continues to have a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 80 year old man previously in fairly good general health,
   who presented with cholangitis associated with stones in the common
   bile duct, and respiratory failure in the setting of severe AG and
   non-AG metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: s/p intubation. ABG on admission showed an AG
   and NAG metabolic acidosis with a respiratory acidosis.  Barriers to
   extubation include continued metabolic acidosis and altered mental
   status. Yesterday morning he vomited, today
s CXR didn
t show evidence
   of aspiration pneumonia. No significant increase in WBC either.  His
   CXR significantly improved today compared to yesterday.
   - d/c propofol
   - monitor mental status after propofol is d/c
   - attempt SBT and extubation today
   - continue regular suctioning

   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Pt continues to have a non-anion gap metabolic
   acidosis.  AG acidosis seems to be resolved. His NAG acidosis seems to
   be the predominant cause for his overall acidosis.  This is likely due
   to NS IVF and acute renal failure.  A positive UAG suggests impaired
   renal acidification (ie renal tubular acidosis I or IV, or renal
   failure). Given that patient had no h/o RTA, this is most likely renal
   failure-caused acidosis.

   Disposition: ICU care
","The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of cholangitis and respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU for further management and has been intubated. 

Key points from the progress note include:

1. The patient vomited yesterday but there were no signs of aspiration on chest X-ray, and his white blood cell count is not significantly elevated. His chest X-ray has improved compared to yesterday.

2. The patient's mental status remains altered, which is a barrier to extubation. Propofol was discontinued and he was monitored for mental status changes. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation were attempted today.

3. The patient continues to have a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal saline intravenous fluids and acute renal failure. Renal function is improving, but it is unclear what the baseline renal function is.

4. The patient has sepsis likely originating from cholangitis. He was treated with antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, and the source of infection was identified as E. coli, which was sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Other antibiotics were discontinued.

5. The patient has acute renal failure, which appears to be pre-renal in nature. His urine sodium fractional excretion (FeNa) is low, indicating a pre-renal cause. Renal function is being monitored, and diuresis is ongoing.

6. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholang"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He was admitted with ascending cholangitis and E. coli sepsis, which resulted in multiorgan failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been responding to antibiotics with recovery of organ systems. However, he still has ongoing acute respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure could progress to ARDS, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.

2. Sepsis: Despite responding to antibiotics, there is a risk of recurrent sepsis due to the underlying E. coli infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not adequately managed.

3. Multiorgan failure: The patient's current multiorgan failure may worsen if not properly supported. This could result in further deterioration of vital organ functions.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.

5. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is still compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. There is a possibility of further deterioration in renal function if not managed appropriately.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is at an increased risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male admitted with ascending cholangitis, E. coli sepsis, and multiorgan failure resulting in respiratory failure and acidosis. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and is showing improvement in organ function. However, the patient still has ongoing acute respiratory failure with minimal spontaneous breathing efforts (MS) being the major barrier to extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and there may be a risk of further deterioration or prolonged respiratory support.
2. E. coli sepsis/ascending cholangitis: Although the patient appears to be appropriately treated with antibiotics, there is still a risk of recurrent infection or complications related to the sepsis.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are improving but may not have a clear baseline. There is a risk of ongoing renal dysfunction or deterioration.
4. Feeding tube (FEN): The patient is currently NPO due to plans for extubation. There is a risk of malnutrition or inadequate nutritional support if not managed appropriately.
5. Other complications: The patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction, and there may be additional complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or other infections."

   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: now resolved. AG acidosis was likely [**1-20**] to
   lactate, uremia. NAG acidosis seems to be the predominant cause for his
   overall acidosis, likely due to NS IVF and acute renal failure.  A
   positive UAG suggests impaired renal acidification (ie renal tubular

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of cholangitis, respiratory failure, severe metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure. He presented with stones in the common bile duct and was treated with ERCP. The patient was extubated and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen. His vital signs are stable, and he is well perfused. However, there are concerns about potential complications such as aspiration pneumonitis, leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, sepsis, acute renal failure, cholangitis, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient may have aspirated recently, which could lead to aspiration pneumonitis. Monitoring clinically and through a chest X-ray is important to detect any signs of aspiration pneumonitis.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is trending up, indicating a possible brewing infection, possibly from a pulmonary source or due to bacteremia post-ERCP.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: Although the patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, it was initially caused by non-anion gap (NAG) acidosis likely due to NS IVF and acute renal failure. Monitoring renal function and using lactated Ringer's solution for IV fluids are recommended.

4. Sepsis: The likely source of sepsis is cholangitis. The patient is off pressors, and OSH blood"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old man previously in good health who presented with cholangitis and respiratory failure due to severe acute kidney injury (AKI) and non-AKI metabolic acidosis. He was intubated and received mechanical ventilation. The patient's current status includes ongoing non-anion gap metabolic acidosis likely caused by acute renal failure, sepsis with a likely source of cholangitis, and resolving thrombocytopenia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is extubated today, but barriers to extubation include continued metabolic acidosis and altered mental status. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of respiratory distress or failure.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient continues to have a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is likely due to acute renal failure. Close monitoring of electrolytes and arterial blood gases (ABGs) is necessary.
3. Sepsis: The patient is likely suffering from sepsis with a likely source of cholangitis. Maintaining adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), mixed venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), and urine output (UOP) is important in managing sepsis.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but ongoing monitoring of creatinine levels is essential. The patient appears to be in a diuresis phase currently.

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of ascending cholangitis and E. coli sepsis who has undergone stenting and is experiencing multiorgan failure. He initially presented with shock, respiratory failure, and renal failure but responded well to antibiotics, resulting in the recovery of his organ systems. However, he still has ongoing acute respiratory failure.

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted events above. The patient's allergies include Valium (oral), which causes agitation.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and pantoprazole (Protonix). The last doses of antibiotics were administered on 09/12/2010 at 04:20 AM (piperacillin/tazobactam) and 12:05 PM (vancomycin). The patient also received a dose of ciprofloxacin on 09/13/2010 at 12:03 PM. Additionally, the patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) at 08:12 PM on 09/13/2010.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), a heart rate of 69 beats per minute (bpm) with a normal range of 59-79 bpm, a blood pressure of 130/60 mmHg with a range of 103/50-139/66 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with a normal range of 17-25 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg with a normal range of -2 to 13 mmHg, fluid intake totaling 660 mL and 202 mL over the past 24 hours, output including 60 mL of urine output and 120 mL of stool output, and a total balance of -3,520 mL and -859 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula with a pressure support ventilation (PSV)/synchronized breath-to-breath (SBT) mode, with a pressure of 5 cmH2O, peak end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 3%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are as follows: pH: 22, PaCO2: 22 mmHg, PaO2: 92 mmHg, HCO3-: 20 mEq/L, and base excess: -3 mEq/L.
