   vodka;
   No empty medication bottles were found, no precipitant or obvious
   trigger per friend; does take ativan at home, unclear how many he took
   if he took any
   Became unresponsive starting the morning of [**1-18**] He was not responsive
   to her commands and she let him ""sleep it off.""  -Yesterday has
   intermittent periods of able to wiggle toes on command, squeez finger,
   open and close eyes.
   -repeat CK yesterdayimproved 6500, troponin, repeat HCT was 31.8 from
   35 (likely secondary to hydration, near baseline, but we should
   follow)
   -Continued IV hydration at 200 cc/hr (is now +7 L balance)
   -In evening, was increasingly somnolent with abdominal breathing;
   difficult to arouse, normal O2 sats, RR 25-30.  Got ABG which was
   pretty unremarkable: 7.43 46 152 on 2L O2.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with h/o ETOH abuse, prostate CA, gastrectomy presents after
   drinking binge and being down for 24 hours from home with somnolence,
   found to have a RLL aspiration pneumonia, lactic acidosis, and
   rhabdomyolysis.
   .
   #  Altered mental status:  Continues to be altered but is arousable.
   Differential includes alcohol and benzodiazepine overdose, although
   EtOH was negative on admission with +benzos.  Unclear how many benzos
   he took.  Other possibilities include non-convulsive seizures in
   setting of alcohol withdrawal, however this is less likely as he is
   arousable and can follow some commands.  Underlying infection is also a
   possibility; meningitis R/O given normal CSF; ROS is significant for
   productive cough with brownish-green sputum.  Is afebrile with no
   leukocytosis.
   -Obtain neuro consultation given prolonged mental status change with ?
   EEG monitoring to evaluate for non-convulsive seizures and ? if any
   other imaging is indicated
   -Obtain CXR this AM and follow up read
   -Follow up blood cultures from [**1-18**]
   -Follow up sputum gram stain and culture from this AM
   -Continue thiamine, folate, MVI

   # Aspiration Pneumonia - History of recent ETOH binge. Infiltrate on
   CXR/CT ab consistent with aspiration event.
   - cover with Vanc/Levaquin/flagyl
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - f/u blood cultures
   -continued suctioning for secretions
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis - Per ED report, was lying in same spot for 24 hours.
   Has pressure sores on right axilla/hip supporting this.
   -CK trending down from 10,000 to 6000
   -f/u CK from this AM: as long as CK continuing to trend down, would
   hold off on further aggressive IV hydration given +7 L fluid balance at
   this point
   -can start maintenance fluids as not taking POs
   -follow UOP

   # ETOH Abuse - received vitamins in ED
   - thiamine, folate, MVI
   - trend LFTs
   - CIWA for now, unclear exactly when last drink was (? 36 hours prior
   to arrival on floor)
   -social work consult today

   # Right Puborectalis Hematoma
   - trend HCT, active type and screen, follow coags: is stable, fell from
   35 -> 31, but stable between 31-32 on repeated checks, recent fall
   likely dilutional
   -difficult to clinically assess hematoma: would continue [**Hospital1 7**] HCT checks
   for now; if < 28 would rescan to evaluate since the hematoma is hard to
   follow clinically
   -f/u surgery team recs

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 10958**]
s note above, including the assessment and plan. I would
   emphasize and add the following points:
   - Additional history obtained
 does take ativan but unclear how much
   he took, no empty bottles found.  Intermittent periods of following
   commands, last night increasingly somnolent
 only withdrawing to
   pain.  ABG PCO2 with 46.
   - Hct dropped to 31, then repeat stable at 32.
   - Frequent brownish secretions.  Responds to simple commands, lifting
   Tm99.5 P95-115.  BP119-140.  RR20-35.  98% on 2L NC. I/O +7L.
   Very somnolent, unintelligible speech.  Limited exam.  Following some
   commands, able to lift legs off bed and moves all 4
s withdrawing to
   pain, though noted to move R spontaneous less than L.  Normal tone
   throughout, neck supple.  Toes downgoing, few beats clonus in LE.
   PERRL.  Responsive to commands intermittently, breath sounds decreased
   b/l.  Abd soft +BS NT.  No edema.  R axilla blistering area appears
   stable to improved; R hip area appears improved.
   WBC 8.5, stable.
   ALT/AST 95/219.  Na 145, Cl 110 Bicarb 26 AG 9
   CK 6530  Lactate 1.2
   CXR low lung vol no acute infiltrate.
   Meds include vanc / flagyl / levoflox, thiamine.
   Sputum gram stain 3+ GPC polys.
   58 y/o with prostate cancer here, prior Hep C, EtOH abuse, here with
   persistently altered mental status in setting of EtOH binge (etoh level
   on admit of 0), + benzos on tox (has ativan at home).
   Overall picture still confusing, gradual improvement c/w overdose with
   tox +benzos but history that obtained does not suggest large benzo
   overdose, and mental status waxing / [**Doctor Last Name 533**].  In addition, still
   concern for initial seizure activity (so possible still having
   subclinical sz, though no activity witnessed), and also with ?decreased
   mvmt RUE and possible plexus injury from being down.  Agree with plan
   to check ammonia level, neuro consult for persistent delirium, seizure
   ?EEG, ?brachial plexus injury, continue antibiotics for suspected
   aspiration pna while awaiting sputum cx, resp care including
   sunctioning.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, prostate cancer, and gastrectomy. He presented to the hospital after a drinking binge and was found to be unresponsive for 24 hours. He has an altered mental status, which may be due to alcohol and benzodiazepine overdose. Other possible causes include non-convulsive seizures in the setting of alcohol withdrawal, underlying infection, or meningitis. The patient also has aspiration pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, and a right puborectalis hematoma. His anemia is likely due to chronic inflammation, and he has hypertension but is currently normotensive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Overdose of alcohol and benzodiazepines.
2. Non-convulsive seizures.
3. Underlying infection, such as meningitis.
4. Aspiration pneumonia.
5. Rhabdomyolysis.
6. Right puborectalis hematoma.
7. Anemia of chronic inflammation.
8. Hypertension.

Note: The patient's condition is critically ill, and further evaluation and treatment are necessary."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, prostate cancer, and gastrectomy. He presented after a drinking binge and was found unresponsive for 24 hours. He is currently in the ICU with altered mental status, right lower lobe aspiration pneumonia, lactic acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status can be attributed to alcohol and benzodiazepine overdose, non-convulsive seizures in the setting of alcohol withdrawal, underlying infection such as meningitis, or prolonged mental status change.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a history of recent alcohol binge and infiltrate on CXR/CT consistent with aspiration event. This increases the risk of respiratory complications like pneumonia.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's prolonged immobility and pressure sores suggest rhabdomyolysis. This condition can lead to kidney damage and electrolyte imbalances.
4. ETOH Abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and ongoing management is necessary to prevent further complications related to alcohol consumption.
5. Right Puborectalis Hematoma: The patient has a hematoma, which requires monitoring of hematocrit levels and potential surgical evaluation.
6. Anemia: The patient's baseline hematocrit levels are low, indicating anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate"

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, prostate cancer, and gastrectomy who presents with somnolence after a drinking binge. He was found to have right lower lobe aspiration pneumonia, lactic acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis.

The patient's altered mental status continues, with possible causes including alcohol and benzodiazepine overdose. However, EtOH was negative on admission, and the patient denies taking benzodiazepines. An EEG and MRI/MRA of the head/neck have been ordered to evaluate for non-convulsive seizures.

The patient has aspiration pneumonia, likely secondary to his recent alcohol binge. His sputum culture showed gram-positive cocci in clusters and chains. Treatment includes vancomycin and continued suctioning for secretions.

The patient also has rhabdomyolysis, which is supported by pressure sores on his right axilla/hip and a high CK level. Maintenance fluids will be continued until the patient can take significant PO, and follow-up UOP will be monitored.

The patient's ETOH abuse is being managed with vitamins, observation for withdrawal symptoms, and social work consult.

Right arm swelling/erythema is present, but imaging and ultrasound have ruled out DVT and compartment syndrome. Vancomycin has been started for possible cellulitis.

A right puborectalis hematoma is noted, with a decreasing Hct. Type and screen have been ordered, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, prostate cancer, and gastrectomy. He presented with somnolence after a drinking binge and was found to have right lower lobe aspiration pneumonia, lactic acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis. The patient's mental status remains altered but he is arousable. Differential diagnosis includes alcohol and benzodiazepine overdose, non-convulsive seizures in the setting of alcohol withdrawal, and underlying infection such as meningitis. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving antibiotics, thiamine, folate, and MVI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a history of recent ethanol binge and evidence of aspiration on chest X-ray/CT abdomen. He is at risk for further aspiration events, which can lead to worsening pneumonia and respiratory failure.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has evidence of rhabdomyolysis likely due to prolonged immobility. This condition can lead to kidney injury and acute kidney failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Ethanol Withdrawal: Given the patient's history of ethanol abuse and uncertain timing of the last drink, there is a risk of developing severe ethanol withdrawal symptoms such as seizures and delirium tremens.
4. Infection: Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, the patient may develop secondary infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or bloodstream infection, especially if the"

   58 yo M with h/o ETOH abuse, prostate CA, gastrectomy presents after
   drinking binge and being down for 24 hours from home with somnolence,
   found to have a RLL aspiration pneumonia, lactic acidosis, and
   rhabdomyolysis.
   .
   #  Altered mental status:  Continues to be altered but is arousable.
   Differential includes alcohol and benzodiazepine overdose, although
   EtOH was negative on admission with +benzos.  Unclear how many benzos
   he took.  Other possibilities include non-convulsive seizures in
   setting of alcohol withdrawal, however this is less likely as he is
   arousable and can follow some commands.  Underlying infection is also a
   possibility; meningitis R/O given normal CSF; ROS is significant for
   productive cough with brownish-green sputum.  Is afebrile with no
   leukocytosis.
   -Obtain neuro consultation given prolonged mental status change with ?
   EEG monitoring to evaluate for non-convulsive seizures and ? if any
   other imaging is indicated
   -Obtain CXR this AM and follow up read

","Summary:
The patient presented with somnolence and developed a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit. They were sent for sputum, urine, and blood cultures. Neurological consultation was sought, and an MRA and EEG were recommended due to suspected benzodiazepine toxicity. The patient's mental status gradually improved throughout the night. Acute right upper extremity swelling and erythema occurred, but plain films did not show any fractures. A right upper extremity ultrasound was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). There were concerns about compartment syndrome, and orthopedic consultation was obtained. Compartmental manometry was performed and came back negative. Erythema and swelling may be secondary to cellulitis, so vancomycin therapy was initiated. The patient has allergies to NSAIDs. The last doses of antibiotics given were metronidazole, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. The patient is receiving pantoprazole, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the new symptoms mentioned above.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:
1. Benzodiazepine toxicity: The patient's altered mental status and need for EEG and MRA suggest the possibility of benzodiazepine toxicity.
2. Cellulitis: The patient's acute right upper extremity swelling and eryth"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with h/o ETOH abuse, prostate CA, gastrectomy presents after
   drinking binge and being down for 24 hours from home with somnolence,
   found to have a RLL aspiration pneumonia, lactic acidosis, and
   rhabdomyolysis.
   .
   #  Altered mental status:  Continues to be altered but is arousable.
   Differential includes alcohol and benzodiazepine overdose, although
   EtOH was negative on admission with +benzos.  Unclear how many benzos
   he took.  Other possibilities include non-convulsive seizures in
   setting of alcohol withdrawal, however this is less likely as he is
   arousable and can follow some commands.  Underlying infection is also a
   possibility; meningitis R/O given normal CSF; ROS is significant for
   productive cough with brownish-green sputum.  Is afebrile with no
   leukocytosis.
   -Obtain neuro consultation given prolonged mental status change with ?
   EEG monitoring to evaluate for non-convulsive seizures and ? if any
   other imaging is indicated
   -Obtain CXR this AM and follow up read
   -Follow up blood cultures from [**1-18**]
   -Follow up sputum gram stain and culture from this AM
   -Continue thiamine, folate, MVI
   .
   # Aspiration Pneumonia - History of recent ETOH binge. Infiltrate on
   CXR/CT ab consistent with aspiration event.
   - cover with Vanc/Levaquin/flagyl
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - f/u blood cultures
   -continued suctioning for secretions
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis - Per ED report, was lying in same spot for 24 hours.
   Has pressure sores on right axilla/hip supporting this.
   -CK trending down from 10,000 to 6000
   -f/u CK from this AM: as long as CK continuing to trend down, would
   hold off on further aggressive IV hydration given +7 L fluid balance at
   this point
   -can start maintenance fluids as not taking POs
   -follow UOP
   .
   # ETOH Abuse - received vitamins in ED
   - thiamine, folate, MVI
   - trend LFTs
   - CIWA for now, unclear exactly when last drink was (? 36 hours prior
   to arrival on floor)
   -social work consult today
   .
   # Right Puborectalis Hematoma
   - trend HCT, active type and screen, follow coags: is stable, fell from
   35 -> 31, but stable between 31-32 on repeated checks, recent fall
   likely dilutional
   -difficult to clinically assess hematoma: would continue [**Hospital1 7**] HCT checks
   for now; if < 28 would rescan to evaluate since the hematoma is hard to
   follow clinically
   -f/u surgery team recs
   .
   # Anemia - Baseline HCT 33-35, appeared hemoconcentrated on
   presentation. MCV low. Iron studies from [**9-30**] with low TIBC, low iron,
   normal ferritin c/w anemia of chronic inflammation.
   - trend as above given hematoma
   .
   # Hypertension - Normotensive since admit
   - hold home po regimen, resume once mental status improves to take po

   His mental status seems slowly to be improving but still signif
   delerious. We still have no good explanation for what happened.  Thigh
   hematoma suggests some trauma.  Along with RUE edema apparently c/w
   pressure injury. Plan is for EEG, MRI today.  We are continuing Vanco
   with ? cellulitis in UE and GPC in sputum but so far sputum cx is no

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's mental status is improving slowly, but they are still delirious. The cause of their condition is unknown. The patient has a thigh hematoma, suggesting trauma, as well as right upper extremity edema, which may indicate a pressure injury. An EEG and MRI have been ordered for further investigation. The patient is being treated with vancomycin for cellulitis in the upper extremity and ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus (GPC) in the sputum, although the sputum culture shows no growth. The patient is critically ill and currently receiving ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pressure injury: The patient's right upper extremity edema may lead to the development of a pressure injury if not properly managed.
2. Thigh hematoma: The presence of a thigh hematoma suggests possible trauma, which could result in additional complications if not addressed.
3. Delirium: The patient's ongoing delirium requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
4. Infection: The presence of cellulitis in the upper extremity and GPC in the sputum indicates potential infections. Proper antibiotic therapy and infection control measures should be implemented to prevent worsening of these conditions.
5. Critical illness: The patient's critical condition necessitates close monitoring and management in the ICU to prevent further deterioration."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, prostate cancer, and gastrectomy. He presented to the hospital after a binge drinking episode and was found to have right lower lobe aspiration pneumonia, lactic acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis. The patient's mental status has improved, but he initially denied taking benzodiazepines and later admitted to taking three Klonopin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's history of recent alcohol binge and infiltrate on chest X-ray/CT scan consistent with aspiration event suggests aspiration pneumonia. Treatment includes antibiotics (vancomycin) and continued suctioning for secretions.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's prolonged immobility and pressure sores on the right axilla/hip indicate rhabdomyolysis. Treatment involves maintaining fluids and monitoring urine output.
3. Right Arm Swelling/Erythema: Although a DVT was ruled out by ultrasound and compartment manometry was negative for compartment syndrome, the patient's right upper extremity swelling and erythema should be monitored closely.
4. Right Puborectalis Hematoma: The patient's hematocrit level is stable, and active type and screen have been initiated. Follow-up with the surgery team's recommendations is necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic inflammation, as indicated by low TIBC, low"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is altered mental status. The patient's condition has improved, and their mental status is now clear. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient may be at risk for rhabdomyolysis due to immobilization or pressure injuries. This condition occurs when muscle breakdown releases myoglobin into the bloodstream, which can lead to kidney damage.

2. Pneumonia, aspiration: The patient may be at risk for pneumonia due to poor dentition and the presence of an endotracheal tube. Aspiration pneumonia occurs when foreign material enters the lungs, leading to infection.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has pressure injuries, which are slowly resolving. These injuries can increase the risk of infection and delay healing.

4. HIV infection: The patient is concerned about HIV and is asking for an HIV test. High concern for active infection should be addressed promptly.

5. Thrush: The patient is being treated for thrush, indicating an oral fungal infection. This can be a common complication in critically ill patients.

6. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is receiving subcutaneous UF heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. This is important to prevent blood clots in immobilized patients.

7. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is also receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis, which is commonly given"
