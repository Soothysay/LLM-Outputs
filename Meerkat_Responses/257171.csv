 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   76 y/o male with multiple medical problems and respiratory failure,
   presenting s/p vertebrectomy and epidural abscess drainage with septic
   shock.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Likely secondary to PNA given time course,
   fever, clinical exam.  Will expand to cover gram negatives, anerobes
   (although no witnessed aspiration) with Zosyn, double cover pseudomonas
   with ciprofloxacin. There is a component of atelectasis given ileus and
   abdominal distension as well as post-op pain.  PE would be on
   differential but less likely given lung findings and proximity to
   orthopedic event.  Patient also having frequent mucous plugging with
   secretions.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP
   - Wean off vent as tolerated
   - Nebulizers for wheezing
   .
   # Fever: Likely secondary to pneumonia/sepsis.
   - f/u sputum/blood/urine CX
   - Empiric coverage as above.
   .
   # Illeus: Continued secretions from NGT, beginning to have bowel
   movements with digital disimpaction.  Resolving ileus.
   - Cap NGT and drain this afternoon to determine volume of secretions
   - Bowel regimen
   .
   # Anemia:  Stable, but goal to have hct closer to 30 in the setting of
   septic shock.
   - Transfuse 2 units PRBC today
   .
   # DM: Continue insulin sliding scale, adjusted dose downwards given NPO
   status.
   .
   # Osteomyelitis s/p vertebrectomy: Continue vancomycin per ID
   recommendations, pain control, regular care per orthopedics.
   - Contact ortho re: anticoagulation with Lovenox following surgery
   .
   # Sinus Tachycardia: Likely secondary to stress, infection.  No
   evidence of ischemia on EKG.  Will continue to follow.
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding medications at this time, will titrate as
   needed.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mildly altered in context of multiple
   physiologic insults, post-operative.  Will continue to follow.
   Currently interactive and following commands; will monitor mental
   status once weaned off vent.
   .
   FEN: Maintenace @ 100cc/hr, replete electrolytes, NPO--will require
   speech & swallow once stable.
   .
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, will d/w ortho if needs to be on
   lovenox.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with multiple medical problems and respiratory failure. He presented after undergoing a vertebrectomy and epidural abscess drainage with septic shock. The patient is currently intubated, sedated but interactive, and follows commands. He has a history of osteomyelitis, pneumonia, hypotension, ileus, anemia, diabetes mellitus, sinus tachycardia, hypertension, and altered mental status.

24-hour events include invasive ventilation, insertion of a subclavian central line, arterial line placement, blood cultures drawn from central and arterial lines, and sputum culture via ETT. The patient also had a fever of 102.8°F. There were episodes of low blood pressure requiring fluid boluses, and the patient needed to be weaned off Levophed due to stable blood pressure. The patient required 6 boluses of normal saline IV fluid overnight. 

The patient has allergies to no known drugs and has received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and ciprofloxacin. He is currently receiving midazolam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications.

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 39.3°C, current temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/"

   # Respiratory distress: Likely secondary to PNA given timecourse,
   fever, clinical exam.  Will expand to cover gram negatives, anerobes
   (although no witnessed aspiration) with Zosyn, double cover pseudomonas
   with ciprofloxacin. There is a component of atelectasis given ileus and
   abdominal distension as well as post-op pain.  PE would be on
   differential but less likely given lung findings and proximity to
   orthopedic event.  Patient also having frequent mucous plugging with
   secretions.
   - Broaden ABX as above for HAP
   - Goal O2 > 90
   - Frequent suctioning for secretions
   - Consider intubation if patient unable to maintain airway.
   - Repeat ABG
   - Nebulizers for wheezing
   .
   # Fever: Likely secondary to pnemonia.
   - Obtain sputum/blood/urine CX
   - Empiric coverage as above.
   .
   # DM: Continue insulin sliding scale, adjusted dose downwards given NPO
   status.
   .
   # Osteomyelitis s/p vertebrectomy: Continue vancomycin per ID
   recommendations, pain control, regular care per orthopedics.
   .
   # Sinus Tachycardia: Likely secondary to stress, infection.  No
   evidence of ischemia on EKG.  Will continue to follow.
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding medications at this time, will titrate as
   needed.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mildly altered in context of multiple
   physiologic insults, post-operative.  Will continue to follow.
   .
   # Illeus: Continue NGT, serial abdominal examinations.
   .
   FEN: Maintenace @ 100cc/hr, replete electrolytes, NPO--will require

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with multiple medical problems who is experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. 

The patient's condition includes pneumonia, osteomyelitis, hypotension, delirium, ileus, and altered mental status. The pneumonia is suspected to be caused by gram-negative diplococci, anaerobes, and possibly pseudomonas. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 73/40 to 127/60 mmHg, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. 

Imaging reveals right basilar consolidation concerning for infection and persistent left retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis but cannot exclude infection. 

The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, heparin sodium, and vancomycin. 

The patient's care plan includes broadening antibiotic coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia, frequent suctioning for secretions, consideration of intubation if unable to maintain airway, repeat arterial blood gas analysis, and nebulizers for wheezing.

   # Respiratory distress: Likely secondary to PNA given time course,
   fever, clinical exam.  Will expand to cover gram negatives, anerobes
   (although no witnessed aspiration) with Zosyn, double cover pseudomonas
   with ciprofloxacin. There is a component of atelectasis given ileus and
   abdominal distension as well as post-op pain.  PE would be on
   differential but less likely given lung findings and proximity to
   orthopedic event.  Patient also having frequent mucous plugging with
   secretions. Extubated the morning of [**11-23**].
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP
   - Discontinue cipro given micro data and [**Male First Name (un) 344**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with multiple medical problems who presented with respiratory failure and septic shock after undergoing vertebrectomy and epidural abscess drainage. The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including respiratory failure, osteomyelitis, pneumonia (other), hypotension (not shock), and altered mental status. 

The patient's respiratory distress is likely secondary to pneumonia given the time course, fever, and clinical exam. The plan is to expand antibiotic coverage to include gram-negative and anaerobic organisms with Zosyn, and double cover pseudomonas with ciprofloxacin. 

The patient's ileus has been addressed by keeping the nasogastric tube in place as a safety mechanism, discontinuing proton pump inhibitor due to no longer being intubated, and implementing a bowel regimen.

The patient's anemia has been managed by transfusing 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**11-22**], but the goal is to have a hematocrit closer to 30 in the setting of septic shock. 

The patient's diabetes mellitus is being managed with an insulin sliding scale, adjusted downwards due to the patient's NPO status.

Osteomyelitis secondary to the vertebrectomy is being treated with continued vancomycin per ID recommendations, pain control, and regular care per orthopedics.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with multiple medical problems who is currently in the ICU. He underwent a vertebrectomy and epidural abscess drainage and experienced septic shock. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory distress secondary to pneumonia. There is also a component of atelectasis due to ileus and abdominal distension, as well as post-operative pain. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

2. Osteomyelitis: The patient has osteomyelitis following a vertebrectomy. He will continue receiving vancomycin as per ID recommendations, along with pain control and regular care from orthopedics.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is not due to shock, but rather secondary to multiple physiological insults and post-operative factors. Medications for hypertension are being held, and the blood pressures are being monitored and titrated as needed.

4. Fever: The patient's fever is likely secondary to pneumonia and sepsis. Further investigations such as sputum, blood, and urine cultures, as well as a chest X-ray, will be conducted. Empiric antibiotic coverage has been initiated.

   .
   # Sepsis: Likely secondary to PNA given time course, fever, clinical
   exam.  Will expand to cover gram negatives, anerobes (although no
   witnessed aspiration) with Zosyn, double cover pseudomonas with
   ciprofloxacin. There is a component of atelectasis given ileus and
   abdominal distension as well as post-op pain.  PE would be on
   differential but less likely given lung findings and proximity to
   orthopedic event.  Patient also having frequent mucous plugging with
   secretions. Extubated the morning of [**11-23**].  Briefly on Cipro but
   discontinued due to micro data and no need to double-cover
   pseudomonas.  Successfully extubated, afebrile.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP; currently day 4
   - f/u cultures
   - Pulmonary toilet, chest PT, suction prn
   - Nebulizers for wheezing
   - Volume deplete; goal I/O even-(+)500cc
   - f/u ID consult
   .
   # Illeus: Continued secretions from NGT, beginning to have bowel
   movements with digital disimpaction.  Resolving ileus.
   - NGT in place for now; consider pulling once pt having regular bowel
   movements
   - d/c PPI as no longer intubated
   - Bowel regimen
   .
   # Anemia: Bumped appropriately s/p 2 u pRBC on [**11-22**], but goal to have
   hct closer to 30 in the setting of septic shock.
   - No transfusion needed today.
   .
   # Osteomyelitis s/p vertebrectomy: Continue vancomycin per ID
   recommendations, pain control, regular care per orthopedics.
   - Contact ortho re: anticoagulation with Lovenox following surgery
   - Pain control with fentanyl patch as now off of fentanyl gtt
   - Morphine for breakthrough and until fentanyl patch reaches
   therapeutic levels; consider d/c
ing Morphine tomorrow based on dosing
   requirements. 1-2mg q4h prn pain (prefer lower dose more frequently, as
   elderly)
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding medications at this time, will titrate as
   needed. Pressures ranging high, consider re-initiating home Metoprolol
   if pressures remain persistently elevated.
   .
   # DM: Continue insulin sliding scale, adjusted dose downwards given NPO
   status.
   .
   # Sinus Tachycardia: Likely secondary to stress, infection.  No
   evidence of ischemia on EKG.  Will continue to follow on telemetry.
   Resolved.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mildly altered in context of multiple
   physiologic insults, post-operative.  Will continue to follow.
   Currently interactive and following commands; will monitor mental
   status now that extubated.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has altered mental status and respiratory failure, which could be secondary to pneumonia (PNA). There is a component of atelectasis due to ileus and abdominal distension, as well as post-operative pain. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn) to cover gram negatives, anerobes, and pseudomonas.

2. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a history of vertebrectomy and epidural abscess drainage with septic shock. The patient is currently on vancomycin, and pain control measures are being taken.

3. Hypotension: The patient has ongoing hypotension, not due to shock, and is holding medications for hypertension. Pressures remain persistently elevated, and consideration is being given to re-initiating home Metoprolol.

4. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes management involves continuing insulin sliding scale, adjusted downwards given NPO status.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient has mildly altered mental status in the context of multiple physiologic insults and post-operative state. This will be monitored closely.

6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which was appropriately transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**11-22**]. The goal is to have a higher hematocrit level closer to 30 in the setting of"

   76 y/o male with multiple medical problems and respiratory failure,
   presenting s/p vertebrectomy and epidural abscess drainage with septic
   shock.
   .
   # Sepsis: Likely secondary to PNA given time course, fever, clinical
   exam.  Will expand to cover gram negatives, anerobes (although no
   witnessed aspiration) with Zosyn, double cover pseudomonas with
   ciprofloxacin. There is a component of atelectasis given ileus and
   abdominal distension as well as post-op pain.  PE would be on
   differential but less likely given lung findings and proximity to
   orthopedic event.  Patient also having frequent mucous plugging with
   secretions. Extubated the morning of [**11-23**].  Briefly on Cipro but
   discontinued due to micro data and no need to double-cover
   pseudomonas.  Successfully extubated, afebrile.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP; currently day [**3-28**]
   - d/c Cipro
   - Incentive spirometry
   - Speech and swallow to prevent future aspiration
   - f/u cultures
   - Pulmonary toilet, chest PT, suction prn
   - Nebulizers for wheezing
   - Volume deplete; goal I/O even-(+)500cc
   - f/u ID consult
   .
   # Illeus: Continued secretions from NGT, beginning to have bowel
   movements with digital disimpaction.  Resolving ileus.
   - NGT pulled
   - d/c PPI as no longer intubated
   - Bowel regimen
   .
   # Anemia: Bumped appropriately s/p 2 u pRBC on [**11-22**], but goal to have
   hct closer to 30 in the setting of septic shock.
   - No transfusion needed today.
   .
   # Osteomyelitis s/p vertebrectomy: Continue vancomycin per ID
   recommendations, pain control, regular care per orthopedics.
   - Contact ortho re: anticoagulation; recommended avoiding Lovenox
   following surgery, as increased risk of bleed.  Recommended SC Heparin
   tid, and if necessary Coumadin.
   - ID contact[**Name (NI) **] re: long term osteomyelitis treatment, recommended
   Vancomycin x6-8 weeks
   - Pain control with fentanyl patch as now off of fentanyl gtt
   - Morphine for breakthrough and until fentanyl patch reaches
   therapeutic levels; consider d/c
ing Morphine tomorrow based on dosing
   requirements. 1-2mg q4h prn pain (prefer lower dose more frequently, as
   elderly)
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding medications at this time, will titrate as
   needed. Pressures ranging high, consider re-initiating home Metoprolol
   if pressures remain persistently elevated.
   .
   # DM: Continue insulin sliding scale, adjusted dose downwards given NPO
   status.
   .
   # Sinus Tachycardia: Likely secondary to stress, infection.  No
   evidence of ischemia on EKG.  Will continue to follow on telemetry.
   Resolved.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mildly altered in context of multiple
   physiologic insults, post-operative.  Will continue to follow.
   Currently interactive and following commands; will monitor mental
   status now that extubated.
   .
   FEN: No IVF as diuresis goal today, replete electrolytes, NPO--will
   require speech & swallow once stable
 likely tomorrow.
   .
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, will d/w ortho if needs to be on
   lovenox.

- The patient is a 76-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including respiratory failure, presenting post-vertebrectomy and epidural abscess drainage with septic shock.
- The patient was intubated and received invasive ventilation, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter, which were all stopped on 11/23/2102.
- The patient had an altered mental status but responded to verbal stimuli.
- Respiratory support was provided through a nasal cannula and PSV/SBT mode on the ventilator.
- Physical examination showed rhonchi bilaterally, mild TTP, mildly distended abdomen, and trace pedal and hand edema bilaterally.
- Labs indicated elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Microbiology results showed gram-negative diplococci and sparse growth of Staphylococcus aureus.
- Assessment and plan included respiratory failure, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, hypotension, sepsis, ileus, anemia, and hypertension.
- The patient's conditions were managed with various medications, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), lorazepam (Ativan), and morphine sulfate.
- The patient's progress was monitored, and appropriate interventions were made, including incentive spirometry, speech and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with multiple medical problems and respiratory failure. He presented after undergoing a vertebrectomy and epidural abscess drainage with septic shock.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has mild alterations in mental status, which could be due to multiple physiological insults, post-operative effects, or stress from the situation.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, but it is not ARDS. There is a component of atelectasis given ileus and abdominal distension as well as post-operative pain. The patient also has frequent mucous plugging with secretions.

3. Sepsis: The patient is likely secondary to pneumonia (HAP) given the time course, fever, clinical exam, and gram-negative diplococci seen on gram stain. He will be expanded to cover gram negatives, anerobes, and double cover pseudomonas with Zosyn and ciprofloxacin.

4. Osteomyelitis: The patient has osteomyelitis s/p vertebrectomy. He will continue with vancomycin per ID recommendations, pain control, and regular care per orthopedics.

5. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, other than HAP. It is likely secondary to the recent surgery, ileus, and abdominal distension.

6. Hypotension: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old man who underwent spine surgery and is currently in the ICU. He has been experiencing postoperative pneumonia (PNA), osteomyelitis, and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), blood pressure ranging from 112/57 to 173/87 mmHg, heart rate between 78 and 136 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics and other medications. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, and liver enzymes. The patient's renal function is within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has a history of respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a diagnosis of osteomyelitis, which is a serious infection of the bone. This condition can lead to complications like sepsis, abscess formation, or the need for surgical intervention.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has postoperative pneumonia (PNA), which increases the risk of complications such as multi-drug resistant infections, sepsis, or worsening respiratory status.
