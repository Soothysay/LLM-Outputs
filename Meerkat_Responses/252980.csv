   Assessment and Plan
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   Prelim read from Heme-Path suggests large cell lymphoma w/ vacuoles
   suggestive of possible Burkitt's Lymphoma. Oncology has already seen pt
   and recommends initiating treatment with steroids. Concern that this
   may be high grade lymphoma given progression, LDH level. Pt received CT
   torso from OSH, films in chart. On review of pt's labs although she
   does not qualify for tumour lysis syndrome given her normal Phos,
   elevated Ca her LDH, Uric Acid suggests the possibility of tumour lysis
   syndome once treatment begins. Will thus consult Nephrology for
   possible CVVH initiation tonight, per Onc recs will start on
   Dexamethasone 40 mg IV once CVVH is initiated given the likelihood of
   TLS. Will check tumour lysis labs (K, Creatinine, Ca, Phos, Mg, LDH) as
   well as DIC labs. Will also start on Rasburicase for uric acid
   converion.
   - will upload CT torso films in PACS
   - f/u BM bx
   - start dex after 30-60 minutes of well working CVVH
   - will check TLS labs q4hrs (K, Cr, Ca, Mg, Ph, LDH)
   - will give Rasburicase 7.5mg IV x 1 now (pharmacy error only got 6mg)
   - will check Uric Acid level 4 hours after Rasburicase per Rasburicase
   protocol
   - will check EBV, CMV, HIV viral loads, antibody panels
   - will give Dexamthasone 40mg IV x 1 once CVVH is initiated
   - check Echo in the AM, to eval systolic function
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Tumour Lysis
   As mentioned above pt noted to have elevated uric acid, however
   phosphorous is still low, Calcium is high. Given LDH and suspected high
   grade lymphoma have high suspicion for tumour lysis syndrome once
   dexamethasone is started.
   - will continue to monitor Tumour lysis labs q3hrs
   - pt receiving Rasburicase for Uric Acid conversion for renal
   protection
   - will place HD line and start CVVH
   - will start Allopurinol in the AM
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Likely due to tumour lysis given her prior labs from [**Hospital3 **]. Pt
   will start CVVH given the anticipation of possible TLS from tumour
   response to dexamethasone.
   - will start on CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend Creatinine
   - will continue with 3amps HCO in D5W @ 250cc/hr
   .
   ##. Anion Gap Acidosis: Pt noted to have an anion gap acidosis on
   admission, likely lactic acidosis given her aggressive lymphoma.
   - will check lactate level (5.3)
   - trend chemistry panel
   .
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   On review of OSH records pt has been persistently sinus tachycardic,
   likely related to her underlying lymphoma.
   .
 HYPOTHYROIDISM
   Will continue on home regimen of Hypothyroidism.
   .
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   Pt was given IV Ceftriaxone for ?UTI however U/A was notable for
   several epi cells in addition to bacteria. No dysuria noted, urine
   appearance likely related to her [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] recheck U/A and urine
   culture.
   - recheck U/A, Urine culture
   - contact OSH for culture results
   ##. Med Reconciliation: Pt unfortunately cannot remember all of her
   meds. She states that she is on Furosemide but it is unclear as to why
   given lack of edema or heart failure history. [**Name (NI) 882**] son has medication
   list, will contact son in the AM to reconciliate Furosemide, Lipitor
   dosing.

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

- The patient has been experiencing several medical complications in the ICU, including lymphoma (cancer), renal failure, anion gap acidosis, tachycardia, hypothyroidism, and a urinary tract infection (UTI).
- The patient's lymphoma is suspected to be high-grade, and there is a concern for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) due to the elevated levels of LDH and uric acid. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) has been initiated for renal support, and the patient will be started on dexamethasone and rasburicase for TLS management.
- The patient's acute renal failure is likely related to tumor lysis syndrome, and CVVH has been started for renal support.
- The patient has an anion gap acidosis, which is likely due to lactic acidosis associated with aggressive lymphoma.
- The patient has persistent sinus tachycardia, which is likely related to the underlying lymphoma.
- The patient has hypothyroidism and will continue on the home regimen.
- The patient had a UTI, for which IV ceftriaxone was given. However, the urine analysis showed several epithelial cells, and the patient did not have dysuria. The urine appearance is likely related to the patient's underlying condition, and a recheck of urine analysis and culture is planned.

   Disposition:[**Hospital Unit Name 10**] pending initiation of methotrexate
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a Caucasian female diagnosed with lymphoma, specifically large cell lymphoma with vacuoles suggestive of possible Burkitt's Lymphoma. The patient's condition has progressed, and oncology recommends initiating treatment with steroids. However, there are concerns about the possibility of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) due to elevated levels of LDH and uric acid. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and treatment plan include:

1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): TLS is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when cancer cells release their contents into the bloodstream, leading to high levels of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid, as well as low calcium levels. The patient's elevated LDH, uric acid, and normal phosphate levels suggest the possibility of TLS. Monitoring of tumor lysis labs (K, Creatinine, Ca, Phos, Mg, LDH) every 4 hours is recommended.

2. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient's renal function may be compromised due to the anticipation of possible TLS from tumor response to dexamethasone. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) has been initiated to manage acute renal failure.

3. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient has an anion gap acidosis, likely due to aggressive lymphoma. Lactic acidosis should be considered, and the lactate"

   Assessment and Plan
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   Burkitt's Lymphoma with high tumor burden and high risk for tumor lysis
   syndrome. On review of pt's labs although she does not qualify for
   tumour lysis syndrome given her normal Phos, elevated Ca her LDH, Uric
   Acid suggests the possibility of tumour lysis syndome with treatment.
   Received Rasburicase for uric acid converion. Pt intiated CVVH and
   CODOX yesterday. Labs remained stable.
   - cont dexa 40 mg IV daily, CODOX per heme/onc orders
   - cont allopurinol 100 mg daily
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   - will check TLS labs q4hrs (K, Cr, Ca, Mg, Ph, LDH)
   - DIC labs q6h
   - f/u EBV, CMV, HIV viral loads, antibody panels
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Likely due to tumour lysis and urate nephropathy given her prior labs
   from [**Hospital3 **]. Has renal stones, likely uric acid on right, and
   hydronephrosis on left possibly due to external compression by
   tumor/LAD. Had marginal urine output. Pt on CVVH given the anticipation
   of possible TLS from tumour response to dexamethasone.
   - on CVVH, will readdress goal fluid balance with renal and BMT
   - currently would run her even given decreased BP and tachycardia with
   aggressive diuresis overnight, our goal is to maintain adequate
   hydration and prevent TLS and not necessarily to diurese
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend Creatinine
   .
   ##. COAGULOPATHY: Pt had profuse oozing from HD site, with associated
   Hct drop yesterday. Also had hematuria, requiring CBI with 3way Foley.
   No evidence of coagulopathy by PTT/INR. Received 2 U FFP despite normal
   INR. Cryo
s pending. Pt is not receiving anticoagulation in CVVH.
   Likely has platelet qualitative dysfunction.
   - monitor Foley output, trial off CBI this AM since saline coming
   through is now clear
   - consider urology consult if concerned
   - monitor q6h coags for r/o DIC
   - f/u cryo and give cryo if needed
   - if continued bleeding or Hct drop, give ddAVP to stabilize presumed
   plt dysfunction
   .
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   Pt was given IV Ceftriaxone for ?UTI however U/A was notable for
   several epi cells in addition to bacteria. Patient complained of
   bladder discomfort with Foley in place, improved with pyridium. Repeat
   UA may suggest infection, although urine cx still pending. Leukocytosis
   and fever are difficult to follow in this patient given lymphoma and
   CVVH.
   - review OSH imaging for perinephric stranding
   - follow up Urine culture OSH and here and consider treatment
   .
   ##. Anion Gap Acidosis: Pt noted to have an anion gap acidosis on
   admission, likely lactic acidosis given her aggressive lymphoma. AG 20
   today.
   - will check lactate level
   - trend chemistry panel
   .
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   On review of OSH records pt has been persistently sinus tachycardic,
   likely related to her underlying lymphoma.
   .
 HYPOTHYROIDISM
   Will continue on home regimen of Hypothyroidism.

   On this day I examined Ms [**Known lastname 708**] and reviewed her historical, lab, and
   imaging data.  I was present for the key portions of the services
   provided.  I also have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note above and agree with
   her findings and plan of care.  The patient has Burkitt
s lymphoma with
   nephropathy likely due to uric acid from her huge tumor burden (LDH
   25,000) and from some mild left hydronephrosis from retroperitoneal
   adenopathy.  She also has lactic acidosis (AG 20), likely from her
   tumor burden as well, though she is compensating fine.  Chemo with
   Cytoxan and high dose Decadron has been started and the goal is to keep
   her hydrated and keep her [**Last Name (STitle) **] and kidneys flushed out with the help
   of  IVF and CVVH.  Frequent lab checks in order.  She is somnolent but
   arousable and answers questions appropriately when asked.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old Caucasian female with a diagnosis of Burkitt's Lymphoma. She is currently admitted to the ICU for aggressive chemotherapy and management of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). 

The patient's medical history includes acute renal failure, coagulopathy, urinary tract infection, anion gap acidosis, and hypothyroidism. She has been receiving various treatments such as CODOX chemotherapy, dexamethasone, rasburicase, and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

Key findings from the progress note include:
1. Hematuria and oozing from the hemodialysis (HD) line, but no evidence of coagulopathy on labs. The patient received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate is pending.
2. Foley catheter with hematuria and clots, which led to the placement of a three-way Foley for bladder irrigation. The bladder scan showed only 200cc of urine, and the urine output was clear.
3. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), blood pressure ranging from 122/61 to 154/81 mmHg, heart rate between 96-103 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99% on a nasal cannula"

   Assessment and Plan
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   Burkitt's Lymphoma with high tumor burden and high risk for tumor lysis
   syndrome. On review of pt's labs although she does not qualify for
   tumour lysis syndrome given her normal Phos, elevated Ca her LDH, Uric
   Acid suggests the possibility of tumour lysis syndome with treatment.
   Received Rasburicase for uric acid converion. Pt intiated CVVH and
   CODOX yesterday. Labs remained stable.
   - cont dexa 40 mg IV daily, CODOX per heme/onc orders
   - cont allopurinol 100 mg daily
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   - will check TLS labs q4hrs (K, Cr, Ca, Mg, Ph, LDH)
   - DIC labs q6h
   - f/u EBV, CMV, HIV viral loads, antibody panels
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Likely due to tumour lysis given her prior labs from [**Hospital3 **]. Pt
   will start CVVH given the anticipation of possible TLS from tumour
   response to dexamethasone.
   - will start on CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend Creatinine
   - will continue with 3amps HCO in D5W @ 250cc/hr
   .
   ##> COAGULOPATHY: Pt had profuse oozing from HD site, with associated
   Hct drop yesterday. Also had hematuria, requiring CBI with 3way Foley.
   No evidence of coagulopathy by PTT/INR. Received 2 U FFP despite normal
   INR. Cryo
s pending. Pt is not receiving anticoagulation in CVVH.
   Likely has platelet qualitative dysfunction.
   - monitor Foley output, trial off CBI this AM since saline coming
   through is now clear
   - consider urology consult if concerned
   - monitor q6h coags for r/o DIC
   - f/u cryo and give cryo if needed
   - if continued bleeding or Hct drop, give ddAVP to stabilize presumed
   plt dysfunction
   .
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   Pt was given IV Ceftriaxone for ?UTI however U/A was notable for
   several epi cells in addition to bacteria. Patient complained of
   bladder discomfort with Foley in place, improved with pyridium. Repeat
   UA may suggest infection, although urine cx still pending. Leukocytosis
   and fever are difficult to follow in this patient given lymphoma and
   CVVH.
   - review OSH imaging for perinephric stranding
   - follow up Urine culture OSH and here and consider resuming treatment
   .
   ##. Anion Gap Acidosis: Pt noted to have an anion gap acidosis on
   admission, likely lactic acidosis given her aggressive lymphoma. AG 20
   today.
   - will check lactate level
   - trend chemistry panel
   .
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   On review of OSH records pt has been persistently sinus tachycardic,
   likely related to her underlying lymphoma.
   .
 HYPOTHYROIDISM
   Will continue on home regimen of Hypothyroidism.
   -
   ##. Med Reconciliation: Pt unfortunately cannot remember all of her
   meds. She states that she is on Furosemide but it is unclear as to why
   given lack of edema or heart failure history. [**Name (NI) 882**] son has medication

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of Burkitt's lymphoma, acute renal failure, and tumor lysis syndrome. The patient is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) due to evidence of TLS (tumor lysis syndrome) on labs. There is no evidence of DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) or hemorrhage. The goal is to maintain the patient's Is/Os even to (-) one liter. CVVH was intermittently stopped overnight due to an air infiltrate. The patient complains of bladder spasm.

The patient has no known drug allergies and has a history of malignancy, specifically Burkitt's lymphoma. The patient has been receiving infusions of calcium gluconate (CRRT) at a rate of 1.4 grams/hour. Other ICU medications include famotidine (Pepcid), lorazepam (Ativan), and morphine sulfate.

The patient is currently sleeping and denies pain, with improving bladder spasm. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 85 bpm (76-109), blood pressure ranging from 123/64 to 172/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute (12-26), and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula"

   Assessment and Plan
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   Burkitt's Lymphoma with high tumor burden and high risk for tumor lysis
   syndrome. On review of pt's labs although she does not qualify for
   tumour lysis syndrome given her normal Phos, elevated Ca her LDH, Uric
   Acid suggests the possibility of tumour lysis syndome with treatment.
   Received Rasburicase for uric acid converion. Pt intiated CVVH and
   CODOX yesterday. Labs remained stable.
   - cont dexa 40 mg IV daily, CODOX per heme/onc orders
   - cont allopurinol 100 mg daily
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   - will check TLS labs q4hrs (K, Cr, Ca, Mg, Ph, LDH)
   - DIC labs q6h
   - f/u EBV, CMV, HIV viral loads, antibody panels
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Likely due to tumour lysis and urate nephropathy given her prior labs
   from [**Hospital3 **]. Has renal stones, likely uric acid on right, and
   hydronephrosis on left possibly due to external compression by
   tumor/LAD. Had marginal urine output. Pt on CVVH given the anticipation
   of possible TLS from tumour response to dexamethasone.
   - on CVVH, will readdress goal fluid balance with renal and BMT
   - currently would run her even given decreased BP and tachycardia with
   aggressive diuresis overnight, our goal is to maintain adequate
   hydration and prevent TLS and not necessarily to diurese
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend Creatinine
   .
   ##. COAGULOPATHY: Pt had profuse oozing from HD site, with associated
   Hct drop yesterday. Also had hematuria, requiring CBI with 3way Foley.
   No evidence of coagulopathy by PTT/INR. Received 2 U FFP despite normal
   INR. Cryo
s pending. Pt is not receiving anticoagulation in CVVH.
   Likely has platelet qualitative dysfunction.
   - monitor Foley output, trial off CBI this AM since saline coming
   through is now clear
   - consider urology consult if concerned
   - monitor q6h coags for r/o DIC
   - f/u cryo and give cryo if needed
   - if continued bleeding or Hct drop, give ddAVP to stabilize presumed
   plt dysfunction
   .
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   Pt was given IV Ceftriaxone for ?UTI however U/A was notable for
   several epi cells in addition to bacteria. Patient complained of
   bladder discomfort with Foley in place, improved with pyridium. Repeat
   UA may suggest infection, although urine cx still pending. Leukocytosis
   and fever are difficult to follow in this patient given lymphoma and
   CVVH.
   - review OSH imaging for perinephric stranding
   - follow up Urine culture OSH and here and consider treatment
   .
   ##. Anion Gap Acidosis: Pt noted to have an anion gap acidosis on
   admission, likely lactic acidosis given her aggressive lymphoma. AG 20
   today.
   - will check lactate level
   - trend chemistry panel
   .
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   On review of OSH records pt has been persistently sinus tachycardic,
   likely related to her underlying lymphoma.
   .
 HYPOTHYROIDISM
   Will continue on home regimen of Hypothyroidism.
   -
   ##. Med Reconciliation: Pt unfortunately cannot remember all of her
   meds. She states that she is on Furosemide but it is unclear as to why
   given lack of edema or heart failure history. [**Name (NI) 882**] son has medication
   list, will contact son in the AM to reconciliate Furosemide, Lipitor
   dosing.

","The patient has been diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma and is currently in the ICU for acute renal failure, tumor lysis syndrome, and other potential medical complications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 123/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications, including cytoxan and decadron, as well as calcium gluconate through CRRT. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased creatinine levels. The electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for hypercalcemia (elevated calcium) and hyperphosphatemia (elevated phosphate). The patient's LDH level is also elevated, suggesting the possibility of tumor lysis syndrome. 

The patient has been initiated on rasburicase for uric acid conversion and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) to manage the tumor lysis syndrome. The patient's renal function is compromised due to tumor lysis and urate nephropathy, as evidenced by the presence of renal stones and hydronephrosis. 

The patient has a history of profuse oozing from the HD site, hematuria, and an Hct drop"

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Likely due to tumour lysis and urate nephropathy given her prior labs
   from [**Hospital3 **]. Has renal stones, likely uric acid on right, and
   hydronephrosis on left possibly due to external compression by
   tumor/LAD. Had marginal urine output. Pt on CVVH given the anticipation
   of possible TLS from tumour response to dexamethasone.  Could have
   component of hydroureter [**12-29**] retroperitoneal disease

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma and is experiencing acute renal failure due to tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). The patient is currently on cytoxan and decadron, and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) has been initiated. 

The patient's medical history includes allergies, previous admissions, and current medications such as calcium gluconate, famotidine, lorazepam, morphine sulfate, and other ICU medications. 

The review of systems shows that the patient denies pain but reports bladder spasm, which has improved. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5%), heart rate of 85 bpm (normal range: 76-109 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 123/64 mmHg to 172/92 mmHg (normal range: 85-124/47-92 mmHg), respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute (normal range: 12-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. 

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and lower extremity edema of 1+ on both sides. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count ("

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Ms [**Known lastname 708**] and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8092**]
s note above and
   agree with his findings and plan of care.
   The patient  seems brighter and less somnolent today and overall claims
   to feel not bad. She has hematuria and bladder pain, and with her
   Cytoxan Rx we will use continuous bladder irrigation to help prevent
   bladder injury from cytoxan.  She continues with met acidosis but has
   no resp compromise.  Her intravascular volume status appears fine, so
   we will attempt to keep I=O via our IVF and CVVH.  ChemoRx ongoing and
   we are hoping for significant response of her tumor to it. Reimaging
   with abd U/S early next week may be helpful to reassess status of left
   hydonephrosis and adenopathy.
   Pt is anemic and will be transfused. Plt ct is also down to 60K and
   will be closely followed.  Pt still not taking well orally, and we
   have to address this (NGT?, TPN?) in the next few days if she can
   improve oral nutrition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old female with a diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma, acute renal failure, and tumor lysis syndrome. She is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The patient is tolerating chemotherapy well, but is experiencing bladder discomfort and hematuria. She has a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 123/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, and she is receiving continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine level, and lactate levels. She also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 60K/uL. The patient's pain and discomfort are being managed with morphine on an as-needed basis. She is encouraged to maintain oral intake, and her medication regimen is being reconciled. The patient's disposition will be determined based on her response to chemotherapy and improvement in her condition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma, presenting with acute renal failure, coagulopathy/pancytopenia, and urinary tract infection/hematuria. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions. She is receiving treatment with cytoxan and decadron, as well as CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and CBI (continuous renal replacement therapy) prophylactically. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has ongoing fluid balance issues and requires close monitoring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised due to tumor lysis syndrome and urate nephropathy. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for ongoing renal support.
2. Coagulopathy/Pancytopenia: The patient has a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration and platelet count, which can lead to increased bleeding risk. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary.
3. Urinary Tract Infection/Hematuria: The patient has evidence of hematuria and a positive urine culture, indicating a possible urinary tract infection. Further evaluation and treatment may be required.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient is being treated for hypothyroidism, which requires ongoing management and monitoring of thyroid hormone levels.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is diagnosed with Burkitt's Lymphoma and is experiencing tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), acute renal failure, coagulopathy/pancytopenia, urinary tract infection (UTI)/hematuria, anion gap acidosis, tachycardia, and hypothyroidism. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are:

1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): TLS is a group of metabolic complications that can occur after cancer treatment, particularly chemotherapy. It can lead to hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), hyperphosphatemia (high phosphate levels), hypocalcemia (low calcium levels), and acute kidney injury.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, leading to decreased urine output and the need for continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Acute renal failure can progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly.

3. Coagulopathy/Pancytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count and is actively oozing from the hemodialysis site. This indicates a bleeding tendency due to thrombocytopenia. Pancytopenia refers to a reduction in all blood cell types, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)/Hematuria: The patient has positive"

   Assessment and Plan
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   Burkitt's Lymphoma with high tumor burden and spontaneous tumor lysis
   syndrome.  Received Rasburicase for uric acid converion. Pt had e/o TL,
   now labs improving. All counts are falling, pt received PRBC and
   platelet transfusions.  Today day [**3-1**] of cytoxan and decadron,
   continues on CVVH and CBI prophylactically.
   - cont allopurinol 100 mg daily, check renal dosing once off CVVH
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   - will check TLS labs Q6hrs (K, Cr, Ca, Mg, Ph, LDH)
   - DIC labs q6h
   - f/u EBV, CMV (-), HIV viral loads (-), antibody panels
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Likely due to tumour lysis and urate nephropathy given her prior labs
   from [**Hospital3 **]. Has renal stones, likely uric acid on right, and
   hydronephrosis on left possibly due to external compression by
   tumor/LAD in retroperitoneum. Had marginal urine output. Pt on CVVH
   given the anticipation of possible TLS from tumour response to
   dexamethasone. Has had difficulty with HD line and air infiltration.
   - discuss re-siting line with renal
   - on CVVH running even
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend Creatinine
   .
   ##. COAGULOPATHY/PANCYTOPENIA: Pt had profuse oozing from HD site, with
   associated Hct drop. Also had hematuria, requiring CBI with 3way Foley.
   Both are now improving. No evidence of coagulopathy. Cryo
s pending. Pt
   is not receiving anticoagulation in CVVH.  Hct and plt count cont to
   trend down, likely [**12-29**] to chemo and CVVH but concern for additional
   etiology especially given severe TCP today.
   - f/u smear, FDP
   - CBI
   - consider repeat CT for obstruction prior to urology consult
   - monitor q6h coags for r/o DIC
   - transfuse for goal Hct>21, plt>50 since bleeding
   .
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)/HEMATURIA
   Positive UA and neg cx x 2. Will not treat for UTI.
   - CBI for hematuria to prophylax against hemorrhagic cystitis
   - oxybutynin for possible bladder spasm
   - consider CT and urology c/s
   .
   ##. Anion Gap Acidosis: normalized, AG 12 today.
   .
   ## Pain/discomfort
 morphine PRN
   .
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   On review of OSH records pt has been persistently sinus tachycardic,
   likely related to her underlying lymphoma.
   .
 HYPOTHYROIDISM
   Will continue on home regimen of Hypothyroidism.
   -
   ##. Med Reconciliation: Pt unfortunately cannot remember all of her
   meds. She states that she is on Furosemide but it is unclear as to why
   given lack of edema or heart failure history. [**Name (NI) 882**] son has medication
   list, will contact to reconcile Furosemide, [**Name (NI) **] dosing.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note above and
   agree with her findings and plan of care.
   Mrs [**Known lastname 708**] looks bright and alert, albeit bored today! She
s needing
   plt and rbc support given chemoRx and oozing around central line and
   hematuria. Getting continuous bladder irrigation. We
re watching for
   neutropenia and also continuing to monitor her tumor lysis labs.  She
   needs to start eating and we
ll try to put her in reverse Trendelenberg
   to help her take po
s without aspirating.  Should talk to renal and
   oncology to get a sense of how much longer she might need CVVH, as I
   worry about her lines and risk of infection given her declining
   immuncompentence.  I would d/c a line if no longer needed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old female with a diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma and high tumor burden. She is currently experiencing spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and acute renal failure, likely due to tumor lysis and urate nephropathy. The patient has received rasburicase for uric acid conversion and has been on CVVH and CBI prophylactically.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 161/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's arterial line was restarted multiple times, and she is receiving continuous bladder irrigation due to hematuria.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, platelet count of 80 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, glucose level of 171 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances such as potassium of 5.2 mEq/L and magnesium of 1.8 mg/dL.

   - DIC labs q6h
   - f/u EBV, CMV (-), HIV viral loads (-), antibody panels
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Likely due to tumour lysis and urate nephropathy given her prior labs
   from [**Hospital3 **]. Has renal stones, likely uric acid on right, and
   hydronephrosis on left possibly due to external compression by
   tumor/LAD in retroperitoneum. Had marginal urine output. Pt on CVVH
   given the anticipation of possible TLS from tumour response to
   dexamethasone. Has had difficulty with HD line and air infiltration.
   - Continue CBI while risk of hemorrhagic cystitis from cytoxan
   - once clear of window for hemorrhagic cystitis would d/c CBI and
   monitor urine output.
   - If making urine well off CBI and running even on CVVH, would d/c CVVH
   - on CVVH running even
   - re: above there is some question of +10L length of stay, however with
   CBI urine output is purely an estimate, so making any definitive
   comment on interval fluid, however we can meet with heme-onc and renal
   to discuss fluid goals.

   with associated Hct drop. Also had hematuria, requiring CBI with 3way
   Foley. Both are now improving. No evidence of coagulopathy. Cryo
   pending. Pt is not receiving anticoagulation in CVVH.  Hct and plt
   count cont to trend down, likely [**12-29**] to chemo and CVVH but concern for
   additional etiology especially given severe TCP today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma with high tumor burden and spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome. They received Rasburicase for uric acid conversion and were transfused with red blood cells and platelets. The patient is currently on the third day of Cytoxan and Decadron, continues on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), and CBI (continuous bladder irrigation) prophylactically.

The patient's medical complications include renal failure, likely due to tumor lysis and urate nephropathy. They also have a urinary tract infection with positive urine analysis and negative cultures, and their coagulopathy/pancytopenia is improving after receiving cryoprecipitate and platelet transfusions. The patient has an anion gap acidosis that has normalized, and they are being treated for possible bladder spasm with oxybutynin.

Other conditions mentioned in the note are hypothyroidism, which the patient will continue on their home regimen, and tachycardia, which is likely related to their underlying lymphoma. The patient's pain and discomfort are managed with morphine as needed.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving regular nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's disposition is currently in the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is diagnosed with Burkitt's Lymphoma, a type of cancer that often leads to a high tumor burden and spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). The patient has received treatment including rasburicase, cytoxan, and decadron, and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and corticosteroid therapy.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, which are likely due to tumor lysis and urate nephropathy. They also have elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.

The patient is at risk for complications such as coagulopathy/pancytopenia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and anion gap acidosis. They are also experiencing tachycardia and have a history of hypothyroidism.

The patient's current medications include allopurinol, cytoxan, decadron, famotidine, lorazepam, calcium gluconate, and morphine for pain management. They are also receiving prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (SCDs), stress ulcers (famotidine), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of their cancer,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute renal failure, likely secondary to tumor lysis syndrome and urate nephropathy. They have been tolerating continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and bladder irrigation. The patient exhibits oozing of blood from venous and arterial catheter sites, feels swollen in their arms and legs, and appears somewhat dyspneic while lying supine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory distress and evolving pulmonary edema could be a concern due to volume resuscitation for tumor lysis syndrome and acute renal failure. Monitoring the patient's respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SaO2) is essential. Aim for a net diuresis to manage fluid balance.
2. Burkitt's Lymphoma: The patient has a high tumor burden, which may lead to spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome. Heme/Onc service will follow up to complete cytoxan and decadron treatment.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The renal failure is attributed to tumor lysis and urate nephropathy. Right renal stones (likely uric acid) and left hydronephrosis (possible external compression by lymphadenopathy) have been observed. Continuing CVVH is necessary, and monitoring urine output, BUN, and creatinine levels is important.
4. Hypervolemia: The patient has a net positive fluid balance of more than"

 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   Burkitt's Lymphoma with high tumor burden and spontaneous tumor lysis
   syndrome.  Received Rasburicase for uric acid converion. Pt had e/o TL,
   now labs continue to be stable. Completed cytoxan last night, continues
   on CVVH and CBI prophylactically. To receive vincristine and
   doxorubicin today.
   - discuss coming off CVVH since no TL and completed cytoxan
   - cont allopurinol 100 mg daily, check renal dosing if off CVVH
   - not neutropenic yet
   - Cryo for fibrinogen less than 100, Plts for less than 50 because of
   oozing, Hct>21
   - appreciate heme/onc recs

   - DIC labs q6h
   - f/u EBV, antibody panels
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Likely due to tumour lysis and urate nephropathy given her prior labs
   from [**Hospital3 **]. Has renal stones, likely uric acid on right, and
   hydronephrosis on left possibly due to external compression by
   tumor/LAD in retroperitoneum. Had marginal urine output. Pt on CVVH so
   creatinine improved, 2.5L neg overnight. Urine output apparently
   improving, possibly passed stone or tumor burden reduced.
   - goal on CVVH 1-2L neg/day
   - consider stopping CVVH or transition to HD if pt euvolemic and good
   UOP
   - d/c CBI and monitor urine output.
   - if poor UOP, consider repeat CT for obstruction and urology consult
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   ##. COAGULOPATHY/PANCYTOPENIA: Pt has had profuse oozing from HD site,
   with associated Hct drop. Also had hematuria, requiring CBI with 3way
   Foley. Both are now improving. No evidence of coagulopathy. Pt is not
   receiving anticoagulation in CVVH.  Hct and plt count cont to trend
   down, likely [**12-29**] to chemo.
   - transfusion goals as above.
   - monitor q6h coags for r/o DIC
   - transfuse for goal Hct>21, plt>50 since bleeding
   .
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)/HEMATURIA: Pt had bladder pain and
   hematuria, now resolved.

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma and acute renal failure secondary to tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). She is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 135/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. She is receiving calcium gluconate through CRRT and other ICU medications including famotidine.

Her laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 126 mg/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 48. Other labs indicate acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 5379 IU/L, and electrolyte imbalances including hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia.

The patient is receiving chemotherapy and has completed a cycle of cytoxan last night. She will be receiving vincristine and doxorubicin today. The medical team plans to discuss discontinuing CVVH since there are no signs of TLS at present, continue allopurinol, check renal dosing if off CVVH, and monitor for any potential complications such"

   Assessment and Plan
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   Burkitt's Lymphoma with high tumor burden and spontaneous tumor lysis
   syndrome.  Received Rasburicase for uric acid converion. Pt had e/o TL,
   now labs continue to be stable. Completed cytoxan last night, continues
   on CVVH and CBI prophylactically. To receive vincristine and
   doxorubicin today.
   - discuss coming off CVVH since no TL and completed cytoxan
   - cont allopurinol 100 mg daily, check renal dosing if off CVVH
   - discuss ppx (Bactrim) with BMT team
   - neutropenic precautions
   - Cryo for fibrinogen less than 100, Plts for less than 50 because of
   oozing, Hct>21
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   - will check TLS labs Q6hrs (K, Cr, Ca, Mg, Ph, LDH)
   - DIC labs q6h
   - f/u EBV, antibody panels
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Likely due to tumour lysis and urate nephropathy given her prior labs
   from [**Hospital3 **]. Has renal stones, likely uric acid on right, and
   hydronephrosis on left possibly due to external compression by
   tumor/LAD in retroperitoneum. Had marginal urine output. Pt on CVVH so
   creatinine improved, 2.5L neg overnight. Urine output apparently
   improving, possibly passed stone or tumor burden reduced.
   - goal on CVVH 1-2L neg/day
   - consider stopping CVVH or transition to HD if pt euvolemic and good
   UOP
   - d/c CBI and monitor urine output.
   - repeat U/S for obstruction and consider urology consult
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   ##. COAGULOPATHY/PANCYTOPENIA: Pt has had profuse oozing from HD site,
   with associated Hct drop. Also had hematuria, requiring CBI with 3way
   Foley. Both are now improving. No evidence of coagulopathy. Pt is not
   receiving anticoagulation in CVVH.  Hct and plt count cont to trend
   down, likely [**12-29**] to chemo.
   - transfusion goals as above.
   - monitor q6h coags for r/o DIC
   - transfuse for goal Hct>21, plt>50 since bleeding
   .
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)/HEMATURIA: Pt had bladder pain and
   hematuria, now resolved.
   Ucx neg x 2.
   .
   ##. Anion Gap Acidosis: normalized.

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   On review of OSH records pt has been persistently sinus tachycardic,
   likely related to her underlying lymphoma.
   .
 HYPOTHYROIDISM
   Will continue on home regimen of Hypothyroidism.
   -
   ##. Med Reconciliation: Pt unfortunately cannot remember all of her
   meds. She states that she is on Furosemide but it is unclear as to why
   given lack of edema or heart failure history. [**Name (NI) 882**] son has medication
   list, will contact to reconcile Furosemide, [**Name (NI) **] dosing.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a diagnosis of Burkitt's Lymphoma and acute renal failure due to tumor lysis syndrome. The patient has been receiving chemotherapy and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and cryoprecipitate infusion for coagulopathy.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): TLS is a life-threatening condition that can occur in patients with high tumor burden, such as Burkitt's Lymphoma. It is characterized by the rapid release of intracellular contents, including potassium, phosphate, and nucleic acids, into the bloodstream. This can lead to metabolic abnormalities, renal failure, and cardiac arrhythmias. The patient has already received rasburicase for uric acid conversion and continues to be monitored closely with labs every 6 hours.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure likely due to tumor lysis and urate nephropathy. She is currently on CVVH, which has improved her creatinine levels. The goal is to maintain a urine output of 1-2 liters per day. If the patient becomes euvolemic and has good urine output, consideration should be given to stopping CVVH or transitioning to hemodialysis.

3. Coagulopathy/Pancytopenia: The patient has had profuse oozing from her hem"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- concern for evolving pulmonary edema secondary
   to volume resussitation (tumor lysis syndrome, acute renal failure).
   Monitor RR, SaO2.  Aim for net diuresis.
   LYMPHOMA -- Burkitt's Lymphoma, high tumor burden, spontaneous tumor
   lysis syndrome.  To complete cytoxan and decadron.  Heme/Onc service
   following.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- attributed to tumour lysis and urate
   nephropathy.  Evidence for right renal stones (likely uric acid), and
   left hydronephrosis (possible external compression by
   lymphadenopathy).  Continue CVVH if poor urine output.   (Experienced
   difficulty with HD line and air infiltration).  Monitor urine output,
   BUN, creatininine.  Consider HD if requires resumption of renal
   replacement therapy.
   FLUIDS -- hypervolemia (net balance ~ 10 L since admission).  Tolerated
   net negative fluid balance overnight.  Desire net negative balance,
   aiming for additional 1-2 L net negative for next 24 hrs if tolerated
   by BP.  Urine output may be difficult to determine/innacurate while
   receiving continous bladder irrigation.  Monitor off CVVH today.
   COAGULOPATHY -- Pt had profuse oozing from HD site, hematuria, with
   associated Hct drop.  Possible DIC?  Monitor coagulopathy.  Monitor q6h
   coags for r/o DIC
   ANEMIA -- transfuse for goal Hct>21
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- transfuse for plt <50 since bleeding
   NEUTROPENIA
 neutroppenic precautions, counts continue to fall.
   HEMATURIA -- attributed in part to chemotherapy.  No evidence for UTI.
   TACHYCARDIA -- resolved.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM -- Continue on home regimen.

Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which could be due to evolving pulmonary edema secondary to volume resuscitation (tumor lysis syndrome, acute renal failure). Monitoring the respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SaO2) is crucial. Aim for a net diuresis to manage fluid balance.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory distress may be attributed to pulmonary edema, which can occur as a result of fluid overload. This can be managed through diuresis and monitoring fluid balance.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely due to tumor lysis syndrome and urate nephropathy. There are indications of right renal stones (likely uric acid) and left hydronephrosis (possible external compression by lymphadenopathy). Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) may be required if poor urine output persists. Regular monitoring of urine output, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels is necessary. Hemodialysis (HD) may be considered if renal replacement therapy needs to be resumed"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- concern for evolving pulmonary edema secondary
   to volume resussitation (tumor lysis syndrome, acute renal failure).
   Monitor RR, SaO2.  Aim for net diuresis.
   LYMPHOMA -- Burkitt's Lymphoma, high tumor burden, spontaneous tumor
   lysis syndrome.  To complete cytoxan and decadron.  Heme/Onc service
   following.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- attributed to tumour lysis and urate
   nephropathy.  Evidence for right renal stones (likely uric acid), and
   left hydronephrosis (possible external compression by
   lymphadenopathy).  Continue CVVH if poor urine output.   (Experienced
   difficulty with HD line and air infiltration).  Monitor urine output,
   BUN, creatininine.  Consider HD if requires resumption of renal
   replacement therapy.
   FLUIDS -- hypervolemia (net balance ~ 10 L since admission).  Tolerated
   net negative fluid balance overnight.  Desire net negative balance,
   aiming for additional 1-2 L net negative for next 24 hrs if tolerated
   by BP.  Urine output may be difficult to determine/innacurate while
   receiving continous bladder irrigation.  Monitor off CVVH today.
   COAGULOPATHY -- Pt had profuse oozing from HD site, hematuria, with
   associated Hct drop.  Possible DIC?  Monitor coagulopathy.  Monitor q6h
   coags for r/o DIC
   ANEMIA -- transfuse for goal Hct>21
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- transfuse for plt <50 since bleeding
   NEUTROPENIA
 neutroppenic precautions, counts continue to fall.
   HEMATURIA -- attributed in part to chemotherapy.  No evidence for UTI.
   TACHYCARDIA -- resolved.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM -- Continue on home regimen.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. Based on the information provided in the progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory distress and symptoms such as dyspnea may indicate evolving pulmonary edema secondary to volume resuscitation. Monitoring the patient's respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SaO2) is important. Aim for a net diuresis to manage the condition.

2. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): TLS is a concern due to the high tumor burden associated with Burkitt's Lymphoma. The patient has shown signs of acute renal failure attributed to TLS and urate nephropathy. Right renal stones (likely uric acid) and left hydronephrosis (possible external compression by lymphadenopathy) have been observed. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) should be continued if poor urine output persists. Monitor urine output, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels. Consider hemodialysis (HD) if renal replacement therapy needs to be resumed.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient experienced profuse oozing from the hemodialysis (HD) site, hematuria, and associated hematocrit drop. DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) should be considered as a possible cause. Monitor coagulopathy closely and check coagulation parameters every 6 hours to"

   Assessment and Plan
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   Burkitt's Lymphoma with high tumor burden and spontaneous tumor lysis
   syndrome.  Received Rasburicase for uric acid converion. Pt had e/o TL,
   now labs continue to be stable. Completed cytoxan last night, continues
   on CVVH and CBI prophylactically. Received vincristine and doxorubicin
   yesterday.
   - Stopped CVVH this AM at 6:30
   - cont allopurinol 100 mg daily, check renal dosing if off CVVH
   - BMT said no bactrim, inhaled pentamidine at some point
   - neutropenic precautions, normal
 goals off CVVH
   - Cryo for fibrinogen less than 100, Plts for less than 50 because of
   oozing, Hct>21
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   - will check TLS labs, DIC labs, electrolytes q8h
   - f/u EBV, antibody panels
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Likely due to tumour lysis and urate nephropathy given her prior labs
   from [**Hospital3 **]. Has renal stones, likely uric acid on right, and
   hydronephrosis on left possibly due to external compression by
   tumor/LAD in retroperitoneum. Had marginal urine output. Pt on CVVH so
   creatinine improved, 2.5L neg overnight. Urine output apparently
   improving, possibly passed stone or tumor burden reduced.
   - Stopping CVVH today
   - Stopped CBI overnight
   - TID electrolytes
   - Monitor for hematuria
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   ##. COAGULOPATHY/PANCYTOPENIA: Pt has had profuse oozing from HD site,
   with associated Hct drop. Also had hematuria, requiring CBI with 3way
   Foley. Both are now improving. No evidence of coagulopathy. Pt is not
   receiving anticoagulation in CVVH.  Hct and plt count cont to trend
   down, likely [**12-29**] to chemo.
   - transfusion goals as above.
   - monitor q6h coags for r/o DIC
   - transfuse for goal Hct>21, plt>50 since bleeding
   .
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)/HEMATURIA: Pt had bladder pain and
   hematuria, now resolved.
   Ucx neg x 2.

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   On review of OSH records pt has been persistently sinus tachycardic,
   likely related to her underlying lymphoma.
   .
 HYPOTHYROIDISM
   Will continue on home regimen of Hypothyroidism.

   hydronephrosis on left possibly due to external compression by
   tumor/LAD in retroperitoneum. Had marginal urine output. Pt on CVVH so
   creatinine improved, 2.5L neg overnight. Urine output apparently
   improving, possibly passed stone or tumor burden reduced.
   - Stopping CVVH today
   - Stopped CBI overnight
   - q6h electrolytes
   - Monitor for hematuria
   - f/u renal recs

   ##. COAGULOPATHY/PANCYTOPENIA: Pt has had profuse oozing from HD site,
   with associated Hct drop. Also had hematuria, requiring CBI with 3way
   Foley. Both are now improving. No evidence of coagulopathy. Pt is not
   receiving anticoagulation in CVVH.  Hct and plt count cont to trend
   down, likely [**12-29**] to chemo.
   - transfusion goals as above.
   - monitor q6h coags for r/o DIC
   - transfuse for goal Hct>21, plt>50 since bleeding
   .
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)/HEMATURIA: Pt had bladder pain and
   hematuria, now resolved.

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   On review of OSH records pt has been persistently sinus tachycardic,

","The patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of Burkitt's lymphoma, presenting with acute renal failure, coagulopathy/pancytopenia, urinary tract infection (UTI)/hematuria, and other medical complications. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving CVVH, CBI, and various medications including vincristine, doxorubicin, morphine sulfate, calcium gluconate, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 124/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's renal function tests indicate acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine level. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The patient's urine output is improving, and there is no evidence of urinary tract infection or hematuria. The patient's pain and discomfort are managed with morphine PRN. The patient's thyroid function is being monitored due to underlying hypothyroidism. The patient's nutritional needs are met through regular diet"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- much improved.  Monitor RR, SaO2.  Provide
   supplimental oxygen as needed.  Aim for net diuresis.
   LYMPHOMA -- Burkitt's Lymphoma, high tumor burden, spontaneous tumor
   lysis syndrome.  To continue chemotherapy as per Heme/Onc service.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- attributed to tumour lysis and urate
   nephropathy.  Evidence for right renal stones (likely uric acid), and
   left hydronephrosis (possible external compression by
   lymphadenopathy).  Hold CVVH and monitor urine output.  Monitor urine
   output, BUN, creatininine, electrolytes while off CVVH.  Consider HD if
   requires resumption of renal replacement therapy.
   FLUIDS -- hypervolemia, Tolerated net negative fluid balance
   overnight.  Desire continued net negative balance, aiming for
   additional 1-2 L net negative for next 24 hrs if tolerated by BP.
   Monitor off CVVH today.
   COAGULOPATHY -- Pt had profuse oozing from HD site, hematuria, with
   associated Hct drop.  Monitor coagulopathy.  Monitor q6h coags for r/o
   DIC
   ANEMIA -- transfuse for goal Hct>21
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- transfuse for plt <50 since bleeding
   NEUTROPENIA
 neutroppenic precautions, PMN counts continue to fall.
   HEMATURIA -- attributed in part to chemotherapy.  No evidence for UTI.
   TACHYCARDIA -- resolved.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM -- Continue on home regimen.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress, but it has improved. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SaO2) and provide supplemental oxygen as needed.

2. Lymphoma (Burkitt's Lymphoma): The patient has a high tumor burden and spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome. Chemotherapy will be continued according to the Heme/Onc service.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised due to tumor lysis and urate nephropathy. There is evidence of right renal stones (likely uric acid) and left hydronephrosis (possible external compression by lymphadenopathy). CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) should be held and urine output, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and electrolytes should be monitored while off CVVH. If required, hemodialysis (HD) may be considered.

4. Fluid imbalance: The patient has hypervolemia, but tolerated a net negative fluid balance overnight. A continued net negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters for the next 24 hours should be aimed for if tolerated by blood pressure (BP). Fluid monitoring will continue off CVVH today.

5. Coagulopathy: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- much improved.  Monitor RR, SaO2.  Provide
   supplimental oxygen as needed.  Aim for net diuresis.
   LYMPHOMA -- Burkitt's Lymphoma, high tumor burden, spontaneous tumor
   lysis syndrome.  To continue chemotherapy as per Heme/Onc service.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- attributed to tumour lysis and urate
   nephropathy.  Evidence for right renal stones (likely uric acid), and
   left hydronephrosis (possible external compression by
   lymphadenopathy).  Hold CVVH and monitor urine output.  Monitor urine
   output, BUN, creatininine, electrolytes while off CVVH.  Consider HD if
   requires resumption of renal replacement therapy.
   FLUIDS -- hypervolemia, Tolerated net negative fluid balance
   overnight.  Desire continued net negative balance, aiming for
   additional 1-2 L net negative for next 24 hrs if tolerated by BP.
   Monitor off CVVH today.
   COAGULOPATHY -- Pt had profuse oozing from HD site, hematuria, with
   associated Hct drop.  Monitor coagulopathy.  Monitor q6h coags for r/o
   DIC
   ANEMIA -- transfuse for goal Hct>21
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- transfuse for plt <50 since bleeding
   NEUTROPENIA
 neutroppenic precautions, PMN counts continue to fall.
   HEMATURIA -- attributed in part to chemotherapy.  No evidence for UTI.
   TACHYCARDIA -- resolved.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM -- Continue on home regimen.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The key findings and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has improved significantly but still requires monitoring of respiratory rate and oxygen saturation levels. Supplemental oxygen may be needed as required.

2. Lymphoma (Burkitt's Lymphoma): The patient has a high tumor burden and spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome. Chemotherapy will continue as per the Heme/Onc service.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is attributed to tumor lysis and urate nephropathy. Right renal stones (likely uric acid) and left hydronephrosis (possible external compression by lymphadenopathy) have been observed. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) has been completed, and the patient is off CVVH. Monitoring of urine output, BUN, creatinine, and electrolytes is important. Consideration for HD (hemodialysis) may be necessary if renal replacement therapy is required again.

4. Fluids: The patient has hypervolemia, but a net negative fluid balance was tolerated overnight. A continued net negative fluid balance is desired, aiming for an additional 1-2 liters net negative for the next 24 hours if tolerated by blood pressure. Monitoring off CVVH today is recommended.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient experienced profuse oozing from the"

   INTERPRETATION:
   46,XX,t(8;14)(q24.1;q32)[10]/
   46,idem,t(X;11)(p22.1;p11.2)[6]/47,idem,+[**Month (only) **][3]/
   47,idem,t(X;11)(p22.1;p11.2),+[**Month (only) **][1]
   All metaphases showed a translocation of chromosomes 8 and 14. This
   translocation is associated with IGH/MYC fusion and is a characteristic
   finding in Burkitt lymphoma.
   The clone with the t(8;14) is the stemline. Three additional abnormal
   subclones are identified. The first
   subclone, represented by [**5-16**] metaphases, has a translocation of
   chromosomes X at band Xp22.1 and 11 at band 11p11.2. The second
   subclone, represented by [**2-13**]
   metaphases, has a marker chromsome. The third subclone, represented by
   [**12-16**] metaphases, has the translocation of chromosomes X and 11 and the
   marker chromosome.
   Small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard
   methods employed.
   FISH evaluation for a MYC rearrangement was performed on nuclei with
   the LSI MYC Dual Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 10526**]
   Molecular) at 8q24 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL. Rearrangement was
   observed in
   74/100 nuclei, which exceeds the normal range (up to 4%
   rearrangement) established for this probe in the Cytogenetics
   Laboratory at [**Hospital1 1**]. MYC rearrangement is
   found in more than 90% of Burkitt lymphomas, but can also be found
   occasionally in other histologies of
   non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The MYC rearrangements in Burkitt lymphomas
   result in MYC overexpression, generally by juxtaposition with an
   immunoglobulin gene.

   All metaphases showed a translocation of chromosomes 8 and 14. This
   translocation is associated with IGH/MYC fusion and is a characteristic
   finding in Burkitt lymphoma.
   The clone with the t(8;14) is the stemline. Three additional abnormal
   subclones are identified. The first
   subclone, represented by [**5-16**] metaphases, has a translocation of
   chromosomes X at band Xp22.1 and 11 at band 11p11.2. The second
   subclone, represented by [**2-13**]
   metaphases, has a marker chromsome. The third subclone, represented by
   [**12-16**] metaphases, has the translocation of chromosomes X and 11 and the
   marker chromosome.
   Small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard
   methods employed.
   FISH evaluation for a MYC rearrangement was performed on nuclei with
   the LSI MYC Dual Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 10526**]
   Molecular) at 8q24 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL. Rearrangement was
   observed in
   74/100 nuclei, which exceeds the normal range (up to 4%
   rearrangement) established for this probe in the Cytogenetics
   Laboratory at [**Hospital1 1**]. MYC rearrangement is
   found in more than 90% of Burkitt lymphomas, but can also be found
   occasionally in other histologies of
   non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The MYC rearrangements in Burkitt lymphomas
   result in MYC overexpression, generally by juxtaposition with an
   immunoglobulin gene.

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old female with a diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma, acute renal failure, and tumor lysis syndrome. The patient was admitted to the ICU with a high tumor burden and spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome. She received Rasburicase for uric acid conversion and had excellent urine output and normal renal function. The patient also received doxorubicin and vincristine yesterday and will have the next dose on day 8. She was on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) but it has been stopped due to stable labs. The patient's goals include maintaining a hematocrit above 21%, platelet count above 50,000/mm3, and continuing to monitor renal function. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: This condition occurs when cancer cells release large amounts of their contents into the bloodstream, leading to electrolyte imbalances and organ dysfunction. The patient has already experienced tumor lysis syndrome and received treatment with Rasburicase. Monitoring of labs, including potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels, will be crucial to prevent further complications.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to tumor lysis and urate nephropathy. Close monitoring of renal function and urine output is necessary. The patient is currently off CVVH, but ongoing assessment of electrolyte balance and fluid management is required.

3. Coagulopathy/P"

   rearrangement) established for this probe in the Cytogenetics
   Laboratory at [**Hospital1 1**]. MYC rearrangement is
   found in more than 90% of Burkitt lymphomas, but can also be found
   occasionally in other histologies of
   non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The MYC rearrangements in Burkitt lymphomas
   result in MYC overexpression, generally by juxtaposition with an
   immunoglobulin gene.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma and is currently experiencing acute renal failure and tumor lysis syndrome. The patient's arterial line was stopped, and CVVH was stopped as labs were stable with a urine output of 100-200cc/hr. The patient's BMT recommendations include decreasing to Hospital1 DIC labs.

The patient has no known drug allergies, and the last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient is currently on various ICU medications, including infusions and other medications. There are no changes to the medical and family history.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: sleeping this morning, negative nausea/vomiting/diarrhea/flatulence/chest pain, and no shortness of breath or abdominal pain.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.5 C (99.5 F)
- Heart rate: 67 bpm (with normal range of 65-110 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 118/55 mmHg (with normal range of 71/104-143/123 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute (with normal range of 14-23 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's neurological assessment shows that they are attentive, follow simple commands, respond appropriately, oriented to time, place, and person, and have normal movement and tone.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- much improved.  Monitor RR, SaO2.  Provide
   supplimental oxygen as needed.  Aim for net diuresis.
   LYMPHOMA -- Burkitt's Lymphoma, high tumor burden, spontaneous tumor
   lysis syndrome.  To continue chemotherapy as per Heme/Onc service.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- attributed to tumour lysis and urate
   nephropathy.  Resolved.  Consider HD if requires resumption of renal
   replacement therapy.
   FLUIDS -- hypervolemia, Tolerated net negative fluid balance
   overnight.  Desire continued net negative balance, aiming for
   additional 1-2 L net negative for next 24 hrs if tolerated by BP.
   Monitor off CVVH today.
   COAGULOPATHY -- Pt had profuse oozing from HD site, hematuria, with
   associated Hct drop.  Monitor coagulopathy.  Monitor q6h coags for r/o
   DIC
   ANEMIA -- transfuse for goal Hct>21
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- transfuse for plt <50 since bleeding
   NEUTROPENIA
 neutroppenic precautions, PMN counts continue to fall.
   HEMATURIA -- attributed in part to chemotherapy.  No evidence for UTI.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM -- Continue on home regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They have hypoxemia, acute renal failure (resolved), lymphoma (Burkitt's type), neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and potential complications such as coagulopathy, hematuria, and hypothyroidism. The patient's respiratory distress has improved but still requires monitoring and supplemental oxygen. Fluid management is crucial due to hypervolemia, aiming for a net negative fluid balance. The patient's coagulopathy needs to be closely monitored, and transfusions may be necessary for anemia and thrombocytopenia. Neutropenic precautions should be maintained, and the patient's hematologic condition should be monitored. The patient is currently on ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is planned for transfer to the floor once stable."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- much improved.  Monitor RR, SaO2.  Provide
   supplimental oxygen as needed.  Aim for net diuresis.
   LYMPHOMA -- Burkitt's Lymphoma, high tumor burden, spontaneous tumor
   lysis syndrome.  To continue chemotherapy as per Heme/Onc service.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE -- attributed to tumour lysis and urate
   nephropathy.  Resolved.  Consider HD if requires resumption of renal
   replacement therapy.
   FLUIDS -- hypervolemia, Tolerated net negative fluid balance
   overnight.  Desire continued net negative balance, aiming for
   additional 1-2 L net negative for next 24 hrs if tolerated by BP.
   Monitor off CVVH today.
   COAGULOPATHY -- Pt had profuse oozing from HD site, hematuria, with
   associated Hct drop.  Monitor coagulopathy.  Monitor q6h coags for r/o
   DIC
   ANEMIA -- transfuse for goal Hct>21
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- transfuse for plt <50 since bleeding
   NEUTROPENIA
 neutroppenic precautions, PMN counts continue to fall.
   HEMATURIA -- attributed in part to chemotherapy.  No evidence for UTI.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM -- Continue on home regimen.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has hypoxemia, indicating low oxygen levels in the blood. Monitoring the respiratory rate and oxygen saturation is essential. Providing supplemental oxygen as needed and aiming for a net diuresis may help improve respiratory function.

2. Lymphoma (Burkitt's Lymphoma): The patient has a high tumor burden, and spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome is a concern. Continuing chemotherapy as per the Heme/Onc service is recommended.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially experienced acute renal failure attributed to tumor lysis and urate nephropathy. However, it has since resolved. Considering hemodialysis (HD) if renal replacement therapy is required in the future.

4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has hypervolemia, but tolerated a net negative fluid balance overnight. It is desired to continue this negative balance, aiming for an additional 1-2 liters net negative for the next 24 hours if tolerated by blood pressure. Monitoring fluid status is crucial.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient had profuse oozing from the HD site, hematuria, and associated Hct drop. Monitoring coagulopathy is essential, and frequent coagulation tests (q6h) should be done to rule out disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC"

   Burkitt's Lymphoma with high tumor burden and spontaneous tumor lysis
   syndrome.  Received Rasburicase for uric acid converion. Pt had e/o TL,
   now labs continue to be stable. Received doxorubicin and vincristine
   [**12-17**] (day 1), next dose day 8 [**12-25**].   CVVH stopped yesterday, continues
   to have excellent UOP, renal function normal.
   - cont allopurinol 100 mg daily, cont to monitor renal fxn
   - BMT said no bactrim, inhaled pentamidine at some point
   - neutropenic precautions, normal
 goals off CVVH
   - Cryo for fibrinogen less than 100, Plts for less than 50 because of
   oozing, Hct>21
   - appreciate heme/onc recs

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Likely due to tumour lysis and urate nephropathy given her prior labs
   from [**Hospital3 **]. Had renal stones, likely uric acid on right, and
   hydronephrosis on left possibly due to external compression by
   tumor/LAD in retroperitoneum. Had marginal urine output. Pt on CVVH so
   creatinine improved.  Urine output continues to improve, possibly
   passed stone or tumor burden reduced.  Stopped CBI and CVVH

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient has been diagnosed with Burkitt's Lymphoma and is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment. The patient is also experiencing Tumor Lysis Syndrome, which has been managed with CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) and close monitoring of labs. The patient's renal function has improved, and they are no longer on CVVH. Additionally, the patient has a history of Hypothyroidism and is being treated with Synthroid.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: As the patient is neutropenic, they are at an increased risk of developing infections. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt treatment of any signs of infection is crucial.
2. Bleeding: With a low platelet count, the patient is at risk of bleeding. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and transfusing platelets as necessary is important.
3. Renal Failure: Although the patient's renal function has improved, there is still a risk of acute renal failure. Close monitoring of kidney function and electrolyte imbalances is essential.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient requires long-term management of hypothyroidism with Synthroid. Regular monitoring of thyroid function and adjusting the medication dosage if needed is necessary.
5. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Although the patient's current episode of Tumor Lysis Syndrome has been managed, there is a risk of recurrence. Monitoring of electrolyte levels and uric acid levels is important to detect"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Burkitt's Lymphoma and Tumor Lysis Syndrome. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature within normal range, heart rate slightly elevated but within acceptable limits, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's weight has decreased from 92.2 kg to 87.8 kg since admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 891 mL, with outputs including 380 mL through the gastrointestinal tract, 511 mL through intravenous fluids, and 2,920 mL through urine. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics and medications for tumor lysis syndrome. The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.7 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 71 K/uL, renal impairment with a creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient also has elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and D-dimer levels. The patient's condition requires close monitoring due to the presence of tumor lysis syndrome, renal failure, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. This can"
