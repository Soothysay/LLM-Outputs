   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5228**] is a 78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p
   BKA, CAD s/p MI, admitted to vascular surgery for right peroeneal
   angiopalsty on [**12-19**] now with ongoing hypotension, hypothermia, and
   need for more aggressive volume removal with CVVH.
   .
   1.  Hypotension.  Patient noted to be hypotensive throughout five day
   hospital stay, routinely having blood pressures in the 70s and 80s.
   She has been noted to be mentating, but there has been concern that her
   mental status is not her baseline per renal (will need to confirm with
   family).  Patient has warm extremities and multiple possible infectious
   sources (RLE heel ulcer, sacral decub, RUE cellulitis) making septic
   shock a strong possibility.  In addition, patient has a history of
   endocarditis with no evidence of vegetations on TTE, but TEE not
   performed.  Less likely etiology of hypotension is cardiogenic shock
   given the finding of new regional wall motion abnormalities consistent
   with ischemia on echo and elevated cardiac enzymes (Trop 0.2 --> 0.2
   --> 0.15 with flat CK).  Patient appears hypervolemia.  Given rising
   WBC, ongoing hypotension, and history of multiple resistant organisms
   in past (VRE, MRSA, cipro-resistant pseudomonas, will cover broadly
   with dapto/[**Last Name (un) 430**]/flagyl.
   - d/c vanco/cipro and start dapto/[**Last Name (un) 430**]
   - continue flagyl until C. diff is negative given abx exposures
   - Daily EKGs
   - check cortisol
   - levophed to maintain MAPS> 56
   - f/u blood culture and stool culture; CXR
   .
   ESRD on dialysis.  Likely secondary to diabetes and HTN.  Patient has
   been getting dialysis 3xweek, but unable to remove volume due to low
   blood pressures.  Now grossly fluid overloaded (?> 30 kg up from dry
   weight) though not requiring supplemental oxygen.  HD line placed
   today.
   - CVVH with goal of 200-300 cc/hour
   - levophed to maintain MAPs> 65 so CVVH can be tolerated
   - no priming of pump due to h/o HIT
   - renal following
   - CXR to evaluate for interstitial edema/fluid overload
   .
   Sacral decubitus ulcer.  Patient was evaluated by plastics for possible
   debridement, however, they are unwilling to debride the wound in
   setting of plavix use.  They recommend improvement of nutritional
   status, frequent turning, and kinaire bed.
   - nutrition
   - vitamin C and zinc
   - logroll q2hr
   - continue kinair bed
   -sacral ulcer: place duoderm over ulcer that is surrounding the
   eschar, then dry 4X4 guaze and ABD pad over entire ulcer
   -Bilater ischial ulcers: place duoderm and allevyn over ulcers
   -we will continue to follow with you
   .
   Heel ulcer.  Patient is s/p right peroneal angioplasty for righ limb
   ischemia who now has right heel necrosis.  Has been evaluated by
   podiatry.
   - multipodis boots
   - podiatry following
   .
   CAD s/p MI.  Patient noted to have new regional wall motion
   abnormalities consistent with ischemia.  Has had two CABGs in past.
   Troponin mildly elevated in setting of renal failure with flat CK not
   suggestive of an acute event.
   - aspirin, plavix, statin
   - hold BB due to hypotension
   .
   Hyponatremia.  Patient appear hypervolemic.  Hyponatremia has worsened
   during hospital stay though patient is on D51/2NS upon arrival to MICu.
   - free water restrict
   - fluid removal with CVVH
   - d/c D51/2NS
   - follow Na
   - check urine lytes, osms
   .
   Leukocytosis.  WBC has been elevated since admission on [**12-18**], though
   is rising of the past few days.  Patient has had no documented fevers,
   though as been hypothermic several times during hospital stay,
   concerning for infectious etiology.  Numerous possible infectious
   sources include her sacral decub, right heel ulcer.
   - follow WBC
   - continue broad spectrum abx
   - follow fever curve
   - follow up blood cultures, stool culture, CXR
   .
   Anemia.  Baseline Hct between 25 and 32.  Currently 24.8.  Has ESRD,
   history of ACD, and history of chronic GI bleeds due to AVMs and PUD.
   Iron studies on [**12-19**] consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
   - consider initiation of epo, will discuss with renal
   - guiaic stools
   - follow Hct
   .
   Thrombocytopenia.  Thombocytopenia < 100 since [**2115**].  Has history of
   HIT in the past.  Unclear etiology of chronic thrombocytopenia, but
   currently stable.
   - follow plts
   - no heparin due to HIT
   .
   Type 2 DM.  Patient has diabetes.  S/p BKA.
   - insulin SS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   RUE edema.  RUE negative on [**2121-12-23**].  Concerning for cellulitis,
   particularly in setting of rising WBC and hypotension.
   - continue dapto/[**Last Name (un) 430**]
   - f/u blood cultures
   - follow fever, wbc curve
   .
   Elevated INR.  Elevated INR, though not on anticoagulation.   Likely
   secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic use.
   - vitamin K
   - follow coags
   .
   Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   Asthma.
   - continue albuterol, atrovent, advair
   .
   Nutrition.  Patient with albumin of 1.6.  Likely with poor PO intake.
   Will need nutrition consult.  Needs improved nutrition for wound
   healing.
   Ppx: home PPI, pneumoboots (no HSQ due to h/o HIT)
   Nutition: diabetic diet
   ICU care
   Will need to address code status with family/HCP due to patient
   mental status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease post below-knee amputation, coronary artery disease post myocardial infarction. She was admitted for right peroneal angioplasty but is now showing signs of sepsis and anasarca. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and hypothyroidism. She has been experiencing hypotension, leukocytosis, and anemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she requires vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure. She is also on dialysis due to end-stage renal disease. The patient has several skin ulcers and a history of multiple resistant organisms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's signs of sepsis, along with leukocytosis and hypotension, indicate a potential infection. The source of sepsis could be the decubitus ulcers, right foot, groin line, right arm AV fistula, or gut Clostridium difficile infection. Antibiotics have been started, and blood cultures are pending.
2. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which can be due to sepsis, hypoalbuminemia, hypothyroidism, or cardiogenic shock. Treating sepsis as mentioned above, along with stress"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5228**] is a 78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p
   BKA, CAD s/p MI, admitted to vascular surgery for right peroeneal
   angiopalsty on [**12-19**] now with signs of sepsis, and anasarca.
   ongoing hypotension, hypothermia, and need for more aggressive volume
   removal with CVVH.
   .
   1.  Hypotension.  Patient noted to be hypotensive throughout five day
   hospital stay, routinely having blood pressures in the 70s and 80s.
   She has been noted to be mentating, but there has been concern that her
   mental status is not her baseline per renal (will need to confirm with
   family).  Patient has warm extremities and multiple possible infectious
   sources (RLE heel ulcer, sacral decub, RUE cellulitis) making septic
   shock a strong possibility.  In addition, patient has a history of
   endocarditis with no evidence of vegetations on TTE, but TEE not
   performed.  Less likely etiology of hypotension is cardiogenic shock
   given the finding of new regional wall motion abnormalities consistent
   with ischemia on echo and elevated cardiac enzymes (Trop 0.2 --> 0.2
   --> 0.15 with flat CK).  Patient appears hypervolemia.  Given rising
   WBC, ongoing hypotension, and history of multiple resistant organisms
   in past (VRE, MRSA, cipro-resistant pseudomonas, will cover broadly
   with dapto/[**Last Name (un) 430**]/flagyl.
   - d/c vanco/cipro and start dapto/[**Last Name (un) 430**]
   - continue flagyl until C. diff is negative given abx exposures
   - Daily EKGs
   - check cortisol
   - levophed to maintain MAPS> 56
   - f/u blood culture and stool culture; CXR
   .
   ESRD on dialysis.  Likely secondary to diabetes and HTN.  Patient has
   been getting dialysis 3xweek, but unable to remove volume due to low
   blood pressures.  Now grossly fluid overloaded (?> 30 kg up from dry
   weight) though not requiring supplemental oxygen.  HD line placed
   today.
   - CVVH with goal of 200-300 cc/hour
   - levophed to maintain MAPs> 65 so CVVH can be tolerated
   - no priming of pump due to h/o HIT
   - renal following
   - CXR to evaluate for interstitial edema/fluid overload
   .
   Sacral decubitus ulcer.  Patient was evaluated by plastics for possible
   debridement, however, they are unwilling to debride the wound in
   setting of plavix use.  They recommend improvement of nutritional
   status, frequent turning, and kinaire bed.
   - nutrition
   - vitamin C and zinc
   - logroll q2hr
   - continue kinair bed
   -sacral ulcer: place duoderm over ulcer that is surrounding the
   eschar, then dry 4X4 guaze and ABD pad over entire ulcer
   -Bilater ischial ulcers: place duoderm and allevyn over ulcers
   -we will continue to follow with you
   .
   Heel ulcer.  Patient is s/p right peroneal angioplasty for righ limb
   ischemia who now has right heel necrosis.  Has been evaluated by
   podiatry.
   - multipodis boots
   - podiatry following
   .
   CAD s/p MI.  Patient noted to have new regional wall motion
   abnormalities consistent with ischemia.  Has had two CABGs in past.
   Troponin mildly elevated in setting of renal failure with flat CK not
   suggestive of an acute event.
   - aspirin, plavix, statin
   - hold BB due to hypotension
   .
   Hyponatremia.  Patient appear hypervolemic.  Hyponatremia has worsened
   during hospital stay though patient is on D51/2NS upon arrival to MICu.
   - free water restrict
   - fluid removal with CVVH
   - d/c D51/2NS
   - follow Na
   - check urine lytes, osms
   .
   Leukocytosis.  WBC has been elevated since admission on [**12-18**], though
   is rising of the past few days.  Patient has had no documented fevers,
   though as been hypothermic several times during hospital stay,
   concerning for infectious etiology.  Numerous possible infectious
   sources include her sacral decub, right heel ulcer.
   - follow WBC
   - continue broad spectrum abx
   - follow fever curve
   - follow up blood cultures, stool culture, CXR
   .
   Anemia.  Baseline Hct between 25 and 32.  Currently 24.8.  Has ESRD,
   history of ACD, and history of chronic GI bleeds due to AVMs and PUD.
   Iron studies on [**12-19**] consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
   - consider initiation of epo, will discuss with renal
   - guiaic stools
   - follow Hct
   .
   Thrombocytopenia.  Thombocytopenia < 100 since [**2115**].  Has history of
   HIT in the past.  Unclear etiology of chronic thrombocytopenia, but
   currently stable.
   - follow plts
   - no heparin due to HIT
   .
   Type 2 DM.  Patient has diabetes.  S/p BKA.
   - insulin SS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   RUE edema.  RUE negative on [**2121-12-23**].  Concerning for cellulitis,
   particularly in setting of rising WBC and hypotension.
   - continue dapto/[**Last Name (un) 430**]
   - f/u blood cultures
   - follow fever, wbc curve
   .
   Elevated INR.  Elevated INR, though not on anticoagulation.   Likely
   secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic use.
   - vitamin K
   - follow coags
   .
   Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   Asthma.
   - continue albuterol, atrovent, advair
   .
   Nutrition.  Patient with albumin of 1.6.  Likely with poor PO intake.
   Will need nutrition consult.  Needs improved nutrition for wound
   healing.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient has a complex medical history and is currently experiencing multiple health issues. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of sepsis, including hypotension, rising white blood cell count, and multiple possible infectious sources such as heel ulcer, sacral decubitus ulcer, and cellulitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started.

2. Anasarca: The patient is grossly fluid overloaded, with an increase of more than 30 kg from their dry weight. This can be attributed to their end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the inability to remove fluid due to low blood pressures.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been noted to be hypotensive throughout their hospital stay, with blood pressures in the 70s and 80s. The cause of hypotension is multifactorial, including septic shock, cardiogenic shock due to new regional wall motion abnormalities, and fluid overload.

4. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a large sacral decubitus ulcer with eschar, stage II weeping, and surrounding area stage II. Treatment includes frequent turning, kinair bed, and duoderm dressing.

5. Heel ulcer: The patient has a right heel necrosis with an ulcer, evaluated by podiatry. Treatment includes multipodis boots and podiatry follow-up.

6. CAD s/p MI: The patient has new regional wall motion abnormalities consistent with ischemia. They have a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI). Medications include aspirin, Plavix, and statin.

7. Hyponatremia: The patient appears hypervolemic and has worsening hyponatremia during their hospital stay. Fluid removal with CVVH and free water restriction are planned.

8. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has been elevated since admission, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Possible infectious sources include sacral decubitus ulcer, right heel ulcer, and bilateral ischial ulcers.

9. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia likely secondary to ESRD, history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and chronic gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds due to arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Epoetin therapy may be considered.

10. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has chronic thrombocytopenia (<100 since 2015) with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). No heparin is given due to HIT.

11. Type 2 DM: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, which is poorly controlled. Insulin therapy is initiated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease with below-knee amputation, coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarction, admitted to the vascular surgery department for right peroneal angioplasty. She is now presenting with signs of sepsis and anasarca. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is on multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, hypotension, and elevated lactate levels. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient shows signs of sepsis with leukocytosis, hypotension, and positive blood cultures. Immediate treatment is required to control the infection and improve hemodynamic stability.
2. Anasarca: The patient has gross anasarca, which can be related to her renal disease and hypoalbuminemia. Management includes optimizing nutritional intake, addressing underlying causes, and considering dialysis if necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive despite being on multiple pressors. This could be due to sepsis, hypoalbuminemia, hypothyroidism, or cardiogenic shock. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and guide appropriate treatment.
4. Chronic Kidney"

","Summary:
Ms. [Last Name 5228], a 78-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease status post below-knee amputation, and coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, was admitted to the vascular surgery department for right peroneal angioplasty on [12-19]. She is now presenting with gram-negative bacteremia, pressor-responsive hypotension, and anasarca.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient exhibits signs of sepsis, including leukocytosis and hypotension on pressors. Potential sources of infection include decubiti, right foot, groin line, right arm AV fistula, and gut Clostridium difficile.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be attributed to sepsis, hypoalbuminemia, hypothyroidism, or cardiogenic shock. Treatment for hypotension includes increasing pressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.
3. ESRD on hemodialysis: The patient has chronic kidney disease and requires hemodialysis three times a week. However, she does not tolerate hemodialysis due to hypotension. There is a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), so priming of the pump is not performed.
4. Sacral and ischial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease with below-knee amputation, coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarction, and gross anasarca. She was admitted to the vascular surgery service for right peroneal angioplasty but is now critically ill with GNR bacteremia, pressor-responsive hypotension, and anasarca. She has a history of multiple resistant organisms and has been treated with various antibiotics including daptomycin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and metronidazole. The patient is currently on norepinephrine, levophed, and CVVHD due to severe sepsis and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis, hypotension on pressors, and positive blood cultures indicating a potential source of infection in her decubitus ulcers, right foot, groin line, right arm AV fistula, or gut.
2. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension prior to transfer to the MICU, which may be due to sepsis, hypoalbuminemia, hypothyroidism, or cardiogenic shock.
3. ESRD on dialysis: The patient has gross anasarca and does not tolerate HD due to hypotension. There is a"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p BKA, CAD s/p MI,
   admitted to vascular surgery for right peroeneal angiopalsty on [**12-19**]
   now with ongoing hypotension, hypotheremia, and need for more
   aggressive volume removal with CVVH.
   >  Hypotension.  The etiology of the hypotension is probably mixed
   including sepsis (as below), cardiac failure with recent MI and hx of
   MI and relatively preserved EF and poor nutritional status (chronically
   low albumin).  We can consider albumin infusions although these are
   only temporizing.  Tough to interpret the cortisol in this patient
   would be hesitant to give stress dose steroids for now given wound
   impairment if progressively hypotensive then would favor steroid
   repletion. Finally would check TFTs as she is hypothyroid as well.
   Finally , her  chronic anemia is compounding her picture and would
   favor a more aggressive transfusion goal of Hct >25
   - pressor support to allow diuresis
   - nutrition consult
   - TFT
   - defer empiric stress dose steroids
   - transfuse for Hct > 25
   -
   > ESRD on dialysis.  Likely secondary to diabetes and HTN.  Patient has
   been getting dialysis 3xweek, but unable to remove volume due to low
   blood pressures.  Now grossly fluid overloaded (?> 30 kg up from dry
   weight) though not requiring supplemental oxygen.  HD line placed
   today.
   - CVVH with goal of 200-300 cc/hour
   - levophed to maintain MAPs> 65 so CVVH can be tolerated
   >CAD s/p MI.  Patient noted to have new regional wall motion
   abnormalities consistent with ischemia.  Has had two CABGs in past.
   Troponin mildly elevated in setting of renal failure with flat CK not
   suggestive of an acute event.
   - aspirin, plavix, statin
   - hold BB due to hypotension
   .
   >Hyponatremia.  Patient appear hypervolemic.  Hyponatremia has worsened
   during hospital stay though patient is on D51/2NS upon arrival to MICU.
   - free water restrict
   - fluid removal with CVVH
   - d/c D51/2NS
   - follow Na
   > Leukocytosis.  WBC has been elevated since admission on [**12-18**], though
   is rising of the past few days.  Patient has had no documented fevers,
   though as been hypothermic several times during hospital stay,
   concerning for infectious etiology.  Numerous possible infectious
   sources include her sacral decub, vs OM right heel ulcer, c. dif given
   the recent Abx, blood. Will treat with empiric flagyl until c.dif.
   returns, meropenem and cipro for gram neg coverage given hx of DM and
   resistant pseudomonas pathogens, daptomycin for gram postive given hx
   of VRE.
   - follow WBC
   - check ESR, plain films of the heel
   - continue broad spectrum abx
   - plastic surgery consult to help with management of decub ulcer.
   - follow fever curve
   - follow up blood cultures, stool culture,

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease status post below-knee amputation, and coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction. She was admitted to the vascular surgery service for right popliteal angioplasty but now presents with ongoing hypotension, hypothermia, and the need for more aggressive volume removal with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of sepsis, cardiac failure following a recent myocardial infarction, poor nutritional status, and chronic anemia. Considering these factors, it may be appropriate to consider albumin infusions as a temporary measure. However, it would be prudent to avoid administering stress-dose steroids at this time due to impaired wound healing. Additionally, thyroid function tests should be conducted, and the patient's chronic anemia should be addressed by transfusing to a hemoglobin concentration of greater than 25%.

The patient's end-stage renal disease is likely secondary to diabetes and hypertension. Despite receiving dialysis three times a week, she remains fluid overloaded, possibly due to low blood pressures. A CVVH with a goal of 200-300 cc/hour has been initiated to remove excess fluid. Levophed will be used to maintain mean arterial pressures above 65 mmHg, allowing for the tolerance of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease status post below-knee amputation, and coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction. She was admitted to the vascular surgery service for right peroneal angioplasty but is now experiencing ongoing hypotension, hypothermia, and the need for more aggressive volume removal with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of factors including sepsis, cardiac failure with recent myocardial infarction, and poor nutritional status. Pressor support is being given to allow for diuresis, and consideration should be given to albumin infusions. Nutritional support and evaluation for adrenal insufficiency should also be considered.

2. Sepsis: The patient has gram-negative bacteria in her blood cultures, indicating a possible infection. Numerous infectious sources, including a sacral decubitus ulcer and groin line, should be investigated. The patient is currently covered with meropenem and ciprofloxacin for gram-negative coverage, as well as daptomycin for gram-positive coverage given her history of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). It is recommended to follow white blood cell counts and culture results, and broad-spectrum"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease status post below-knee amputation, and coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction. She was admitted to the vascular surgery service for right popliteal angioplasty but is now experiencing ongoing hypotension, hypothermia, and the need for more aggressive volume removal with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypotension:
   - Mixed etiology including sepsis, cardiac failure with recent MI, poor nutritional status, and chronic anemia.
   - Pressor support to allow diuresis, nutrition, evaluation for adrenal insufficiency, and transfusion goal of Hct > 25.

2. Sepsis:
   - Patient has gram-negative rods in blood cultures.
   - Numerous possible infectious sources include sacral decubitus ulcer and groin line.
   - Concurrent Clostridium difficile infection should be considered.
   - Currently covered with meropenem and ciprofloxacin for gram-negative coverage, daptomycin for gram-positive coverage.
   - Follow WBC, cultures, continue broad-spectrum antibiotics, and narrow based on cultures.
   - Plastic surgery consult to help with management of decubitus ulcer.
   - Replace L groin line with internal jugular"

She was admitted to the vascular surgery service for a right popliteal angioplasty and is currently in the ICU.

The patient has ongoing hypotension, hypothermia, and requires aggressive volume removal with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She is also hypothyroid, has chronic anemia, and is receiving dialysis three times a week.

The patient's cardiovascular status includes cardiac failure with a recent myocardial infarction, relatively preserved ejection fraction, and poor nutritional status. She is on pressor support and diuresis.

Her respiratory status is stable with an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. However, she has an elevated white blood cell count suggestive of an infection, and there are numerous possible infectious sources including sacral decubitus, right heel ulcer, Clostridium difficile colitis, and bacteremia.

The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema, and her right lower extremity is negative, raising concern for cellulitis. She also has elevated INR likely due to malnutrition and antibiotic use.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p BKA, CAD s/p MI,
   admitted to vascular surgery for right peroneal angiopalsty on [**12-19**]
   now with ongoing hypotension, hypotheremia, and need for more
   aggressive volume removal with CVVH.
    >  Hypotension.  The etiology of the hypotension is probably mixed
   including sepsis (as below), cardiac failure with recent MI and poor
   nutritional status (chronically low albumin).  We can consider albumin
   infusions although these are only temporizing.  Borderlin cortisol may
   also suggest AI. TFTs with normal TSH and low T4, but unlikely to be
   playing a role in hypotension. Finally , her chronic anemia is
   compounding her picture and would favor a more aggressive transfusion

   -          transfuse for Hct > 25
   > Sepsis. Patient with GNR in blood.  Numerous possible infectious
   sources include her sacral decub and groin line. Also could have
   concurrent C. diff, so will continue flagyl until comes back. Currently
   covered with Meropenem and cipro for gram neg coverage given hx of DM
   and resistant pseudomonas pathogens, Daptomycin for gram postive given
   hx of VRE. Of note, plastic surgery came by to see about decub ulcer,
   but only recommended topical treatment, nothing invasive given she is
   on plavix. Plavix d/c

   recommendation to desensitize to Unasyn. Pt received ceftriaxone in

   -          plastic surgery consult to help with management of decub
   ulcer.
   -          Will likely need to have L groin line removed and resited.

   -          Repeat lactic acid of 4
   > ESRD on dialysis.  Likely secondary to diabetes and HTN.  Patient has
   been getting dialysis 3xweek, but unable to remove volume due to low
   blood pressures.  Now grossly fluid overloaded (?> 30 kg up from dry
   weight) though not requiring supplemental oxygen.  HD line will need to
   be replaced today to continue CVVH (cannot do that through fistula)

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease status post below-knee amputation, and coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction. She was admitted to the vascular surgery service for right peroneal angioplasty but is now experiencing ongoing hypotension, hypothermia, and the need for more aggressive volume removal with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of sepsis, cardiac failure following a recent myocardial infarction, poor nutritional status, and chronic anemia. Pressor support is being provided to allow for diuresis, and further evaluation for adrenal insufficiency should be considered.

2. Sepsis: The patient has gram-negative rods in her blood culture, indicating a possible infection. There are multiple potential infectious sources, including a sacral decubitus ulcer and groin line infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, but consideration should be given to discontinuing ciprofloxacin due to the patient's penicillin allergy. Desensitization to Unasyn is recommended as it is the only antibiotic sensitive to the identified GNR.

3. Chronic kidney disease (ESRD): The patient has been on hem"

   Total time spent: 35 minutes, patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's ongoing hypotension may be due to a mixed etiology, including sepsis, cardiac failure with recent myocardial infarction (MI), and poor nutritional status. Chronic anemia is also compounding the picture.

2. Sepsis: The patient has MDR GNR (multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacteria) sensitive only to colistin in her blood. There are numerous possible infectious sources, including sacral decub and groin line. She is currently covered with Unasyn and Colistin for gram-negative coverage and Daptomycin for gram-positive coverage given her history of Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).

3. ESRD on dialysis: The patient has chronic kidney disease secondary to diabetes and hypertension. She has been getting dialysis three times a week but is unable to remove volume due to low blood pressures. She is grossly fluid overloaded.

4. CAD s/p MI: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone two coronary artery bypass grafts (CABGs). She now has new regional wall motion abnormalities consistent with ischemia.

5. Hyponatremia: The patient appears hypervolemic, and her hyponatremia may be related to fluid overload.

6. RUE edema: The patient has edema"

   78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p BKA, CAD s/p MI,
   admitted to vascular surgery for right peroneal angiopalsty on [**12-19**]
   now with ongoing hypotension, hypothermia, and need for more aggressive
   volume removal with CVVH.
     >  Hypotension.  The etiology of the hypotension is probably mixed
   including sepsis (as below), cardiac failure with recent MI and poor
   nutritional status (chronically low albumin).  Borderline cortisol may
   have suggest AI, but [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim was normal. TFTs with normal TSH and low
   T4, but unlikely to be playing a role in hypotension. Finally , her
   chronic anemia is compounding her picture and would favor a more
   aggressive transfusion goal of Hct >25.
   -          Persistent pressor requirements
   -          Nutrition per c/s
   -          Transfuse for Hct > 25
   -          Will need temporary groin line for additional access given
   pressors/abx
   > Sepsis. Patient with MDR GNR sensitive only to colistin in blood.
   Numerous possible infectious sources include her sacral decub and groin
   line. Per ID, currently covered with Unasyn and Colistin for gram neg
   coverage and Daptomycin for gram postive given hx of VRE. Also could
   have concurrent C. diff, so will continue flagyl until comes back
   negative x3. Of note, plastic surgery came by to see about decub ulcer,
   but only recommended topical treatment, nothing invasive given she is
   on plavix. Plavix d/c
ed [**12-23**].
   -          WBC slightly increased, but downtrending overall
   -          Follow-up cultures
 2 blood cultures 11/27 pending, 1 from
   [**12-26**] pending
   -          Continue broad spectrum abx  per ID
 consider d/c
   colistin now on high dose unasyn (sensitization complete)
   -          D/c flagyl if c.diff x 3 negative
   -          Needs to have left groin line removed
   -          Levophed to maintain MAPs> 55 while on CVVH
   -          Repeat lactic acid decreasing 3.0
   -          Repeat imaging of right arm to ensure no underlying source
   -          Plastic surgery on board to help with management of decub
   ulcer
   -          Plan for CT with IV contrast to address above (and cystic
   mass)
   > ESRD on dialysis.  Likely secondary to diabetes and HTN.  Patient has
   been getting dialysis 3xweek, but unable to remove volume due to low
   blood pressures.  Now grossly fluid overloaded (?> 30 kg up from dry
   weight) though not requiring supplemental oxygen.  HD line will need to
   be replaced today to continue CVVH (cannot do that through fistula)
   -          Replace non-functioning groin line with HD in L IJ per IR
   -          Will restart CVVHD after new HD line
   > CAD s/p MI.  Patient noted to have new regional wall motion
   abnormalities consistent with ischemia.  Has had two CABGs in past.
   Troponin mildly elevated in setting of renal failure with flat CK not
   suggestive of an acute event.
   -          aspirin, statin
   -          hold BB due to hypotension
   >Hyponatremia.  Patient appears hypervolemic.
   -          free water restrict
   -          fluid removal with CVVH
   > RUE edema.  RUE negative on [**2121-12-23**].  Concerning for
   cellulitis/abscess, possibly source of sepsis.
   -          continue dapto
   -          imaging as above
   > Elevated INR.  Elevated INR, though not on anticoagulation.   Likely
   secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic use.
   -          vitamin K IV
   -          follow coags
   -          FFP for procedures
   > Anemia: Hct decreased from 30 to 27.5, now 25.8. Initial decrease
   likely due to HD line having to be changed 4x with loss of blood each
   time. Also, pt with history of AVMs.
   -          Follow Hct

","The patient is a 78-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease, and a below-knee amputation. She was admitted to the vascular surgery service for right peroneal angioplasty but developed sepsis requiring pressors. The patient has ongoing hypotension, hypothermia, and needs more aggressive volume removal with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to a combination of sepsis, cardiac failure following a recent myocardial infarction, poor nutritional status, and chronic anemia. Aggressive fluid removal with CVVH and transfusion to achieve a hematocrit (Hct) level above 25 may be necessary.

2. Sepsis: The patient has MDR Gram-negative bacteria in her blood that is sensitive only to colistin. There are multiple potential infectious sources, including a sacral decubitus ulcer and groin line. She is currently covered with Unasyn and Colistin for gram-negative coverage and Daptomycin for gram-positive coverage given her history of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE). Concurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection should also be considered, and Flagyl may be continued until it returns negative three times.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p BKA, CAD s/p MI,
   admitted to vascular surgery for right peroneal angiopalsty on [**12-19**]
   now with ongoing hypotension, hypotheremia, and need for more
   aggressive volume removal with CVVH.
     >  Hypotension.  The etiology of the hypotension is probably mixed
   including sepsis (as below), cardiac failure with recent MI and poor
   nutritional status (chronically low albumin).  We can consider albumin
   infusions although these are only temporizing.  Borderlin cortisol may
   also suggest AI. TFTs with normal TSH and low T4, but unlikely to be
   playing a role in hypotension. Finally , her chronic anemia is
   compounding her picture and would favor a more aggressive transfusion
   goal of Hct >25

   -          [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim normal
   -          transfuse for Hct > 25
   > Sepsis. Patient with GNR in blood.  Numerous possible infectious
   sources include her sacral decub and groin line. Also could have
   concurrent C. diff, so will continue flagyl until comes back. Currently
   covered with Meropenem and cipro for gram neg coverage given hx of DM
   and resistant pseudomonas pathogens, Daptomycin for gram postive given
   hx of VRE. Of note, plastic surgery came by to see about decub ulcer,
   but only recommended topical treatment, nothing invasive given she is
   on plavix. Plavix d/c
   -          WBC slightly increased, but downtrending overall
   -          follow-up cultures

   -          d/c flagyl if c.diff x 3 negative
   -          plastic surgery on board to help with management of decub
   ulcer
 will need imaging when stable for CT
   -          Needs to have left groin line removed
   -          Levophed to maintain MAPs> 55 while on CVVH
   -          Repeat lactic acid decreasing 3.0
   -          Repeat imaging of right arm to ensure no underlying source
   ideally CT if stable
   > ESRD on dialysis.  Likely secondary to diabetes and HTN.  Patient has
   been getting dialysis 3xweek, but unable to remove volume due to low
   blood pressures.  Now grossly fluid overloaded (?> 30 kg up from dry
   weight) though not requiring supplemental oxygen.  HD line will need to
   be replaced today to continue CVVH (cannot do that through fistula)
   -          Replace non-functioning groin line with HD in L IJ per IR
   -          Will restart CVVHD after new HD line
   >CAD s/p MI.  Patient noted to have new regional wall motion
   abnormalities consistent with ischemia.  Has had two CABGs in past.
   Troponin mildly elevated in setting of renal failure with flat CK not
   suggestive of an acute event.
   -          aspirin, statin
   -          hold BB due to hypotension
   >Hyponatremia.  Patient appear hypervolemic.  Hyponatremia has worsened
   during hospital stay though patient is on D51/2NS upon arrival to MICU.

   -          follow coags
   -          FFP for procedures
   > Anemia: Hct decreased from 30 to 27.5, now 25.8. Initial decrease
   likely due to HD line having to be changed 4x with loss of blood each
   time. Also, pt with history of AVMs.
   -          Follow Hct

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post below-knee amputation (BKA), and coronary artery disease (CAD) with a history of myocardial infarction (MI). 

The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery department for right peroneal angioplasty but is now experiencing ongoing hypotension, hypothermia, and the need for more aggressive fluid removal with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to a combination of sepsis, cardiac failure following the recent MI, and poor nutritional status. Chronic anemia is also contributing to the hypotension, suggesting a need for more aggressive transfusion with a goal hematocrit (Hct) >25.

2. Sepsis: The patient has Gram-negative rods (GNR) in her blood, indicating a possible infection. There are multiple potential sources of infection, including a sacral decubitus ulcer and a groin line. The patient is currently being covered with meropenem and ciprofloxacin for GNR coverage, as well as daptomycin for Gram-positive organisms due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p BKA, CAD s/p MI,
   admitted to vascular surgery for right peroneal angiopalsty on [**12-19**]
   now with ongoing hypotension, hypotheremia, and need for more
   aggressive volume removal with CVVH.
     >  Hypotension.  The etiology of the hypotension is probably mixed
   including sepsis (as below), cardiac failure with recent MI and poor
   nutritional status (chronically low albumin).  We can consider albumin
   infusions although these are only temporizing.  Borderlin cortisol may
   also suggest AI. TFTs with normal TSH and low T4, but unlikely to be
   playing a role in hypotension. Finally , her chronic anemia is
   compounding her picture and would favor a more aggressive transfusion
   goal of Hct >25
   -          persistent pressor requirements
   -          Nutrition per c/s
   -          [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim normal
   -          transfuse for Hct > 25
   > Sepsis. Patient with GNR in blood.  Numerous possible infectious
   sources include her sacral decub and groin line. Also could have
   concurrent C. diff, so will continue flagyl until comes back. Currently
   covered with Meropenem and cipro for gram neg coverage given hx of DM
   and resistant pseudomonas pathogens, Daptomycin for gram postive given
   hx of VRE. Of note, plastic surgery came by to see about decub ulcer,
   but only recommended topical treatment, nothing invasive given she is
   on plavix. Plavix d/c
   -          WBC slightly increased, but downtrending overall
   -          follow-up cultures
 2 blood cultures 11/27 pending, 1 from
   [**12-26**] pending
   -          continue broad spectrum abx  per ID
 consider d/c
   colistin now on high dose unasyn (sensitization complete)
   -          d/c flagyl if c.diff x 3 negative
   -          plastic surgery on board to help with management of decub
   ulcer
 will need imaging when stable for CT
   -          Needs to have left groin line removed
   -          Levophed to maintain MAPs> 55 while on CVVH
   -          Repeat lactic acid decreasing 3.0
   -          Repeat imaging of right arm to ensure no underlying source
   ideally CT if stable
   > ESRD on dialysis.  Likely secondary to diabetes and HTN.  Patient has
   been getting dialysis 3xweek, but unable to remove volume due to low
   blood pressures.  Now grossly fluid overloaded (?> 30 kg up from dry
   weight) though not requiring supplemental oxygen.  HD line will need to
   be replaced today to continue CVVH (cannot do that through fistula)
   -          Replace non-functioning groin line with HD in L IJ per IR
   -          Will restart CVVHD after new HD line
   >CAD s/p MI.  Patient noted to have new regional wall motion
   abnormalities consistent with ischemia.  Has had two CABGs in past.
   Troponin mildly elevated in setting of renal failure with flat CK not
   suggestive of an acute event.
   -          aspirin, statin
   -          hold BB due to hypotension
   >Hyponatremia.  Patient appear hypervolemic.  Hyponatremia has worsened
   during hospital stay though patient is on D51/2NS upon arrival to MICU.
   Stable.
   -          free water restrict
   -          fluid removal with CVVH
   > RUE edema.  RUE negative on [**2121-12-23**].  Concerning for
   cellulitis/abscess, possibly source of sepsis.
   -          continue dapto
   -          imaging as above
   > Elevated INR.  Elevated INR, though not on anticoagulation.   Likely
   secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic use.
   -          vitamin K IV
   -          follow coags
   -          FFP for procedures
   > Anemia: Hct decreased from 30 to 27.5, now 25.8. Initial decrease
   likely due to HD line having to be changed 4x with loss of blood each
   time. Also, pt with history of AVMs.
   -          Follow Hct
   -          Epogen
   > Abdominal mass: Unclear etiology,
   -          Consider CT with PO/IV contrast

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post below-knee amputation (BKA), and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI). The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service for right peroneal angioplasty but is now experiencing ongoing hypotension, hypothermia, and requires more aggressive volume removal with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's current assessment includes:
1. Hypotension: The cause of the hypotension is likely a combination of sepsis, cardiac failure due to recent MI, poor nutritional status, and chronic anemia. The patient's low albumin level indicates chronic malnutrition, which may contribute to the hypotension. A more aggressive transfusion goal of hematocrit (Hct) >25% is recommended.
2. Sepsis: The patient has gram-negative rods (GNR) in her blood culture, indicating an infection. Possible sources of infection include sacral decubitus ulcer and groin line. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem and ciprofloxacin) are being administered, and the patient is also receiving daptomycin for gram-positive coverage due to her history of vancomycin-resistant"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known Last Name 5228**] is a 78-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post below-knee amputation (BKA), and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI). She was admitted to vascular surgery for right peroneal angioplasty on [**12-19**] and is now presenting with gram-negative bacilli (GNR) bacteremia, pressor-responsive hypotension, and anasarca.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: leukocytosis, hypotension on pressors. Sources: decubiti, right foot, groin line, right arm AV fistula, gut C. diff.
   a. Continue Dapto/Flagyl.
   b. Started Unasyn, after successful desensitization.
   c. ID re need for continued colistin.
   d. Lactic Acid [**6-1**] be from dialysate, VBG pH 7.46 recheck off CVVHD.
   e. C. diff *3.
   f. Serial blood cultures.
   g. Consult plastics re: source control for sacral decubiti plan for intervention as of [**12-24**].
   h. Trend leukocytosis: mild improvement.
   i. IR IJ line, FFP prior to procedure and right fem line.
   j. Abscess scarum and right arm, characterize abd mass.

2. Hypotension. Hx hypotension with HD, but with persistent hypotension prior to transfer to MICU. Hypotension from sepsis vs hypoalbuminemia vs hypothyroid vs cardiogenic shock. Tx sepsis as above. Cortisol 14.5. Needed to increase pressor support overnight. TSH wnl, mildly low free T4 likely related to patient's current sepsis.
   a. Cortisol Stimulation Test to evaluate for relative adrenal insufficiency.
   b. Nutrition recommended supplementation with [**Doctor First Name 470**] [**Doctor First Name **], and consideration NG/G if intake does not improve.
   c. Cardiogenic shock: new wall motion defect, preserved EF 55%, likely due to hypotension, will monitor daily EKGs.
   d. Continue levophed, goal MAP > 65.
   e. Patient fluid responsive -- intubated.

3. ESRD on dialysis. [**3-1**] DM, HTN. HD 3*/wk. Gross anasarca, does not tolerate HD due to hypotension. No priming of pump due to h/o HIT. L groin HD line for CVVHD failed.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for the patient. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia and is pressor-responsive hypotensive, indicating a possible ongoing infection. This could lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition.

2. Anasarca: The patient has gross anasarca, which refers to generalized edema. This can be associated with hypoalbuminemia and may indicate a poor prognosis.

3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension despite pressor support. This could be due to sepsis, hypoalbuminemia, hypothyroidism, or cardiogenic shock.

4. ESRD on dialysis: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis (HD) three times a week. They do not tolerate HD well due to hypotension. There is also a mention of a failed CVVHD line.

5. Sacral and ischial decubitus ulcers: The patient has pressure ulcers on their sacrum and ischial area. These require regular turning, wound care, and nutritional support.

6. Heel ulcer: The patient has a non-healing heel ulcer, likely related to peripheral arterial disease and previous angioplasty.

7. Right arm pain/scar: The patient has pain and concern for ischemic injury in their right arm"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including type 2 diabetes, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease post below-knee amputation, and coronary artery disease post myocardial infarction. She was admitted to the vascular surgery department for right peroneal angioplasty and is now experiencing bacteremia with Gram-negative rods (GNRs) that are sensitive only to amp/sulbactam. The patient also has pressor-responsive hypotension and anasarca (generalized swelling).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), hypotension on pressors, and potential sources of infection including decubiti (pressure sores), right foot, groin line catheter, and gut Clostridium difficile. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is negative for endocarditis, but further testing may be required if there are positive blood cultures. The patient has a history of multiple resistant organisms in the past, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a wound.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension could be due to sepsis, hypoalbuminemia, hypothyroidism"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease post below-knee amputation, and coronary artery disease post myocardial infarction. She was admitted to the vascular surgery service for right peroneal angioplasty and subsequently developed gram-negative rod bacteremia, pressor-responsive hypotension, and anasarca.

The patient has a history of multiple resistant organisms including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in the urine, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the blood, and ciprofloxacin-resistant pseudomonas in a wound.

Current Assessment and Plan:

1. Gram Negative Rod Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis, hypotension on pressors, and anasarca. The most likely source of infection is the left groin line. Decubiti should be evaluated. The patient's right foot has been evaluated with x-ray negative for osteomyelitis and stage II heel ulcer. AV fistula with patent flow by ultrasound. C. diff negative.

- Continue dapto/flagyl
- Started Unasyn after successful desensitization and will continue
- Appreciate ID recs, will stop colistin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post below-knee amputation (BKA), and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI). The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service for right peroneal angioplasty and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with several medical complications.

The patient has sepsis caused by a gram-negative bacteremia, which may be due to a central line infection as the line has been removed. There is also an ongoing concern for Acinetobacter infection, but this has not been definitively confirmed. The patient's hypotension is pressor-responsive and she has anasarca (generalized edema). She has a history of multiple resistant organisms including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas in her past.

   angioplasty on [**12-19**] now with GNR bacteremia, pressor responsive
   hypotension and anasarca.
   1.       Sepsis: leukocytosis, hypotension on pressors. Decompensated
   since stopping MEROPENEM [**12-24**] and need to consider acinetobacter may
   not be the organism. Most likely source left groin line and that has
   been removed [**2121-12-26**]. Acinetobactor if real would more likely be from
   decubiti, awaiting final read on CT abdomen. Right foot with x-ray
   negative for osteomyelitis and stage II heel ulcer. AV fistula with
   patent flow by ultrasound. C. diff negative *2. TTE negative ( hx
   endocarditis, if bl cx + will request TEE). History of multiple

   2.       Hypotension.  Hx hypotension with HD, but with persistent
   hypotension prior to transfer to MICU. Hypotension from sepsis vs
   hypoalbuminemia vs hypothyroid vs cardiogenic shock. Tx sepsis as
   above. Cortisol 14.5, stemmed to over 20. TSH wnl, mildly low T4 likely
   related to patient current sepsis. Cardiogenic shock unlikely new wall
   motion defect, with preserved EF 55%
   a.       Nutrition recommended supplementation with [**Doctor First Name 470**] [**Doctor First Name **], and
   consideration NG/G if intake does not improve
   b.       Continue levophed, decrease goal MAP > 55 given baseline
   hypotensive
   c.        Patient fluid responsive -- intubated
   3.       ESRD on dialysis.  [**3-1**] DM, HTN. HD 3*/wk. Gross anasarca, does
   not tolerate HD due to hypotension  No priming of pump due to h/o HIT.
   . L groin HD line for CVVHD failed and removed [**2121-12-26**].

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p BKA, CAD s/p MI,
   admitted to vascular surgery for right peroneal angiopalsty on [**12-19**]
   now with ongoing hypotension, hypothermia, and need for more aggressive
   volume removal with CVVH.
   >  Hypotension.  The etiology of the hypotension is likely sepsis (as
   below).  Borderline cortisol may have suggest AI, but [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim was
   normal. TFTs with normal TSH and low T4, but unlikely to be playing a
   role in hypotension. Finally , her chronic anemia is compounding her
   picture and would favor a more aggressive transfusion goal of Hct >25.
   -          Persistent pressor requirements
   -          Transfuse for Hct > 25
   -          Will need temporary groin line for additional access given
   pressors/abx
   > Sepsis. Patient with MDR acinetobacter sensitive only to unasyn in
   blood (sensitivities to colistin added).  Numerous possible infectious
   sources include her sacral decub and groin line. Per ID, currently
   covered with Unasyn for gram neg coverage and Daptomycin for gram
   postive given hx of VRE. Also could have concurrent intraabdominal
   process, so will continue flagyl until final read on CT back. Of note,
   plastic surgery came by to see about decub ulcer, but only recommended
   topical treatment, nothing invasive given she is on plavix. Plavix
   d/c
ed [**12-23**]. Given that patient initially improved on Meropenem
   (decreased WBC count and briefly off pressors), and now has been
   getting progressively worse since changed to unasyn (increased pressor
   requirements, less responsive, increased WBC count), will add back
   meropenem.  RUE u/s negative x 3. Abd CT pending.
   -          Add back Meropenem to dapto/flagyl/unasyn (CVVHD dosing)
   -          Follow-up cultures
   -          C.diff x 3 negative
   -          Levophed to maintain MAPs> 55 while on CVVH
   -          Plastic surgery on board to help with management of decub
   ulcer
   -          F/u Abd CT
   > ESRD on dialysis.  Likely secondary to diabetes and HTN.  Patient has
   been getting dialysis 3xweek, but unable to remove volume due to low
   blood pressures.  Now grossly fluid overloaded (?> 30 kg up from dry
   weight) though not requiring supplemental oxygen.  HD line replaced
   [**12-26**] and now back on CVVH (cannot do that through fistula)
   -          Continue CVVHD
   > CAD s/p MI.  Patient noted to have new regional wall motion
   abnormalities consistent with ischemia.  Has had two CABGs in past.
   Troponin mildly elevated in setting of renal failure with flat CK not
   suggestive of an acute event.
   -          aspirin, statin
   -          hold BB due to hypotension
   >Hyponatremia.  Patient appears hypervolemic.
   -          free water restrict
   -          fluid removal with CVVH
   > RUE edema with pain out of proportion to exam.  RUE negative x3.
   Unclear if vascular event happened, but extremity does not appear
   ischemic.
   -          continue dapto
   > Elevated INR.  Elevated INR, though not on anticoagulation.   Likely
   secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic use.
   -          vitamin K IV
   -          follow coags
   -          FFP for procedures
   > Anemia: Hct decreased from 30 to 27.5, now 25.8. Decrease likely
   iatrogenic due to CVVHD filter having to be changed multiple times with
   loss of blood each time and labs. Also, pt with history of AVMs.
   -          Transfuse to keep Hct > 25
   -          Epogen
   > HIT positive: Not on SQ heparin.
   > Abdominal mass: Unclear etiology,
   -          F/u final CT read

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to an infection with multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter. The possible sources of infection include sacral decubitus ulcer and groin line. The patient is currently being treated with Unasyn for gram-negative coverage and Daptomycin for gram-positive bacteria.

2. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which may be due to sepsis. The low blood pressure is further compounded by chronic anemia, resulting in a more aggressive transfusion goal of Hct >25.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient appears hypervolemic and has hyponatremia. This may be related to fluid overload and free water retention.

4. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated INR, likely secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic use. Vitamin K IV and coagulation monitoring are planned.

5. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased significantly, likely due to iatrogenic blood loss from CVVHD filter changes and history of arteriovenous malformations. Transfusion to maintain Hct >25 and Epogen are recommended.

6. Abdominal mass: The etiology of the abdominal mass is unclear, and a follow-up CT read is pending.

7. Other issues: The patient has other concerns, including ongoing hyp"

ed [**12-23**]. Given that patient initially improved on Meropenem
   (decreased WBC count and briefly off pressors), and now has been
   getting progressively worse since changed to unasyn (increased pressor
   requirements, less responsive, increased WBC count), will add back
   meropenem.  RUE u/s negative x 3. Abd CT pending.
   -          Add back Meropenem to dapto/flagyl/unasyn (CVVHD dosing)
   -          Follow-up cultures
   -          C.diff x 3 negative
   -          Levophed to maintain MAPs> 55 while on CVVH

   > ESRD on dialysis.  Likely secondary to diabetes and HTN.  Patient has
   been getting dialysis 3xweek, but unable to remove volume due to low
   blood pressures.  Now grossly fluid overloaded (?> 30 kg up from dry
   weight) though not requiring supplemental oxygen.  HD line replaced
   [**12-26**] and now back on CVVH (cannot do that through fistula)
   -          Continue CVVHD
   > CAD s/p MI.  Patient noted to have new regional wall motion
   abnormalities consistent with ischemia.  Has had two CABGs in past.
   Troponin mildly elevated in setting of renal failure with flat CK not
   suggestive of an acute event.
   -          aspirin, statin
   -          hold BB due to hypotension
   >Hyponatremia.  Patient appears hypervolemic.
   -          free water restrict
   -          fluid removal with CVVH
   > RUE edema with pain out of proportion to exam.  RUE negative x3.
   Unclear if vascular event happened, but extremity does not appear
   ischemic.
   -          continue dapto
   > Elevated INR.  Elevated INR, though not on anticoagulation.   Likely
   secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic use.
   -          vitamin K IV
   -          follow coags
   -          FFP for procedures
   > Anemia: Hct decreased from 30 to 27.5, now 25.8. Decrease likely
   iatrogenic due to CVVHD filter having to be changed multiple times with
   loss of blood each time and labs. Also, pt with history of AVMs.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-knee amputation (BKA), and coronary artery disease (CAD) with a history of myocardial infarction (MI). She was admitted for right peroneal angioplasty but is now experiencing hypotension, hypothermia, and requires more aggressive volume removal with continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH).

The patient has sepsis caused by multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter infection, which is sensitive only to Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn) in the blood. She also has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection. The possible infectious sources include her sacral decubitus ulcer and groin line. The patient is currently being covered with Unasyn for gram-negative coverage and Daptomycin for gram-positive coverage due to her history of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Additionally, she may have an intra-abdominal process, so Flagyl will be continued until the final read on the CT scan.

The patient's cardiac status is complicated by CAD with previous CABGs and new regional wall motion abnormalities consistent with ischemia. Her troponin levels are mildly elevated, but this may"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities including chronic anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, decubitus ulcer, hyponatremia, impaired skin integrity, neuropathy, pain control, peptic ulcer disease, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but they have diminished peripheral pulses and diminished breath sounds at the bases of the lungs. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including dialysis and multi-lumen lines. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Given the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay, there is a risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections, or pressure ulcers.
2. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding, particularly if the platelet count continues to decrease or if there are any complications during procedures or medication administration.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,664 mL and output of 2,588 mL over 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of 16 mL. This may indicate inadequate fluid resuscitation or ongoing fluid losses.
4. Hypotension: Despite being on norepinephrine, the patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p BKA, CAD s/p MI,
   admitted to vascular surgery for right peroneal angiopalsty on [**12-19**]
   now with ongoing hypotension, hypothermia, and need for more aggressive
   volume removal with CVVH.
   >  Hypotension.  The etiology of the hypotension is likely sepsis (as
   below).  Borderline cortisol may have suggest AI, but [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim was
   normal. TFTs with normal TSH and low T4, but unlikely to be playing a
   role in hypotension. Finally , her chronic anemia is compounding her
   picture and would favor a more aggressive transfusion goal of Hct >25.
   -          Persistent pressor requirements
   -          Transfuse for Hct > 25
   -          Will need temporary groin line for additional access given
   pressors/abx
   > Sepsis. Patient with MDR acinetobacter sensitive only to unasyn in
   blood (sensitivities to colistin added).  Numerous possible infectious
   sources include her sacral decub and groin line. Per ID, currently
   covered with Unasyn for gram neg coverage and Daptomycin for gram
   postive given hx of VRE. Also could have concurrent intraabdominal
   process, so will continue flagyl until final read on CT back. Of note,
   plastic surgery came by to see about decub ulcer, but only recommended
   topical treatment, nothing invasive given she is on plavix. Plavix
   d/c
ed [**12-23**]. Given that patient initially improved on Meropenem
   (decreased WBC count and briefly off pressors), and now has been
   getting progressively worse since changed to unasyn (increased pressor
   requirements, less responsive, increased WBC count), will add back
   meropenem.  RUE u/s negative x 3. Abd CT pending.
   -          Add back Meropenem to dapto/flagyl/unasyn (CVVHD dosing)
   -          Follow-up cultures
   -          C.diff x 3 negative
   -          Levophed to maintain MAPs> 55 while on CVVH
   -          Plastic surgery on board to help with management of decub
   ulcer
   -          F/u Abd CT
   > ESRD on dialysis.  Likely secondary to diabetes and HTN.  Patient has
   been getting dialysis 3xweek, but unable to remove volume due to low
   blood pressures.  Now grossly fluid overloaded (?> 30 kg up from dry
   weight) though not requiring supplemental oxygen.  HD line replaced
   [**12-26**] and now back on CVVH (cannot do that through fistula)
   -          Continue CVVHD
   > CAD s/p MI.  Patient noted to have new regional wall motion
   abnormalities consistent with ischemia.  Has had two CABGs in past.
   Troponin mildly elevated in setting of renal failure with flat CK not
   suggestive of an acute event.
   -          aspirin, statin
   -          hold BB due to hypotension
   >Hyponatremia.  Patient appears hypervolemic.
   -          free water restrict
   -          fluid removal with CVVH
   > RUE edema with pain out of proportion to exam.  RUE negative x3.
   Unclear if vascular event happened, but extremity does not appear
   ischemic.
   -          continue dapto
   > Elevated INR.  Elevated INR, though not on anticoagulation.   Likely
   secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic use.
   -          vitamin K IV
   -          follow coags
   -          FFP for procedures
   > Anemia: Hct decreased from 30 to 27.5, now 25.8. Decrease likely
   iatrogenic due to CVVHD filter having to be changed multiple times with
   loss of blood each time and labs. Also, pt with history of AVMs.
   -          Transfuse to keep Hct > 25
   -          Epogen
   > HIT positive: Not on SQ heparin.
   > Abdominal mass: Unclear etiology,

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post below-knee amputation (BKA), and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI). She was admitted to the vascular surgery service for right peroneal angioplasty but is now critically ill with ongoing hypotension, hypothermia, and the need for more aggressive volume removal with continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH).

The patient has persistent pressor requirements, anemia, sepsis caused by multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and elevated INR. She also has a history of chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, and is at risk for developing complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis. Borderline cortisol levels may suggest adrenal insufficiency, but the patient's cortisol stimulation test was normal. The patient's chronic anemia is compounding the hypotension, and a more aggressive transfusion goal of hematocrit (Hct) >25% is recommended.

2. Sepsis: The patient has multi"

The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) post below-knee amputation (BKA), and coronary artery disease (CAD) post myocardial infarction (MI). She was admitted to the vascular surgery service for right peroneal angioplasty but is now critically ill with Acinetobacter sepsis. 

The patient has ongoing hypotension and hypothermia, requiring aggressive fluid removal through continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVHDF). She also has persistent pressor requirements, anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) goal of >25, and multiple infectious sources including a sacral decubitus ulcer and groin line.

She is being treated with multiple antibiotics for gram-negative coverage, including Unasyn, colistin, and daptomycin for gram-positive organisms. The patient is also on flagyl for possible concurrent intra-abdominal infection. There is a pending abdominal CT for further evaluation.

The patient's ESRD is likely secondary to diabetes and hypertension, and she has been receiving dialysis three times a week. However, she is grossly fluid overloaded due to low blood pressures. Her HD line was replaced on 12/26, and she is now back on CVVH"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p BKA, CAD s/p MI,
   admitted to vascular surgery for right peroneal angiopalsty on [**12-19**]
   now with acinetobacter sepsis causing ongoing hypotension and
   hypothermia.  On CVVHD for more aggressive volume removal.  Satting
   100% on RA.
   >  Hypotension.  The etiology of the hypotension is likely sepsis (as
   below).  Borderline cortisol may have suggest AI, but [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim was
   normal. TFTs with normal TSH and low T4, but unlikely to be playing a
   role in hypotension. Finally, her chronic anemia is compounding her
   picture and would favor a more aggressive transfusion goal of Hct >25.
   -          Persistent pressor requirements
   -          Transfuse for Hct > 25
   -          Will need temporary groin line for additional access given
   pressors/abx
   > Sepsis. Patient with MDR acinetobacter sensitive only to unasyn in
   blood (sensitivities to colistin added).  Numerous possible infectious
   sources include her sacral decub and groin line. Per ID, currently
   covered with Unasyn and colistin for gram neg coverage (got worse
 inc
   pressor requirement ,increased WBC count
 on unasyn alone) and
   Daptomycin for gram postive given hx of VRE. Also could have concurrent
   intraabdominal process, so will continue flagyl until final read on CT
   back. Of note, plastic surgery came by to see about decub ulcer, but
   only recommended topical treatment, nothing invasive given she is on
   plavix. Plavix d/c
ed [**12-23**]. RUE u/s negative x 3. Abd CT final read
   pending.
   -          On dapto/flagyl/unasyn/colistin (CVVHD dosing)
   -          Follow-up cultures
   -          C.diff x 3 negative
   -          Vasopressin to maintain MAPs> 55 while on CVVH
   -          Will reconsult plastic surgery regarding debridement of
   decub ulcer (ID very keen on them intervening)
   -          F/u Abd CT final read
   > ESRD on dialysis.  Likely secondary to diabetes and HTN.  Patient has
   been getting dialysis 3xweek, but unable to remove volume due to low
   blood pressures.  Now grossly fluid overloaded (?> 30 kg up from dry
   weight) though not requiring supplemental oxygen.  HD line replaced
   [**12-26**] and now back on CVVH (cannot do that through fistula)
   -          Continue CVVHD
   > CAD s/p MI.  Patient noted to have new regional wall motion
   abnormalities consistent with ischemia.  Has had two CABGs in past.
   Troponin mildly elevated in setting of renal failure with flat CK not
   suggestive of an acute event.
   -          aspirin, statin
   -          hold BB due to hypotension
   >Hyponatremia.  Patient appears hypervolemic.
   -          free water restrict
   -          fluid removal with CVVH
   > RUE edema with pain out of proportion to exam.  RUE negative x3.
   Unclear if vascular event happened, but extremity does not appear
   ischemic.  Concern for compartment syndrome. Lactate slightly increased
   from 3.0 to 3.3.
   -          continue dapto
   -          hand consult
   > Elevated INR.  Elevated INR, though not on anticoagulation.   Likely
   secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic use.
   -          vitamin K IV
   -          follow coags
   -          FFP for procedures
   > Anemia: Hct decreased from 30 to 27.5, now 25.8. Decrease likely
   iatrogenic due to CVVHD filter having to be changed multiple times with
   loss of blood each time and labs. Also, pt with history of AVMs.  Will
   give 1 unit today.
   -          Transfuse to keep Hct > 25
   -          Epogen
   > HIT positive: Not on SQ heparin.
   > Abdominal mass: Unclear etiology,

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post below-knee amputation (BKA), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI), and currently admitted for right peroneal angioplasty. The patient is critically ill with acinetobacter sepsis, causing ongoing hypotension and hypothermia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent pressor requirements, suggesting ongoing sepsis-related hypotension. Borderline cortisol levels may suggest adrenal insufficiency, but the patient's cortisol stimulation test was normal. Chronic anemia is also contributing to the hypotension, favoring a more aggressive transfusion goal of hematocrit (Hct) >25.
2. Sepsis: The patient has multidrug-resistant acinetobacter infection, sensitive only to ampicillin/sulbactam. Infectious sources include sacral decubitus ulcer and groin line. The patient is currently covered with ampicillin/sulbactam and colistin for gram-negative coverage, as well as daptomycin for gram-positive coverage due to history of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 5228], a 78-year-old female with type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease status post below-knee amputation, and coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, is admitted to the ICU with septic shock caused by multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter line infection. She also has decubitus ulcers, anemia due to chronic gastrointestinal bleeding from arteriovenous malformations, a heel ulcer related to peripheral vascular disease, a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's condition remains critical as she is still experiencing septic shock from the multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter line infection. There is a risk of further deterioration and organ failure if the infection is not effectively controlled.
2. Decubitus Ulcers: The presence of sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers increases the risk of infection and potential complications such as cellulitis or osteomyelitis.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia, likely due to chronic GI bleeding from AVMs, may worsen if not properly managed, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and potential organ dysfunction.
4. Heel Ulcer and PVD: The heel ulcer, associated with peripheral vascular disease, carries a risk of"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of septic shock. He has a history of allergies to penicillins, codeine, heparin agents, and levofloxacin. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infection.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/56 mmHg to 141/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on vasopressin and norepinephrine infusions. He is also receiving calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, and morphine sulfate.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. His creatinine levels are slightly elevated, and blood glucose levels are mostly within normal range with some fluctuations.

The physical examination reveals a moderately uncomfortable patient, clear chest auscultation, irregular heart rhythm without murmurs, soft abdomen with palpable subcutaneous mass, and previous left below-knee amputation with right leg in a weight-sparing boot.

The patient's current assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control with insulin, placement of multi-lumen lines and dialysis catheter, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis due to history of heparin-induced throm"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p BKA, CAD s/p MI,
   admitted to vascular surgery for right peroneal angiopalsty on [**12-19**]
   now with acinetobacter sepsis causing ongoing hypotension and
   hypothermia.  On CVVHD for more aggressive volume removal.  Satting
   100% on RA.
   >  Hypotension.  The etiology of the hypotension is likely sepsis (as
   below).  Borderline cortisol may have suggest AI, but [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim was
   normal. TFTs with normal TSH and low T4, but unlikely to be playing a
   role in hypotension. Finally, her chronic anemia is compounding her
   picture and would favor a more aggressive transfusion goal of Hct >25.
   -          Persistent pressor requirements
   -          Transfuse for Hct > 25
   -          Will need temporary groin line for additional access given
   pressors/abx
   > Sepsis. Patient with MDR acinetobacter sensitive only to unasyn in
   blood (sensitivities to colistin added).  Numerous possible infectious
   sources include her sacral decub and groin line. Per ID, currently
   covered with Unasyn and colistin for gram neg coverage (got worse
 inc
   pressor requirement ,increased WBC count
 on unasyn alone) and
   Daptomycin for gram postive given hx of VRE. Also could have concurrent
   intraabdominal process, so will continue flagyl until final read on CT
   back. Of note, plastic surgery came by to see about decub ulcer, but
   only recommended topical treatment, nothing invasive given she is on
   plavix. Plavix d/c
ed [**12-23**]. RUE u/s negative x 3. Abd CT final read
   pending.
   -          On dapto/flagyl/unasyn/colistin (CVVHD dosing)
   -          Follow-up cultures
   -          C.diff x 3 negative
   -          Vasopressin to maintain MAPs> 55 while on CVVH
   -          Will reconsult plastic surgery regarding debridement of
   decub ulcer (ID very keen on them intervening)
   -          F/u Abd CT final read
   > ESRD on dialysis.  Likely secondary to diabetes and HTN.  Patient has
   been getting dialysis 3xweek, but unable to remove volume due to low
   blood pressures.  Now grossly fluid overloaded (?> 30 kg up from dry
   weight) though not requiring supplemental oxygen.  HD line replaced
   [**12-26**] and now back on CVVH (cannot do that through fistula)
   -          Continue CVVHD
   > CAD s/p MI.  Patient noted to have new regional wall motion
   abnormalities consistent with ischemia.  Has had two CABGs in past.
   Troponin mildly elevated in setting of renal failure with flat CK not
   suggestive of an acute event.
   -          aspirin, statin
   -          hold BB due to hypotension
   >Hyponatremia.  Patient appears hypervolemic.
   -          free water restrict
   -          fluid removal with CVVH
   > RUE edema with pain out of proportion to exam.  RUE negative x3.
   Unclear if vascular event happened, but extremity does not appear
   ischemic.  Concern for compartment syndrome. Lactate slightly increased
   from 3.0 to 3.3.
   -          continue dapto
   -          hand consult
   > Elevated INR.  Elevated INR, though not on anticoagulation.   Likely
   secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic use.
   -          vitamin K IV
   -          follow coags
   -          FFP for procedures
   > Anemia: Hct decreased from 30 to 27.5, now 25.8. Decrease likely
   iatrogenic due to CVVHD filter having to be changed multiple times with
   loss of blood each time and labs. Also, pt with history of AVMs.  Will
   give 1 unit today.
   -          Transfuse to keep Hct > 25
   -          Epogen
   > HIT positive: Not on SQ heparin.
   > Abdominal mass: Unclear etiology,
   -          F/u final CT read

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5228**] is a 78-year-old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p BKA, CAD s/p MI, currently admitted to the ICU. She is being treated for septic shock caused by an MDR Acinetobacter line infection, and her decubitus ulcers may be contributing to the condition. There is a possibility of tissue ischemia in her left arm/hand due to PVD. She is on colistin/high-dose Unasyn for Acinetobacter bacteremia and daptomycin to cover skin/soft tissue infections. Empiric metronidazole is being used to cover abdominal pathogens, and C Diff negative x2. A consultation with plastics is needed to discuss the role of debridement of decubitus ulcers, and hand surgery is required to evaluate right hand/arm for compartment syndrome. She is also experiencing CKD V on hemodialysis, sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers, anemia with a history of chronic GI bleed from AVMs, heel ulcer/PVD, history of HIT, and DM2. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is currently experiencing septic shock due to an MDR Acinetobacter line infection. This condition can lead to organ failure and death if"

   BKA, CAD s/p MI with septic shock.
   1.       Septic Shock: from MDR Acinetobacter line infection; decubitus
   ulcers may very well be contributing; unclear if there is also tissue
   ischemia from PVD (? In her left arm/hand)
   -          ID input appreciated
   -          Remaining on Colistin/high-dose Unasyn for Acinetobacter
   bacteremia; surveillance blood cultures negative
   -          Remaining empiric daptomycin to cover skin/soft tissue
   infections
   -          On empiric metronidazole to cover abdominal pathogens as
   well; C Diff negative x2, however, still having diarrhea so keeping
   this on for now
   -          Will discuss with plastics role of debridement of decubitus
   ulcers; f/u final read of CT
   -          Will consult hand surgery to evaluate right hand/arm for
   compartment syndrome
   2.       CKD V on hemodialysis
   -          cont CVVH per renal team; per renal attending, systolics of
   80s are typical for her and we should tolerate this; they feel that she
   still have considerable fluid to take off and that the failure to do so
   will significantly limit her future prospects; therefore we are
   continuing to the extent possible, targeting systolics of 80s and
   making sure that basic mentation, organ function, etc remains intact.
   3.       Sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers
   Plastics feels that there is not currently a role for debridement; we
   should follow these closely and ask them to reassess if she continues
   to have any element of sepsis-like picture
   4.       Anemia; history of chronic GI bleed from AVMs
   -         Got 1 U PRBCs
   5.       Heel ulcer/PVD
   -          cont weight-sparing boot; no urgent vascular intervention
   6.       History of HIT
   -          avoid heparin

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5228**] is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease after below-knee amputation, coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarction, and septic shock due to MDR Acinetobacter line infection. She is currently in the ICU and has been admitted for several days. 

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for her Acinetobacter bacteremia, including colistin and high-dose Unasyn. She is also receiving empiric daptomycin to cover skin and soft tissue infections and metronidazole to cover abdominal pathogens. The decision to proceed with debridement of decubitus ulcers will be discussed with plastics, and hand surgery will be consulted to evaluate the right hand/arm for compartment syndrome.

The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to chronic kidney disease stage V. The renal team plans to continue CVVH, targeting systolic blood pressures of 80s and ensuring basic mentation and organ function remain intact.

She has sacral/ischiatic decubitus ulcers, but plastics does not currently recommend debridement. The patient's anemia is a result of chronic GI bleed from arteriovenous malformations, and she received one unit of packed red blood cells. A heel"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. They have been diagnosed with renal failure (ESRD), chronic thrombocytopenia, and hypotension. The patient is currently on CVVH with an aim of -100 to -150/hr, and their platelet count is trending down. The patient's blood pressure is being supported with vasopressin and norepinephrine. The patient is also receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected infections, including Acinetobacter bacteremia and sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening renal function: The patient's current condition of ESRD puts them at risk for further deterioration in renal function, which could lead to an increase in creatinine levels and fluid overload.
2. Infection: The patient's susceptibility to infections is heightened due to their immunocompromised state. The presence of Acinetobacter bacteremia indicates a potential source of infection, and there may be other sites of infection that need to be identified and treated.
3. Bleeding complications: Thrombocytopenia, along with the patient's use of anticoagulant medications, increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of platelet counts and signs of bleeding is necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requires careful management to ensure adequate organ perfusion. Adjustments in"

","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and are currently on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient also has thrombocytopenia and is experiencing hypotension. They have multiple infections, including Acinetobacter bacteremia and sacral decubitus ulcers. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) code status and is receiving various medications and treatments, such as antibiotics, vasopressors, and insulin for glycemic control. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate, and they are dependent on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe sepsis or septic shock due to ongoing infections.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening of ESRD.
3. Thrombotic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) due to inadequate oxygenation or perfusion.
5. Respiratory failure if unable to wear off mechanical ventilation.
6. Further decline in platelet count leading to increased bleeding risk.
7. Cardiovascular collapse due to persistent hypotension.
8. Development of additional pressure ulcers or wound infections.
9. Electrolyte imbalances and metabolic disturbances"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p BKA, CAD s/p MI,
   admitted to vascular surgery for right peroneal angiopalsty on [**12-19**]
   now with acinetobacter sepsis causing ongoing hypotension and
   hypothermia.  On CVVHD for more aggressive volume removal.  Satting
   100% on RA.
   >  Hypotension.  The etiology of the hypotension is likely sepsis (as
   below).  Borderline cortisol may have suggest AI, but [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim was
   normal. TFTs with normal TSH and low T4, but unlikely to be playing a
   role in hypotension. Finally, her chronic anemia is compounding her
   picture and would favor a more aggressive transfusion goal of Hct >25.
   -          Persistent pressor requirements
   -          Transfuse for Hct > 25
   -          Will need temporary groin line for additional access given
   pressors/abx
   > Sepsis. Patient with MDR acinetobacter sensitive only to unasyn in
   blood (sensitivities to colistin added).  Numerous possible infectious
   sources include her sacral decub and groin line. Per ID, currently
   covered with Unasyn and colistin for gram neg coverage (got worse
 inc
   pressor requirement ,increased WBC count
 on unasyn alone) and
   Daptomycin for gram postive given hx of VRE. Also could have concurrent
   intraabdominal process, so will continue flagyl until final read on CT
   back. Of note, plastic surgery came by to see about decub ulcer, but
   only recommended topical treatment, nothing invasive given she is on
   plavix. Plavix d/c
ed [**12-23**]. RUE u/s negative x 3. Abd CT final read
   pending.
   -          On dapto/flagyl/unasyn/colistin (CVVHD dosing)
   -          Follow-up cultures
   -          C.diff x 3 negative
   -          Vasopressin to maintain MAPs> 55 while on CVVH
   -          Will reconsult plastic surgery regarding debridement of
   decub ulcer (ID very keen on them intervening)
   -          F/u Abd CT final read
   > ESRD on dialysis.  Likely secondary to diabetes and HTN.  Patient has
   been getting dialysis 3xweek, but unable to remove volume due to low
   blood pressures.  Now grossly fluid overloaded (?> 30 kg up from dry
   weight) though not requiring supplemental oxygen.  HD line replaced
   [**12-26**] and now back on CVVH (cannot do that through fistula)
   -          Continue CVVHD
   > CAD s/p MI.  Patient noted to have new regional wall motion
   abnormalities consistent with ischemia.  Has had two CABGs in past.
   Troponin mildly elevated in setting of renal failure with flat CK not
   suggestive of an acute event.
   -          aspirin, statin
   -          hold BB due to hypotension
   >Hyponatremia.  Patient appears hypervolemic.
   -          free water restrict
   -          fluid removal with CVVH
   > RUE edema with pain out of proportion to exam.  RUE negative x3.
   Unclear if vascular event happened, but extremity does not appear
   ischemic.  Concern for compartment syndrome. Lactate slightly increased
   from 3.0 to 3.3.
   -          continue dapto
   -          hand consult
   > Elevated INR.  Elevated INR, though not on anticoagulation.   Likely
   secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic use.
   -          vitamin K IV
   -          follow coags
   -          FFP for procedures
   > Anemia: Hct decreased from 30 to 27.5, now 25.8. Decrease likely
   iatrogenic due to CVVHD filter having to be changed multiple times with
   loss of blood each time and labs. Also, pt with history of AVMs.  Will
   give 1 unit today.
   -          Transfuse to keep Hct > 25
   -          Epogen
   > HIT positive: Not on SQ heparin.
   > Abdominal mass: Unclear etiology,

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease with below-knee amputation, and coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarction. She was admitted for a right peroneal angioplasty but developed acinetobacter sepsis, leading to ongoing hypotension and hypothermia. She is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) for volume removal and has persistent pressor requirements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis. The source of infection could be her sacral decubitus ulcer or groin line. She is already receiving appropriate antibiotic coverage, but further cultures should be obtained. Vasopressin is being used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 while on CVVH.
2. Sepsis: The patient has MDR acinetobacter sepsis, which is sensitive only to unasyn in the blood. Other possible infectious sources need to be evaluated. She is currently covered with Unasyn, colistin for gram-negative coverage, and daptomycin for gram-positive organisms due to her history of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Flagyl is also being continued until the final read on her abdominal CT scan.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post below-knee amputation (BKA), and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI). She was admitted to the vascular surgery service for right peroneal angioplasty but is now critically ill with Acinetobacter sepsis.

The patient is experiencing ongoing hypotension and hypothermia. She is being treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and vasopressin to maintain blood pressure above 80 mmHg. She is also receiving multiple antibiotics for multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter infection, including Unasyn, colistin, and daptomycin. Flagyl has been added to cover for a potential intraabdominal process.

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week. However, she is currently grossly fluid overloaded due to low blood pressures and unable to remove volume effectively. Her hemoglobin (Hct) level has decreased from 30% to 25.8%, likely due to iatrogenic blood loss from frequent changes in the CVVHD filter and her history of arteriovenous malformations (AV"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p BKA, CAD s/p MI,
   admitted to vascular surgery for right peroneal angiopalsty on [**12-19**]
   now with acinetobacter sepsis causing ongoing hypotension and
   hypothermia.  On CVVHD for more aggressive volume removal.  Satting
   100% on RA.
   >  Hypotension.  Cont. to titrate for SBP > 80. Still on vasopressin.
   > Sepsis. Patient with MDR acinetobacter. Per ID, currently covered
   with Unasyn and colistin for gram neg coverage (got worse
 inc pressor
   requirement ,increased WBC count
 on unasyn alone) and Daptomycin for
   gram postive given hx of VRE. Also could have concurrent intraabdominal
   process, so will continue flagyl until final read on CT back. Of note,
   plastic surgery came by to see about decub ulcer, but only recommended
   topical treatment, nothing invasive given she is on plavix. Plavix
   d/c
ed [**12-23**]. RUE u/s negative x 3. Abd CT final read pending.
   -          On dapto/flagyl/unasyn/colistin (CVVHD dosing)
   -          Follow-up cultures
   -          C.diff x 3 negative - ? DC flagyl today
   -          Vasopressin to maintain SBP> 80 while on CVVH
   > ESRD on dialysis.  Likely secondary to diabetes and HTN.  Patient has
   been getting dialysis 3xweek, but unable to remove volume due to low
   blood pressures.  Now grossly fluid overloaded (?> 30 kg up from dry
   weight) though not requiring supplemental oxygen.  HD line replaced
   [**12-26**] and now back on CVVH (cannot do that through fistula)
   -          Continue CVVH aim -200 to -300 today.
   > CAD s/p MI.  Patient noted to have new regional wall motion
   abnormalities consistent with ischemia.  Has had two CABGs in past.
   Troponin mildly elevated in setting of renal failure with flat CK not
   suggestive of an acute event.
   -          aspirin, statin
   -          hold BB due to hypotension
   >Hyponatremia.  Patient appears hypervolemic.
   -          free water restrict
   -          fluid removal with CVVH
   > Anemia: Hct decreased from 30 to 27.5, now 25.8. Decrease likely
   iatrogenic due to CVVHD filter having to be changed multiple times with
   loss of blood each time and labs. Also, pt with history of AVMs.  Will
   give 1 unit today.
   -          Transfuse to keep Hct > 25
   -          Epogen
   > HIT positive: Not on SQ heparin.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease with below-knee amputation, and coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarction. She was admitted to the vascular surgery department for a right peroneal angioplasty but developed Acinetobacter sepsis, leading to ongoing hypotension and hypothermia. 

The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) for volume removal and is receiving multiple antibiotics to cover multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter, including Unasyn and colistin. She also receives daptomycin for gram-positive coverage due to her history of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. 

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and is on dialysis three times a week. However, she is unable to remove volume due to low blood pressures, resulting in gross fluid overload. Her HD line was replaced on [**12-26**], and she is now back on CVVH. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with previous CABGs and new regional wall motion abnormalities consistent with ischemia. Her troponin levels are mildly elevated, but not suggestive of an acute event. 

The patient also has hyponatremia, which appears to be hypervolemic in nature. She is being managed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis. He has a history of multiple medical conditions including chronic anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, hyponatremia, impaired skin integrity, peripheral neuropathy, peptic ulcer disease, renal failure (ESRD), thrombocytopenia, and pain control. The patient is currently receiving various medications and treatments in the ICU, including antibiotics, vasopressin, calcium gluconate (CRRT), and dialysis. His vital signs are stable, but he has been experiencing low blood pressure and tachycardia. The patient's respiratory support is not needed, and his oxygen saturation is at 100%. His physical examination reveals diminished peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose levels, and liver enzymes, while showing decreased platelet count and kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to sepsis and chronic conditions may increase the risk of developing further infections.
2. Kidney damage: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. It is crucial to monitor and manage this condition to prevent any further kidney damage.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent low blood pressure may"

   ulcers may very well be contributing; unclear if there is also tissue
   ischemia from PVD (? In her left arm/hand)
   -          ID input appreciated
   -          Remaining on Colistin/high-dose Unasyn for Acinetobacter
   bacteremia; surveillance blood cultures negative
   -          Remaining empiric daptomycin to cover skin/soft tissue
   infections
   -          On empiric metronidazole to cover abdominal pathogens as
   well; C Diff negative x2, however, still having diarrhea so keeping
   this on for now
   -          Will discuss with plastics role of debridement of decubitus
   ulcers; f/u final read of CT
   -          Will consult hand surgery to evaluate right hand/arm for
   compartment syndrome
   2.       CKD V on hemodialysis
   -          cont CVVH per renal team; per renal attending, systolics of
   80s are typical for her and we should tolerate this; they feel that she
   still have considerable fluid to take off and that the failure to do so
   will significantly limit her future prospects; therefore we are
   continuing to the extent possible, targeting systolics of 80s and
   making sure that basic mentation, organ function, etc remains intact.
   3.       Sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers
   Plastics feels that there is not currently a role for debridement; we
   should follow these closely and ask them to reassess if she continues
   to have any element of sepsis-like picture
   4.       Anemia; history of chronic GI bleed from AVMs
   -         Got 1 U PRBCs
   5.       Heel ulcer/PVD
   -          cont weight-sparing boot; no urgent vascular intervention
   6.       History of HIT
   -          avoid heparin

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) post below-knee amputation (BKA), coronary artery disease (CAD) post myocardial infarction (MI), and septic shock. 

The patient is currently experiencing septic shock from a multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter line infection, with decubitus ulcers potentially contributing to the condition. It is unclear if there is also tissue ischemia from PVD in her left arm/hand. 

The patient has been receiving vasopressin and continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVHD). She has been on high-dose Unasyn and Colistin for Acinetobacter bacteremia, with surveillance blood cultures being negative. Daptomycin has been continued to cover skin/soft tissue infections. Metronidazole has been stopped as Clostridium difficile (C. diff) tests negative and intrabdominal access is clear.

Plastics have assessed the decubitus ulcers and do not feel any intervention is needed at this time. Hand surgery has evaluated the right hand/arm for compartment syndrome but found no need for intervention, ruling out compartment syndrome.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5228**] is a 78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p
   BKA, CAD s/p MI with septic shock
   1.       Septic Shock: from MDR Acinetobacter line infection; decubitus
   ulcers may very well be contributing; unclear if there is also tissue
   ischemia from PVD (? In her left arm/hand). Off daptomycin and flagyl
   as c. diff negative and ulcers appear to be not infected.
   -          ID input appreciated
   -          Cont vasopressin unti 3pm then attempt to stop, but goal is
   to continue CVVHD
   -          Remaining on Colistin/high-dose Unasyn for Acinetobacter
   bacteremia; surveillance blood cultures negative
   -          Plastics role of debridement of decubitus ulcers
 does not
   feel any intervention needed
   -          Hand surgery to evaluate right hand/arm for compartment
   syndrome
 no need for intervention, no compartment
   -          Consult colorectal surgery re: rectal inflammation on CT and
   ? possible treatment.
   2. Vaginal Clot: could explain hct drift, per report patient s/p
   TAH/BSO, could be evidence of fistula given inflammation seen on CT
   abd/pelvis.
   -          Transvaginal ultrasound with limited views
   -           Review with radiology if anything on CT abd/pelvis that
   could reveal reason for
   -           Trend HCT
   -           Re-eval if blood becomes issue
   3. Right Arm:  there is some steal from AV fistula. No current change
   in management.
   -            neuropathic pain for symptoms
   -           defer to outpatient further management i.e. neurontin
   4.       CKD V on hemodialysis
   -          cont CVVH per renal team; per renal attending, systolics of
   80s are typical for her and we should tolerate this; they feel that she
   still have considerable fluid to take off and that the failure to do so
   will significantly limit her future prospects; therefore we are
   continuing to the extent possible, targeting systolics of 80s and
   making sure that basic mentation, organ function, etc remains intact.
   5.       Sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers
   Plastics feels that there is not currently a role for debridement; we
   should follow these closely and ask them to reassess if she continues
   to have any element of sepsis-like picture
   --- Ask colorectal surgery to comment given soft tissue changes extend
   to rectum
   6.       Anemia; history of chronic GI bleed from AVMs, also vaginal
   bleed, and CVVHD
   -         Continue to transfuse HCT >25 given on CVVHD and will have
   ongoing blood loss
   -         Give one unit of pRBCs
   7.       Heel ulcer/PVD
   -          cont weight-sparing boot; no urgent vascular intervention
   8.       History of HIT
   -          avoid heparin
   9.       DM2
   -          cont insulin
   10.     Thrombocytopenia: worsening, concerned may have occurred at
   about the time of line placement
   -           confirm with IR re: heparinization of line
   -            if heparin line, then would change over wire with
   non-heparinized due to poor access issues

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease.
- She presented with septic shock due to a multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter line infection and decubitus ulcers.
- The patient is currently on vasopressin, CVVHD, colistin, and high-dose Unasyn for the Acinetobacter bacteremia.
- There is a concern for vaginal clot, which could be related to a possible fistula given the patient's history of total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
- The patient has right arm issues, including poor radial artery flow with improvement using compression and radial artery calcification.
- Other conditions include chronic kidney disease stage V on hemodialysis, sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers, anemia, heel ulcer/peripheral vascular disease, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
- The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.1°C, heart rate 74 bpm, blood pressure 91/35 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) post below-knee amputation (BKA), and coronary artery disease (CAD) post myocardial infarction (MI). She presented with septic shock caused by a multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter line infection, decubitus ulcers, and possible tissue ischemia from PVD in her left arm/hand. The patient has been on vasopressin and continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVHD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock due to an MDR Acinetobacter line infection. It is crucial to continue aggressive management and surveillance.
2. Decubitus Ulcers: The presence of decubitus ulcers may contribute to the septic shock and could lead to further complications such as infection or tissue necrosis if not properly managed.
3. Tissue Ischemia: The patient's PVD raises concerns about potential tissue ischemia in her left arm/hand, which may worsen if not addressed.
4. Vaginal Clot: The presence of a vaginal clot could explain the patient's declining hematocrit (Hct) levels. Further evaluation, such as a transvaginal ultrasound,"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known lastname 5228] is a 78-year-old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p BKA, CAD s/p MI with septic shock. She has several medical complications including septic shock from MDR Acinetobacter line infection, decubitus ulcers, worsening anemia, heel ulcer/PVD, thrombocytopenia, history of HIT, and DM2. The patient's current condition is critical and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock due to an MDR Acinetobacter line infection. It is crucial to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy and closely monitor vital signs.
2. Decubitus Ulcers: The patient has sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers. These wounds need to be closely monitored for signs of infection or worsening, and plastic surgery input should be sought if there is a sepsis-like picture.
3. Anemia: The patient has a history of chronic GI bleed from AVMs, which may contribute to her anemia. Transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) is recommended to maintain a higher hematocrit level.
4. Heel Ulcer/PVD: The patient has a heel ulcer associated with peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Weight-sparing boots should be continued, and urgent vascular intervention is not required.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has a history of chronic anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, impaired skin integrity, peripheral neuropathy, peptic ulcer disease, renal failure (ESRD), and thrombocytopenia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/35 to 113/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's medical events over the past 24 hours include stopping flagyl and daptomycin, administration of one unit of packed red blood cells during CVVHD due to a decreasing hematocrit level, inability to wean off vasopressin, and decrease in CVVHD flow rate at 3 am due to systolic blood pressures in the 70s. The patient also had clots noted in her vagina during turning, prompting an order for a transvaginal ultrasound to evaluate as a potential source of bleeding.

The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, codeine, heparin agents, and levofloxacin, all of which cause rash and/or wheezing. The patient has received various antibiotics over the past few days, including metronidazole, colistin, dapt"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5228**] is a 78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p
   BKA, CAD s/p MI with septic shock
   Vaginal Bleed
   1.       Septic Shock: from MDR Acinetobacter line infection; decubitus
   ulcers may very well be contributing; unclear if there is also tissue
   ischemia from PVD (? In her left arm/hand).
   -          ID input appreciated
   -          Cont vasopressin unti 3pm then attempt to stop, but goal is
   to continue CVVHD
   -          Remaining on Colistin/high-dose Unasyn for Acinetobacter
   bacteremia; surveillance blood cultures negative
   -          Remaining empiric Daptomycin to cover skin/soft tissue
   infections
   -         Metronidazole - C Diff negative x4, CT neg intrabdominal
   access
 STOP today
   -          Plastics role of debridement of decubitus ulcers
 does not
   feel any intervention needed
   -          Hand surgery to evaluate right hand/arm for compartment
   syndrome
 no need for intervention, no compartment
   2.       CKD V on hemodialysis
   -          cont CVVH per renal team; per renal attending, systolics of
   80s are typical for her and we should tolerate this; they feel that she
   still have considerable fluid to take off and that the failure to do so
   will significantly limit her future prospects; therefore we are
   continuing to the extent possible, targeting systolics of 80s and
   making sure that basic mentation, organ function, etc remains intact.
   3.       Sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers
   Plastics feels that there is not currently a role for debridement; we
   should follow these closely and ask them to reassess if she continues
   to have any element of sepsis-like picture
   4.       Anemia; history of chronic GI bleed from AVMs
   -         Continue to transfuse HCT >25 given on CVVHD and will have
   ongoing blood loss
   -         Give one unit of pRBCs
   5.       Heel ulcer/PVD
   -          cont weight-sparing boot; no urgent vascular intervention
   6.       History of HIT
   -          avoid heparin
   7.       DM2
   -          cont insulin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including chronic anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, peripheral neuropathy, peptic ulcer disease, renal failure (ESRD), and thrombocytopenia. The patient presents with hypotension and signs of infection. 

24-hour events include stopping flagyl and daptomycin, administration of one unit of packed red blood cells, decrease in CVVHD flow due to low blood pressure, and identification of clots in the vagina with an order for transvaginal ultrasound. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/35-113/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on vasopressin and calcium gluconate infusions. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, codeine, heparin agents, and levofloxacin. The patient's pain is controlled with morphine sulfate.

   -          cont CVVH per renal team; per renal attending, systolics of
   80s are typical for her and we should tolerate this; they feel that she
   still have considerable fluid to take off and that the failure to do so
   will significantly limit her future prospects; therefore we are
   continuing to the extent possible, targeting systolics of 80s and
   making sure that basic mentation, organ function, etc remains intact.
   3.       Sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers
   Plastics feels that there is not currently a role for debridement; we
   should follow these closely and ask them to reassess if she continues
   to have any element of sepsis-like picture
   4.       Anemia; history of chronic GI bleed from AVMs
   -         Continue to transfuse HCT >25 given on CVVHD and will have

The patient is a 78-year-old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p BKA, CAD s/p MI with septic shock. She presents with hypotension, signs of infection, and skin breakdown. The patient has a history of chronic GI bleed from AVMs, decubitus ulcers, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, peptic ulcer disease, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.

1. Septic Shock: The patient is currently experiencing septic shock due to an MDR Acinetobacter line infection. Decubitus ulcers may also contribute to the condition, and there could be tissue ischemia from peripheral vascular disease in her left arm/hand.
2. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on hemodialysis: The patient requires continued CVVH per renal team, targeting systolics of 80s and ensuring basic mentation and organ function remain intact.
3. Sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers: These ulcers should be closely monitored, and plastic surgery reassessment may be needed if the patient continues to have sepsis-like symptoms.

","The patient's chief complaint is hypotension, signs of infection, and skin breakdown. They were given one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to a decreasing hematocrit (HCT). Vasopressin was unable to be weaned off, and the patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) remained in the 70s. During turning, clots were noted in the vagina, so a transvaginal ultrasound was ordered to evaluate as a potential source of bleeding.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, codeine, heparin agents, levofloxacin, and rashes with metronidazole and colistin. The last dose of antibiotics was metronidazole on 2121-12-28 at 08:00 AM, colistin on 2121-12-30 at 10:59 AM, daptomycin on 2121-12-30 at 09:15 PM, and ampicillin on 2121-12-31 at 04:31 AM.

The patient is currently on vasopressin at a rate of 2.4 units/hour, calcium gluconate (CRRT) at 1.2 grams/hour, and potassium chloride (CRRT) at 2 mEq./hour. They are also receiving morphine sulfate.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for ongoing pain"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with septic shock, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently receiving vasopressin, colistin, and ampicillin for the septic shock, and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for renal failure. The thrombocytopenia is being managed by ensuring that all lines are heparin-free.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/59 mmHg to 76/12 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and low platelet count. Kidney function tests indicate an elevated creatinine level. Blood glucose levels are fluctuating, with some readings within the normal range and others elevated.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, codeine, heparin agents, and levofloxacin. The patient's medical history is significant for septic shock, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening septic shock, progression of renal failure, and further deterioration of platelet count. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to address these"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are currently experiencing septic shock, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been on vasopressin, colistin, and ampicillin for septic shock. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been used to manage renal failure. Thrombocytopenia is being monitored, and efforts are being made to ensure all lines are heparin-free. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and they are currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and heart rate indicate ongoing instability, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. If left untreated, renal failure can result in the buildup of waste products and toxins in the body.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications. Care must be taken to avoid procedures or medications that could worsen thrombocytopenia.
4. Infection: The presence of vaginal bleeding and the concern for rectal extension of infection suggest the possibility of ongoing infection. This could potentially lead to further sepsis and complications.
5. Cardiovascular issues: The patient's atrial fibrillation and diminished peripheral pulses indicate potential"

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already septic, which increases the risk of further complications.
2. Infection: Given the presence of lines, catheters, and the patient's immunocompromised state, there is a risk of developing new infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease, and the condition could worsen due to inadequate fluid balance, medication dosing errors, or complications related to dialysis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating ongoing hypotension. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has chronic thrombocytopenia, which increases the risk of bleeding complications, especially with procedures or if there is any platelet dysfunction.
6. Wound complications: The patient has impaired skin integrity and is at risk of developing wound infections or non-healing ulcers.
7. Metabolic disturbances: Abnormal glucose levels and liver function tests suggest potential metabolic derangements that need to be managed carefully.
8. Cardiac issues: The patient has atrial fibrillation and hypotension,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5228**] is a 78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p
   BKA, CAD s/p MI with septic shock
   1.       Septic Shock: from MDR Acinetobacter line infection; decubitus
   ulcers may very well be contributing; unclear if there is also tissue
   ischemia from PVD (? In her left arm/hand). Off daptomycin and flagyl
   as c. diff negative and ulcers appear to be not infected. Off Colistin
   -          ID input appreciated
   -          Cont vasopressin unti 3pm then attempt to stop, but goal is
   to continue CVVHD
   -          Remaining on Colistin for Acinetobacter bacteremia;
   surveillance blood cultures negative
   -          Plastics role of debridement of decubitus ulcers
 does not
   feel any intervention needed
   -          Hand surgery to evaluate right hand/arm for compartment
   syndrome
 no need for intervention, no compartment
   -          Consult colorectal surgery re: rectal inflammation on CT and
   ? possible treatment.
   2. Vaginal Clot: could explain hct drift, per report patient s/p
   TAH/BSO, could be evidence of fistula given inflammation seen on CT
   abd/pelvis.
   -          Transvaginal ultrasound with limited views
   -           Review with radiology if anything on CT abd/pelvis that
   could reveal reason for
   -           Trend HCT
   -           Re-eval if blood becomes issue
   3. Right Arm:  there is some steal from AV fistula. No current change
   in management.
   -            neuropathic pain for symptoms
   -           defer to outpatient further management i.e. neurontin
   4.       CKD V on hemodialysis
   -          cont CVVH per renal team; per renal attending, systolics of
   80s are typical for her and we should tolerate this; they feel that she
   still have considerable fluid to take off and that the failure to do so
   will significantly limit her future prospects; therefore we are
   continuing to the extent possible, targeting systolics of 80s and
   making sure that basic mentation, organ function, etc remains intact.
   5.       Sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers
   Plastics feels that there is not currently a role for debridement; we
   should follow these closely and ask them to reassess if she continues
   to have any element of sepsis-like picture
   --- Ask colorectal surgery to comment given soft tissue changes extend
   to rectum
   6.       Anemia; history of chronic GI bleed from AVMs, also vaginal
   bleed, and CVVHD
   -         Continue to transfuse HCT >25 given on CVVHD and will have
   ongoing blood loss
   -         Give one unit of pRBCs
   7.       Heel ulcer/PVD
   -          cont weight-sparing boot; no urgent vascular intervention
   8.       History of HIT
   -          avoid heparin
   9.       DM2
   -          cont insulin
   10.     Thrombocytopenia: worsening, concerned may have occurred at
   about the time of line placement
   -           confirm with IR re: heparinization of line
   -            if heparin line, then would change over wire with
   non-heparinized due to poor access issues

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post below-knee amputation (BKA), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI), and septic shock. 

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is still experiencing septic shock, which is likely due to a multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter line infection. Decubitus ulcers may also contribute to the septic shock, and there might be tissue ischemia from PVD in her left arm/hand. The patient is off daptomycin and Flagyl since the patient is negative for Clostridioides difficile infection and ulcers appear not to be infected. Colistin is being continued for Acinetobacter bacteremia, with surveillance blood cultures negative.
2. Vaginal Clot: The patient has a vaginal clot, which could explain the hematocrit (Hct) drift. Given the patient's history of total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH/BSO), this could be evidence of a fistula, especially considering the inflammation seen on CT abdomen/pelvis. A transvaginal ultrasound with limited views has been ordered,"

   in management.
   -            neuropathic pain for symptoms
   -           defer to outpatient further management i.e. neurontin
   4.       CKD V on hemodialysis
   -          cont CVVH per renal team; per renal attending, systolics of
   80s are typical for her and we should tolerate this; they feel that she
   still have considerable fluid to take off and that the failure to do so
   will significantly limit her future prospects; therefore we are
   continuing to the extent possible, targeting systolics of 80s and
   making sure that basic mentation, organ function, etc remains intact.
   5.       Sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers
   Plastics feels that there is not currently a role for debridement; we
   should follow these closely and ask them to reassess if she continues
   to have any element of sepsis-like picture
   --- Ask colorectal surgery to comment given soft tissue changes extend
   to rectum
   6.       Anemia; history of chronic GI bleed from AVMs, also vaginal
   bleed, and CVVHD
   -         Continue to transfuse HCT >25 given on CVVHD and will have
   ongoing blood loss
   -         Give one unit of pRBCs
   7.       Heel ulcer/PVD
   -          cont weight-sparing boot; no urgent vascular intervention
   8.       History of HIT
   -          avoid heparin
   9.       DM2
   -          cont insulin
   10.     Thrombocytopenia: worsening, concerned may have occurred at
   about the time of line placement
   -           confirm with IR re: heparinization of line
   -            if heparin line, then would change over wire with
   non-heparinized due to poor access issues

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease after below-knee amputation, and coronary artery disease after myocardial infarction. She presented with septic shock caused by a multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter line infection and decubitus ulcers. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is still dependent on vasopressin and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVHD). Her blood culture results are negative for infection. There are concerns about vaginal clot, right arm ischemia, chronic kidney disease stage V, sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers, anemia, heel ulcer/peripheral vascular disease, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) code status and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Septic shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which can lead to organ failure and death if not properly managed.
2. Decubitus ulcers: The presence of decubitus ulcers increases the risk of infection and can potentially lead to sepsis.
3. Right arm ischemia: The patient's diminished radial and digital pulses in the right arm suggest possible ischemia, which could progress to compartment"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5228**] is a 78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p
   BKA, CAD s/p MI with septic shock
   1.       Septic Shock: from MDR Acinetobacter line infection; decubitus
   ulcers may very well be contributing; unclear if there is also tissue
   ischemia from PVD (? In her left arm/hand). Off daptomycin and flagyl
   as c. diff negative and ulcers appear to be not infected. Off Colistin
   -          ID input appreciated
   -          Cont vasopressin while on CVVHD
   -          Remaining on Colistin for Acinetobacter bacteremia;
   surveillance blood cultures negative
   -          Plastics role of debridement of decubitus ulcers
 does not
   feel any intervention needed
   -          Hand surgery to evaluate right hand/arm for compartment
   syndrome
 no need for intervention, no compartment
   -          Consult colorectal surgery re: rectal inflammation on CT and
   ? possible treatment.
   2. Vaginal Clot: could explain hct drift, per report patient s/p
   TAH/BSO, but patient has uterus on CT scan
 nothing pathologic.
   Transvaginal ultrasound with limited views
   -           Trend HCT
   -           Re-eval if blood loss becomes issue
   3. Right Arm:  there is some steal from AV fistula. No current change
   in management. Neuropathic pain.
   -            continue current pain meds
   -           defer to outpatient further management i.e. neurontin
   4.       CKD V on hemodialysis
   -          cont CVVH per renal team; per renal attending, systolics of
   80s are typical for her and we should tolerate this; they feel that she
   still have considerable fluid to take off and that the failure to do so
   will significantly limit her future prospects; therefore we are
   continuing to the extent possible, targeting systolics of 80s and
   making sure that basic mentation, organ function, etc remains intact.
   5.       Sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers
   Plastics feels that there is not currently a role for debridement; we
   should follow these closely and ask them to reassess if she continues
   to have any element of sepsis-like picture
   --- Ask colorectal surgery to comment given soft tissue changes extend
   to rectum
   6.       Anemia; history of chronic GI bleed from AVMs, also vaginal
   bleed, and CVVHD
   -         Continue to transfuse HCT >25 given on CVVHD and will have
   ongoing blood loss
   -         Give one unit of pRBCs
   7.       Heel ulcer/PVD
   -          cont weight-sparing boot; no urgent vascular intervention
   8.       History of HIT
   -          avoid heparin
   9.       DM2
   -          cont insulin
   10.     Thrombocytopenia: worsening, no heparin lines, has a history of
   thrombocytopenia.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 5228] is a 78-year-old female with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post below-knee amputation (BKA), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI), and septic shock. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: Ms. [Lastname] has septic shock caused by a multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter line infection. The presence of decubitus ulcers may contribute to the sepsis, and there is a possibility of tissue ischemia from PVD in her left arm/hand. She is currently off daptomycin and flagyl as she is negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and the ulcers do not appear to be infected. It is recommended to continue with colistin for Acinetobacter bacteremia and perform surveillance blood cultures. Vasopressin should be continued while on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVHD).

2. Vaginal Clot: There is a possibility of a vaginal clot that could explain the hematocrit (Hct) drift. Since the patient had a total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salping"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, renal failure, and bacteremia caused by Acinetobacter species. The patient is currently on aggressive diuresis and receiving vasopressin for blood pressure support. His vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 100/30 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated but not on mechanical ventilation. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -5,342 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 66 K/uL. Other notable lab abnormalities include elevated white blood cell count, decreased albumin levels, and deranged electrolytes. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics including colistin, daptomycin, and ampicillin for his Acinetobacter bacteremia. Surgical intervention for pressure ulcers has been ruled out. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he remains in the ICU. Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, worsening of thrombocytopenia, infection due to prolonged immobility, and potential bleeding risks due to platelet count."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 5228**] is a 78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p
   BKA, CAD s/p MI with septic shock
   1.       Septic Shock: from MDR Acinetobacter line infection; decubitus
   ulcers may very well be contributing; unclear if there is also tissue
   ischemia from PVD (? In her left arm/hand). Off daptomycin and flagyl
   as c. diff negative and ulcers appear to be not infected. Off Colistin
   -          ID input appreciated
   -          CVVHD stopping
 try to wean/stop vasopressin
   -          Remaining on high dose Unasyn for Acinetobacter bacteremia;
   surveillance blood cultures negative
   -          Plastics role of debridement of decubitus ulcers
 does not
   feel any intervention needed
   -          Hand surgery to evaluate right hand/arm for compartment
   syndrome
 no need for intervention, no compartment
   -          Consult colorectal surgery feels no indication for surgical
   intervention
   2. Vaginal Clot: could explain hct drift, per report patient s/p
   TAH/BSO, but patient has uterus on CT scan
 nothing pathologic.
   Transvaginal ultrasound with limited views
   -           Trend HCT
   -           Re-eval if blood loss becomes issue
   3. Right Arm:  there is some steal from AV fistula. No current change
   in management. Neuropathic pain.
   -            continue current pain meds
   -           defer to outpatient further management i.e. neurontin
   4.       CKD V on hemodialysis
   -          patient negative 30L on CVVHD. Patient is felt to be near
   her dry weight. Patient will hold on CVVHD for now. Given patient has
   tenuous pressures this may need to be restarted if she does not
   tolerate HD.
   - appreciate renal recs
   5.       Sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers
   Plastics feels that there is not currently a role for debridement; we
   should follow these closely and ask them to reassess if she continues
   to have any element of sepsis-like picture
   6.       Anemia; history of chronic GI bleed from AVMs, also vaginal
   bleed, and CVVHD
   -         Continue to transfuse HCT >25 given on CVVHD and will have
   ongoing blood loss
   -         Give one unit of pRBCs
   7.       Heel ulcer/PVD
   -          cont weight-sparing boot; no urgent vascular intervention
   8.       History of HIT
   -          avoid heparin
   9.       DM2
   -          cont insulin
   10.     Thrombocytopenia: stable,  no heparin lines, has a history of
   thrombocytopenia.

The patient's disposition is in the ICU due to pressor requirement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is currently experiencing septic shock from an MDR Acinetobacter line infection. If the infection spreads or if the patient develops sepsis again, it can lead to further complications such as organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and death.
2. Decubitus Ulcers: The patient has decubitus ulcers which can worsen if not properly managed. This can lead to increased risk of infection and potential complications such as cellulitis or osteomyelitis.
3. Tissue Ischemia: There is a possibility of tissue ischemia in the patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and bacteremia. They have been admitted to the ICU and have undergone various interventions. The patient's vital signs are currently stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 85/20 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is still receiving vasopressin for blood pressure support, but it is being weaned off. 

The patient has been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and will continue until further guidance from the renal team. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 6,238 mL and an output of 13,484 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -7,246 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 57 K/uL. Kidney function tests show elevated creatinine levels, while glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab results reveal elevated liver enzymes, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal electrolyte levels. 

The patient's condition is being closely monitored, with ongoing efforts to manage renal failure, bacteremia, hypotension, and other complications. The patient has a do not resuscitate (D"

","The patient is critically ill with a diagnosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently euvolemic. The patient's blood pressure is low, and they are being weaned off vasopressin. They have a history of allergies to penicillins, codeine, heparin agents, and levofloxacin. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85/20 mmHg to 138/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The patient has received multiple antibiotics including colistin, daptomycin, and ampicillin. 

The lab results show elevated creatinine levels, low hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, high white blood cell count, and elevated levels of potassium and lactate. The liver function tests are within normal range, but there are elevated levels of cardiac enzymes. 

The patient has a history of renal failure and requires dialysis. They are currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). 

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and DNI (do not intubate)."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5228**] is a 78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p
   BKA, CAD s/p MI with septic shock
   1.       Septic Shock: from MDR Acinetobacter line infection; decubitus
   ulcers may very well be contributing; unclear if there is also tissue
   ischemia from PVD (? In her left arm/hand). Off daptomycin and flagyl
   as c. diff negative and ulcers appear to be not infected. Off Colistin.
   Remaining on high dose Unasyn for Acinetobacter bacteremia;
   surveillance blood cultures negative. Plastics does not feel any
   intervention needed on decubitus ulcers.  Hand surgery  no need for
   intervention, no compartment syndrome in right arm/hand. Colorectal
   surgery feels no indication for surgical intervention
   -          ID input appreciated on length of unasyn course for
   -          Off CVVHD, trying to stop vasopressin -- added midodrine
   yesterday
   2. Vaginal Clot: could explain hct drift, per report patient s/p
   TAH/BSO, but patient has uterus on CT scan
 nothing pathologic.
   Transvaginal ultrasound with limited views
   -           Trend HCT
   -           Re-eval if blood loss becomes issue
   3. Right Arm:  there is some steal from AV fistula. No current change
   in management. Neuropathic pain.
   -            continue current pain meds
   -           defer to outpatient further management i.e. neurontin
   4.       CKD V on hemodialysis. Patient negative 30L on CVVHD. Patient
   is felt to be near her dry weight. Patient will hold on CVVHD for now.
   Given patient has tenuous pressures this may need to be restarted if
   she does not tolerate HD.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - started midodrine for pressures, will stop vasopressin
   5.       Sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers
   Plastics feels that there is not currently a role for debridement; we
   should follow these closely and ask them to reassess if she continues
   to have any element of sepsis-like picture
   6.       Anemia; history of chronic GI bleed from AVMs, also vaginal
   bleed, and CVVHD
   -         Continue to transfuse HCT >25 given on CVVHD and will have
   ongoing blood loss
   7.       Heel ulcer/PVD
   -          cont weight-sparing boot; no urgent vascular intervention
   8.       History of HIT
   -          avoid heparin
   9.       DM2
   -          cont insulin
   10.     Thrombocytopenia: stable,  no heparin lines, has a history of
   thrombocytopenia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post below-knee amputation (BKA), and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI). She is currently in septic shock from a multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter line infection, with decubitus ulcers that may be contributing to her condition. Other possible contributing factors include tissue ischemia in her left arm/hand due to PVD and a vaginal clot. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with hypotension and tachycardia. She is on high-dose Unasyn for Acinetobacter bacteremia, and surveillance blood cultures are negative. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock from an MDR Acinetobacter line infection. If not properly managed, this condition can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), sepsis-induced hypotension, and even death.
2. Decubitus Ulcers: These pressure ulcers may worsen and lead to infection, further complicating the patient's condition. They could also serve as a source of ongoing infection.
3. Tissue Ischemia: The presence of PVD raises concerns about tissue ischemia in the left arm/hand. If left"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5228**] is a 78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p
   BKA, CAD s/p MI with septic shock
   1.       Septic Shock: from MDR Acinetobacter line infection; decubitus
   ulcers may very well be contributing; unclear if there is also tissue
   ischemia from PVD (? In her left arm/hand). Off daptomycin and flagyl
   as c. diff negative and ulcers appear to be not infected. Off Colistin.
   Remaining on high dose Unasyn for Acinetobacter bacteremia;
   surveillance blood cultures negative. Plastics does not feel any
   intervention needed on decubitus ulcers.  Hand surgery  no need for
   intervention, no compartment syndrome in right arm/hand. Colorectal
   surgery feels no indication for surgical intervention
   -          ID input appreciated on length of unasyn course for
   bacteremia
   -          Off CVVHD, trying to stop vasopressin -- added midodrine
   yesterday
   2. Right Arm:  there is some steal from AV fistula. No current change
   in management. Neuropathic pain improved.
   -            continue current pain meds
   -           defer to outpatient further management i.e. neurontin
   3.       CKD V on hemodialysis. Patient negative 30L on CVVHD. Patient
   is felt to be near her dry weight. Patient will hold on CVVHD for now.
   Given patient has tenuous pressures this may need to be restarted if
   she does not tolerate HD.
   -             appreciate renal recs
   -             On midodrine for pressures, will stop vasopressin
   5.       Sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers
   Plastics feels that there is not currently a role for debridement;
   continue with aggressive wound care
   6.       Anemia; history of chronic GI bleed from AVMs, also vaginal
   bleed, and CVVHD.  Patient with uterus and cervix, but CT scan and
   transvaginal with limited views show no pathologic features.
   -         Continue to transfuse HCT >25
   -         Monitor for sign vaginal or GI bleeding
   7.       Heel ulcer/PVD
   -          cont weight-sparing boot; no urgent vascular intervention
   8.       History of HIT
   -          avoid heparin
   9.       DM2
   -          cont insulin
 readjust fixed evening dose downward given
   low BG this am
   10.Thrombocytopenia: stable, no heparin lines, has a history of
   thrombocytopenia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, chronic anemia, end-stage renal disease, and a large decubitus ulcer. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 140/20 mmHg, heart rate of 80 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, codeine, heparin agents, and levofloxacin. Her last dose of antibiotics was ampicillin on 01/03/2022 at 08:09 PM.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has a large decubitus ulcer with significant eschar and fat necrosis. There is a risk of developing a deep-seated infection, which may require surgical intervention. The patient is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ceftaz+vanco) for suspected osteomyelitis.
2. Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, especially if the patient develops complications such as sepsis or hypotension.
3. Hypotension: The patient is borderline hypertensive and requires careful"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a medical history of chronic anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral neuropathy, impaired skin integrity, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and acute pain. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU, including nutrition support, glycemic control using regular insulin, and renal replacement therapy via dialysis catheter. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/20-142/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate borderline hypertension, which may require further evaluation and management to prevent complications related to low blood pressure.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of ESRD and is receiving dialysis. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting the dialysis regimen accordingly is essential to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
3. Diabetic Complications: Given the patient's history of type II diabetes, it is crucial to maintain strict glycemic control to prevent diabetic complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
4. Infection: The patient's WBC count has been elevated on multiple occasions, suggesting the possibility of an infection."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease, and a below-knee amputation. She was admitted with septic shock caused by an Acinetobacter infection, which has now resolved. She has several ongoing medical issues, including sacral/ischiatal decubitus ulcers, yeast infection from a central venous catheter, hypotension, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, neuropathic pain in the right arm, anemia, heel ulcer/peripheral vascular disease, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers: These ulcers can lead to infection and osteomyelitis, especially with an elevated ESR.
2. Yeast infection from central venous catheter: This could potentially cause bloodstream infection or local infection at the catheter site.
3. Hypotension: This may be due to volume overload or bad peripheral vascular disease. It can lead to organ dysfunction and poor tissue perfusion.
4. Chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis: The patient may require ongoing renal support and management of fluid balance and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Neuropathic pain in the right arm: This may require ongoing pain management and potential referral to an"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 5228**] is a 78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p
   BKA, CAD s/p MI with septic shock
   1.       Septic Shock:RESOLVED.  from MDR Acinetobacter line infection;
   decubitus ulcers may very well be contributing; unclear if there is
   also tissue ischemia from PVD (? In her left arm/hand). Off daptomycin
   and flagyl as c. diff negative and ulcers appear to be not infected.
   Off Colistin. Remaining on high dose Unasyn for Acinetobacter
   bacteremia; surveillance blood cultures negative. Plastics does not
   feel any intervention needed on decubitus ulcers.  Hand surgery  no
   need for intervention, no compartment syndrome in right arm/hand.
   Colorectal surgery feels no indication for surgical intervention
   -          Unasyn course for bacteremia 14 days
   2. Hypotension: per renal patient at baseline, mentates well with
   measured SBP high 70s low 80s , suspect bad PVD preventing accurate
   measurement of true BP
   - cont midodrine, cont to monitor
   3. Right Arm:  there is some steal from AV fistula. No current change
   in management. Neuropathic pain improved.
   -            continue current pain meds
   -           defer to outpatient further management i.e. neurontin
   4.       CKD V on hemodialysis. Patient negative 30L on CVVHD. Patient
   is felt to be near her dry weight. Patient will hold on CVVHD for now.
   Given patient has tenuous pressures this may need to be restarted if
   she does not tolerate HD. Patient has tolerated HD.
   -             appreciate renal recs
   -             On midodrine for pressures
   5.       Sacral/ischial decubitus ulcers
   - Plastics agressively debrided
   - Started on vanc/ceftaz for presumed osteo
   - Appreciate ID input
   6.       Anemia; history of chronic GI bleed from AVMs, also vaginal
   bleed, and CVVHD.  Patient with uterus and cervix, but CT scan and
   transvaginal with limited views show no pathologic features.
   -         Continue to transfuse HCT >25
   -         Monitor for sign vaginal or GI bleeding
   7.       Heel ulcer/PVD
   -          cont weight-sparing boot; no urgent vascular intervention

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease post below-knee amputation, and a history of myocardial infarction, presented with septic shock from a multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter line infection. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and the septic shock has resolved. However, she still has several medical complications that require ongoing management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: Although the patient's septic shock has resolved, there is a risk of recurrent infection due to her immunocompromised state and presence of multiple comorbidities.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be attributed to her chronic kidney disease and peripheral vascular disease. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and increase the risk of further complications.
3. Right Arm Ischemia: The patient has evidence of ischemia in her right arm, which may be due to peripheral vascular disease. If left untreated, it can lead to tissue necrosis and potential amputation.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia likely secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding from arteriovenous malformations, vaginal bleeding, and hemodialysis. This can result in decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
5. Sacral/Iscial Decubitus Ulcers: The patient has sac"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with hypotension, anasarca, and subsequently underwent continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). She had a course complicated by Acinetobacter bacteremia and presumed osteomyelitis underlying sacral decubitus. She tolerated hemodialysis without the need for pressors over the weekend. The patient has several allergies, including penicillins, codeine, heparin agents, and levofloxacin. She received antibiotics, including ampicillin, ceftazidime, and vancomycin. Her vital signs show low blood pressure, mild hypothermia, and normal oxygen saturation. She is alert with warm upper extremities and no murmurs or gallops on cardiac examination. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, hyperglycemia, and elevated liver enzymes. Other lab values reveal coagulopathy and electrolyte imbalances. The patient has been on dialysis and has had a PICC line placed. She is on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status and is expected to be transferred to the floor."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a chief complaint of sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, codeine, and heparin agents. He is currently on multiple antibiotics, including ceftazidime and vancomycin. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has several medical complications, including renal failure, sacral decubitus, and suspected Acinetobacter sepsis. He is on hemodialysis and has undergone aggressive volume removal with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing atrial fibrillation. His weight has significantly decreased from admission. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and altered liver function tests. The patient's overall condition is critical, and his prognosis is guarded.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sacral decubitus ulcer with suspected underlying osteomyelitis, which is being treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime.
2. Acinetobacter sepsis, for which the patient is receiving treatment with Unasyn.
3. Renal failure, indicated by elevated creatinine levels and the need for hemodialysis.
4. Thrombocytopenia, which may be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted to the ICU with hypotension, anasarca, and sacral decubitus ulcer. She underwent continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and tolerated hemodialysis (HD) without the need for pressors. The patient also had an acetaminophen overdose and a possible underlying osteomyelitis. She was started on ceftazidime and vancomycin for presumed osteomyelitis, and her sacral decubitus ulcer was debrided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and is on maintenance hemodialysis. The recent aggressive volume removal with CVVH may have further compromised her renal function.
2. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer that required debridement. There is a possibility of underlying osteomyelitis, which needs to be monitored and treated appropriately.
3. Acinetobacter Sepsis: The patient had an acetaminophen overdose and possibly underlying osteomyelitis. She is currently being treated with Unasyn for suspected Acinetobacter sepsis.
4. Hypotension/Severe Vasculopathy: The patient's initial presentation included severe hypotension and widespread peripheral vascular disease. Although the hypotension has resolved, the underlying cause and the"

   Assessment and Plan
   [Barring further complications, Ms [**Known lastname 5228**] will be discharged today.
   This assessment and plan describes her hospital course and
   recommendations for further care and will be included in the discharge
   summary.
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5228**] is a 78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p
   BKA, CAD s/p MI with septic shock, volume overload.
   .
   1.  Septic Shock: Resolved from MDR Acinetobacter line infection. Had
   initially been treated empirically with Daptomycin, Colistin, Flagyl
   and Unasyn. Patient Daptomycin and Flagyl was discontinued in setting
   of no GPCs in blood cultures, AND negative c. diff.  Patient
   acinetobacter coverage narrowed to high dose Unasyn for 14 day course.
   She should continue this Unasyn for 14 days, day 1=[**12-25**], complete at
   end of day on [**1-7**].
   .
   2. Hypotension: Per renal, the patient is at baseline and mentates well
   with measured SBP high 70s low 80s; suspect bad PVD preventing accurate
   measurement of true BP. We initiated midodrine and this was continued
   for discharge.
   .
   3. Sacral /ischial decubiti: plastics debrided sacral ulcer. Given rise
   in ESR from 55 to 109, treating for presumptive osteomyelitis. Continue
   Vanc/Ceftaz for a two-week course and monitor ESR, unless plastics
   plans definitive surgical intervention. If ESR persists high, discuss
   continuation of antibiotics with Plastics.  Plastics follow-up
   appointment pending. She should have follow-up in 2 weeks.
   .
   4. Yeast from Right Groin Line: this is of unclear significance, as
   there was no change in patient
s mental status, blood pressure. Blood
   cultures more recently are still pending, will need follow-up.
   .
   5. CKD V on hemodialysis. Patient negative 30L on CVVHD. Patient is
   felt to be near her dry weight. Patient will hold on CVVHD for now.
   Given patient has tenuous pressures this may need to be restarted if
   she does not tolerate HD. Patient has tolerated HD. Continuing
   midodrine as above.
   .
   6. Right Arm Pain: There is some steal from AV fistula. No current
   change in management. Neuropathic pain improved. Hand surgery feels
   there is no surgical intervention. She does have good radial pulse
   currently. Further consideration of neurontin or other treatments may
   be appropriate after discharge.
   .
   7. Anemia; history of chronic GI bleed from AVMs, also vaginal bleed,
   and CVVHD.  Patient with uterus and cervix, but CT scan and
   transvaginal with limited views show no pathologic features. We
   targeted a Hct of 25 for transfusion and recommend follow-up monitoring
   for signs of vaginal or GI bleeding.
   .
   8. Heel ulcer/PVD: Continued weight-sparing boot; no urgent vascular
   intervention.
   .
   8. History of HIT: Heparin was avoided and heparin-free lines only were
   used.
   .
   9. DM2: We continued sliding scale insulin, stopped fixed dose 70/30 in
   setting of low blood glucose.
   10.Thrombocytopenia: stable, no heparin lines, has a history of
   thrombocytopenia.
   11. Elevated INR: likely nutritional, vitamin K 5mg PO * 3 days

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) post below-knee amputation, coronary artery disease post myocardial infarction (CAD MI), and septic shock. The patient has been treated for a multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter line infection and is currently receiving Unasyn for a 14-day course. She also has hypotension, sacral/ischiadecubiti with osteomyelitis, yeast from the right groin line, chronic kidney disease stage V on hemodialysis, right arm pain due to steal from AV fistula, anemia, heel ulcer/PVD, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), diabetes mellitus type 2, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is expected to be discharged today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sacral/ischial decubiti with osteomyelitis: The patient has a high ESR level indicating a possible infection. If the ESR persists, further antibiotic treatment may be necessary.
2. Yeast from right groin line: The significance of this finding is unclear. Blood cultures are pending, and follow-up is needed to determine the appropriate management.
3. Chronic kidney disease stage V on hemodialysis:"

   Was critical ill with renal failure, hypotension. Now resolved.
   Disposition : Plan to DC to LTAC today.
   Total time spent: 30 minutes
","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old woman with extensive vascular disease and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (HD). She was admitted to the MICU with gross volume overload and is now tolerating HD. She has severe peripheral vascular disease and a presumed osteomyelitis with sacral decubitus. She has a history of allergies to penicillins, codeine, heparin agents, and levofloxacin. She is currently receiving morphine sulfate for pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with Acinetobacter bacteremia, which is a type of multi-drug resistant bacterial infection. It is important to monitor her closely for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to her renal failure and volume overload. Close monitoring of her vital signs and appropriate fluid management will be necessary to prevent further complications.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding. It is important to monitor her for any signs of bleeding or bruising.
4. Anasarca: The patient has generalized edema (anasarca), which can be a sign of severe liver disease or fluid overload. Monitoring her fluid balance and addressing any underlying causes will be important.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old woman with extensive vascular disease and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. She was admitted to the MICU with gross volume overload and is now tolerating hemodialysis (HD). The patient has severe peripheral vascular disease and an unclear history of osteomyelitis in the sacral area. She is currently on a two-week course of Unasyn for an identified line infection, which was previously caused by Acinetobacter bacteremia. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's condition indicates ongoing renal failure, which could lead to further deterioration of kidney function and the need for continued hemodialysis support.
2. Anasarca: The patient presents with generalized edema, suggesting anasarca, a condition associated with severe fluid overload. This may increase the risk of complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and wound healing difficulties.
3. Osteomyelitis: The unclear history of osteomyelitis in the sacral area could result in persistent infection and potential spread of infection to other parts of the body.
4. Line Infection: The patient's recent line infection with Acinetobacter bacteremia indicates a risk for central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) and the need for proper line management and antibiotic therapy.
5. Cardiovascular Disease: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old woman with extensive vascular disease, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (HD), and currently in the ICU. She has been diagnosed with renal failure, anasarca (generalized swelling), severe peripheral vascular disease, and a suspected underlying osteomyelitis causing sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient also had a recent episode of acute kidney injury and is now tolerating HD. She has a history of allergic reactions to penicillins, codeine, heparin agents, and levofloxacin. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 71/40 mmHg to 175/139 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is experiencing atrial fibrillation and has lost a significant amount of weight since admission.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,000 mL, including 458 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), 660 mL orally, and 340 mL intravenously. Output includes 600 mL of urine and 458 mL from drains. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a non-invasive device, and her ABG results are pending.

Physical examination reveals normal cardiovascular sounds, clear breath sounds in the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both extremities, and"
