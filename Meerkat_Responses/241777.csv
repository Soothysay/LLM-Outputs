   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old male with a pmh of asthma, HTN, and OSA admitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for an respiratory distress due to an acute asthma exacerbation
   likely secondary to uri vs. flu vs. pneumonia.
   # Asthma exacerbation - Patient tachypneic to the 30's in the ED,
   recieved 2L NS and 3 nebulizations in the ED.  Exacerbation likely
   secondary to an infectious process based on elevated lactate (2.8),
   fever, chills, cough.  DD includes viral etiology vs CAP.   Given the
   history, physical, and data collected, most likely etiology is viral.
   - Albuterol/Atrovent nebs q2h PRN for asthma, q4 standing
   - Change steroids to 40mg PO q8hrs for asthma
   - Monitor sats - currently on room air and satting 98%. Monitor for
   sats greater than 92%
   - Peak flow spirometer to the bedside
 document peak flow value
   - Restart Advair now for asthma teaching and habit forming
   - Follow-up with Pulmonary clinic
   - Flu shot when pt improves
   # Infection - Likely Respiratory in nature given productive cough,
   fever's, and shortness of breath.  Possible etiologies include URI vs
   flu vs pneumonia. Most likely etiology is viral.
   - Flu swab negative
   - D/C Tamiflu 75mg.
   - Levaquin and ceftriaxone given in the ED - continue for empiric
   treatment of CAP with Levaquin 750 - 5 day course
   - Bolus 1L of NS in the setting of increasing lactate (3.8) and check a
   PM lactate
   - F/u morning chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumonia
   # Tachycardia - Pt's HR was 140 on presentation to the ED.  He received
   4L NS total and his HR is now ranging 70
s-90
s.  Presumably
   tachycardic due to asthma exacerbation likely compounded by infectious
   process and nebulizations.
   - Resolved.
   # HTN - Pt hypertensive at baseline.  Pt normotensive now.
   - Add back home meds today, (valsartan 160 daily and nifedipine ER 30
   daily) as long as the patient remains stable.
   # OSA -
   - Continue home CPAP requirements

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, hypertension (HTN), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress caused by an acute asthma exacerbation, likely secondary to an upper respiratory infection (URI) or viral flu versus pneumonia. The patient received 2 liters of normal saline (NS) and three nebulizations in the emergency department (ED). 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate (HR) ranging from 78 to 115 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 141/91 to 102 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is in sinus rhythm.

The physical examination reveals a pleasant and alert patient with no abnormalities in the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT) area. The cardiac examination shows a normal rate and regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The lung examination reveals sparse wheezes in the left lower lung field, diffuse wheezes in the right lung fields, good air movement, and minimal crackles in the right middle lobe (RML). The abdomen is described as obese but soft with no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly (HSM). The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, hypertension (HTN), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress due to an acute asthma exacerbation likely secondary to an infectious process. The patient received nebulizations and intravenous fluids in the emergency department. His condition has improved, with stable vital signs and decreased heart rate. He is currently being treated with albuterol/atrovent nebs every two hours as needed for asthma, methylprednisolone for asthma, and antibiotics for a possible respiratory infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's history of asthma and current symptoms suggest the possibility of an asthma exacerbation. Monitoring his response to nebulizations and adjusting treatment accordingly will be important.
2. Respiratory infection: The patient's elevated lactate level, fever, chills, and productive cough may indicate a respiratory infection. Continuing the antibiotics and following up with flu swab and other diagnostic tests will help determine the specific etiology.
3. Tachycardia: Although the patient's heart rate has improved since receiving intravenous fluids, it was initially high on presentation. Monitoring his heart rate and ensuring adequate hydration will be important.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension. It is crucial to monitor his blood pressure and consider adding back home medications once he is stable.
5. Obstructive Sleep Ap"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress due to an acute asthma exacerbation, likely secondary to an infectious process. The patient received 2 liters of normal saline and three nebulizations in the emergency department. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, blood pressure ranging from 141/91 mmHg to 102/74 mmHg, heart rate between 78 and 115 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination findings include a pleasant and alert patient, clear oropharynx, normal heart sounds, scattered wheezes in the left lower lung field, diffuse wheezes in the right lung fields, minimal crackles in the right middle lung, and a partially blanching pinpoint erythematous rash on the arms and legs. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal kidney function. The patient is currently being treated with albuterol/atrovent nebulizations every two hours, methylprednisolone for asthma, monitoring oxygen saturation, follow-up in pulmonary clinic, empiric treatment for flu and community-acquired pneumonia, and hydration with normal saline. Potential complications may include worsening respiratory distress, infection spread, or inadequate control of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms including tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, fever, and was found to have possible pneumonia on chest X-ray, wheezing consistent with an asthma exacerbation, and suspected influenza.

The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Tachypnea: This could be due to pneumonia, influenza, or asthma exacerbation. Influenza is very likely given the patient's symptoms of cough, backache, and fever. Droplet precautions have been started, and Tamiflu has been initiated. Treatment for possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation is also being administered.

2. Asthma exacerbation: The patient responded to nebulizers in the emergency department. Combivent nebs (ipatropium/albuterol) are being given every 4 hours while standing and every 2 hours as needed. Methylprednisolone 60mg IV q6hrs has been started, and the patient will continue on advanced air after the steroid taper. Daily peak flow will be checked, and follow-up in the pulmonary clinic is planned. If the respiratory rate exceeds 25, an ABG will be checked.

3. Possible CAP (Community-Acquired Pneumonia): There is a suspicion of pneumonia, although it is more likely to be atelect"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea who presented to the emergency department with tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, fever, and was found to have pneumonia on chest X-ray. He also had wheezing consistent with an asthma exacerbation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 102 bpm (normal range 78-115 bpm), blood pressure of 185/90 mmHg (normal range 112/74-185/95 mmHg), respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (normal range 12-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is speaking in full sentences and has no evidence of distress. Physical examination findings include a faint macular rash on arms and legs that has almost completely resolved, mildly increased respiratory effort with diffuse expiratory wheezes, and no rales or rhonchi. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated glucose level, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's condition is improving, and he is currently on multiple medications including Combivent nebs, prednisone, Advair, and IV fluids. He is expected to be called out to the floor today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, fever, and was diagnosed with pneumonia. He has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112-185/74-90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is speaking in full sentences and has clear lung sounds without any signs of distress. His physical examination reveals no abnormalities except for a faint macular rash on his arms and legs, which has almost completely resolved. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal blood glucose levels. The patient's asthma exacerbation is likely exacerbated by a viral upper respiratory infection. He is currently receiving Combivent nebs every four hours, prednisone PO, levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily, and restarting Advair. The plan is to continue monitoring his respiratory status and peak flow, follow up in the pulmonary clinic, and administer a flu shot prior to discharge. Other concerns include tachypnea, elevated lactate levels, and hypertension. The patient's rash has resolved, and he will be evaluated for possible evolving pneumonia. He will"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of poorly controlled asthma, now presenting with acute respiratory distress. Overnight, there was an improvement in the patient's condition, with a reduced frequency of nebulizer treatments. The rash has resolved, and there is no evidence of influenza. The patient's medical and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged from admission except for the noted improvements.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/64 to 185/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on sinus tachycardia.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese build, and no signs of conjunctival edema, pallor, or scleral edema. Cardiovascular examination shows normal PMI, S1, S2, and no murmurs or signs of heart failure. Respiratory examination reveals scattered wheezes but clear air movement. Abdominal examination shows soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. Extremities show no edema or cyanosis. Skin examination shows warmth without rash or jaundice. Neurologic examination is attentive and oriented.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.2 g/dL, hemoglobin of 15.7 g/dL, platelet count of 187 K/uL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 178 mg/dL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4.4 mEq/L, and magnesium of 1.8 mEq/L.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with acute asthma exacerbation attributed to asthma. The pneumonia is early and not convincing. The patient should receive influenza vaccine prior to discharge. The acute asthma exacerbation shows a good response to the current level of care. Follow peak flows and continue current care. The patient needs asthma education. Lactic acidosis is unclear etiology, with no signs of sepsis, abnormal abdominal exam, or starvation. Monitor serial lactate values. Obstructive sleep apnea should continue CPAP as scheduled. Fluids are hypovolemic and should be replenished since admission. Maintain balance. Rash has resolved, likely viral exanthem. Nutritional support should encourage PO. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and stress ulcer prevention."

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of poorly controlled asthma, currently experiencing an acute asthma exacerbation. He is being treated in the ICU and has shown improvement overnight. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 150/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.

Physical examination reveals clear lung sounds with scattered wheezes, indicating possible airway obstruction due to asthma. No signs of respiratory distress or other abnormalities were noted. The patient is alert, oriented, and follows simple commands. Neurologic examination is normal.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 187 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 45.1%, platelet count (Plt) of 6.2 g/dL, blood glucose of 178 mg/dL, and normal electrolyte levels. The lactate level is elevated at 3.8 mmol/L, but the etiology is unclear. Other lab values, including complete blood count (CBC), calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, are within normal range.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory distress attributed to asthma exacerbation. Repeat chest X-ray should be done to rule out pneumonia. Influenza vaccine should be given prior to discharge.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening asthma symptoms: The patient may experience another asthma exacerbation if not properly managed with medications and follow-up care.
2. Pneumonia progression: The patient's pneumonia may worsen if not appropriately treated, leading to increased symptoms and potential complications.
3. Volume depletion: The patient may become dehydrated due to fluid losses and inadequate intake, which can result in further complications such as hypotension and organ dysfunction.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing new infections due to the use of immunosuppressive medications like steroids and the presence of a central line.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing blood clots in the legs due to prolonged immobility in the ICU and may require prophylactic measures.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Although the patient is not currently on mechanical ventilation, there is still a risk of developing VAP if ventilatory support becomes necessary during their stay.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional assessments may be required for a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of poorly controlled asthma, now presenting with an acute asthma exacerbation. The patient's respiratory distress is primarily attributed to the asthma exacerbation. There are early radiographic signs of pneumonia, but they are not convincing. It is recommended to repeat the chest X-ray (current film is suboptimal). The patient should also receive an influenza vaccine prior to discharge.

The patient has shown a good response to the current level of care. It is advised to follow peak flows, continue with the current care, and administer Advir QID, Albuterol nebs q4h, and prednisone 40. The patient needs asthma education.

There is a concern for lactic acidosis with unclear etiology. There are no signs of sepsis, abnormal abdominal exam, or starvation. Serial lactate values should be monitored.

The patient has obstructive sleep apnea and should continue with CPAP as scheduled.

The patient is hypovolemic and has been repleted since admission. It is important to monitor I/O and maintain fluid balance.

The patient previously had a rash that has resolved. It is likely a viral exanthem.

The patient requires nutritional support, and oral intake should be encouraged.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and line management. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of poorly controlled asthma who is currently experiencing an acute asthma exacerbation. The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to the asthma exacerbation. There are early radiographic signs of pneumonia, but they are not convincing, and it is recommended to repeat the chest X-ray with an improved film quality.

The patient is currently receiving appropriate care for his asthma, including Advir QID (once in the morning), Albuterol nebs q4h (every four hours), and prednisone 40. It is advised to follow peak flows and continue the current care plan. The patient also needs asthma education.

Additionally, the patient has intermittent tachycardia, which may be due to pharmacological causes (beta-agonists). However, it is important to consider thromboembolic complications, and a d-dimer test should be performed. If the d-dimer is positive, a CTA (computed tomography angiography) should be done to assess for pulmonary embolism.

The patient's lactic acidosis has unclear etiology. There are no signs of sepsis, abnormal abdominal exam (no bowel ischemia) or starvation. Serial lactate values should be monitored.

The patient also has obstructive sleep apnea and should continue with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) as scheduled.

The patient has been hypovolemic since admission, and fluid repletion"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old male with a pmh of asthma, HTN, and OSA admitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for an respiratory distress due to an acute asthma exacerbation
   likely secondary to uri vs. flu vs. pneumonia.
   # Asthma exacerbation - Patient tachypneic to the 30's in the ED,
   recieved 2L NS and 3 nebulizations in the ED.  Exacerbation likely
   secondary to an infectious process based on elevated lactate, fever,
   chills, cough.  DD includes viral etiology vs CAP.   Given the history,
   physical, and data collected, most likely etiology is viral.
   - Albuterol/Atrovent nebs q2h PRN for asthma, q4 standing
   - Continue steroids to 40mg PO q8hrs for asthma
   - Monitor sats - currently on room air and satting 98%. Monitor for
   sats greater than 92%
   - Peak flow spirometer to the bedside
 document peak flow value
   - Continue Advair
   - Follow-up with Pulmonary clinic
   - Flu shot when pt improves
   # Infection - Likely Respiratory in nature given productive cough,
   fever's, and shortness of breath.  Possible etiologies include URI vs
   flu vs pneumonia. Most likely etiology is viral.
   - Flu swab negative
   - Levaquin and ceftriaxone given in the ED - continue for empiric
   treatment of CAP with Levaquin 750 - 5 day course
   - Lactate has improved to 2.6
   - Order chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumonia
   # Tachycardia - Pt's HR was 140 on presentation to the ED.  Over the
   past 24 hours he had episodes of sinus tach to the 140
s and responded
   to fluid boluses and his HR is now ranging 80
s-100
s.  Presumably
   tachycardic due to asthma exacerbation likely compounded by infectious
   process and nebulizations.
   - Resolved.
   #Leukocytosis
 likely due to high dose steroids.  The absence of fever
   and other clinical signs of infection, as well as a decreasing lactate
   support this theory.  Will continue to monitor for signs and symptoms
   of infection.
   # HTN - Pt hypertensive at baseline.  Pt normotensive now with
   fluctuating BP over the last 24 hours.
   - Continue home meds (valsartan 160 daily and nifedipine ER 30 daily).
   # OSA -
   - Continue home CPAP requirements

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, hypertension (HTN), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress due to an acute asthma exacerbation likely secondary to an upper respiratory infection (URI) or viral infection.

The patient presented with a rapid heart rate (tachycardia) initially, which responded to fluid boluses and has now stabilized within the normal range. His blood pressure is fluctuating but remains within normal limits. He is also experiencing wheezing in the lungs, indicating ongoing respiratory distress.

The patient has been receiving nebulizations, steroids, and other medications for asthma management. Antibiotics were started empirically in the emergency department (ED) and will be continued for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Chest X-ray has been ordered to evaluate for pneumonia.

His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), which could be due to high-dose steroids or an ongoing infection. The lactate level has improved, indicating better tissue perfusion. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's condition appears to be stable at the moment, with no new medical complications mentioned in the progress note. However, ongoing monitoring is necessary to ensure the patient's well-being and respond to any changes in his condition."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, presenting with symptoms of fever, shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing. The patient was diagnosed with an asthma exacerbation likely caused by a viral infection. He is being treated with a 15-day Prednisone taper starting at 40 mg PO and will continue to use an albuterol inhaler, advair, and combivent nebs. The patient also has a possible upper respiratory infection (URI) for which he is being started on Levofloxacin.

The patient continues to experience episodes of sinus tachycardia, which may be partly due to albuterol. An elevated D-dimer level was noted, but without any signs or symptoms of pulmonary embolism (PE), it is being monitored. The patient's hypertension is stable and he will continue on Valsartan and Nifedipine. The patient also has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and will continue using CPAP at night.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly low body temperature (35.3 C or 95.6 F) and a heart rate in the 130s. His blood pressure is within normal limits. The patient's respiratory rate is normal, and his oxygen saturation is 94%. The physical examination reveals sparse wheezes in the left lower lung field and right lung, overall better aeration, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old male with a pmh of asthma, HTN, and OSA admitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for an respiratory distress due to an acute asthma exacerbation
   likely secondary to uri vs. flu vs. pneumonia.
   # Asthma exacerbation - Patient tachypneic to the 30's in the ED,
   recieved 2L NS and 3 nebulizations in the ED.  Exacerbation likely
   secondary to an infectious process based on elevated lactate, fever,
   chills, cough.  DD includes viral etiology vs CAP.   Given the history,
   physical, and data collected, most likely etiology is viral.
   - Albuterol/Atrovent nebs q2h PRN for asthma, q4 standing
   - Continue steroids to 40mg PO q8hrs for asthma
   - Monitor sats - currently on room air and satting 98%. Monitor for
   sats greater than 92%
   - Peak flow spirometer to the bedside
 document peak flow value
   - Continue Advair
   - Follow-up with Pulmonary clinic
   - Flu shot when pt improves
   # Infection - Likely Respiratory in nature given productive cough,
   fever's, and shortness of breath.  Possible etiologies include URI vs
   flu vs pneumonia. Most likely etiology is viral.
   - Flu swab negative
   - Levaquin and ceftriaxone given in the ED - continue for empiric
   treatment of CAP with Levaquin 750 - 5 day course
   - Lactate has improved to 2.6
   - Order chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumonia
   # Tachycardia - Pt's HR was 140 on presentation to the ED.  Over the
   past 24 hours he had episodes of sinus tach to the 140
s and responded
   to fluid boluses and his HR is now ranging 80
s-100
s.  Presumably
   tachycardic due to asthma exacerbation likely compounded by infectious
   process and nebulizations.
   - Resolved.
   #Leukocytosis
 likely due to high dose steroids.  The absence of fever
   and other clinical signs of infection, as well as a decreasing lactate
   support this theory.  Will continue to monitor for signs and symptoms
   of infection.
   # HTN - Pt hypertensive at baseline.  Pt normotensive now with
   fluctuating BP over the last 24 hours.
   - Continue home meds (valsartan 160 daily and nifedipine ER 30 daily).
   # OSA -
   - Continue home CPAP requirements

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, hypertension (HTN), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress due to an acute asthma exacerbation, likely secondary to an infectious process such as viral upper respiratory infection (URI), influenza (flu), or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate ranging from 77 to 130 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 135/64 to 146/94 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 5 to 36 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94% on room air. His physical examination reveals wheezing in the left lower lung field and diffuse wheezing in the right lung fields, along with a pleasant and alert mental status.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.9 thousand/mm³, elevated lactate levels at 2.6 mmol/L, and elevated D-dimer levels at 740 ng/mL. His blood glucose level is elevated at 178 mg/dL, and his magnesium (Mg++) level is low at 2.3 mg/dL.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of poorly controlled asthma, currently experiencing an acute asthma exacerbation. He has shown improvement since admission and is responding well to the current level of care. The patient's respiratory distress is primarily attributed to the asthma exacerbation. There are early radiographic signs of pneumonia, but they are not convincing, and a repeat chest X-ray is recommended. It is also advised to administer an influenza vaccine prior to discharge. 

The patient has intermittent tachycardia, which has now resolved, possibly due to pharmacological intervention. The etiology of lactic acidosis is unclear, with no signs of sepsis, abnormal abdominal exam, or starvation. Serial lactate values should be monitored. The patient has obstructive sleep apnea and should continue with CPAP as scheduled. 

The patient was initially hypovolemic but has been repleted since admission. Fluid balance should be monitored, and input/output should be maintained. A rash has resolved, likely due to a viral exanthem. Nutritional support should encourage oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has early radiographic signs of pneumonia, indicating a potential respiratory infection.
2. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's poorly controlled asthma can lead to further exacerbations, causing respiratory distress.
3. Lactic acidosis: The unclear etiology of lactic acidosis warrants close monitoring and further investigation to determine"

Fluid balance will be maintained, and I/O will be monitored. The patient previously had a rash that has resolved, likely due to a viral exanthem. Nutritional support is encouraged through PO (oral) intake. The patient is under ICU care, with ongoing monitoring of glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and nutrition."

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   58 year old male with a pmh of asthma, HTN, and OSA admitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for an respiratory distress due to an acute asthma exacerbation
   likely secondary to uri vs. flu vs. pneumonia.
   # Asthma exacerbation - Patient tachypneic to the 30's in the ED,
   recieved 2L NS and 3 nebulizations in the ED.  Exacerbation likely
   secondary to an infectious process based on elevated lactate, fever,
   chills, cough.  DD includes viral etiology vs CAP.   Given the history,
   physical, and data collected, most likely etiology is viral.
   - Albuterol/Atrovent nebs q2h PRN for asthma, q4 standing
   - Continue steroids to 40mg PO q8hrs for asthma
   - Monitor sats - currently on room air and satting 98%. Monitor for
   sats greater than 92%
   - Peak flow spirometer to the bedside
 document peak flow value
   - Continue Advair
   - Follow-up with Pulmonary clinic
   - Flu shot when pt improves
   # Infection - Likely Respiratory in nature given productive cough,
   fever's, and shortness of breath.  Possible etiologies include URI vs
   flu vs pneumonia. Most likely etiology is viral.
   - Flu swab negative
   - Levaquin and ceftriaxone given in the ED - continue for empiric
   treatment of CAP with Levaquin 750 - 5 day course
   - Lactate has improved to 2.6
   - Order chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumonia
   # Tachycardia - Pt's HR was 140 on presentation to the ED.  Over the
   past 24 hours he had episodes of sinus tach to the 140
s and responded
   to fluid boluses and his HR is now ranging 80
s-100
s.  Presumably
   tachycardic due to asthma exacerbation likely compounded by infectious
   process and nebulizations.
   - Resolved.
   #Leukocytosis
 likely due to high dose steroids.  The absence of fever
   and other clinical signs of infection, as well as a decreasing lactate
   support this theory.  Will continue to monitor for signs and symptoms
   of infection.
   # HTN - Pt hypertensive at baseline.  Pt normotensive now with
   fluctuating BP over the last 24 hours.
   - Continue home meds (valsartan 160 daily and nifedipine ER 30 daily).
   # OSA -
   - Continue home CPAP requirements

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, hypertension (HTN), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress due to an acute asthma exacerbation likely secondary to an upper respiratory infection (URI), flu, or pneumonia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate (HR) ranging from 80 to 136 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 117/56 mmHg to 141/83 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%. The patient's general appearance is pleasant and alert, with no signs of distress. 

On physical examination, the patient has sparse wheezes in the left lower lung field, diffuse wheezes in the right lung fields, and minimal crackles in the right middle lung. His abdomen is described as obese but soft, with no hepatosplenomegaly (HSM). There is a partially blanching pinpoint erythematous rash on his arms and legs, as well as eczema on the dorsal surfaces of his phalanges. Neurological examination reveals normal strength and reflexes throughout the upper and lower extremities, with preserved sensation. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, hypertension (HTN), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress due to an acute asthma exacerbation likely secondary to an upper respiratory infection (URI), influenza (flu), or pneumonia. The patient received 2 liters of normal saline (NS) and three nebulizations in the emergency department (ED). His vital signs on admission included a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate (HR) ranging from 77 to 136 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 89/56 to 141/83 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 15-25 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96% on room air.

During the past 24 hours, the patient's HR has been fluctuating between 80-100 bpm after responding to fluid boluses. His current BP is 122/79 mmHg. The patient is still experiencing some wheezing in the left lower lung field and diffuse wheezing in the right lung fields. No retractions or accessory muscle use was observed during respiration. Crackles were heard in the right middle lobe. The patient has a partially blanching pinpoint erythematous rash on his arms and legs, as well as eczema on the"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   58 year old male with a pmh of asthma, HTN, and OSA admitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for an respiratory distress due to an acute asthma exacerbation
   likely secondary to uri vs. flu vs. pneumonia.
   # Asthma exacerbation - Patient tachypneic to the 30's in the ED,
   recieved 2L NS and 3 nebulizations in the ED.  Exacerbation likely
   secondary to an infectious process based on elevated lactate, fever,
   chills, cough.  DD includes viral etiology vs CAP.   Given the history,
   physical, and data collected, most likely etiology is viral.
   - Albuterol/Atrovent nebs q2h PRN for asthma, q4 standing
   - Continue steroids to 40mg PO q8hrs for asthma
   - Monitor sats - currently on room air and satting 98%. Monitor for
   sats greater than 92%
   - Peak flow spirometer to the bedside
 document peak flow value
   - Continue Advair
   - Follow-up with Pulmonary clinic
   - Flu shot when pt improves
   # Infection - Likely Respiratory in nature given productive cough,
   fever's, and shortness of breath.  Possible etiologies include URI vs
   flu vs pneumonia. Most likely etiology is viral.
   - Flu swab negative
   - Levaquin and ceftriaxone given in the ED - continue for empiric
   treatment of CAP with Levaquin 750 - 5 day course
   - Lactate has improved to 2.6
   - Order chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumonia
   # Tachycardia - Pt's HR was 140 on presentation to the ED.  Over the
   past 24 hours he had episodes of sinus tach to the 140
s and responded
   to fluid boluses and his HR is now ranging 80
s-100
s.  Presumably
   tachycardic due to asthma exacerbation likely compounded by infectious
   process and nebulizations.
   - Resolved.
   #Leukocytosis
 likely due to high dose steroids.  The absence of fever
   and other clinical signs of infection, as well as a decreasing lactate
   support this theory.  Will continue to monitor for signs and symptoms
   of infection.
   # HTN - Pt hypertensive at baseline.  Pt normotensive now with
   fluctuating BP over the last 24 hours.
   - Continue home meds (valsartan 160 daily and nifedipine ER 30 daily).
   # OSA -
   - Continue home CPAP requirements

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress caused by an acute asthma exacerbation, likely secondary to an upper respiratory infection (URI), influenza, or pneumonia. The patient received nebulizations and intravenous fluids in the emergency department. His current medications include albuterol/atropine nebs every 2 hours as needed for asthma, steroids, Advair, and antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate ranging from 80-136 bpm, blood pressure between 122/79 and 141/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's neurological examination is normal, but he has a partially blanching pinpoint erythematous rash on his arms and legs, as well as eczema on the dorsal surfaces of his phalanges. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal kidney function. The patient's conditions include asthma exacerbation, infection (likely respiratory in nature), tachycardia, leukocytosis, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. The patient is expected to be called out today."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of asthma, hypertension (HTN), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress due to an acute asthma exacerbation, likely secondary to an infectious process such as urinary tract infection (UTI), viral infection (URI), or pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes sinus tachycardia, leukocytosis, and hypertension. The plan includes continuing asthma medications, completing a 5-day course of antibiotics (Levaquin), following up with a pulmonary clinic, and administering a flu shot when the patient improves.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Asthma exacerbation: The patient has a history of asthma and is currently experiencing an exacerbation. If not properly managed, this could lead to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient's symptoms and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infectious process. If not identified and treated promptly, it could lead to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which could be due to the asthma exacerbation and infection. If left untreated, it may progress to arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently hypertensive. Poorly controlled blood pressure can lead to end-organ damage and cardiovascular events.
5. Obstructive sleep ap"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of asthma, which has led to an acute exacerbation. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. The patient has shown a gradual improvement in his condition, attributed to the treatment for asthma exacerbation. There are early radiographic signs of pneumonia, but they are not convincing.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate between 80-136 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/56-141/83 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

During the physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished, overweight, and not in acute distress. No abnormal findings were noted in the cardiovascular or neurologic systems. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. There is no edema observed in the extremities.

Laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. Other lab results indicate elevated D-dimer and lactic acid levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo man h/o asthma (poorly controlled and not on regular
   medications), now with acute asthma exacerbation.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 Continued gradual improvement.  Attributed
   predominately to asthma exacerbation.  [**Month (only) 11**] have early radigraphic signs
   of pneumonia, but not convincing.   Should receive influenza vaccine
   prior to discharge.
   ASTHMA -- acute exacerbation.  Good response to current level of care.
   Peak flow improving.  Continue to follow peak flows.  Continue current
   care, Advir QID, Albuterol nebs q4h, prednisone 40.  Needs asthma
   education.
   TACHYCARDIA
 intermittent, but now resolved.  In part likely
   pharmacological (b-agoinst).
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS
 unclear etiology.  No signs sepsis, abnormal
   abdominal exam (no bowel ischemia) or starvation.  Monitor serial
   lactate values.
   OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA -- continue CPAP as scheduled.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic.  Repleted since admission.  Monitor I/O.
   Maintain balance.
   RASH -- resolved.  Evenascent.  Likely viral exanthem.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- encourage PO.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled asthma who is currently experiencing an acute asthma exacerbation. He is in the ICU and has shown gradual improvement. The patient also has early radiographic signs of pneumonia but not conclusive. It is recommended that he receive an influenza vaccine prior to discharge. The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to the asthma exacerbation, and he is responding well to the current level of care. His peak flow is improving, and he will continue to follow peak flows. The current care plan includes Advir QID, Albuterol nebs q4h, and prednisone 40. The patient needs asthma education. He had an episode of tachycardia, which has now resolved. The etiology of his lactic acidosis is unclear, but it is being monitored. The patient has obstructive sleep apnea and will continue with CPAP as scheduled. He is hypovolemic and has been repleted with fluids since admission. Fluid balance will be monitored. The patient had a rash that has resolved, likely a viral exanthem. Nutritional support is encouraged via the oral route. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to be transferred to the floor. The total time spent with the patient was 45 minutes.
