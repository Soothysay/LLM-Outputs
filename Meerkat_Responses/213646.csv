   Assessment and Plan
 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
   Assessment and Plan: 55 y/o male with ESLD (MELD 22), CKD, recent
   admission for encephalopathy presents with hypoglycemia,
   encephalopathic.
   # Altered Mental Status: Pt presented with hypoglycemia and then
   intubated due to mental status. Pt without clear infectious source
   although suspicious CXR yesterday with L base opacity concerning for
   aspiration or PNA, although pt without fevers or leukocytosis. UA was
   negative for infection. All other cultures continue to be negative.
   Given history, hepatic encephalopathy high on differential.
   - F/u repeat CXR today to evaluate L base
   - Watch blood sugars and allow for higher sugars in order to avoid
   hypoglycemia
   - F/u OSH blood cultures
   - F/u ascites fluid Cx, has been negative x2 so far from [**12-31**] and
   [**12-26**]
   - Continue Lactulose 30 QID, continue Rifaximin 400 TID
   - F/u with Hepatology and make sure they are aware of pt's admission
   - F/u final read of RUQ u/s
   - Cultures if spikes
   - Hold off on ABx for now as no WBC count and no fevers
   # Respiratory status: Pt is on minimal PS, however is fairly bradypneic
   to the [**11-16**]'s, and yet still has CO2 of 20 on his last gas. He was not
   intubated for hypoxia or respiratory distress and so once the
   underlying cause is appropriately addressed, it seems reasonable to be
   able to wean him fairly easily. He is on minimal sedation as well,
   which could be easily weaned, and he has already shown signs of waking
   up when off the Propofol.
   - RSBI this morning
   - SBT and if passes, extubate later this am
   # Non AG metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Unclear why
   his CO2 is currently so low and trending down, when he is also
   bradypneic. Unclear etiology but differential includes: renal failure
   with impaired generation of NH3, RTA, GI losses of HCO3, and dilutional
   effect of IVF's without HCO3. This appears to be a process started
   earlier during past admission [**12-28**], just a few days ago.
   - Have temporarily stopped pt's NS without HCO3 this am
   - If IVF's needed, will give NS with HCO3
   # Diabetes Mellitus: BS's have been between 59-226 since admission.
   Continues on insulin gtt. Would rather pt go slightly hyperglycemic
   than hypoglycemic, considering his presentation.
   # CKD: Creatinine at baseline, renally dose meds.
   # HCV Cirrhosis s/p transplant: MELD 22, on transplant list.  Liver
   team aware.  Continue tacrolimus (level today) and bactrim for
   prophylaxis.
   - F/u tacro level today but would contact hepatology team to adjust if
   necessary.
   # HTN: Will follow, metoprolol per home regimen.
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Continue hydrocortisone per home regimen.
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO for now, IVF's with HCO3 if given, but
   none for now
   # Prophylaxis: PPI, pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals x2   [**69**] and 20
   # Code:  Presumed Full, will need to be clarified
   # Disposition: pending extubation.
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with ESLD (MELD 22), CKD, and recent admission for encephalopathy. He presents with hypoglycemia and encephalopathic symptoms. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 95/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and intubated on minimal propofol.

The patient's physical examination reveals icteric conjunctivae, distended abdomen without tightness, no edema in the extremities, and slight yellowing of the skin. Neurological examination shows altered mental status.

Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies reveal a patchy opacity at the left base of the lungs, concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. Microbiology tests are negative for infections.

The patient's diagnosis includes hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory distress, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, HCV cirrhosis post-transplant, hypertension, adrenal insufficiency, and fluid-electrolyte imbalance. The patient is currently receiving lactulose, rifaximin, insulin, metoprolol, hydrocortisone, and prophylactic medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease), CKD (chronic kidney disease), and a recent admission for encephalopathy. He presents with hypoglycemia and encephalopathy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 95/62 to 211/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is sedated and intubated. His general appearance is icteric, and he has a distended abdomen. The patient's neurologic examination reveals purposeful movements when off propofol but no following of commands. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's presentation with hypoglycemia and encephalopathy, along with a history of ESLD and recent admission for encephalopathy, suggests hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment includes lactulose and rifaximin.
2. Respiratory Status: The patient is on minimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PS), but he is bradypneic. His carbon dioxide (CO2) level is low and trending down, indicating respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis. The underlying cause of his respiratory distress should be addressed to facilitate weaning off mechanical ventilation.
3. Non-anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has non"

   Assessment and Plan
 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
   Assessment and Plan: 55 y/o male with ESLD (MELD 22), CKD, recent
   admission for encephalopathy presents with hypoglycemia,
   encephalopathic.
   # Altered Mental Status: Pt presented with hypoglycemia and then
   intubated due to mental status. Pt without clear infectious source
   although suspicious CXR yesterday with L base opacity concerning for
   aspiration or PNA, although pt without fevers or leukocytosis. UA was
   negative for infection. All other cultures continue to be negative.
   Given history, hepatic encephalopathy high on differential.
   - F/u repeat CXR today to evaluate L base
   - Watch blood sugars and allow for higher sugars in order to avoid
   hypoglycemia
   - F/u OSH blood cultures
 2/4 bottles with gram + cocci in pairs an
   chains from [**12-31**] (first 0/2 then 45 minutes later another set drawn
   and [**3-10**] from that set).
   - Get new BCx
s from here now
   - F/u ascites fluid Cx, has been negative x2 so far from [**12-31**] and
   [**12-26**]
   - Increase Lactulose and Rifaxamin
   - F/u with Hepatology and make sure they are aware of pt's admission
   - F/u final read of RUQ u/s
   - Cultures if spikes
   - Will start Vancomycin for positive Cx
s from OSH
   # Respiratory status: Pt is on minimal PS, however is fairly bradypneic
   to the [**11-16**]'s, and yet still has CO2 of 20 on his last gas. He was not
   intubated for hypoxia or respiratory distress and so once the
   underlying cause is appropriately addressed, it seems reasonable to be
   able to wean him fairly easily. He is on minimal sedation as well,
   which could be easily weaned, and he has already shown signs of waking
   up when off the Propofol.
   - RSBI this morning
   - SBT this morning
   - Do not plan to extubate as doesn
t appear alert enough to protect
   airway
   # Non AG metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Unclear why
   his CO2 is currently so low and trending down, when he is also
   bradypneic. Unclear etiology but differential includes: renal failure
   with impaired generation of NH3, RTA, GI losses of HCO3, and dilutional
   effect of IVF's without HCO3. This appears to be a process started
   earlier during past admission [**12-28**], just a few days ago.
   - Have temporarily stopped pt's NS without HCO3 this am
   - If IVF's needed, will give NS with HCO3
   # Diabetes Mellitus: BS's have been between 59-226 since admission.
   Continues on insulin gtt. Would rather pt go slightly hyperglycemic
   than hypoglycemic, considering his presentation.
   # CKD: Creatinine at baseline, renally dose meds.
   # HCV Cirrhosis s/p transplant: MELD 22, on transplant list.  Liver
   team aware.  Continue tacrolimus (level today) and bactrim for
   prophylaxis.
   - F/u tacro level today, but would contact hepatology team to adjust if
   necessary.
   # HTN: Will follow, metoprolol per home regimen.
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Continue hydrocortisone per home regimen.
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO for now, IVF's with HCO3 if restart,
   but none for now
   # Prophylaxis: PPI, pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals x2   [**69**] and 20
   # Code:  Full code
   # Disposition: pending extubation.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with ESLD (MELD 22), CKD, and recent admission for encephalopathy. He presents with hypoglycemia and encephalopathic symptoms. The patient has been intubated due to mental status changes.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 36.1°C, HR: 66 bpm, BP: 95/62 mmHg, RR: 20 inspirations per minute, and SpO2: 100%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a set Vt of 600 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and minimal Propofol infusion at 20 mcg/kg/min.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and recent admission for encephalopathy. He presented with hypoglycemia and altered mental status, leading to intubation. The patient has a suspicious chest X-ray showing left base opacity, suggesting aspiration or pneumonia, although he does not have fevers or an elevated white blood cell count. Urine analysis was negative for infection. The patient's ascites fluid culture has been negative twice.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1. HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: The patient is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy. Repeat CXR today, watch blood sugars, follow up on OSH blood cultures, and continue monitoring ascites fluid culture.
2. RESPIRATORY STATUS: The patient is on minimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PS) but is bradypneic. It is planned to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and if successful, extubate later this morning.
3. METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: The patient has non-anion gap (NAG) metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. The etiology is unclear, but potential causes include renal failure, RTA, GI losses of HCO3, and dilutional effect of intravenous fluids (IVF's) without HCO3. Temporary cessation of the patient's normal saline (NS) without HCO3 has been implemented.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS: The patient's blood sugar levels have been fluctuating between 59-226 since admission. He is currently on insulin gtt and will be closely monitored to avoid hypoglycemia.
5. CKD: Renal dosing of medications will be followed.
6. HCV CIRRHOSIS S/P TRANSPLANT: The patient is listed for liver transplantation with a MELD score of 22. Tacrolimus and bactrim prophylaxis will be continued.

   Assessment and Plan: 55 y/o male with ESLD (MELD 22), CKD, recent
   admission for encephalopathy presents with hypoglycemia,
   encephalopathic
   # Altered Mental Status: Pt presented with hypoglycemia and then
   intubated due to mental status. Pt without clear infectious source
   although suspicious CXR yesterday with L base opacity concerning for
   aspiration or PNA, although pt without fevers or elevated WBC count. UA
   was negative for infxn. All other Cx's continue to be negative. Given
   history, hepatic encephalopathy high on differential.
   - F/u repeat CXR today to evaluate L base
   - Watch blood sugars and allow for higher sugars in order to avoid
   hypoglycemia
   - F/u OSH blood cultures
   - F/u ascites fluid Cx, has been negative x2 so far from [**12-31**] and
   [**12-26**]
   - Continue Lactulose 30 QID, continue Rifaximin 400 TID
   - F/u with Hepatology and make sure they are aware of pt's admission
   - F/u final read of RUQ u/s
   - Cultures if spikes
   - Hold off on ABx for now as no WBC count and no fevers
   # Respiratory status: Pt is on minimal PS, however is fairly bradypneic
   to the [**11-16**]'s, and yet still has CO2 of 20 on his last gas. He was not
   intubated for hypoxia or respiratory distress and so once the
   underlying cause is appropriately addressed, it seems reasonable to be
   able to wean him fairly easily. He is on minimal sedation as well,
   which could be easily weaned, and he has already shown signs of waking
   up when off the Propofol.
   - RSBI this morning
   - SBT and if passes, extubate later this am
   # Non AG metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Unclear why
   his CO2 is currently so low and trending down, when he is also
   bradypneic. Unclear etiology but differential includes: renal failure
   with impaired generation of NH3, RTA, GI losses of HCO3, and dilutional
   effect of IVF's without HCO3. This appears to be a process started
   earlier during past admission [**12-28**], just a few days ago.
   - Have temporarily stopped pt's NS without HCO3 this am
   - If IVF's needed, will give NS with HCO3
   # Diabetes Mellitus: BS's have been between 59-226 since admission.
   Continues on insulin gtt. Would rather pt go slightly hyperglycemic
   than hypoglycemic, considering his presentation.
   # CKD: Creatinine at baseline, renally dose meds.
   # HCV Cirrhosis s/p transplant: MELD 22, on transplant list.  Liver
   team aware.  Continue tacrolimus (level today) and bactrim for
   prophylaxis.
   - F/u tacro level today but would contact hepatology team to adjust if
   necessary.
   # HTN: Will follow, metoprolol per home regimen.
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Continue hydrocortisone per home regimen.
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO for now, IVF's with HCO3 if given, but
   none for now
   # Prophylaxis: PPI, pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals x2   [**69**] and 20
   # Code:  Presumed Full, will need to be clarified
   # Disposition: pending extubation.
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease), CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease), and recent admission for encephalopathy. He presented with hypoglycemia and altered mental status, leading to intubation. There is suspicion of aspiration or pneumonia on the CXR, but no clear infectious source. The patient's blood sugars have been fluctuating between 59-226 since admission. He is currently on insulin gtt and is at risk for hypoglycemia. Other medical conditions include HCV cirrhosis s/p transplant, hypertension, adrenal insufficiency, and FEN (possibly referring to fluid electrolyte imbalance or other condition). The patient is also on multiple medications including lactulose, rifaximin, tacrolimus, and bactrim.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of ESLD and recent admission for encephalopathy suggest that hepatic encephalopathy is a potential complication. The plan includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin, which are treatments for hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Respiratory distress or failure: The patient is on minimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PS) and is bradypneic, indicating potential respiratory compromise. The underlying cause needs to be addressed, and the patient may be weaned off the ventilator soon.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The"

   Assessment and Plan
 BACTEREMIA
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
   Assessment and Plan: 55 y/o male with ESLD (MELD 22), CKD, recent
   admission for encephalopathy presents with hypoglycemia,
   encephalopathic.
   # Altered Mental Status: Pt presented with hypoglycemia and then
   intubated due to mental status. Pt without clear infectious source.
   What we are seeing today is likely residual sedation from medication.
   UA was negative for infection. All other cultures continue to be
   negative. Given history, hepatic encephalopathy also high on
   differential.  He is now passing stool and has responded to lactulose
   in the past.
   - OSH blood cultures
 2/4 bottles with methicillin-resistant alpha
   strep.  We will touch base with ID about whether this can be considered
   a contaminant given patient
s stable clinical status, or if we should
   be concerned for true bacteremia.  We are currently treating with
   vancomycin.
   - f/u blood cx from here.
   - Continue Lactulose and Rifaxamin titrated for [**4-9**] BMs daily.
   - Cultures if spikes
   # Respiratory status: Patient did well on [**6-10**] of pressure support and
   SBT.  He is ready for extubation once his mental status will allow.
   - extubate when possible.
   - Do not plan to extubate as doesn
t appear alert enough to protect
   airway
   # Non AG metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Unclear why
   his CO2 is currently so low and trending down, when he is also
   bradypneic. Unclear etiology but differential includes: renal failure
   with impaired generation of NH3, RTA, GI losses of HCO3, and dilutional
   effect of IVF's without HCO3. This appears to be a process started
   earlier during past admission [**12-28**], just a few days ago.
   - Have temporarily stopped pt's NS without HCO3 this am
   - If IVF's needed, will give NS with HCO3
   # Diabetes Mellitus: BS's have been between 59-226 since admission.
   Continues on insulin gtt. Would rather pt go slightly hyperglycemic
   than hypoglycemic, considering his presentation.
   # CKD: Creatinine at baseline, renally dose meds.
   # HCV Cirrhosis s/p transplant: MELD 22, on transplant list.  Liver
   team aware.  Continue tacrolimus (level today) and bactrim for
   prophylaxis.
   - F/u tacro level today, but would contact hepatology team to adjust if
   necessary.
   # HTN: Will follow, metoprolol per home regimen.
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Continue hydrocortisone per home regimen.
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO for now, IVF's with HCO3 if restart,
   but none for now
   # Prophylaxis: PPI, pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals x2   [**69**] and 20
   # Code:  Full code
   # Disposition: pending extubation.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis who underwent a liver transplant. The patient presented with hypoglycemia and encephalopathy, leading to intubation. The differential diagnosis includes altered mental status, bacteremia, hyperglycemia, and hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's current vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 119/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's general appearance is off sedation but still confused and unresponsive. Physical examination findings include icteric eyes, distended abdomen without signs of tightness, no peripheral edema, and slight yellowing of the skin.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low albumin level, and elevated lactate acid level. Imaging reveals bilateral atelectasis with progression on chest X-ray. Blood cultures are pending, with previous results being negative.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures for methicillin"

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who presented with hypoglycemia and altered mental status. He was intubated due to his mental status changes and has been in the ICU since then. The patient's blood cultures grew methicillin-resistant alpha strep, and he is currently being treated with vancomycin. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:
1. Infection: The patient has bacteremia, and there is a concern about a potential infection caused by methicillin-resistant alpha strep. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, but it is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or antibiotic resistance.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of ESLD, hepatic encephalopathy is high on the differential diagnosis. The patient has responded to lactulose in the past, and it should be continued along with rifaximin to manage this condition.

3. Respiratory status: The patient's respiratory status needs to be closely monitored. He did well on pressure support and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and he is ready for extubation once his mental status stabilizes.

4. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's blood sugar levels have been fluctuating since admission. As he stabilizes, it will be necessary to convert his insulin regimen to long-acting insulin and adjust the dosage accordingly"

   Assessment and Plan
 BACTEREMIA
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
   Assessment and Plan: 55 y/o male with ESLD (MELD 22), CKD, recent
   admission for encephalopathy presents with hypoglycemia,
   encephalopathic.
   # Altered Mental Status: Pt presented with hypoglycemia and then
   intubated due to mental status. Pt without clear infectious source
   although suspicious CXR yesterday with L base opacity concerning for
   aspiration or PNA, although pt without fevers or leukocytosis. UA was
   negative for infection. All other cultures continue to be negative.
   Given history, hepatic encephalopathy high on differential.
   - F/u repeat CXR today to evaluate L base
   - Watch blood sugars and allow for higher sugars in order to avoid
   hypoglycemia
   - F/u OSH blood cultures
 2/4 bottles with gram + cocci in pairs an
   chains from [**12-31**] (first 0/2 then 45 minutes later another set drawn
   and [**3-10**] from that set).
   - Get new BCx
s from here now
   - F/u ascites fluid Cx, has been negative x2 so far from [**12-31**] and
   [**12-26**]
   - Increase Lactulose and Rifaxamin
   - F/u with Hepatology and make sure they are aware of pt's admission
   - F/u final read of RUQ u/s
   - Cultures if spikes
   - Will start Vancomycin for positive Cx
s from OSH
   # Respiratory status: Pt is on minimal PS, however is fairly bradypneic
   to the [**11-16**]'s, and yet still has CO2 of 20 on his last gas. He was not
   intubated for hypoxia or respiratory distress and so once the
   underlying cause is appropriately addressed, it seems reasonable to be
   able to wean him fairly easily. He is on minimal sedation as well,
   which could be easily weaned, and he has already shown signs of waking
   up when off the Propofol.
   - RSBI this morning
   - SBT this morning
   - Do not plan to extubate as doesn
t appear alert enough to protect
   airway
   # Non AG metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Unclear why
   his CO2 is currently so low and trending down, when he is also
   bradypneic. Unclear etiology but differential includes: renal failure
   with impaired generation of NH3, RTA, GI losses of HCO3, and dilutional
   effect of IVF's without HCO3. This appears to be a process started
   earlier during past admission [**12-28**], just a few days ago.
   - Have temporarily stopped pt's NS without HCO3 this am
   - If IVF's needed, will give NS with HCO3
   # Diabetes Mellitus: BS's have been between 59-226 since admission.
   Continues on insulin gtt. Would rather pt go slightly hyperglycemic
   than hypoglycemic, considering his presentation.
   # CKD: Creatinine at baseline, renally dose meds.
   # HCV Cirrhosis s/p transplant: MELD 22, on transplant list.  Liver
   team aware.  Continue tacrolimus (level today) and bactrim for
   prophylaxis.
   - F/u tacro level today, but would contact hepatology team to adjust if
   necessary.
   # HTN: Will follow, metoprolol per home regimen.
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Continue hydrocortisone per home regimen.
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO for now, IVF's with HCO3 if restart,
   but none for now
   # Prophylaxis: PPI, pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals x2   [**69**] and 20
   # Code:  Full code
   # Disposition: pending extubation.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), recent admission for encephalopathy, hypoglycemia, and altered mental status. The patient presented with hypoglycemia and was intubated due to mental status changes. He is currently being treated for bacteremia, hepatic encephalopathy, hyperglycemia, and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of ESLD and is at an increased risk for infections. Bacteremia has already been identified, and further evaluation of blood cultures is necessary.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose and rifaximin have been increased to manage this condition.

3. Respiratory issues: The patient is on minimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and shows signs of bradypnea. His carbon dioxide (CO2) level is low and trending down, which could be indicative of respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis. However, the underlying cause of this respiratory issue is unclear.

4. Acid-base imbalance: The patient has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. The cause of this imbalance is uncertain and requires further investigation.

 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
   Assessment and Plan: 55 y/o male with ESLD (MELD 22), CKD, recent
   admission for encephalopathy presents with hypoglycemia,
   encephalopathic.
    # Altered Mental Status: Pt presented with hypoglycemia and then
   intubated due to mental status. Pt without clear infectious source.
   What we are seeing today is likely residual sedation from medication.
   UA was negative for infection. OSH 2/4 bottles positive for Strep
   alpha, meth resistant. All other cultures from this hospital continue
   to be negative. Given history, hepatic encephalopathy also high on
   differential.  He is now passing stool and has responded to lactulose
   in the past.
   - OSH blood cultures
 2/4 bottles with methicillin-resistant alpha
   strep.  We will touch base with ID about whether this can be considered
   a contaminant given patient
s stable clinical status, or if we should
   be concerned for true bacteremia.  We are currently treating with
   vancomycin which we will continue.  --> today is day 3
   - f/u blood cx from here.
   - Continue Lactulose and Rifaxamin titrated for [**4-9**] BMs daily.
   - Cultures if spikes
   # Respiratory status: Pt extubated and doing well on RA
   # Diabetes Mellitus: Pt currently on 30U q12 of NPH, BS's look good in
   the low 100's.
   # CKD: Creatinine at baseline, renally dose meds.
   # HCV Cirrhosis s/p transplant: MELD 22, on transplant list.  Liver
   team aware.  Continue tacrolimus (level today) and bactrim for
   prophylaxis.
   - F/u tacro level today, but would contact hepatology team to adjust if

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease), CKD (chronic kidney disease), and a recent admission for encephalopathy. He presented with hypoglycemia and altered mental status, which led to intubation. The patient does not have a clear infectious source, but his urine analysis was negative for infection. However, blood cultures from outside the hospital showed methicillin-resistant alpha strep, which is sensitive to Cefazolin. The patient will be switched to Cefazolin today. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/73 to 177/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is extubated and doing well on room air. 

The patient has multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, CKD, HCV cirrhosis post-transplant, hypertension, adrenal insufficiency, and hepatorenal syndrome. His blood glucose levels have been in the low 100's while on 30U q12 of NPH. His creatinine levels are at baseline, and he is being dosed for CKD. The patient is on the transplant list with a MELD score of 22 and is being treated with tacrolimus"

   =================
   Patient remains mildly agitated and non-communicative. Lactulose
   continues.
   Creat rising. Urine output low (although total I/O's are near equal).
   Will bolus with fluid now; concern about risk for hepatorenal syndrome.
   Hct stable.
   Blood sugars have been stable.
   Has metabolic acidosis with academia on last ABG. Mild anion gap. PaCO2
   down to 20. Would give bicarbonate to get pH into 7.30-7.35 range.
