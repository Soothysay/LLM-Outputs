134768.0,253155,2182-11-10 07:42:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"24 Hour Events:
   - Patient was admitted, right central line was placed, arterial line
   was placed.
   - Patient was given 2 L NS (received 5 L at OSH), then 4 L of LR for
   CVP <14 and/or SBP <90.
   - Abdominal ultrasound completed, liver was without abnormalities. No
   intra or extra-hepatic duct dilatation, CBD 3 mm, gall bladder
   [** 420**] so could not be assessed for stones. Patent portal flow
   without occlusion.
   - Surgery [**Name (NI) 420**] given abdominal distension and bladder pressure of
   38, worsening respiratory status. Surgery following closely for
   possible laparotomy if needed to relieve abdominal compartment
   syndrome.
   - ERCP team [**Name (NI) 420**], case discussed, given improving amylase, lipase,
   and LFTs, and lack of stone in CBD, appears he passed stone so no ERCP
   at this time.
   - Trials of changing over to AC to increase rate unsuccessful overnight
   as patient
s PIP very high (50
s) and patient fighting ventilator.
   After patient on increased sedation and neo, was able to switch mode to
   AC to increase rate.
   - Started neo given lack of response to fluid boluses and SBP in
   mid-70
s to 80
   - Cardiology [**Name (NI) 420**] and reviewed EKG given ST elevations in inferior
   leads, rising troponins and already elevated CK
s. Cardiology felt
   there was no significant change from old EKG
s. Decision not to
   anti-coagulate given risk of hemorrhagic pancreatitis.
   - Patient
s family called and updated this AM, will be in to visit.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], presents with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found to have elevated pancreatic enzymes and LFTs,
   intubated for increased work of breathing, with hypotension, worsening
   renal function, and elevated cardiac enzymes overnight.
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated in setting of respiratory distress,
   also given need for aggressive IVF resuscitation. Did not tolerated
   several attempts at trials of AC, with PIP that were very high (>50),
   however this morning respiratory team was able to switch him over to
   AC. In setting of IVFs, needed to increase oxygen to 100% FiO2 from 70%
   to maintain oxygenation. Given that his acidosis is worsening
   (metabolic), would ideally like to go up on rate to help compensate
   further; this may require additional sedation and possibly a trial of
   paralytics. Increased abdominal pressure also is likely leading to
   higher pleural pressures, so additional data would be helpful.
   - Will place esophageal balloon to obtain data on pleural pressures,
   plateau pressures
   - Trending ABGs, CXR w/volume overload but no ARDS (will be mindful of
   potential of developing ARDS given severe pancreatitis)
   - Patient received levofloxacin for question of consolidation (versus
   atelectasis versus asp PNA) on CXR at OSH, also may have had
   aspiration, so will follow daily CXR
   - Will paralyze patient and see if able to better ventilate to improve
   oxygenation, BP, and pH
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFTs and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Currently appears that patient has SIRS related
   to his pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for
   hypoxia, had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.
   Greatly appreciate surgery and ERCP recommendations and assistance.
   - Patient is status-post over 11 liters of IVF
based on discussion with
   ICU and surgical team, will hold on further IVF resuscitation as
   additional IVFs will further compromise respiratory status and have
   potential of significantly worsening abdominal compartment syndrome and
   necessitating laparotomy.
   - F/u final RUQ u/s
   - Per surgery, no need for repeat imaging at this time
   - Hold off on ERCP consulted, given it appears stone has passed
   - Treat w/broad spectrum Abx: Vanc/meropenam/flagyl(day 1=[**11-10**]), given
   acuity of patient
s illness, however no evidence of infection at
   present.
   - Continuing to trend [**Doctor First Name **]/lipase, HCT, WBCs, calcium, lactate (lactate
   currently coming down, calcium stabilized after repleted)
   - CRP pending
   - Triglycerides pending
   - Sedation to fentanyl/versed
   - Appreciate surgical assistance following abdominal for compartment
   syndrome
   - Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia
   # Metabolic acidosis: In setting of ARF, lactate has been stable, was
   slightly rising (2.6) but then trending downward. Also hyperglycemia,
   and was initially resuscitated with normal saline.
   - As noted above, attempting to change to AC and increase rate to help
   optimize pH by blowing off Co2
   - Trend ABGs, lactate, treat hyperglycemia
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to significant third spacing of
   fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well as
   SIRS from his pancreatitis. Do not suspect infection or sepsis, however
   cultures are pending. Also have to consider MI as possibility given EKG
   changes and elevated CK/Troponin. No recent steroid use to suspect
   adrenal insufficiency.
   - Cont neo, holding on further IVFs as noted above given concerns of
   worsening abd compartment syn and pulmonary edema. (CVP had been >14).
   Will likely add levophed if second pressor is needed.
   - Following cardiac enzymes as noted above, cardiac echo cardiogram
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures pending.
   # EKG changes: Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of
   STE in inferior leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**4-21**]. However, TWI
   are new. Initial CK at OSH was elevated, with flat troponin and MB
   fraction negative. Patient does have h/o recent 4vCABG and new TWI are
   in the setting of intravascular hypovolemia, HCT drop. At this time,
   risks outweigh benefits for anticoagulation given concern of
   hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis. Given rising (but not very high)
   troponin levels, and appearance of EKG (although not markedly different
   from [**4-21**]), cardiology was [**Month/Year (2) 420**] and reviewed EKG and case, felt
   current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE could be
   ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for change
   in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be larger
   priority.
   - Continue to cycle enzymes
   - Serial EKGs
   - Will consider formal cardiology consult after echocardiogram is
   abnormal or should troponin markedly elevated.
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue baby ASA
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated, start esmolol
   gtt
   - Transthoracic echo today.
   # Hyperkalemia: Improved,  in the setting of ARF, responded to IVFs and
   bicarbonate. No EKG changes c/w hyperkalemia.
   - Consider insulin/glucose, kayexalate
   - Follow trend, monitoring on telemetry.
   # ARF: Patient
s creatinine at presentation to OSH was 2.1, has been
   1.7-1.9 here. FENa 0.21% suggestive of pre-renal etiology, likely
   secondary to severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia, as well as
   abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient also received dye with CT at
   OSH. Anticipate given low urine output, borderline hypotension, that
   patient also will have component of ATN.
   - aggressive IVF hydration
   - urine lytes
   - renally dose meds
   - consider renal consult
   - Mucomist
   # Abdominal distension: Concern is for compartment syndrome in setting
   of elevated bladder pressure, distended abdomen, third spacing of
   fluids. Appreciate surgical assistance.
   - Continuing to monitor pressure, will see if paralytics improve
   bladder pressure. Should pressure rise >40, will need laparotory, which
   will be last resort.
   - Following trend of lactate, no evidence to suggest ischemic bowel or
   obstruction on imaging, no free air on CXR. SMA and aorta were free of
   significant atherosclerosis on CT.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with hypotension, bradycardia, and epigastric pain. He was found to have elevated pancreatic enzymes and liver function tests, indicating acute pancreatitis. The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress and worsening renal function. He also has elevated cardiac enzymes, suggesting possible myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and he requires aggressive ventilatory support. There is a concern for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to severe pancreatitis.
2. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's distended abdomen and elevated bladder pressure indicate the possibility of abdominal compartment syndrome, which can compromise organ function.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension is likely secondary to third spacing of fluids in the abdomen from pancreatitis and sepsis-related systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a worsening metabolic acidosis, possibly due to lactic acidosis in the setting of renal failure.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe acute pancreatitis, likely caused by gallstones. This condition carries a risk of complications such as infected pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation.
6. Cardiac issues: The patient's EKG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes raise concerns for myocardial infar"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 63yoM w/h/o 4V CABG in [**4-21**] transferred
   from OSH for management of severe pancreatitis, currently intubated.
   EKGs reveal new TWI in V1, V2, STE in inferior leads are possibly
   residual from [**4-21**] when pt had CABG. Cardiac enzymes have been
   negative.
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated in setting of respiratory distress,
   also given need for aggressive IVF resuscitation. Did not tolerated
   several attempts at trials of AC, with PIP that were very high (>50).
   In setting of IVFs, needed to increase oxygen to 100% FiO2 from 70% to
   maintain oxygenation. Would ideally like to ventilate at higher rate to
   help metabolic acidosis, currently tolerating trial of AC. [**Month (only) 60**] need to
   sedate/paralyze to fully control ventilator settings.
   - Trending ABGs, CXR w/volume overload but no ARDS
   - Got levoflox for ? of consolidation (versus atelectasis versus asp
   PNA0
   # Pancreatitis: severe, acute. Thought to be due to gallstones, CBD
   5.5mm at OSH. c/b SIRS. Intubated for hypoxia, had initial bradycardia
   and hypotension which resolved w/IVF. Lactate 1.6 at OSH, 1.0 here.
   - Will hold on further IVF rescusitation given difficulties
   w/ventilattion
   - place CVL, A-line
   - F/u final RUQ u/s
   - Per surgery, no need for repeat imaging at this time
   - Hold off on ERCP consulted, given it appears stone has passed
   - treat w/broad spectrum Abx: Vanc/meropenam/flagyl(day 1=[**11-10**])
   - trend [**Doctor First Name **]/lipase, HCT, WBCs, calcium, lactate
   - check CRP
   - change sedation to fentanyl/versed
   - Appreciate surgical assistance following abd for compartment syndrome
   # Metabolic acidosis: In setting of ARF, lactate has been stable, but
   now slightly rising (2.6), now also w/hyperglycemia. Initially got NS
   as well.
   - vent settings to help optimize pH by blowing off Co2
   - trend ABGs, lactate, treat hyperglycemia
   # Hypotension: Suspect [**12-15**] to significant third spacing of fluids [**12-15**]
   pancreatitis. Also have to consider MI as possiblility. No evidence of
   sepsis at present.
   - Cont neo, holding on further IVFs as noted above given concerns of
   worsening abd compartment syn and pulmonary edema
   # EKG changes: New TWI in V1, V2, STE in inferior leads- STE noted on
   prior EKGs from [**4-21**]. However, TWI are new. TNI's have been flat, CK's
   elevated, but MB fraction negative. Pt does have h/o recent 4vCABG and
   new TWI are in the setting of intravascular hypovolemia, HCT drop. At
   this time, risks outweight benefits for anticoagulation.
   - continue to cycle enzymes
   - serial EKGs
   - Discussed w/cardiology overnight, EKG changes not significant as
   compared to old, b
   - hold statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - continue baby ASA
   - transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated, start esmolol

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory distress and requires aggressive IVF resuscitation. There is a need to maintain oxygenation, and ventilator settings need to be carefully controlled.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe acute pancreatitis, which is thought to be caused by gallstones. There is ongoing concern for SIRS and the patient's condition may worsen.

3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has rising lactate levels, indicating worsening metabolic acidosis. This may be related to ARF (acute renal failure) or pancreatitis.

4. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could be due to significant third spacing of fluids in pancreatitis or as a possible complication of MI (myocardial infarction).

5. EKG changes: The patient has new TWI (T wave inversions) in V1 and V2, along with STE (ST elevation) in inferior leads. These changes may indicate myocardial ischemia or previous damage from CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting).

6. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels were elevated but have improved. This is likely due to ARF.

7. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by FENa (fraction of ex"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], presents with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found to have elevated pancreatic enzymes and LFTs,
   with ARDS and persistent pressor requirement, but improved abdominal
   pressures after paralyzed.
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   Intubated in setting of respiratory distress, also given need for
   aggressive IVF resuscitation. Initially did not tolerated AC, but
   necessary to switch over to AC given metabolic acidosis. Yesterday
   paralytics were initiated to attempt to lessen work of breathing and
   allow for synchrony on ventilator so patient could tolerate AC mode.
   This was successful, and esophageal balloon helped further titrate
   PEEP. Currently he now meets ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis
   and possible aspiration.
   - Will aim to stop paralytics today to lessen risk of myopathy and
   follow ABG
s to see if this is tolerated
   - Will aim to lower tidal volumes to reach lower volumes closer to ARDS
   net protocol (rate and tidal volumes were increased to rise minute
   ventilation to help with metabolic acidosis)
   - Continue antibiotics as noted below.
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl and versed.
   .
   #  Metabolic acidosis: In setting of ARF, lactate has been stable, and
   now trending downward. Working on treating hyperglycemia as well.
   - Will consult renal for further assistance managing acid base status,
   as appears patient likely will not need CVVH, but wish to have them
   aware and following in event this acidosis worsens or cannot improve
   with changing ventilator settings. Appreciate assistance
   - Will follow ABGs, weigh benefits lowering tidal volumes (and going up
   on rate) to help ARDS versus improving acidosis, consider bicarbonate
   supplementation
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFTs and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Currently appears that patient has SIRS related
   to his pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for
   hypoxia, had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.
   Greatly appreciate surgery and ERCP recommendations and assistance.
   - Patient is status-post > 11 liters of IVF
based on discussion with
   ICU and surgical team, will hold on further IVF resuscitation as
   additional IVFs will further compromise respiratory status and have
   potential of significantly worsening abdominal compartment syndrome and
   necessitating laparotomy.
   - Per surgery, no need for repeat imaging at this time
   - Hold off on ERCP consulted, given it appears stone has passed, given
   LFTs and pancreatitic enzymes improving, no role at present, but will
   have low threshold to consider should status worsen
   - Treat w/broad spectrum Abx: Vanc/meropenam/flagyl(day 1=[**11-10**]), given
   acuity of patient
s illness, however no evidence of infection at
   present (no necrosis seen on CT)
   - Continuing to trend [**Doctor First Name **]/lipase, HCT, WBCs, calcium, lactate (lactate
   currently coming down, calcium stabilized after repleted)
   - Triglycerides pending
   - Sedation to fentanyl/versed
   - Appreciate surgical assistance following abdominal for compartment
   syndrome
   - Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to significant third spacing of
   fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well as
   SIRS from his pancreatitis. Do not suspect infection or sepsis, however
   cultures are pending. Also have to consider MI as possibility given EKG
   changes and elevated CK/Troponin (but more likely cardiac enzyme leak
   from stress in setting of SIRS and hypotension, no EKG changes). No
   recent steroid use to suspect adrenal insufficiency.
   - Cont neo, holding on further IVFs as noted above given concerns of
   worsening abd compartment syn and pulmonary edema. (CVP had been >14).
   Vasopressin added yesterday given low SBP.
   - Following cardiac enzymes as noted above, cardiac echocardiogram
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures pending.
   - Weaning pressors as tolerated (does of neo has lessened)
   # EKG changes: Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of
   STE in inferior leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**4-21**]. However, TWI
   are new. Initial CK at OSH was elevated, with flat troponin and MB
   fraction negative. Patient does have h/o recent 4vCABG and new TWI are
   in the setting of intravascular hypovolemia, blood pressure drop. At
   this time, risks continue to outweigh benefits for anticoagulation
   given concern of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis. Given rising (but
   not very high) troponin levels, and appearance of EKG (although not
   markedly different from [**4-21**]), cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and reviewed
   EKG and case, felt current EKG was not significantly different from
   old, STE could be ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other
   recommendations for change in management, as management of his
   pancreatitis was felt to be larger priority.
   - Continue to cycle enzymes
   - Serial EKGs
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated, start esmolol
   gtt
   - Transthoracic echo today, will follow up results
   # ARF: Patient
s creatinine at presentation to OSH was 2.1, has risen
   to over 3.0. FENa 0.21% suggestive of pre-renal etiology, likely
   secondary to severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia, also with
   possible component of abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient also
   received dye with CT at OSH. Urine output has picked up today with
   100-150 today (as opposed to 10-20 cc/hr initially)
   Picture supports that of ATN secondary to hypotension, with possible
   dye nephropathy as well. Hopefull that he will be able to avoid
   dialysis given what appears to be post-ATN diuresis, but will obtain
   renal consult to help manage him in event that his volume status,
   hyperkalemia, and/or acidosis become difficult to manage. Appreciate
   assistance.
   - Supportive care as noted above, continuing to treat hyperkalemia (on
   insulin gtt), acidosis, monitoring urine output
   # Abdominal distension: Concern was for compartment syndrome in setting
   of elevated bladder pressure, distended abdomen, third spacing of
   fluids. Appreciate surgical assistance. Bladder pressures are currently
   in teens now.
   - Following trend of lactate, no evidence to suggest ischemic bowel or
   obstruction on imaging, no free air on CXR. SMA and aorta were free of
   significant atherosclerosis on CT.
   # Leukocytosis: New WBC to 13.5, differential from [**11-9**] with 7 bands.
   No overwhelming evidence of infection, but has had low grade
   temperatures. Must consider infection of necrotic pancreas, but no
   intervention at this time given he is already on appropriate antibiotic
   coverage and has only had low grade temperatures, and pressor
   requirement is lessening.
   -          F/u final CXR read
   -          F/u cx data
   -          Cont antibiotics as noted above.
   -          Hold on repeat imaging of abd (would need contrast to fully
   evaluate), but if status dramatically worsens, would consider CT guided
   biopsy of pancreatis

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post CABG, who presents with hypotension, bradycardia, epigastric pain, elevated pancreatic enzymes, and liver function tests (LFTs). He is intubated for respiratory distress and requires aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe acute pancreatitis, and possible aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to significant third spacing of fluids in the abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia. There is also a possibility of septic shock due to infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury, possibly due to hypotension, third spacing of fluids, or dye nephropathy from contrast exposure during imaging.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient has shown new EKG changes, including TWI in V1 and V2 with <1 mm STE in inferior leads. These changes could indicate myocardial ischemia or injury, possibly related to the patient's recent CABG surgery or ongoing hypotension.
4. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient's distended abdomen and elevated bladder pressures suggest the possibility of abdominal compartment syndrome, which can lead to organ dysfunction if not managed promptly.
5. Infection: Despite appropriate"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], presents with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found to have elevated pancreatic enzymes and LFTs,
   intubated for increased work of breathing, with hypotension, worsening
   renal function, and elevated cardiac enzymes overnight.
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated in setting of respiratory distress,
   also given need for aggressive IVF resuscitation. Did not tolerated
   several attempts at trials of AC, with PIP that were very high (>50),
   however this morning respiratory team was able to switch him over to
   AC. In setting of IVFs, needed to increase oxygen to 100% FiO2 from 70%
   to maintain oxygenation. Given that his acidosis is worsening
   (metabolic), would ideally like to go up on rate to help compensate
   further; this may require additional sedation and possibly a trial of
   paralytics. Increased abdominal pressure also is likely leading to
   higher pleural pressures, so additional data would be helpful.
   ARDS net protocol for ARDS
   - Will place esophageal balloon to obtain data on pleural pressures,
   plateau pressures
   - Trending ABGs, CXR w/volume overload but no ARDS (will be mindful of
   potential of developing ARDS given severe pancreatitis)
   - Patient received levofloxacin for question of consolidation (versus
   atelectasis versus asp PNA) on CXR at OSH, also may have had
   aspiration, so will follow daily CXR
   - Will paralyze patient and see if able to better ventilate to improve
   oxygenation, BP, and pH
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFTs and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Currently appears that patient has SIRS related
   to his pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for
   hypoxia, had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.
   Greatly appreciate surgery and ERCP recommendations and assistance.
   - Patient is status-post over 11 liters of IVF
based on discussion with
   ICU and surgical team, will hold on further IVF resuscitation as
   additional IVFs will further compromise respiratory status and have
   potential of significantly worsening abdominal compartment syndrome and
   necessitating laparotomy.
   - F/u final RUQ u/s
   - Per surgery, no need for repeat imaging at this time
   - Hold off on ERCP consulted, given it appears stone has passed
   - Treat w/broad spectrum Abx: Vanc/meropenam/flagyl(day 1=[**11-10**]), given
   acuity of patient
s illness, however no evidence of infection at
   present.
   - Continuing to trend [**Doctor First Name **]/lipase, HCT, WBCs, calcium, lactate (lactate
   currently coming down, calcium stabilized after repleted)
   - CRP pending
   - Triglycerides pending
   - Sedation to fentanyl/versed
   - Appreciate surgical assistance following abdominal for compartment
   syndrome
   - Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia
   ? d/c abx
   # Metabolic acidosis: In setting of ARF, lactate has been stable, was
   slightly rising (2.6) but then trending downward. Also hyperglycemia,
   and was initially resuscitated with normal saline.
   - As noted above, attempting to change to AC and increase rate to help
   optimize pH by blowing off Co2
   - Trend ABGs, lactate, treat hyperglycemia
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to significant third spacing of
   fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well as
   SIRS from his pancreatitis. Do not suspect infection or sepsis, however
   cultures are pending. Also have to consider MI as possibility given EKG
   changes and elevated CK/Troponin. No recent steroid use to suspect
   adrenal insufficiency.
   - Cont neo, holding on further IVFs as noted above given concerns of
   worsening abd compartment syn and pulmonary edema. (CVP had been >14).
   Vasopressin added yesterday given low SBP.
   - Following cardiac enzymes as noted above, cardiac echo cardiogram
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures pending.
   # EKG changes: Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of
   STE in inferior leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**4-21**]. However, TWI
   are new. Initial CK at OSH was elevated, with flat troponin and MB
   fraction negative. Patient does have h/o recent 4vCABG and new TWI are
   in the setting of intravascular hypovolemia, HCT drop. At this time,
   risks outweigh benefits for anticoagulation given concern of
   hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis. Given rising (but not very high)
   troponin levels, and appearance of EKG (although not markedly different
   from [**4-21**]), cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and reviewed EKG and case, felt
   current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE could be
   ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for change
   in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be larger
   priority.
   - Continue to cycle enzymes
   - Serial EKGs
   - Will consider formal cardiology consult after echocardiogram is
   abnormal or should troponin markedly elevated.
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue baby ASA
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated, start esmolol
   gtt
   - Transthoracic echo today.
   # Hyperkalemia: Improved,  in the setting of ARF, responded to IVFs and
   bicarbonate. No EKG changes c/w hyperkalemia.
   - Consider insulin/glucose, kayexalate
   - Follow trend, monitoring on telemetry.
   # ARF: Patient
s creatinine at presentation to OSH was 2.1, has been
   1.7-1.9 here. FENa 0.21% suggestive of pre-renal etiology, likely
   secondary to severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia, as well as
   abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient also received dye with CT at
   OSH. Anticipate given low urine output, borderline hypotension, that
   patient also will have component of ATN.
   ? Renal c/s
   - aggressive IVF hydration
   - urine lytes
   - renally dose meds
   - consider renal consult
   - Mucomist
   # Abdominal distension: Concern is for compartment syndrome in setting
   of elevated bladder pressure, distended abdomen, third spacing of
   fluids. Appreciate surgical assistance.
   - Continuing to monitor pressure, will see if paralytics improve
   bladder pressure. Should pressure rise >40, will need laparotory, which
   will be last resort.
   - Following trend of lactate, no evidence to suggest ischemic bowel or
   obstruction on imaging, no free air on CXR. SMA and aorta were free of
   significant atherosclerosis on CT.
   # Leukocytosis: New WBC to 13.5, differential from [**11-9**] with 7 bands.
   No overwhelming evidence of infection, but has had low grade
   temperatures

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous CABG surgery. He presents with hypotension, bradycardia, epigastric pain, and elevated pancreatic enzymes and liver function tests. The patient has been intubated for respiratory distress and worsening renal function, along with elevated cardiac enzymes.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration. The need for aggressive ventilation and potential paralysis may be necessary to improve oxygenation and blood pressure.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and low urine output. There is a risk of developing or worsening AKI due to factors such as severe third spacing of fluids, relative hypovolemia, abdominal compartment syndrome, and potential acute tubular necrosis.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe acute pancreatitis, likely secondary to gallstones. Complications related to pancreatitis, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), necrosis, infection, or abscess formation, should be closely monitored.

4. Cardiac issues: The patient's history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG surgery, and EKG changes raise concerns about potential cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction or ventricular aneurysm.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and is receiving vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure above 90 mmHg. There are concerns about fluid balance, as the total in is 9,622 mL and the total out is 1,570 mL, resulting in a balance of 8,927 mL.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/57 mmHg to 117/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.28, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, PaO2 of 116 mmHg, and a respiratory system compliance of 72.2 cmH2O/mL. The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose level, lactate, and troponin T, along with decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels.

The assessment and plan section indicates that the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, and has multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line. The patient is also receiving proph"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 year old man who presents with severe pancreatitis c/b by hypoxemic
   respiratory failure, NSTEMI and non-oliguric acute renal failure.
   Abdominal compartment syndrome responsive to conservative management.
   Volume replete and weaning off neo. If unable to come off pressors
   would prefer neo in the setting of decreased contractility and SVR.
   Decrease Vt to 6cc/kg. Will tolerate ph > 7.2. Awaiting final read of
   TTE today but prelim has had a decrease in his EF, still doubt primary
   cardiac event and I suspect this may be a reversible sepsis-associated
   cardiomyopathy. Will DC paralytics today. DDx of ARF is ATN vs contrast
   nepropathy or abdominal compartment syndrome. Metabolic acidosis and
   borderline K, will consult renal today for possible RRT. Continues on
   broad empiric antibiotics for leukocytosis and low grade fever. Will
   f/u cultures. No evidence of pancreatic necrosis on CT. Surgery
   following, pancreatic enzymes trending down, on TPN. Further plans as
   per resident note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with severe pancreatitis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and non-oliguric acute renal failure. He presented with hypotension and has been in the ICU. The patient's condition has been complicated by abdominal compartment syndrome and persistent hypoxemia. He has been on various medications including vasopressin, phenylephrine, midazolam, cisatracurium, insulin, and fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal compartment syndrome: This is a condition characterized by increased pressure within the abdomen, which can compromise organ function and blood flow. The patient's slightly distended and firm abdomen suggests the presence of abdominal compartment syndrome.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure indicates difficulty in oxygenating the blood. The crackles and rhonchi heard on chest examination may indicate pulmonary edema or pneumonia.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and low urine output suggest acute renal failure. The differential diagnosis includes acute tubular necrosis (ATN), contrast nephropathy, or abdominal compartment syndrome as potential causes.

4. Cardiomyopathy: The decrease in ejection fraction (EF) seen on the preliminary read of the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) raises concern for a primary cardiac event or sepsis-associated cardiomyopathy. Further"

   would decrease Vt to 6cc/kg. Tolerate ph > 7.2. Awaiting final read of
   TTE today but prelim has had a decrease in his EF, still doubt primary
   cardiac event. Will DC paralytics today. DDx of ARF is ATN vs
   contrast nepropathy or abdominal compartment syndrome. Metabolic
   acidosis and borderline K, will consult renal today for possible RRT.
   Continues on broad empiric antibiotics for leukocytosis and
   low grade fever. Will f/u culutres. No evidence of pancreatic necrosis
   on CT. Surgery following, pancreatic enzymes trending down, on TPN.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old man who presented with hypotension, pancreatitis, acute renal failure (ARF), and possible inferior myocardial infarction (IMI). He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with abdominal compartment syndrome and persistent hypoxemia. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/62 mmHg to 117/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He is on multiple medications including vasopressin, phenylephrine, midazolam, cisatracurium, insulin, and fentanyl.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The imaging shows bibasilar airspace opacity.

The assessment and plan for the patient include severe pancreatitis possibly caused by hypoxemic respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and non-oliguric ARF. The abdominal compartment syndrome has responded to conservative management. The patient is volume replete and being weaned off neo. If unable to come off pressors, neo will be preferred in the setting of decreased contractility and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The tidal volume (Vt) will be decreased to 6cc/kg, and"

   Imaging:
   [**11-11**] Transthoracic Echocardiogram:
   The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
   right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
   contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic
   root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is probably normal, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well
   seen but appears dilated and hypokinetic. No pathologic valvular
   abnormality seen. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-4-19**], LVH is now
   seen. The right ventricle appears dilated and hypokinetic on the
   current study. Aortic dimensions and other findings are similar.
   [**11-12**] Chest X-ray: Final read pending
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], presents with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found to have elevated pancreatic enzymes and LFTs,
   with ARDS and persistent pressor requirement, but improved abdominal
   pressures after paralyzed.
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   Intubated in setting of respiratory distress, also given need for
   aggressive IVF resuscitation. Patient was on paralytics for about 24
   hours to facilitate tolerance of AC mode and lessen resistance.
   Currently he now meets ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and
   possible aspiration. Overnight with desaturation while bathing, but now
   Fi02 back down to 80%, have successfully weaned TV
s to 550 with
   improved pH.
   - Will continue current settings, weaning FiO2 if possible, using lower
   tidal volumes to reach lower volumes closer to ARDS net protocol (rate
   and tidal volumes were increased to rise minute ventilation to help
   with metabolic acidosis)
   - Continue antibiotics as noted below.
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl and versed.
   .
   #  Metabolic acidosis: Improving as renal function improves and
   ventilatory settings optimized. Suspect this was mainly secondary to
   acute renal failure.
   - Appreciate renal assistance, now appears that renal function
   improving and his acidosis will hopefully continue to improve as well.
   Bicarbonate drip will be consideration should acidosis worsen.
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFTs and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Currently appears that patient has SIRS related
   to his pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for
   hypoxia, had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.
   Greatly appreciate surgery and ERCP recommendations and assistance.
   Abdominal exam overall unchanged today.
   - Patient is status-post > 11 liters of IVF
based on discussion with
   ICU and surgical team, will hold on further IVF resuscitation as
   additional IVFs will further compromise respiratory status and have
   potential of significantly worsening abdominal compartment syndrome and
   necessitating laparotomy.
   - Per surgery, no need for repeat imaging at this time
   - Hold off on ERCP consulted, given it appears stone has passed, given
   LFTs and pancreatitic enzymes improving, no role at present, but will
   have low threshold to consider should status worsen
   - Treat w/broad spectrum Abx: Vanc/meropenam/flagyl(day 1=[**11-10**]), given
   acuity of patient
s illness, however no evidence of infection at
   present (no necrosis seen on CT)
   - Continuing to trend [**Doctor First Name **]/lipase, HCT, WBCs, calcium, lactate (lactate
   currently coming down, calcium stabilized after repleted)
   - Triglycerides pending
   - Sedation to fentanyl/versed
   - Appreciate surgical assistance following abdominal for compartment
   syndrome, and now in setting of fevers.
   - Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to significant third spacing of
   fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well as
   SIRS from his pancreatitis. Do not suspect infection or sepsis, however
   cultures are pending. Also have to consider MI as possibility given EKG
   changes and elevated CK/Troponin (but more likely cardiac enzyme leak
   from stress in setting of SIRS and hypotension, no EKG changes). No
   recent steroid use to suspect adrenal insufficiency.
   - Cont neo, holding on further IVFs as noted above given concerns of
   worsening abd compartment syn and pulmonary edema. (CVP had been >14).
   Vasopressin added yesterday given low SBP.
   - Following cardiac enzymes as noted above, cardiac echocardiogram
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures pending.
   - Weaning pressors as tolerated (does of neo has lessened)
   # EKG changes, history of CAD: Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2,
   with <1 mm of STE in inferior leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**4-21**].
   Initial CK at OSH was elevated, with flat troponin and MB fraction
   negative. Patient does have h/o recent 4vCABG in 6/[**2181**]. At this time,
   risks continue to outweigh benefits for anticoagulation given concern
   of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis. Given rising troponin levels,

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous CABG surgery. He presents with hypotension, bradycardia, epigastric pain, elevated pancreatic enzymes, and liver function tests (LFTs), indicating acute pancreatitis. The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure, specifically hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS. He is on aggressive IV fluid resuscitation and pressors.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient meets ARDS criteria, and his FiO2 is being weaned as tolerated.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: Improving with renal function improvement and optimized ventilatory settings. Bicarbonate drip may be considered if acidosis worsens.
3. Pancreatitis: Severe acute pancreatitis, most likely due to gallstones seen on CT. No history of alcohol use or elevated triglycerides.
4. Hypotension: Secondary to significant third spacing of fluids in the abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia. SIRS from pancreatitis is also a possibility.

   Imaging:
   [**11-11**] Transthoracic Echocardiogram:
   The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
   right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
   contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic
   root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is probably normal, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well
   seen but appears dilated and hypokinetic. No pathologic valvular
   abnormality seen. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-4-19**], LVH is now
   seen. The right ventricle appears dilated and hypokinetic on the
   current study. Aortic dimensions and other findings are similar.
   [**11-12**] Chest X-ray: Final read pending
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], presents with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found to have elevated pancreatic enzymes and LFTs,
   with ARDS and persistent pressor requirement, but improved abdominal
   pressures after paralyzed.
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   Intubated in setting of respiratory distress, also given need for
   aggressive IVF resuscitation. Patient was on paralytics for about 24
   hours to facilitate tolerance of AC mode and lessen resistance.
   Currently he now meets ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and
   possible aspiration. Overnight with desaturation while bathing, but now
   Fi02 back down to 80%, have successfully weaned TV
s to 550 with
   improved pH.
   - Will continue current settings, weaning FiO2 if possible, using lower
   tidal volumes to reach lower volumes closer to ARDS net protocol (rate
   and tidal volumes were increased to rise minute ventilation to help
   with metabolic acidosis)
   - Continue antibiotics as noted below.
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl and versed.
   .
   #  Metabolic acidosis: Improving as renal function improves and
   ventilatory settings optimized. Suspect this was mainly secondary to
   acute renal failure.
   - Appreciate renal assistance, now appears that renal function
   improving and his acidosis will hopefully continue to improve as well.
   Bicarbonate drip will be consideration should acidosis worsen.
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFTs and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Currently appears that patient has SIRS related
   to his pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for
   hypoxia, had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.
   Greatly appreciate surgery and ERCP recommendations and assistance.
   Abdominal exam overall unchanged today.
   - Patient is status-post > 11 liters of IVF
based on discussion with
   ICU and surgical team, will hold on further IVF resuscitation as
   additional IVFs will further compromise respiratory status and have
   potential of significantly worsening abdominal compartment syndrome and
   necessitating laparotomy.
   - Per surgery, no need for repeat imaging at this time
   - Hold off on ERCP consulted, given it appears stone has passed, given
   LFTs and pancreatitic enzymes improving, no role at present, but will
   have low threshold to consider should status worsen
   - Treat w/broad spectrum Abx: Vanc/meropenam/flagyl(day 1=[**11-10**]), given
   acuity of patient
s illness, however no evidence of infection at
   present (no necrosis seen on CT)
   - Continuing to trend [**Doctor First Name **]/lipase, HCT, WBCs, calcium, lactate (lactate
   currently coming down, calcium stabilized after repleted)
   - Triglycerides pending
   - Sedation to fentanyl/versed
   - Appreciate surgical assistance following abdominal for compartment
   syndrome, and now in setting of fevers.
   - Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to significant third spacing of
   fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well as
   SIRS from his pancreatitis. Do not suspect infection or sepsis, however
   cultures are pending. Also have to consider MI as possibility given EKG
   changes and elevated CK/Troponin (but more likely cardiac enzyme leak
   from stress in setting of SIRS and hypotension, no EKG changes). No
   recent steroid use to suspect adrenal insufficiency.
   - Cont neo, holding on further IVFs as noted above given concerns of
   worsening abd compartment syn and pulmonary edema. (CVP had been >14).
   Vasopressin added yesterday given low SBP.
   - Following cardiac enzymes as noted above, cardiac echocardiogram
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures pending.
   - Weaning pressors as tolerated (does of neo has lessened)
   # EKG changes, history of CAD: Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2,
   with <1 mm of STE in inferior leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**4-21**].
   Initial CK at OSH was elevated, with flat troponin and MB fraction
   negative. Patient does have h/o recent 4vCABG in 6/[**2181**]. At this time,
   risks continue to outweigh benefits for anticoagulation given concern
   of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis. Given rising troponin levels,
   and appearance of EKG (although not markedly different from [**4-21**]),
   cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and reviewed EKG and case, felt current EKG
   was not significantly different from old, STE could be ventricular
   aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for change in
   management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be larger
   priority.
   - Continue to cycle enzymes (will likely remain elevated in setting of
   his renal failure as will be slow to clear)
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA (PR while NG tube is to suction)
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated once off
   pressors, start esmolol gtt
   - Transthoracic echo today as noted above, suspect depressed function
   noted could be in setting of SIRS
   # ARF: Marked improvement to 1.9 today. Suspected ATN secondary to
   severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing hypotension, also
   with possible component of abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient also
   received dye with CT at OSH so contrast nephropathy also a possibility.
   Urine output has picked up today with 100-150 today (as opposed to
   10-20 cc/hr initially)
   - Hopefull that he will be able to avoid dialysis given what appears to
   be post-ATN diuresis, but obtained renal consult to help manage him in
   event that his volume status, hyperkalemia, and/or acidosis become
   difficult to manage. Appreciate assistance.
   - Supportive care as noted above, continuing to treat hyperkalemia (on
   insulin gtt), acidosis, monitoring urine output (no phos in TPN)
   # Abdominal distension: Concern was for compartment syndrome in setting
   of elevated bladder pressure, distended abdomen, third spacing of
   fluids. Appreciate surgical assistance. Bladder pressures are currently
   in teens now.
   - Following trend of lactate, no evidence to suggest ischemic bowel or
   obstruction on imaging, no free air on CXR. SMA and aorta were free of
   significant atherosclerosis on CT.
   # Leukocytosis: New WBC to 13.5, differential from [**11-9**] with 7 bands.
   No overwhelming evidence of infection, but has had low grade
   temperatures. Must consider infection of necrotic pancreas, but no
   intervention at this time given he is already on appropriate antibiotic
   coverage and has only had low grade temperatures, and pressor
   requirement is lessening.
   -          F/u final CXR read
   -          F/u cx data
   -          Cont antibiotics as noted above.

   Imaging:
   [**11-11**] Transthoracic Echocardiogram:
   The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
   right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
   contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic
   root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is probably normal, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well
   seen but appears dilated and hypokinetic. No pathologic valvular
   abnormality seen. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-4-19**], LVH is now
   seen. The right ventricle appears dilated and hypokinetic on the
   current study. Aortic dimensions and other findings are similar.
   [**11-12**] Chest X-ray: Final read pending
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], presents with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found severe pancreatitis with ARDS and persistent
   pressor requirement, with improved respiratory status, acidosis, and
   renal function today.
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   Intubated in setting of respiratory distress, also given need for
   aggressive IVF resuscitation. Patient was on paralytics for about 24
   hours to facilitate tolerance of AC mode and lessen resistance.
   Currently he now meets ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and
   possible aspiration. Overnight with desaturation while bathing, but now
   Fi02 back down to 80%, have successfully weaned TV
s to 550 with
   improved pH. Suspect that in setting of RV dysfunction noted on
   transthoracic echo (likely from ARDS and positive-pressure ventilation,
   and catecholamines from ARDS/pancreatitis), any movement will decrease
   pre-load/venous return leading to hypotension with preferential
   vasocontrction and resultant transient hypoxia.
   - Continue to decrease TV to meet ARDS net goal of 6 cc/kg (height is
   5
 per wife), around 450 cc, will increase respiratory rate as
   needed should pH worsen, goal pH >7.20
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated for goal pO2 >60
   - Continue vancomycin and meropenem for empiric coverage, will consider
   additional of 2^nd [**Doctor Last Name **] to cover gram negative rods in sputum. If c.
   difficile negative, will stop flagyl as it provides redundant coverage
   (already on meropenem)
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl and versed.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Much improved overnight as renal function
   improves and ventilatory settings optimized. Suspect this was mainly
   secondary to acute renal failure.
   - Appreciate renal assistance, now appears that renal function
   improving and his acidosis will hopefully continue to improve as well.
   Bicarbonate drip will be consideration should acidosis worsen.
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Currently appears that patient has SIRS related
   to his pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for
   hypoxia, had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.
   Greatly appreciate surgery and ERCP recommendations and assistance. No
   change in abdominal examination.
   - Patient is status-post > 11 liters of IVF
had held off on further
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension given concerns about oxygenation
   and worsening of abdominal compartment syndrome in setting of poor
   urine output. Given that his bladder pressure is now 9 and he has
   significant (likely post-ATN) auto-diuresis, will aim to wean pressors
   and bolus with fluids as long as respiratory status is stable.
   - Per surgery, no need for repeat imaging at this time, as this would
   have risk of further dye exposure in setting of resolving ARF, and
   already on appropriate antibiotics (and HD stable, so surgical
   intervention not desired)
   - ERCP team aware of patients.
   - Treat w/broad spectrum Abx: Vanc/meropenam/flagyl(day 1=[**11-10**]), given
   persistent fevers to 102, will continue antibiotics, but will stop
   flagyl if c. difficile negative. If continues to [**Last Name (LF) 1694**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] consider
   additional double gram negative coverage.
   - Continuing to trend [**Doctor First Name **]/lipase, HCT, WBCs, calcium, (lactate has been
   normal)
   - Triglycerides were within normal limits
   - Sedation to fentanyl/versed
   - Appreciate surgical assistance.
   - Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia
   # Hypotension: Decreasing pressor requirement is encouraging.
   Hypotension with movement as noted above likely secondary to decreased
   venous return and forward flow with movement. Overall hypotension most
   likely secondary to significant third spacing of fluids in abdomen from
   pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well as SIRS from his
   pancreatitis. No new clear wall motion abnormalities on transthoracic
   echocardiogram. Also in setting of post-ATN diuresis and new diarrhea
   and fevers with insensible losses. Do not suspect sepsis from infection
   as pressor need decreasing.
   - Cont neo (did not tolerate trial of levophed which caused
   tachycardia), wean as tolerated. If oxygenation is stable with new vent
   settings, will aim to further wean pressors and bolus instead given
   that CVP is down and patient has had significant diuresis and losses as
   noted above.
   - Following cardiac enzymes as noted above (just for purposes of noting
   peak)
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures pending, as noted above.
   # EKG changes, history of CAD: Do not suspect new ischemic event, but
   instead some low levels of demand ischemia secondary to hypotension and
   stress of infection/SIRS/pancreatitis with circulating catecholamies.
   Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of STE in inferior
   leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**4-21**]. Patient does have h/o recent
   4vCABG in 6/[**2181**]. At this time, risks continue to outweigh benefits for
   anticoagulation given concern of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis.
   Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] morning after admission and reviewed EKG and
   case, felt current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE
   could be ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for
   change in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be
   larger priority.
   Will continue to trend enzymes, which remain difficult to interpret in
   setting of renal insufficiency.  Do not suspect ARDS, and not a
   candidate for other interventions or management at present.
   - Continue to cycle enzymes (will likely remain elevated in setting of
   his renal failure as will be slow to clear)
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA (PR if possible, currently with diarrhea, while NG tube
   is to suction)
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated once off
   pressors, start esmolol gtt
   - Transthoracic echo today as noted above, suspect depressed RV
   function noted could be in setting of ARDS
   # ARF: Marked improvement to 1.9 today. Suspected ATN secondary to
   severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing hypotension, also
   with possible component of abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient also
   received dye with CT at OSH so contrast nephropathy also a possibility.
   Urine output has picked up today with 90cc/hr today (as opposed to
   10-20 cc/hr initially)
   - Hopefull that he will be able to avoid dialysis given what appears to
   be post-ATN diuresis, but obtained renal consult to help manage him in
   event that his volume status, hyperkalemia, and/or acidosis become
   difficult to manage. Appreciate assistance.
   - Supportive care as noted above, continuing to treat hyperkalemia (on
   insulin gtt), acidosis, monitoring urine output (no phos in TPN)
   # Abdominal distension: Much improved, bladder pressure now 9.
   # Leukocytosis: Stable WBC to 13.5 today. Diarrhea overnight. Continues
   to have temperatures, overnight to 102. Must consider infection of
   necrotic pancreas, but no intervention at this time given he is already
   on appropriate antibiotic coverage and has only had low grade
   temperatures, and pressor requirement is lessening, and no necrosis
   seen on CT of abdomen.
   -          Follow up on culture data, added 2nd [**Doctor Last Name **] for gram
   negatives if continues to [**Doctor Last Name 1694**] based on respiratory culture
   -          Cont antibiotics as noted above, will stop flagyl if c.
   difficile toxin negative.
   -          Hold on repeat imaging of abd (would need contrast to fully
   evaluate), but if status dramatically worsens, would consider CT guided
   biopsy of pancreatis
   -          Appreciate surgical assistance.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with hypotension, bradycardia, and epigastric pain. He was found to have severe pancreatitis with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and persistent pressor requirement. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His respiratory status has improved with FiO2 weaning down to 80% and tidal volume reduction to 550 mL. The patient also has a history of gallstone pancreatitis and has undergone ERCP. He has persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and diarrhea. His renal function is improving, and he is producing urine. The patient's blood cultures show no growth, while sputum culture shows sparse growth of gram-negative rods. The echocardiogram shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and depressed right ventricular contractility. There is no evidence of pericardial effusion or valvular abnormality. The patient's acid-base status has improved, and his lactate levels are normal. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infection. The patient's condition remains stable, and he is expected to continue receiving ICU level of care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS and is on mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator will be crucial to prevent further respiratory complications.
2. Infection: The patient has persistent"

   The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
   right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
   contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic
   root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is probably normal, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well
   seen but appears dilated and hypokinetic. No pathologic valvular
   abnormality seen. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-4-19**], LVH is now
   seen. The right ventricle appears dilated and hypokinetic on the

   Disposition:
","The patient's condition remains critical. The patient started on levophed after neo weaned, but became tachycardic, so went back to neosynephrine, at which point HR improved to 100. The patient's echo result did not show depressed EF but poor quality. Renal saw and recommended bicarb drip for acidosis if needed, but I held given pH 7.28. No HD currently. The patient's ET tube pulled back, and they spiked a fever to 102. Cultured. Abdomen stable. Surgery aware. The patient is trying to wean tidal volume on ventilator. Had to go up on FiO2 to 100% around 3am after desaturation with bathing. 

Infusions include vasopressin at 2.4 units/hour, insulin at 5 units/hour, phenylephrine at 2 mcg/Kg/min, midazolam (Versed) at 10 mg/hour, and fentanyl at 250 mcg/hour. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) started on 11/11 at 08:00 AM, heparin sodium (prophylaxis) started on 11/12 at 01:00 AM, and others listed below.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tmax: 38.9 C (102 F), Tcurrent: 38.3 C (101 F), HR: 92 bpm (86-117 bpm), BP: 108/69 mmHg (83/58-115/75 mmHg), RR: 28 inspirations per minute (16-29 inspirations per minute), SpO2: 92%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's flowsheet data includes hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and others. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 46, HCO3- of 81 mEq/L, and base excess of -3 mEq/L. The patient's blood cultures were drawn on 11/9, 11/10, 11/11, and 11/12. The patient's urine culture showed no growth. The sputum culture showed sparse growth of gram-negative rods. 

The patient's imaging includes a transthoracic echocardiogram that showed a left atrium that is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypotension (not shock), renal failure, acute respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, pancreatitis, acute myocardial infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with severe pancreatitis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 89/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 28, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 12 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 80%, and plateau pressure at 25 cmH2O.

The patient has several medical interventions, including vasopressin infusion at 2.4 units/hour, phenylephrine infusion at 2 mcg/kg/min, midazolam (versed) infusion at 10 mg/hour, and fentanyl infusion at 250 mcg/hour. The patient is also receiving pantoprazole (protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other medications as per the treatment plan.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.5 K/uL, slightly decreased hematocrit (Hct) of 36.5, normal platelet count (Plt) of 150 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 3.1, and elevated troponin T of 0.94. Other lab values such as blood glucose, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), electrolytes (Na+/K+/Cl-), and kidney function tests are within normal limits.

Imaging studies reveal a dilated left atrium (LA) and right ventricular (RV) dilation with depressed systolic function on trans-thoracic echo. There are no significant valvular abnormalities noted.

The patient's assessment includes severe pancreatitis, MODS, renal function improvement, fever, and concern for progressive pancreatitis, necrosis, and infection. The plan is to continue vancomycin, flagyl, and re-evaluate the need for flagyl pending Clostridium difficile assay. Further plans will be determined based on the resident's note.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated WBC count raise concerns for infection, especially considering his severe pancreatitis and MODS. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with low oxygen saturation and high plateau pressures indicating potential lung injury. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite vasopressor support, indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability. Frequent monitoring of blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 year old man with PMH as above who presents with severe pancreatitis
   and MODS. Renal function improving. Febrile yesterday raising concern
   for progressive pancreatititis, necrosis and infection. CT with
   contrast is problem[**Name (NI) 1114**] given Cr and doubt CT would result in a
   diagnosis that would alter management. GNR in sputum are also a
   potential explanation for fever. Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) 430**]/flagyl for now.
   Could DC flagyl pending c. diff assay. Echo yesterday with  worsening
   right sided function, not unexpected given respiratory failure and
   sepsis. Trend troponin but doubt primary cardiac event. Further plans
   as per resident note.  Decrease Vt to 6cc/Kg. Wean fi02 for pa02 > 60.
   When Fi02 < 0.5 can wean PEEP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with severe pancreatitis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing hypotension. The patient has shown signs of infection, including fever and positive cultures for gram-negative rods (GNR) in the sputum and urine. He has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and metronidazole. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure, high heart rate, and low oxygen saturation. He is sedated and intubated on mechanical ventilation with PRVC/AC mode. The respiratory support parameters indicate a high peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and plateau pressure (Plateau). The patient has pitting edema in his extremities. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels, along with low platelet count and albumin. Imaging reveals dilated left atrium and right ventricular dilation with depressed systolic function, but no significant valvular abnormality. The patient's renal function is improving. The assessment is that the patient has severe pancreatitis, MODS, and possible infection. The plan includes continuing current antibiotics, weaning FiO2 when PaO2 is greater than 60, decreasing tidal volume to 6cc/kg, and further plans as per resident note. ICU care includes nutrition through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), glycemic control"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], presents with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found severe pancreatitis with ARDS and persistent
   pressor requirement, with improved respiratory status,  and renal
   function today, able to come off pressors.
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   Intubated in setting of respiratory distress, also given need for
   aggressive IVF resuscitation. Patient was on paralytics for about 24
   hours to facilitate tolerance of AC mode and lessen resistance.
   Currently he now meets ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and
   possible aspiration.. Suspect that in setting of RV dysfunction noted
   on transthoracic echo (likely from ARDS and positive-pressure
   ventilation, and catecholamines from ARDS/pancreatitis), any movement
   will decrease pre-load/venous return leading to hypotension with
   preferential vasocontrction and resultant transient hypoxia.
   - At goal 6cc/kg ARDSnet ventilation protocol, continue current TV and
   rate settings, will aim to wean FiO2 down to 40%, then consider weaning
   down PEEP.
   - Later today, if off pressors for >12 hrs and stable, will diuresis
   down to CVP <5 to help fluid status
   - Continue vancomycin and meropenem, adding 2^nd [**Doctor Last Name **] to cover gram
   negative rods for question of possible VAP or resistance organisms
   (stopped flagyl as  c. difficile negative)
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl and versed
did not tolerate attempts
   to wean sedation overnight as was overbreathing vent and appeared
   uncomfortable.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Much improved overnight as renal function
   improves and ventilatory settings optimized. Suspect this was mainly
   secondary to acute renal failure.
   - Appreciate renal assistance, now appears that renal function
   improving and his acidosis will hopefully continue to improve as well.
   Bicarbonate drip will be consideration should acidosis worsen.
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Currently appears that patient has SIRS related
   to his pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for
   hypoxia, had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.
   Greatly appreciate surgery and ERCP recommendations and assistance. No

   - Patient is status-post > 11 liters of IVF
had held off on further
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension given concerns about oxygenation
   and worsening of abdominal compartment syndrome in setting of poor
   urine output. Given that his bladder pressure remains relatively low
   (11, as compared to 30
s) and he has significant (likely post-ATN)
   auto-diuresis, will aim to wean pressors and bolus with fluids as long
   as respiratory status is stable.
   - Per surgery, no need for repeat imaging at this time, as this would
   have risk of further dye exposure in setting of resolving ARF, and
   already on appropriate antibiotics (and HD stable, so surgical
   intervention not desired)
   - ERCP team aware of patients.

   - Sedation to fentanyl/versed
   - Appreciate surgical assistance.
   - Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia
   # Hypotension: Now off pressors! Hypotension with movement as noted
   above likely secondary to decreased venous return and forward flow with
   movement. Overall hypotension most likely secondary to significant
   third spacing of fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to
   hypovolemia, as well as SIRS from his pancreatitis. No new clear wall
   motion abnormalities on transthoracic echocardiogram. Also in setting
   of post-ATN diuresis and new diarrhea and fevers with insensible
   losses. Do not suspect sepsis from infection as pressor need
   decreasing.
   - Will bolus with IVF if needed in lieu of re-starting pressors.
   - Cardiac enzymes have peaked, no need to continue following unless
   suspect new event
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures pending, as noted above.
   # EKG changes, history of CAD: Do not suspect new ischemic event, but
   instead some low levels of demand ischemia secondary to hypotension and
   stress of infection/SIRS/pancreatitis with circulating catecholamies.
   Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of STE in inferior
   leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**4-21**]. Patient does have h/o recent
   4vCABG in 6/[**2181**]. At this time, risks continue to outweigh benefits for
   anticoagulation given concern of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis.
   Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] morning after admission and reviewed EKG and
   case, felt current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE
   could be ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for
   change in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be
   larger priority.
   - CE trending downward
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA (PR if possible, currently with diarrhea, while NG tube
   is to suction)
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated once off
   pressors, start esmolol gtt
   - Transthoracic echo today as noted above, suspect depressed RV
   function noted could be in setting of ARDS
   # ARF: Marked improvement to 1.6 today. Suspected ATN secondary to
   severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing hypotension, also
   with possible component of abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient also
   received dye with CT at OSH so contrast nephropathy also a possibility.
   Urine output has picked up today, as opposed to 10-20 cc/hr initially.
   # Leukocytosis: Improved WBC today and decreasing fever curve. Diarrhea
   two nights ago. Must consider infection of necrotic pancreas, but no
   intervention at this time given he is already on appropriate antibiotic
   coverage and has only had low grade temperatures, and pressor
   requirement is lessening, and no necrosis seen on CT of abdomen.
   -          Follow up on culture data, added 2nd [**Doctor Last Name **] for gram
   negatives given GNRs in sputum and fevers
   -          Cont antibiotics as noted above, stopped flagyl if c.
   difficile toxin negative.
   -          Hold on repeat imaging of abd (would need contrast to fully

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], presents with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found severe pancreatitis with ARDS and persistent
   pressor requirement, with improved respiratory status, acidosis, and
   renal function today.
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   Intubated in setting of respiratory distress, also given need for
   aggressive IVF resuscitation. Patient was on paralytics for about 24
   hours to facilitate tolerance of AC mode and lessen resistance.
   Currently he now meets ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and
   possible aspiration. Overnight with desaturation while bathing, but now
   Fi02 back down to 80%, have successfully weaned TV
s to 550 with
   improved pH. Suspect that in setting of RV dysfunction noted on
   transthoracic echo (likely from ARDS and positive-pressure ventilation,
   and catecholamines from ARDS/pancreatitis), any movement will decrease
   pre-load/venous return leading to hypotension with preferential
   vasocontrction and resultant transient hypoxia.
   - Continue to decrease TV to meet ARDS net goal of 6 cc/kg (height is
   5
 per wife), around 450 cc, will increase respiratory rate as
   needed should pH worsen, goal pH >7.20
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated for goal pO2 >60
   - Continue vancomycin and meropenem for empiric coverage, will consider
   additional of 2^nd [**Doctor Last Name **] to cover gram negative rods in sputum. If c.
   difficile negative, will stop flagyl as it provides redundant coverage
   (already on meropenem)
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl and versed.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Much improved overnight as renal function
   improves and ventilatory settings optimized. Suspect this was mainly
   secondary to acute renal failure.
   - Appreciate renal assistance, now appears that renal function
   improving and his acidosis will hopefully continue to improve as well.
   Bicarbonate drip will be consideration should acidosis worsen.
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Currently appears that patient has SIRS related
   to his pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for
   hypoxia, had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.
   Greatly appreciate surgery and ERCP recommendations and assistance. No
   change in abdominal examination.
   - Patient is status-post > 11 liters of IVF
had held off on further
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension given concerns about oxygenation
   and worsening of abdominal compartment syndrome in setting of poor
   urine output. Given that his bladder pressure is now 9 and he has
   significant (likely post-ATN) auto-diuresis, will aim to wean pressors
   and bolus with fluids as long as respiratory status is stable.
   - Per surgery, no need for repeat imaging at this time, as this would
   have risk of further dye exposure in setting of resolving ARF, and
   already on appropriate antibiotics (and HD stable, so surgical
   intervention not desired)
   - ERCP team aware of patients.
   - Treat w/broad spectrum Abx: Vanc/meropenam/flagyl(day 1=[**11-10**]), given
   persistent fevers to 102, will continue antibiotics, but will stop
   flagyl if c. difficile negative. If continues to [**Last Name (LF) 1694**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] consider
   additional double gram negative coverage.
   - Continuing to trend [**Doctor First Name **]/lipase, HCT, WBCs, calcium, (lactate has been
   normal)
   - Triglycerides were within normal limits
   - Sedation to fentanyl/versed
   - Appreciate surgical assistance.
   - Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia
   # Hypotension: Decreasing pressor requirement is encouraging.
   Hypotension with movement as noted above likely secondary to decreased
   venous return and forward flow with movement. Overall hypotension most
   likely secondary to significant third spacing of fluids in abdomen from
   pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well as SIRS from his
   pancreatitis. No new clear wall motion abnormalities on transthoracic
   echocardiogram. Also in setting of post-ATN diuresis and new diarrhea
   and fevers with insensible losses. Do not suspect sepsis from infection
   as pressor need decreasing.
   - Cont neo (did not tolerate trial of levophed which caused
   tachycardia), wean as tolerated. If oxygenation is stable with new vent
   settings, will aim to further wean pressors and bolus instead given
   that CVP is down and patient has had significant diuresis and losses as
   noted above.
   - Following cardiac enzymes as noted above (just for purposes of noting
   peak)
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures pending, as noted above.
   # EKG changes, history of CAD: Do not suspect new ischemic event, but
   instead some low levels of demand ischemia secondary to hypotension and
   stress of infection/SIRS/pancreatitis with circulating catecholamies.
   Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of STE in inferior
   leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**4-21**]. Patient does have h/o recent
   4vCABG in 6/[**2181**]. At this time, risks continue to outweigh benefits for
   anticoagulation given concern of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis.
   Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] morning after admission and reviewed EKG and
   case, felt current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE
   could be ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for
   change in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be
   larger priority.
   Will continue to trend enzymes, which remain difficult to interpret in
   setting of renal insufficiency.  Do not suspect ARDS, and not a
   candidate for other interventions or management at present.
   - Continue to cycle enzymes (will likely remain elevated in setting of
   his renal failure as will be slow to clear)
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA (PR if possible, currently with diarrhea, while NG tube
   is to suction)
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated once off
   pressors, start esmolol gtt
   - Transthoracic echo today as noted above, suspect depressed RV
   function noted could be in setting of ARDS
   # ARF: Marked improvement to 1.9 today. Suspected ATN secondary to
   severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing hypotension, also
   with possible component of abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient also
   received dye with CT at OSH so contrast nephropathy also a possibility.
   Urine output has picked up today with 90cc/hr today (as opposed to
   10-20 cc/hr initially)
   - Hopefull that he will be able to avoid dialysis given what appears to
   be post-ATN diuresis, but obtained renal consult to help manage him in
   event that his volume status, hyperkalemia, and/or acidosis become
   difficult to manage. Appreciate assistance.
   - Supportive care as noted above, continuing to treat hyperkalemia (on
   insulin gtt), acidosis, monitoring urine output (no phos in TPN)
   # Abdominal distension: Much improved, bladder pressure now 9.
   # Leukocytosis: Stable WBC to 13.5 today. Diarrhea overnight. Continues
   to have temperatures, overnight to 102. Must consider infection of
   necrotic pancreas, but no intervention at this time given he is already
   on appropriate antibiotic coverage and has only had low grade
   temperatures, and pressor requirement is lessening, and no necrosis
   seen on CT of abdomen.
   -          Follow up on culture data, added 2nd [**Doctor Last Name **] for gram
   negatives if continues to [**Doctor Last Name 1694**] based on respiratory culture
   -          Cont antibiotics as noted above, will stop flagyl if c.
   difficile toxin negative.
   -          Hold on repeat imaging of abd (would need contrast to fully
   evaluate), but if status dramatically worsens, would consider CT guided
   biopsy of pancreatis
   -          Appreciate surgical assistance.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. Here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

- The patient's tidal volume has decreased to 450 cc, and their respiratory rate has increased to 32 breaths per minute. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) has been decreased to 60%.
- The patient was weaned off neo (likely referring to neomycin) and received 2 L boluses of lactated Ringer's (LR) solution for a low systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 90 mmHg.
- The patient was previously on Flagyl, but it was stopped after testing negative for Clostridium difficile toxin.
- Ciprofloxacin was added for double gram-negative coverage due to persistent fevers.
- The patient's repeat sodium levels are trending down.
- The patient experienced a spike in fever to 102 degrees Fahrenheit in the afternoon and 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit overnight, with cultures being obtained.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.

- Review of systems: No changes.
- Flowsheet data as of 11/13/2182 07:36 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, physical examination, labs/radiology, and imaging data.
- Labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine, troponin-T within normal range, elevated lipase, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Microbiology data shows C. difficile toxin negative, with all other cultures negative except for sputum culture with gram-negative rods on 11/10.
- Imaging data includes pending chest X-ray.
- Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and comments about family meeting and code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications due to decreased tidal volume and Fi02, which may lead to further respiratory distress or failure.
2. Infection or sepsis due to persistent fevers, despite antibiotic treatment, which could be indicated by the elevated white blood cell count and positive gram-negative rods in the sputum culture.
3. Organ dysfunction or failure, such as acute kidney injury indicated by elevated creatinine and low urine output, or hepatic dysfunction indicated by abnormal liver function tests.
4. Hemodynamic instability indicated by low blood pressure and high vasopressin requirement.
5. Potential complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or delirium."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with severe pancreatitis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently off pressors with normalizing renal function. The patient continues on low tidal volume ventilation and his FiO2 is being weaned as tolerated for PaO2 > 60. When FiO2 < 0.4, PEEP will be weaned. If stable off pressors for 12 hours, diuresis will be attempted. The patient is on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin pending specification of sputum culture. Suspected fever to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) but pancreatic necrosis is also a possibility. Troponin peaked and no longer needs to be followed. Further plans are as per the resident's note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a fever and bibasilar infiltrates on imaging, which raises suspicion for VAP. It is important to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy and maintain proper lung hygiene.
2. Pancreatic necrosis: Given the patient's severe pancreatitis, there is a possibility of pancreatic necrosis. Monitoring for signs of worsening abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and changes in vital signs is crucial.
3. Renal dysfunction: Although the patient's renal function is normalizing, it is important to monitor kidney function closely and adjust fluids and medications accordingly to prevent renal complications.
4. Cardiovascular instability:"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], presents with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found severe pancreatitis with ARDS and persistent
   pressor requirement, with improved respiratory status, and renal
   function today, weaned off of pressors.
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   Intubated in setting of respiratory distress, also given need for
   aggressive IVF resuscitation. Patient was on paralytics for about 24
   hours to facilitate tolerance of AC mode and lessen resistance.
   Currently he now meets ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and
   possible aspiration.. Suspect that in setting of RV dysfunction noted
   on transthoracic echo (likely from ARDS and positive-pressure
   ventilation, and catecholamines from ARDS/pancreatitis), any movement
   will decrease pre-load/venous return leading to hypotension with
   preferential vasocontrction and resultant transient hypoxia.
   - At goal 6cc/kg ARDSnet ventilation protocol, continue current TV and
   rate settings, will aim to wean FiO2 down to 40%, then consider weaning
   down PEEP.
   - Later today, if off pressors for >12 hrs and stable, will diuresis
   down to CVP <5 to help fluid status
   - Continue vancomycin and meropenem, added ciprofloxacin on [**11-12**] to
   extend coverage against gram negative rods for question of possible VAP
   or resistance organisms (stopped flagyl as  c. difficile negative)
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl and versed
did not tolerate attempts
   to wean sedation overnight as was overbreathing vent and appeared
   uncomfortable.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Much improved overnight as renal function
   improves and ventilatory settings optimized. Suspect this was mainly
   secondary to acute renal failure.
   - Appreciate renal assistance, now appears that renal function
   improving and his acidosis will hopefully continue to improve as well.
   Bicarbonate drip will be consideration should acidosis worsen.
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Currently appears that patient has SIRS related
   to his pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for
   hypoxia, had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.
   Greatly appreciate surgery and ERCP recommendations and assistance. No
   change in abdominal examination.
   - Patient is status-post > 11 liters of IVF
had held off on further
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension given concerns about oxygenation
   and worsening of abdominal compartment syndrome in setting of poor
   urine output. Given that his bladder pressure remains relatively low
   (11, as compared to 30
s) and he has significant (likely post-ATN)
   auto-diuresis, will aim to wean pressors and bolus with fluids as long
   as respiratory status is stable.
   - Per surgery, no need for repeat imaging at this time, as this would
   have risk of further dye exposure in setting of resolving ARF, and
   already on appropriate antibiotics (and HD stable, so surgical
   intervention not desired)
   - ERCP team aware of patients.
   - Treat w/broad spectrum Abx: Vanc/meropenam (day 1=[**11-10**]), started
   cipro yesterday.
   - Continuing to trend [**Doctor First Name **]/lipase, HCT, WBCs, calcium, (lactate has been
   normal)
   - Triglycerides were within normal limits
   - Sedation to fentanyl/versed
   - Appreciate surgical assistance.
   - Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia
   # Hypotension: Now off pressors! Hypotension with movement as noted
   above likely secondary to decreased venous return and forward flow with
   movement. Overall hypotension most likely secondary to significant
   third spacing of fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to
   hypovolemia, as well as SIRS from his pancreatitis. No new clear wall
   motion abnormalities on transthoracic echocardiogram. Also in setting
   of post-ATN diuresis and new diarrhea and fevers with insensible
   losses. Do not suspect sepsis from infection as pressor need
   decreasing.
   - Will bolus with IVF if needed in lieu of re-starting pressors.
   - Cardiac enzymes have peaked, no need to continue following unless
   suspect new event
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures pending, as noted above.
   # EKG changes, history of CAD: Do not suspect new ischemic event, but
   instead some low levels of demand ischemia secondary to hypotension and
   stress of infection/SIRS/pancreatitis with circulating catecholamies.
   Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of STE in inferior
   leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**4-21**]. Patient does have h/o recent
   4vCABG in 6/[**2181**]. At this time, risks continue to outweigh benefits for
   anticoagulation given concern of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis.
   Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] morning after admission and reviewed EKG and
   case, felt current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE
   could be ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for
   change in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be
   larger priority.
   - CE trending downward
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA (PR if possible, currently with diarrhea, while NG tube
   is to suction)
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated once off
   pressors, start esmolol gtt
   - Transthoracic echo today as noted above, suspect depressed RV
   function noted could be in setting of ARDS
   # ARF: Marked improvement to 1.6 today. Suspected ATN secondary to
   severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing hypotension, also
   with possible component of abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient also
   received dye with CT at OSH so contrast nephropathy also a possibility.
   Urine output has picked up today, as opposed to 10-20 cc/hr initially.
   # Leukocytosis: Improved WBC today and decreasing fever curve. Diarrhea
   two nights ago. Must consider infection of necrotic pancreas, but no
   intervention at this time given he is already on appropriate antibiotic
   coverage and has only had low grade temperatures, and pressor
   requirement is lessening, and no necrosis seen on CT of abdomen.
   -          Follow up on culture data, added 2nd [**Doctor Last Name **] for gram
   negatives given GNRs in sputum and fevers
   -          Cont antibiotics as noted above, stopped flagyl if c.
   difficile toxin negative.
   -          Hold on repeat imaging of abd (would need contrast to fully
   evaluate), but if status dramatically worsens, would consider CT guided
   biopsy of pancreatis
   -          Appreciate surgical assistance.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status-post CABG, who presented with hypotension, bradycardia, and epigastric pain. He was diagnosed with severe pancreatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and persistent pressor requirement. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His respiratory status has improved, and he has been weaned off the ventilator. He remains on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The patient's renal function has also improved, and he is no longer requiring renal assistance. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of respiratory failure due to his ARDS and possible aspiration. The ARDS is causing severe lung injury, leading to hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's oxygenation status needs to be closely monitored, and appropriate ventilatory support should be provided.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient had metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to acute renal failure. His renal function has improved, and his acidosis should continue to improve as well. However, close monitoring of his acid-base balance is necessary, and bicarbonate drip may be considered if acidosis worsens.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe acute pancreatitis, likely caused by gallstones. This diagnosis is supported by his imaging findings and improvement in liver function tests (LFTs) and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], presents with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found severe pancreatitis with ARDS and persistent
   pressor requirement, with improved respiratory status, and renal
   function today, weaned off of pressors.
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   Intubated in setting of respiratory distress, also given need for
   aggressive IVF resuscitation. Patient was on paralytics for about 24
   hours to facilitate tolerance of AC mode and lessen resistance. He mets
   ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and possible aspiration event
   at home. RV dysfunction also noted on transthoracic echo (likely from
   ARDS and positive-pressure ventilation, and catecholamines from
   ARDS/pancreatitis) which has been likely etiology of transient
   hypotension and hypoxia with movement.
   - He remains at goal 6cc/kg ARDSnet ventilation protocol, continue
   current TV and rate settings, will aim to wean FiO2 down to 40%, then
   work  weaning down PEEP.
   - Continue to diuresis down to CVP <5 to help fluid status, on lasix
   gtt currently with good urine output (was net out 1 L since midnight)
   - Continue vancomycin and meropenem, added ciprofloxacin on [**11-12**] to
   extend coverage against gram negative rods for question of possible VAP
   or resistance organisms (stopped flagyl as  c. difficile negative).
   Will plan to continue all for 7 day course (started [**11-9**], last day
   would be [**2182-11-15**]), pending any further culture data (has not had
   secretions). Will call to have sputum culture further speciated.
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl and versed, lighten up today to
   assess mental status better.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Appeared that patient has SIRS related to his
   pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for hypoxia,
   had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.
   Greatly appreciate surgery and ERCP recommendations and assistance.
   Abdominal examination has improved.
   - Patient is status-post > 11 liters of IVF
initially had held off on
   further fluid resuscitation for hypotension given concerns about
   oxygenation and worsening of abdominal compartment syndrome in setting
   of poor urine output. Given that his bladder pressure remains
   relatively low ([**7-25**]) and he has significant (likely post-ATN)
   auto-diuresis, was able to wean pressors.
   - Per surgery, no need for repeat imaging at this time, as this would
   have risk of further dye exposure in setting of resolving ARF, and
   already on appropriate antibiotics (and HD stable, so surgical
   intervention not desired)
   - ERCP team aware of patients.
   - Treat w/broad spectrum Abx: Vanc/meropenam (day 1=[**11-10**]), cipro
   started [**11-12**], will continue to [**2182-11-15**].
   - Continuing to trend [**Doctor First Name **]/lipase, HCT, WBCs, calcium, (lactate has been
   normal)
   - Triglycerides were within normal limits
   - Sedation to fentanyl/versed
   - Appreciate surgical assistance.
   - Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia
   # Hypotension: Resolved: patient has been off neo and vasopressin since
   AM of [**11-13**]. Hypotension with movement as noted above likely secondary
   to decreased venous return and forward flow with movement. Overall
   hypotension most likely secondary to significant third spacing of
   fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well as
   SIRS from his pancreatitis. No new clear wall motion abnormalities on
   transthoracic echocardiogram. Status post over 14 L of fluid during his
   stay.
   # EKG changes, history of CAD: Do not suspect new ischemic event, but
   instead some low levels of demand ischemia secondary to hypotension and
   stress of infection/SIRS/pancreatitis with circulating catecholamies.
   Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of STE in inferior
   leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**4-21**]. Patient does have h/o recent
   4vCABG in 6/[**2181**]. At this time, risks continue to outweigh benefits for
   anticoagulation given concern of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis.
   Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] morning after admission and reviewed EKG and
   case, felt current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE
   could be ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for
   change in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be
   larger priority.
   - CE trending downward, stopped checking.
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA (PR if possible, currently with diarrhea, while NG tube
   is to suction)
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated once off
   pressors, start esmolol gtt
   - Transthoracic echo today as noted above, suspect depressed RV
   function noted could be in setting of ARDS
   # ARF: Marked improvement to 1.3 today. Suspected ATN secondary to
   severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing hypotension, also
   with possible component of abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient also
   received dye with CT at OSH so contrast nephropathy also a possibility.
   Urine output has remained stable.
   # Leukocytosis: Resolved.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Today patient with sodium 149, again suspect secondary
   to inability to give PO water, insensible losses, and diuresis. Will
   contact nutrition to see if can deliver more free water with TPN, also
   give D5W. Will check again in PM.
    # Abdominal distension: Patient without bowel movement for last 24
   hrs, had previously had diarrhea. Continues to have diminished bowel
   sounds. Blood pressure has been good, and lactate had been normal, so
   less concern for mesenteric ischemia, but will need to remain mindful
   of this.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous CABG surgery. He presents with hypotension, bradycardia, epigastric pain, severe pancreatitis with ARDS, and persistent pressor requirement. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 12 cmH2O. His vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 113/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and renal dysfunction. He also has hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS is causing significant respiratory distress, and there is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst formation, or infected pancreatic necrosis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension could be due to third spacing of fluids in the abdomen from pancreatitis, hypovolemia, or decreased venous return.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CAD and"

   # ARF: Marked improvement to 1.3 today. Suspected ATN secondary to
   severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing hypotension, also
   with possible component of abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient also
   received dye with CT at OSH so contrast nephropathy also a possibility.
   Urine output has remained stable.
   # Leukocytosis: Resolved.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Today patient with sodium 149, again suspect secondary
   to inability to give PO water, insensible losses, and diuresis. Will
   contact nutrition to see if can deliver more free water with TPN, also
   give D5W. Will check again in PM.
    # Abdominal distension: Patient without bowel movement for last 24
   hrs, had previously had diarrhea. Continues to have diminished bowel
   sounds. Blood pressure has been good, and lactate had been normal, so
   less concern for mesenteric ischemia, but will need to remain mindful
   of this.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status-post CABG, who presented with hypotension, bradycardia, epigastric pain, and was found to have severe pancreatitis with ARDS. He has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation according to the ARDSnet protocol. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but he remains sedated and unresponsive. He is also experiencing renal failure, likely due to third spacing of fluids in the abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to prolonged respiratory failure and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Pancreatitis: Severe acute pancreatitis can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and infected pancreatic necrosis.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to hypovolemia, third spacing of fluids, and potential contrast nephropathy from previous imaging studies.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to third spacing of fluids in the abdomen, hypovolemia, and sepsis. There is a risk of recurrent hypotension and the need for vasopressor support.
5. Infection: The patient is at high risk for nosocomial infections, including ventilator"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], presents with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found severe pancreatitis with ARDS and persistent
   pressor requirement, with improved respiratory status,  and renal
   function today, able to come off pressors.
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   Intubated in setting of respiratory distress, also given need for
   aggressive IVF resuscitation. Patient was on paralytics for about 24
   hours to facilitate tolerance of AC mode and lessen resistance.
   Currently he now meets ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and
   possible aspiration.. Suspect that in setting of RV dysfunction noted
   on transthoracic echo (likely from ARDS and positive-pressure
   ventilation, and catecholamines from ARDS/pancreatitis), any movement
   will decrease pre-load/venous return leading to hypotension with
   preferential vasocontrction and resultant transient hypoxia.
   - At goal 6cc/kg ARDSnet ventilation protocol, continue current TV and
   rate settings, will aim to wean FiO2 down to 40%, then consider weaning
   down PEEP.
   - Later today, if off pressors for >12 hrs and stable, will diuresis
   down to CVP <5 to help fluid status
   - Continue vancomycin and meropenem, adding 2^nd [**Doctor Last Name **] to cover gram
   negative rods for question of possible VAP or resistance organisms
   (stopped flagyl as  c. difficile negative)
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl and versed
did not tolerate attempts
   to wean sedation overnight as was overbreathing vent and appeared
   uncomfortable.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Much improved overnight as renal function
   improves and ventilatory settings optimized. Suspect this was mainly
   secondary to acute renal failure.
   - Appreciate renal assistance, now appears that renal function
   improving and his acidosis will hopefully continue to improve as well.
   Bicarbonate drip will be consideration should acidosis worsen.
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Currently appears that patient has SIRS related
   to his pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for
   hypoxia, had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.
   Greatly appreciate surgery and ERCP recommendations and assistance. No
   change in abdominal examination.
   - Patient is status-post > 11 liters of IVF
had held off on further
   fluid resuscitation for hypotension given concerns about oxygenation
   and worsening of abdominal compartment syndrome in setting of poor
   urine output. Given that his bladder pressure remains relatively low
   (11, as compared to 30
s) and he has significant (likely post-ATN)
   auto-diuresis, will aim to wean pressors and bolus with fluids as long
   as respiratory status is stable.
   - Per surgery, no need for repeat imaging at this time, as this would
   have risk of further dye exposure in setting of resolving ARF, and
   already on appropriate antibiotics (and HD stable, so surgical
   intervention not desired)
   - ERCP team aware of patients.
   - Treat w/broad spectrum Abx: Vanc/meropenam (day 1=[**11-10**]), started
   cipro yesterday.
   - Continuing to trend [**Doctor First Name **]/lipase, HCT, WBCs, calcium, (lactate has been
   normal)
   - Triglycerides were within normal limits
   - Sedation to fentanyl/versed
   - Appreciate surgical assistance.
   - Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia
   # Hypotension: Now off pressors! Hypotension with movement as noted
   above likely secondary to decreased venous return and forward flow with
   movement. Overall hypotension most likely secondary to significant
   third spacing of fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to
   hypovolemia, as well as SIRS from his pancreatitis. No new clear wall
   motion abnormalities on transthoracic echocardiogram. Also in setting
   of post-ATN diuresis and new diarrhea and fevers with insensible
   losses. Do not suspect sepsis from infection as pressor need
   decreasing.
   - Will bolus with IVF if needed in lieu of re-starting pressors.
   - Cardiac enzymes have peaked, no need to continue following unless
   suspect new event
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures pending, as noted above.
   # EKG changes, history of CAD: Do not suspect new ischemic event, but
   instead some low levels of demand ischemia secondary to hypotension and
   stress of infection/SIRS/pancreatitis with circulating catecholamies.
   Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of STE in inferior
   leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**4-21**]. Patient does have h/o recent
   4vCABG in 6/[**2181**]. At this time, risks continue to outweigh benefits for
   anticoagulation given concern of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis.
   Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] morning after admission and reviewed EKG and
   case, felt current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE
   could be ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for
   change in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be
   larger priority.
   - CE trending downward
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA (PR if possible, currently with diarrhea, while NG tube
   is to suction)
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated once off
   pressors, start esmolol gtt
   - Transthoracic echo today as noted above, suspect depressed RV
   function noted could be in setting of ARDS
   # ARF: Marked improvement to 1.6 today. Suspected ATN secondary to
   severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing hypotension, also
   with possible component of abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient also
   received dye with CT at OSH so contrast nephropathy also a possibility.
   Urine output has picked up today, as opposed to 10-20 cc/hr initially.
   # Leukocytosis: Improved WBC today and decreasing fever curve. Diarrhea
   two nights ago. Must consider infection of necrotic pancreas, but no
   intervention at this time given he is already on appropriate antibiotic
   coverage and has only had low grade temperatures, and pressor
   requirement is lessening, and no necrosis seen on CT of abdomen.
   -          Follow up on culture data, added 2nd [**Doctor Last Name **] for gram
   negatives given GNRs in sputum and fevers
   -          Cont antibiotics as noted above, stopped flagyl if c.
   difficile toxin negative.
   -          Hold on repeat imaging of abd (would need contrast to fully
   evaluate), but if status dramatically worsens, would consider CT guided
   biopsy of pancreatis
   -          Appreciate surgical assistance.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with severe pancreatitis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently off pressors and showing improvement in renal function. He remains on low tidal volume/high PEEP ventilation due to respiratory failure, with a poor PaO2/FiO2 ratio but improving. The patient also has a fever, which has been improving, and is currently on a 7-day course of antibiotics. His shock state has resolved, and he will continue to be monitored with diuresis. The patient is expected to undergo a cholecystectomy in the future for his pancreatitis. His renal failure is improving, and he will continue with supportive care. He is also experiencing an ileus secondary to severe pancreatitis, and further evaluation of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) will be done. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and will continue to do so, with adjustments made for hyponatremia. A PICC line consultation has been made for access. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with insulin in TPN, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is to remain in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 year old man with severe pancreatitis and MODS. Now off pressors
   with improving renal function. Continues on low Vt/high PEEP
   ventilation.
   Respiratory Failure:  Still with poor PaO2/FiO2 ratio but improving.
     -Will continue with low tidal volume ventilation
     -Diuresis today and attempt to wean FiO2/PEEP
   Fever:  Thus far, has only sparse GNR in sputum culture, currently
   without secretions.  Fever curve improving
        -Will d/c antibiotics tomorrow if no other information available
   (7 day course)
   Shock:  Now resolved.  Monitor BP with diuresis
   Pancreatitis:  Continue supportive care.  Likely cholecystectomy in the
   future.
   Renal Failure:  GFR continues to improve, continue supportive care.
   Ileus:  Secondary to severe pancreatitis
      -Check KUB
      -Wean Fentanyl
   FEN:  On TPN, will continue for now.
     -Add free water in TPN for hyponatremia

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with severe pancreatitis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently off pressors with improving renal function and continues on low tidal volume/high PEEP ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient still has a poor PaO2/FiO2 ratio, indicating difficulty in oxygenation. It is important to continue with low tidal volume ventilation and attempt to wean FiO2/PEEP.

2. Fever: The patient's fever curve is improving, and there is only sparse GNR in sputum culture. If no other information is available, antibiotics may be discontinued tomorrow after a 7-day course.

3. Shock: The patient's shock is now resolved, but it is essential to monitor blood pressure with diuresis.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient likely requires cholecystectomy in the future for the underlying cause of pancreatitis.

5. Renal failure: Although the patient's GFR continues to improve, supportive care should be continued.

6. Ileus: Secondary to severe pancreatitis, the patient may experience ileus. It is important to check the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) regularly and wean off fentanyl.

7. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hyponatremia, and free water should be added to the TPN.

   RADIOLOGY:
   Morning CXR: left lung field cut off from image
   [**2182-11-14**] KUB: No evidence of obstruction
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], presented with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found severe (gallstone) pancreatitis with ARDS and
   pressor requirement.  Now off pressors > 24 hours.  Spiked fever
   overnight.
   #) Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   He met ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and possible aspiration
   event at home. RV dysfunction also noted on transthoracic echo (likely
   from ARDS and positive-pressure ventilation, and catecholamines from
   ARDS/pancreatitis) which has been likely etiology of transient
   hypotension and hypoxia with movement.
   -- He remains at goal 6cc/kg ARDSnet ventilation protocol, continue
   current TV and rate settings, will aim to wean FiO2 down to 40%, then
   work  weaning down PEEP.
   -- Continue to diuresis down to CVP <5 to help fluid status, on lasix
   gtt currently with good urine output (was net out 1 L since -midnight)
   -- Attempt to wean sedation
   #) Fever: lowgrade temp to 101.1 overnight, had been running 100.6
   yesterday; unclear cause; no increase in WBC; has been on
   broad-spectrum abx; minimal c/f necrotizing pancreatitis given abd is
   soft.  Possibly a drug reaction, though no eos on CBC/diff
   -- will check urine eos
   -- will d/c abx given empiric w/o clear evidence of infection and
   concern that fevers may be a drug reaction.
   #) Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Appeared that patient has SIRS related to his
   pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for hypoxia,
   had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.   ERCP
   team aware of patients.
   -- t/c repeat abd imaging looking for necrotic pancreatitis if fever
   persists
   -- Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia; has been running in the mid 100
s as
   insulin GGT has been uptitrated
   #) Hypotension: Resolved: patient has been off neo and vasopressin
   since AM of [**11-13**]. Hypotension with movement as noted above likely
   secondary to decreased venous return and forward flow with movement.
   Overall hypotension most likely secondary to significant third spacing
   of fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well
   as SIRS from his pancreatitis. No new clear wall motion abnormalities
   on transthoracic echocardiogram. Status post over 14 L of fluid during
   his stay.
   #) Hypernatremia: Na 150 on [**2182-11-15**] trending up, again suspect secondary
   to inability to give PO water, insensible losses, and diuresis. Will
   contact nutrition to see if can deliver more free water with TPN, also
   give D5W.
   -- will check in PM in setting of diuresis
    # Abdominal distension: Patient without bowel movement for last 24
   hrs, had previously had diarrhea. Continues to have diminished bowel
   sounds. Blood pressure has been good, and lactate had been normal, so
   less concern for mesenteric ischemia, but will need to remain mindful
   of this.  KUB yesterday read with no signs of obstruction but poor
   quality film.  Still with somewhat high [**Date Range **] output, bilious; concern by
   nurse [**First Name (Titles) 2796**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is coiled.
   -- will repeat KUB
   # EKG changes, history of CAD: Do not suspect new ischemic event, but
   instead some low levels of demand ischemia secondary to hypotension and
   stress of infection/SIRS/pancreatitis with circulating catecholamies.
   Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of STE in inferior
   leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**4-21**]. Patient does have h/o recent
   4vCABG in 6/[**2181**]. At this time, risks continue to outweigh benefits for
   anticoagulation given concern of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis.
    Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] morning after admission and reviewed EKG and
   case, felt current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE
   could be ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for
   change in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be
   larger priority.
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA (PR if possible, currently with diarrhea, while NG tube
   is to suction)
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated once off
   pressors, start esmolol gtt
   # ARF: Cr improved to 1.3 and stable; UOP good. Suspected ATN secondary
   to severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing hypotension,
   also with possible component of abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient
   also received dye with CT at OSH so contrast nephropathy also a
   possibility. Urine output has remained stable.
   -- cont following CR & UOP
   # Leukocytosis: Resolved.

   Disposition: to remain in ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with hypotension, bradycardia, epigastric pain, severe gallstone pancreatitis with ARDS, and pressor requirement. The patient has been intubated for hypoxia, had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved with IV fluids. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, fever, pancreatitis, hypotension, hypernatremia, abdominal distension, EKG changes, and acute kidney injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia. Standard precautions should be taken to prevent VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin should be administered to prevent DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and the use of pressors can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Prophylactic IV proton pump inhibitors should be given to prevent stress ulcers.
4. ARDS-related complications: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) can lead to complications such as hypoxemic respiratory failure and barotrauma. Close"

   epigastric pain, found severe pancreatitis with ARDS and persistent
   pressor requirement, with improved respiratory status, and renal
   function today, weaned off of pressors.
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   Intubated in setting of respiratory distress, also given need for
   aggressive IVF resuscitation. Patient was on paralytics for about 24
   hours to facilitate tolerance of AC mode and lessen resistance. He mets
   ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and possible aspiration event
   at home. RV dysfunction also noted on transthoracic echo (likely from
   ARDS and positive-pressure ventilation, and catecholamines from
   ARDS/pancreatitis) which has been likely etiology of transient
   hypotension and hypoxia with movement.
   - He remains at goal 6cc/kg ARDSnet ventilation protocol, continue
   current TV and rate settings, will aim to wean FiO2 down to 40%, then
   work  weaning down PEEP.
   - Continue to diuresis down to CVP <5 to help fluid status, on lasix
   gtt currently with good urine output (was net out 1 L since midnight)
   - Continue vancomycin and meropenem, added ciprofloxacin on [**11-12**] to
   extend coverage against gram negative rods for question of possible VAP
   or resistance organisms (stopped flagyl as  c. difficile negative).
   Will plan to continue all for 7 day course (started [**11-9**], last day
   would be [**2182-11-15**]), pending any further culture data (has not had

   # Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Appeared that patient has SIRS related to his
   pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for hypoxia,
   had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.
   Greatly appreciate surgery and ERCP recommendations and assistance.
   Abdominal examination has improved.
   - Patient is status-post > 11 liters of IVF
initially had held off on
   further fluid resuscitation for hypotension given concerns about
   oxygenation and worsening of abdominal compartment syndrome in setting
   of poor urine output. Given that his bladder pressure remains
   relatively low ([**7-25**]) and he has significant (likely post-ATN)
   auto-diuresis, was able to wean pressors.
   - Per surgery, no need for repeat imaging at this time, as this would
   have risk of further dye exposure in setting of resolving ARF, and
   already on appropriate antibiotics (and HD stable, so surgical
   intervention not desired)
   - ERCP team aware of patients.
   - Treat w/broad spectrum Abx: Vanc/meropenam (day 1=[**11-10**]), cipro
   started [**11-12**], will continue to [**2182-11-15**].
   - Continuing to trend [**Doctor First Name **]/lipase, HCT, WBCs, calcium, (lactate has been
   normal)
   - Triglycerides were within normal limits
   - Sedation to fentanyl/versed
   - Appreciate surgical assistance.
   - Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia
   # Hypotension: Resolved: patient has been off neo and vasopressin since
   AM of [**11-13**]. Hypotension with movement as noted above likely secondary
   to decreased venous return and forward flow with movement. Overall
   hypotension most likely secondary to significant third spacing of
   fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well as
   SIRS from his pancreatitis. No new clear wall motion abnormalities on
   transthoracic echocardiogram. Status post over 14 L of fluid during his
   stay.
   # EKG changes, history of CAD: Do not suspect new ischemic event, but
   instead some low levels of demand ischemia secondary to hypotension and
   stress of infection/SIRS/pancreatitis with circulating catecholamies.
   Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of STE in inferior
   leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**4-21**]. Patient does have h/o recent
   4vCABG in 6/[**2181**]. At this time, risks continue to outweigh benefits for
   anticoagulation given concern of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis.
   Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] morning after admission and reviewed EKG and
   case, felt current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE
   could be ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for
   change in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be
   larger priority.
   - CE trending downward, stopped checking.
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA (PR if possible, currently with diarrhea, while NG tube
   is to suction)
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated once off
   pressors, start esmolol gtt
   - Transthoracic echo today as noted above, suspect depressed RV
   function noted could be in setting of ARDS
   # ARF: Marked improvement to 1.3 today. Suspected ATN secondary to
   severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing hypotension, also
   with possible component of abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient also
   received dye with CT at OSH so contrast nephropathy also a possibility.
   Urine output has remained stable.
   # Leukocytosis: Resolved.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Today patient with sodium 149, again suspect secondary
   to inability to give PO water, insensible losses, and diuresis. Will
   contact nutrition to see if can deliver more free water with TPN, also
   give D5W. Will check again in PM.
    # Abdominal distension: Patient without bowel movement for last 24
   hrs, had previously had diarrhea. Continues to have diminished bowel
   sounds. Blood pressure has been good, and lactate had been normal, so
   less concern for mesenteric ischemia, but will need to remain mindful
   of this.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease status-post CABG, presenting with hypotension, bradycardia, epigastric pain, severe pancreatitis with ARDS, and persistent pressor requirement. The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress and required aggressive IVF resuscitation. He met ARDS criteria in the setting of pancreatitis and possible aspiration event at home.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current condition of ARDS indicates a risk of continued respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension, especially with movement, suggests a potential for ongoing hypotension.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's severe acute pancreatitis requires close monitoring for complications such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation.
4. Sepsis: Given the patient's persistent hypotension and elevated white blood cell count, there is a risk of developing sepsis due to infection.
5. Renal failure: The patient's history of significant fluid resuscitation, use of nephrotoxic agents, and potential ATN suggests a risk of renal failure.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent CABG surgery increases the risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], presents with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found severe pancreatitis with ARDS and persistent
   pressor requirement, with improved respiratory status, and renal
   function today, weaned off of pressors.
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   Intubated in setting of respiratory distress, also given need for
   aggressive IVF resuscitation. Patient was on paralytics for about 24
   hours to facilitate tolerance of AC mode and lessen resistance. He mets
   ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and possible aspiration event

   63 year old man with severe pancreatitis and MODS. Now off pressors
   with improving renal function. Continues on low Vt/high PEEP
   ventilation.
    Respiratory Failure:  Still with poor PaO2/FiO2 ratio but improving.
     -Will continue with low tidal volume ventilation
     -Continue Diuresis today and attempt to wean FiO2/PEEP
     -Repeat CXR as is poor study
   Fever:  Thus far, has only sparse GNR in sputum culture, currently
   without secretions.  Still with low-grade fevers.  Seems most likely
   related to persistent SIRS from pancreatitis.
     -D/c antibiotics
   Shock:  Now resolved.  Monitor BP with diuresis
   Pancreatitis:  Continue supportive care.  Likely cholecystectomy in the
   future.
   Renal Failure:  GFR continues to improve, continue supportive care.
   Ileus:  Secondary to severe pancreatitis.  Bowel sounds present today.
    -Continue TPN for now. Monitor OGT output.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with severe pancreatitis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently off pressors with improving renal function. He continues on low tidal volume (Vt) and high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient still has a poor PaO2/FiO2 ratio but is improving. There is a plan to continue with low tidal volume ventilation, attempt to wean FiO2/PEEP, and repeat chest X-ray due to poor study.

2. Fever: The patient has low-grade fevers and sparse gram-negative rods (GNR) in sputum culture. The fever is likely related to persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) from pancreatitis. The plan is to discontinue antibiotics.

3. Shock: The patient's shock has resolved, but the blood pressure should be monitored with diuresis.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is severe, and he likely needs a cholecystectomy in the future. Supportive care will be continued.

5. Renal Failure: The patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is improving, and supportive care will be continued.

6. Ileus: The patient has secondary ileus due to severe pancreatitis. Bowel sounds are present, and total parenteral nutrition"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with severe pancreatitis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently off pressors and showing improvement in renal function. He is receiving low tidal volume ventilation and continues to have poor PaO2/FiO2 ratio but is improving. The plan is to continue with low tidal volume ventilation, attempt to wean FiO2/PEEP, and repeat chest X-ray as it is a poor study. The patient has a fever, most likely related to persistent SIRS from pancreatitis, and there are sparse GNR in sputum culture. Antibiotics will be discontinued. The patient's shock has resolved, and he will be monitored for blood pressure with diuresis. Pancreatitis will be managed with supportive care, and a cholecystectomy may be performed in the future. Renal failure is improving, and supportive care will continue. The patient has ileus secondary to severe pancreatitis, and TPN will be continued for now. The patient's PICC line has been placed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's poor PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicates ongoing respiratory failure. Continued low tidal volume ventilation and attempts to wean FiO2/PEEP are planned to improve oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient has a fever, and sparse GNR in sputum culture suggests a possible infection. Discontinuation of antibiotics may lead"

   #) Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   He met ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and possible aspiration
   event at home. RV dysfunction also noted on transthoracic echo (likely
   from ARDS and positive-pressure ventilation, and catecholamines from
   ARDS/pancreatitis.  Little radiographic improvement on CXR today.
   Likely also mechanical component with third spacing in abdominal wall
   and peri-pancreas with pancreatitis.  Was able to wean to 45% FiO2
   yesterday; PEEP still at 12.
   -- will attempt to wean PEEP to 8 before giving atrial of PS
   -- BP has been high; will attempt to diurese as Na tolerates (he needed
   D5W overnight for rising sodium)
   -- Attempt to wean sedation (currently at fentanyl 100/versed 1); will
   place fentanyl patch 25 today to facilitate weaning of fentanyl
   #) Hypertensive, tachycardic:
   Has baseline HTN on metoprolol and lisinopril; has had slowly rising
   pulse and BP since yesterday; as high as 180
s systolic overnight even
   while at rest and not stimulated; pulse in 110-120
   -- will add metoprolol 5 mg IV BID and uptitrate as tolerated
   -- will defer starting lisinopril (ACEI) while trying to aggressively
   diurese
   #) Fever: again with lowgrade temp to 101.0 overnight (has now spiked
   on [**11-14**] and [**11-15**] at night); self-defervesces during the day.  Unclear
   cause: minor increase in WBC (from 8  to 11) after d/c-ing broad
   spectrum antibiotics yesterday afternoon; minimal c/f necrotizing
   pancreatitis given abd is soft.  Possibly a drug reaction, though no
   eos on CBC/diff or urine; also no rash.  Possible inflammatory rxn to
   pancreatitis with diurnal variation (? [**12-16**] cortisol).
   -- cont to follow fever curve, monitor for possible drug reaction
   though less likley
   -- t/c re-instituting abx tomorrow if spikes and WBC increases further
   -- low threshold to image abd with CT if clinically worsens
   -- f/u cx data; no growth on anything so far
   #) Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Appeared that patient has SIRS related to his
   pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for hypoxia,
   had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.   ERCP
   team aware of patients.
   -- t/c repeat abd imaging looking for necrotic pancreatitis if
   clinically worsens
   -- Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia; has been running in the mid 100
s as
   insulin GGT has been uptitrated
   #) Hypernatremia: Na 150 on [**2182-11-15**] trending up, again suspect secondary
   to inability to give PO water, insensible losses, and diuresis. Will
   contact nutrition to see if can deliver more free water with TPN, also
   give D5W.
   -- will check in PM in setting of diuresis
 D5W as needed with lasix
   #) Hypotension: Resolved: patient has been off neo and vasopressin
   since AM of [**11-13**]. Hypotension with movement as noted above likely
   secondary to decreased venous return and forward flow with movement.
   Overall hypotension most likely secondary to significant third spacing
   of fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well
   as SIRS from his pancreatitis. No new clear wall motion abnormalities
   on transthoracic echocardiogram. Status post over 14 L of fluid during
   his stay.
   #) EKG changes, history of CAD: Do not suspect new ischemic event, but
   instead some low levels of demand ischemia secondary to hypotension and
   stress of infection/SIRS/pancreatitis with circulating catecholamies.
   Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of STE in inferior
   leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**4-21**]. Patient does have h/o recent
   4vCABG in 6/[**2181**]. At this time, risks continue to outweigh benefits for
   anticoagulation given concern of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis.
   Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] morning after admission and reviewed EKG and
   case, felt current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE
   could be ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for
   change in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be
   larger priority.
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA (PR if possible, currently with diarrhea, while NG tube
   is to suction)
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated once off
   pressors, start esmolol gtt
   #) ARF: Cr improved to 1.3 and stable; UOP good. Suspected ATN
   secondary to severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing
   hypotension, also with possible component of abdominal compartment
   syndrome. Patient also received dye with CT at OSH so contrast
   nephropathy also a possibility. Urine output has remained stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous CABG surgery. He was admitted for severe (gallstone) pancreatitis with ARDS and required pressor support. The patient's respiratory failure has not improved significantly, and he remains on 45% FiO2 with PEEP at 12. There is bibasilar atelectasis and/or consolidation, which has worsened since 11/13 but relatively stable since 11/14. He also has hypertension and tachycardia, with a fever that has been present on two occasions overnight. His sodium levels are elevated, and he is receiving TPN with lipids. He has a history of CAD and recent EKG changes, but no new ischemic event is suspected. His creatinine levels have improved, and he is producing urine well. The patient's current medications include midazolam, furosemide, fentanyl, insulin, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's condition remains critical, and he is to remain in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with pancreatitis and hypoxic respiratory failure, later diagnosed as ARDS. The patient has developed fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. Cultures were taken from urine, blood, and sputum. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. They have several allergies, including no known drug allergies. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and fever. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable central venous pressure (CVP). Fluid balance indicates an ongoing fluid loss. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume ventilation strategy. ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with partial compensation. Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, decreased extremity edema, and soft abdomen. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has a history of altered mental status, nutrition alteration, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and acute pancreatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypertension may suggest an infection. The cultures taken from urine, blood, and sputum need to be evaluated to identify the causative organism and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 63-year-old male with severe pancreatitis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently off pressors with improving renal function and continues on low tidal volume (Vt)/high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Oxygen requirement is improving with aggressive diuresis. The plan is to wean PEEP as able today and if able to reduce PEEP, liberalize to pressure support ventilation (PSV).
2. Fever: The patient has had low-grade fevers, which are likely related to persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) from pancreatitis. Pan culture results are pending, and antibiotics have been withheld for now. There is a low threshold for restarting antibiotics and considering an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan to look for phlegmon/pseudocyst.
3. Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive off home anti-hypertensives. The plan is to add back metoprolol and continue to hold angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) during aggressive diuresis.
4. Pancreatitis: Supportive care for pancreatitis will continue, and a cholecystectomy may be planned in the future.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with severe pancreatitis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently off pressors with improving renal function and continues on low tidal volume (Vt)/high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation for respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers, which are likely related to persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) from pancreatitis. The fever and secretions may be due to an infection, but the pan culture results are pending, and antibiotics have been withheld for now. 

The patient is also hypertensive, likely secondary to his critical illness and off his home anti-hypertensives. It is recommended to add metoprolol back and continue to hold angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) during aggressive diuresis. 

The patient's fluid status is being carefully managed, aiming to allow net daily diuresis as tolerated by blood pressure and renal function. 

Supportive care for pancreatitis is ongoing, and it is likely that the patient will undergo cholecystectomy in the future. Renal failure is improving, and supportive care will continue. The patient has an ileus secondary to severe pancreatitis, and bowel sounds are present. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) will be continued for now, and monitoring of oral gastric tube (OGT) output is recommended.

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery
   disease status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], who presented with hypotension,
   bradycardia, epigastric pain, found severe (gallstone) pancreatitis
   with ARDS and pressor requirement.  Now off pressors > 48 hours.
   Spiked fever overnight both on [**11-14**] and [**2182-11-15**].
   #) Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   He met ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and possible aspiration
   event at home. RV dysfunction also noted on transthoracic echo (likely
   from ARDS and positive-pressure ventilation, and catecholamines from
   ARDS/pancreatitis.  Little radiographic improvement on CXR today.
   Likely also mechanical component with third spacing in abdominal wall
   and peri-pancreas with pancreatitis.  Was able to wean to 45% FiO2
   yesterday; PEEP still at 12.
   -- will attempt to wean PEEP to 8 before giving atrial of PS
   -- BP has been high; will attempt to diurese as Na tolerates (he needed
   D5W overnight for rising sodium)
   -- Attempt to wean sedation (currently at fentanyl 100/versed 1); will
   place fentanyl patch 25 today to facilitate weaning of fentanyl
   #) Hypertensive, tachycardic:
   Has baseline HTN on metoprolol and lisinopril; has had slowly rising
   pulse and BP since yesterday; as high as 180
s systolic overnight even
   while at rest and not stimulated; pulse in 110-120
   -- will add metoprolol 5 mg IV BID and uptitrate as tolerated
   -- will defer starting lisinopril (ACEI) while trying to aggressively
   diurese
   #) Fever: again with lowgrade temp to 101.0 overnight (has now spiked
   on [**11-14**] and [**11-15**] at night); self-defervesces during the day.  Unclear
   cause: minor increase in WBC (from 8  to 11) after d/c-ing broad
   spectrum antibiotics yesterday afternoon; minimal c/f necrotizing
   pancreatitis given abd is soft.  Possibly a drug reaction, though no
   eos on CBC/diff or urine; also no rash.  Possible inflammatory rxn to
   pancreatitis with diurnal variation (? [**12-16**] cortisol).
   -- cont to follow fever curve, monitor for possible drug reaction
   though less likley
   -- t/c re-instituting abx tomorrow if spikes and WBC increases further
   -- low threshold to image abd with CT if clinically worsens
   -- f/u cx data; no growth on anything so far
   #) Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Appeared that patient has SIRS related to his
   pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for hypoxia,
   had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.   ERCP
   team aware of patients.
   -- t/c repeat abd imaging looking for necrotic pancreatitis if
   clinically worsens
   -- Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia; has been running in the mid 100
s as
   insulin GGT has been uptitrated
   #) Hypernatremia: Na 150 on [**2182-11-15**] trending up, again suspect secondary
   to inability to give PO water, insensible losses, and diuresis. Will
   contact nutrition to see if can deliver more free water with TPN, also
   give D5W.
   -- will check in PM in setting of diuresis
 D5W as needed with lasix
   #) Hypotension: Resolved: patient has been off neo and vasopressin
   since AM of [**11-13**]. Hypotension with movement as noted above likely
   secondary to decreased venous return and forward flow with movement.
   Overall hypotension most likely secondary to significant third spacing
   of fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well
   as SIRS from his pancreatitis. No new clear wall motion abnormalities
   on transthoracic echocardiogram. Status post over 14 L of fluid during
   his stay.
   #) EKG changes, history of CAD: Do not suspect new ischemic event, but
   instead some low levels of demand ischemia secondary to hypotension and
   stress of infection/SIRS/pancreatitis with circulating catecholamies.
   Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of STE in inferior
   leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**4-21**]. Patient does have h/o recent
   4vCABG in 6/[**2181**]. At this time, risks continue to outweigh benefits for
   anticoagulation given concern of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis.
   Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] morning after admission and reviewed EKG and
   case, felt current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE
   could be ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for
   change in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be
   larger priority.
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA (PR if possible, currently with diarrhea, while NG tube
   is to suction)
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated once off
   pressors, start esmolol gtt
   #) ARF: Cr improved to 1.3 and stable; UOP good. Suspected ATN
   secondary to severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing
   hypotension, also with possible component of abdominal compartment
   syndrome. Patient also received dye with CT at OSH so contrast
   nephropathy also a possibility. Urine output has remained stable.

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with hypotension, bradycardia, epigastric pain, and severe (gallstone) pancreatitis with ARDS. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, hypertensive, tachycardic, fever, pancreatitis, hypernatremia, hypotension, EKG changes, and acute renal failure. The patient's conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS. He is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 45% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. There is a concern for further respiratory deterioration due to the underlying severe pancreatitis and possible aspiration event.

2. Hypertension and tachycardia: The patient has high blood pressure and heart rate, despite being on metoprolol. The hypertension may be related to stress-induced catecholamine release, fluid overload, or medication non-compliance. The tachycardia could be due to pain, fever, or sepsis.

3. Fever: The patient has had intermittent low-grade fevers, which may be caused by an ongoing infection or inflammatory response related to pancreatitis.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe acute pancreatitis with evidence of gallstones seen on CT. There is concern for necrotizing pancreatitis, especially"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to severe respiratory distress. The patient is currently sedated and intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing efforts to wean off sedation and ventilatory support.

24-hour events:
- The patient's PEEP was decreased from 12 to 10, then to 8, but did not tolerate PEEP of 8 (PaO2 63 with FiO2 at 45%). The PEEP was subsequently increased back to 10.
- A fentanyl patch was added to facilitate weaning from IV sedation.
- Metoprolol 7.5 mg IV QID was started for tachycardia and hypertension.
- The patient's temperature spiked to 102.0°F at 8 pm, and blood cultures and urine cultures were sent.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with severe pancreatitis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit (Tmax) and a current temperature of 98.5 degrees Fahrenheit. His heart rate is 105 beats per minute, blood pressure is 167/87 mmHg, respiratory rate is 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 93%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 16 mmHg.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including furosemide, fentanyl, insulin, midazolam, heparin, and metoprolol. He is also on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), as well as abnormal levels of creatinine (Cr), blood glucose, and liver enzymes. His electrolytes are within normal range.

Imaging studies reveal the presence of bilateral effusions on chest X-ray, and microbiology cultures are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to ARDS, fever with leukocytosis, hypertension, pancreatitis, renal failure, ileus, and hypernatremia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with severe pancreatitis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently off pressors with improving renal function and continues on low tidal volume (Vt)/high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation. The patient's respiratory failure is due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and his oxygen requirement is improving. The plan is to wean PEEP as able today and potentially liberalize to pressure support ventilation (PSV) if PEEP is reduced. Diuresis will be continued, and attempts will be made to wean FiO2/PEEP. Metabolic alkalosis will be addressed by decreasing minute ventilation.

The patient is also experiencing fever with a rising fever curve and leukocytosis. Pan culture results are pending, and antibiotics will be restarted. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan will be performed to assess for phlegmon, pseudocyst, or necrosis, as well as a chest CT to better evaluate ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Additionally, the patient has hypertension, which is now hypertensive off home anti-hypertensives. Metoprolol will be increased. Pancreatitis is ongoing, and a cholecystectomy may be considered in the future. Renal failure is present, but the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is at baseline, and supportive care will be continued. Secondary ileus due to severe pancreatitis persists"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery
   disease status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], who presented with hypotension,
   bradycardia, epigastric pain, found severe (gallstone) pancreatitis
   with ARDS and pressor requirement.  Now off pressors > 48 hours.
   Spiked fever overnight on [**2-11**], [**11-16**], and [**11-17**].
   #) Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   Little radiographic improvement on CXR today.  Likely also mechanical
   component with third spacing in abdominal wall and peri-pancreas with
   pancreatitis.  Was able to wean to 45% FiO2 yesterday; PEEP now at 10.
   -- will attempt to wean PEEP to 8 before giving a trial of PS
   -- continue diuresis as Na, BP tolerates
   -- has fentanyl patch, versed/fentanyl for sedation. Continue to wean.
   #) Hypertensive, tachycardic: Has baseline HTN on metoprolol and
   lisinopril at home;
   -- continue metoprolol 10 mg IV q6h
   -- will defer starting lisinopril (ACEI) while trying to aggressively
   diurese, borderline renal function
   #) Fever: spiking through broad spectrum antibiotics.  Unclear cause.
   WBC count stable but elevated.  CT scan unrevealed for source, although
   performed without po/IV contrast.
   - Possibly a drug reaction, though no eos on CBC/diff or urine, no
   rash.
   - Possible inflammatory rxn to pancreatitis with diurnal variation
   - cont to follow fever curve, WBC count
   - would d/c antibiotics as low suspicion for infection
   - f/u cx data; pan-s E Coli from sputum on [**11-10**], rare GNR on sputum
   [**2182-11-16**]
   #) Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides.
   -- repeat abd imaging without e/o obvious pseudocyst of necrotizing
   panc, but no contrast given
   -- Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia; has been running in the mid 100
s as
   insulin GGT has been uptitrated
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved. suspect secondary to inability to give PO
   water, insensible losses, and diuresis.
   -- check in PM in setting of diuresis
 D5W as needed with lasix
   #) ARF: Resolving, was in 3
s, now 1.3, stable; UOP good. Suspected ATN
   secondary to severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing
   hypotension, also with possible component of abdominal compartment
   syndrome. Patient also received dye with CT at OSH so contrast
   nephropathy also a possibility. Urine output has remained stable.
   -- cont following CR & UOP

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous CABG surgery. He presented with hypotension, bradycardia, epigastric pain, and severe gallstone pancreatitis with ARDS and pressor requirement. The patient has had multiple spikes in fever, respiratory failure, hypertension, tachycardia, and hypernatremia. He also has severe acute pancreatitis likely caused by gallstones, as evidenced by the presence of gallstones on CT scan. The patient's condition is complicated by ARF (acute renal failure) and hyperglycemia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 at 45% and PEEP at 10 cmH2O. The patient's blood cultures have been sent and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated. His current medications include fentanyl, versed, metoprolol, lisinopril, insulin, and heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a low PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 160, indicating hypoxemic respiratory failure. The presence of ARDS suggests a high risk of further respiratory complications.
2. Infection: The patient has had multiple spikes in fever, and despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, the source of infection remains unclear. There is a concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia or another source of infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery
   disease status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], who presented with hypotension,
   bradycardia, epigastric pain, found severe (gallstone) pancreatitis
   with ARDS and pressor requirement.  Now off pressors > 48 hours.
   Spiked fever overnight both on [**11-14**] and [**2182-11-15**].
   #) Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   He met ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and possible aspiration
   event at home. RV dysfunction also noted on transthoracic echo (likely
   from ARDS and positive-pressure ventilation, and catecholamines from
   ARDS/pancreatitis.  Little radiographic improvement on CXR today.
   Likely also mechanical component with third spacing in abdominal wall
   and peri-pancreas with pancreatitis.  Was able to wean to 45% FiO2
   yesterday; PEEP still at 12.
   -- will attempt to wean PEEP to 8 before giving atrial of PS
   -- BP has been high; will attempt to diurese as Na tolerates (he needed
   D5W overnight for rising sodium)
   -- Attempt to wean sedation (currently at fentanyl 100/versed 1); will
   place fentanyl patch 25 today to facilitate weaning of fentanyl
   #) Hypertensive, tachycardic:
   Has baseline HTN on metoprolol and lisinopril; has had slowly rising
   pulse and BP since yesterday; as high as 180
s systolic overnight even
   while at rest and not stimulated; pulse in 110-120
   -- will add metoprolol 5 mg IV BID and uptitrate as tolerated
   -- will defer starting lisinopril (ACEI) while trying to aggressively
   diurese
   #) Fever: again with lowgrade temp to 101.0 overnight (has now spiked
   on [**11-14**] and [**11-15**] at night); self-defervesces during the day.  Unclear
   cause: minor increase in WBC (from 8  to 11) after d/c-ing broad
   spectrum antibiotics yesterday afternoon; minimal c/f necrotizing
   pancreatitis given abd is soft.  Possibly a drug reaction, though no
   eos on CBC/diff or urine; also no rash.  Possible inflammatory rxn to
   pancreatitis with diurnal variation (? [**12-16**] cortisol).
   -- cont to follow fever curve, monitor for possible drug reaction
   though less likley
   -- t/c re-instituting abx tomorrow if spikes and WBC increases further
   -- low threshold to image abd with CT if clinically worsens
   -- f/u cx data; no growth on anything so far
   #) Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Appeared that patient has SIRS related to his
   pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for hypoxia,
   had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.   ERCP
   team aware of patients.
   -- t/c repeat abd imaging looking for necrotic pancreatitis if
   clinically worsens
   -- Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia; has been running in the mid 100
s as
   insulin GGT has been uptitrated
   #) Hypernatremia: Na 150 on [**2182-11-15**] trending up, again suspect secondary
   to inability to give PO water, insensible losses, and diuresis. Will
   contact nutrition to see if can deliver more free water with TPN, also
   give D5W.
   -- will check in PM in setting of diuresis
 D5W as needed with lasix
   #) Hypotension: Resolved: patient has been off neo and vasopressin
   since AM of [**11-13**]. Hypotension with movement as noted above likely
   secondary to decreased venous return and forward flow with movement.
   Overall hypotension most likely secondary to significant third spacing
   of fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well
   as SIRS from his pancreatitis. No new clear wall motion abnormalities
   on transthoracic echocardiogram. Status post over 14 L of fluid during
   his stay.
   #) EKG changes, history of CAD: Do not suspect new ischemic event, but
   instead some low levels of demand ischemia secondary to hypotension and
   stress of infection/SIRS/pancreatitis with circulating catecholamies.
   Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of STE in inferior
   leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**4-21**]. Patient does have h/o recent
   4vCABG in 6/[**2181**]. At this time, risks continue to outweigh benefits for
   anticoagulation given concern of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis.
   Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] morning after admission and reviewed EKG and
   case, felt current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE
   could be ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for
   change in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be
   larger priority.
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA (PR if possible, currently with diarrhea, while NG tube
   is to suction)
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated once off
   pressors, start esmolol gtt
   #) ARF: Cr improved to 1.3 and stable; UOP good. Suspected ATN
   secondary to severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing
   hypotension, also with possible component of abdominal compartment
   syndrome. Patient also received dye with CT at OSH so contrast
   nephropathy also a possibility. Urine output has remained stable.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous CABG surgery. He presented with hypotension, bradycardia, epigastric pain, and severe gallstone pancreatitis with ARDS. The patient also has respiratory failure due to hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS, likely from aspiration at home and positive-pressure ventilation. There is also evidence of RV dysfunction on transthoracic echo, likely from ARDS and positive-pressure ventilation.

The patient has been experiencing fever spikes overnight on [**11-14**] and [**11-15**], with a low-grade temperature overnight. The cause of the fever is unclear, but it may be due to a drug reaction, inflammatory response to pancreatitis with diurnal variation, or an infection. The patient's blood culture showed no growth so far.

The patient has severe acute pancreatitis with gallstones seen on CT from OSH. He has SIRS related to pancreatitis, hypoxia, initial bradycardia, and hypotension which resolved with IV fluids. The ERCP team is aware of the patient's condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery
   disease status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], who presented with hypotension,
   bradycardia, epigastric pain, found severe (gallstone) pancreatitis
   with ARDS and pressor requirement.  Now off pressors > 48 hours.
   Spiked fever overnight on [**2-11**], [**11-16**], and [**11-17**].
   #) Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   Little radiographic improvement on CXR today.  Likely also mechanical
   component with third spacing in abdominal wall and peri-pancreas with
   pancreatitis.  Was able to wean to 45% FiO2 yesterday; PEEP now at 10.
   -- will attempt to wean PEEP to 8 before giving a trial of PS
   -- continue diuresis as Na, BP tolerates
   -- has fentanyl patch, versed/fentanyl for sedation. Continue to wean.
   #) Hypertensive, tachycardic: Has baseline HTN on metoprolol and
   lisinopril at home;
   -- continue metoprolol 10 mg IV q6h
   -- will defer starting lisinopril (ACEI) while trying to aggressively
   diurese, borderline renal function
   #) Fever: spiking through broad spectrum antibiotics.  Unclear cause.
   WBC count stable but elevated.  CT scan unrevealed for source, although
   performed without po/IV contrast.
   - Possibly a drug reaction, though no eos on CBC/diff or urine, no
   rash.
   - Possible inflammatory rxn to pancreatitis with diurnal variation
   - cont to follow fever curve, WBC count
   - would d/c antibiotics as low suspicion for infection
   - f/u cx data; pan-s E Coli from sputum on [**11-10**], rare GNR on sputum
   [**2182-11-16**]
   #) Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides.
   -- repeat abd imaging without e/o obvious pseudocyst of necrotizing
   panc, but no contrast given
   -- Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia; has been running in the mid 100
s as
   insulin GGT has been uptitrated
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved. suspect secondary to inability to give PO
   water, insensible losses, and diuresis.
   -- check in PM in setting of diuresis
 D5W as needed with lasix
   #) ARF: Resolving, was in 3
s, now 1.3, stable; UOP good. Suspected ATN
   secondary to severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing
   hypotension, also with possible component of abdominal compartment
   syndrome. Patient also received dye with CT at OSH so contrast
   nephropathy also a possibility. Urine output has remained stable.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with hypotension, bradycardia, epigastric pain, and severe gallstone pancreatitis. The patient also has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and was previously on pressors but is now off them for over 48 hours.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS. There is little radiographic improvement on CXR today. Mechanical ventilation support may be required due to the impaired lung function.

2. Hypertension and tachycardia: The patient is hypertensive and tachycardic. Metoprolol has been continued at a dose of 10 mg IV q6h. Lisinopril (ACEI) is deferred due to borderline renal function and the need for aggressive diuresis.

3. Fever: The patient has spiking fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. The cause of the fever is unclear, and further investigation is needed to identify the source. Possible causes include drug reactions, inflammatory reactions to pancreatitis, or infections.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe acute pancreatitis likely caused by gallstones. Repeat abdominal imaging should be done without contrast to rule out pseudocyst or necrotizing pancreatitis. Insulin gtt may be required for hyperglycemia.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 63-year-old male with severe pancreatitis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently off pressors with improving renal function and continues on low tidal volume (Vt)/high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and oxygen requirement is improving. The plan includes switching to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and monitoring for respiratory alkalosis. Fever is present, with a fever curve trending up and leukocytosis developing. The abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan shows no clear source of infection, and cultures are pending. Fungal cultures have been sent given total parenteral nutrition (TPN) usage. Liver function tests (LFTs) are to be followed up, and a right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ U/S) may be considered if abnormal. Vancomycin and meropenem will continue for now, and central venous catheter (CVC) and arterial line resites are planned. If fevers persist, the possibility of removing the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line will be considered. The patient's hypertension is now present even though he is off home anti-hypertensives, so metoprolol dose will be increased. Pancreatitis is expected to improve with supportive care, and a cholecystectomy may be necessary in the future. Renal failure is managed with supportive care"

   RADIOLOGY:
   [**2182-11-18**] ABD CT:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. There is extensive pancreatic necrosis, with only minimal residual
   enhancing pancreatic tissue in the region of the head and uncinate
   process.
   Fluid interdigitates with retroperitoneal and mesenteric fat. A small
   amount
   tracks inferiorly into the paracolic gutter and into the pelvis.
   However,
   there is no drainable fluid collection at this time.
   2. Gallstones.
   3. Bilateral small effusions and consolidation/atelectasis.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
   admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and necrosis.
   #) Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure from ARDS.
   Became tachypneic on PSV yesterday and was rested on AC overnight.
   -- will increase fentanyl patch from 25 to 50 for better pain control
   -- will monitor TG and pancreatic status while on propofol
   -- continue diuresis as Na, BP tolerates; will reduce volume of TPN to
   try to get negative I/O balance
   -- has fentanyl patch, propofol for sedation.
   -- will attempt PSV trial this afternoon
   #) Ileus: with decreased BS and no BM in one week; KUB
s earlier in
   week were negative for obstruction.   Likely [**12-16**] pancreatitis.
   -- will give trail of Reglan
   -- hope will see improvement as now off fentanyl drip
   #) Hypertensive, tachycardic: Has baseline HTN on metoprolol and
   lisinopril at home;  holding ACEI in setting of recent renal failure &
   contrast exposure on [**11-18**] for CT.
   -- continue metoprolol 10 mg IV q6h
   -- will defer starting lisinopril (ACEI) while trying to aggressively
   diurese, borderline renal function
   #) Fever: CT from [**11-19**] showed necrotic pancreas, but no drainable fluid
   collection to tap.  Will cont treating empirically for infected
   pancreatic necrosis given persistent fevers and rising WBC off abx,
   though no way to know for sure.  Will also leave vanco on for possible
   HAP.  Daily spiking fevers may also be inflammatory reaction,
   especially given cyclic nature.   Mild LFT elevation but no evidence of
   cholecystitis/cholangitis on CT.
   -- cont meropenem/vanco
   -- cont to follow fever curve, WBC count
   -- f/u Cx data; all cultures NGTD so far including fungal blood
   cultures from [**11-18**]
   #) Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides.   CT from [**11-19**] showed necrotic pancreas, but no
   drainable fluid collection to tap.  Will cont treating empirically for
   infected pancreatic necrosis given persistent fevers and rising WBC off
   abx, though no way to know for sure.
   -- cont insulin drip for glucose control
   -- will need cholecystitis in the long-term
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved. Suspect secondary to inability to give PO
   water, insensible losses, and diuresis.
   -- will decrease free water (and volume) of TPN in order to work on I/O
   volume balance
   #) ARF: resolving; UOP good; Cr stable at 1.3

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with extensive cardiac history admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and necrosis. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure, ileus, hypertension, and fever. The CT scan shows extensive pancreatic necrosis without a drainable fluid collection. The patient has been treated empirically for infected pancreatic necrosis due to persistent fevers and rising WBC count. Other medical issues include hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and hyperglycemia. The patient is receiving various medications, including insulin, fentanyl, metoprolol, and heparin. He is on mechanical ventilation and will remain intubated while in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure from ARDS. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the patient does not respond to current treatments or if there are any complications with the mechanical ventilation.

2. Infected Pancreatic Necrosis: The patient's persistent fevers and rising WBC count suggest the possibility of an infection within the necrotic pancreas. If left untreated, this can lead to further complications such as sepsis or abscess formation.

3. Ileus: The patient's decreased bowel sounds and lack of bowel movement for a week indicate the presence of an ileus. If the ileus persists, it may lead to complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
   admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and necrosis.
   #) Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure from ARDS; also
   difficulty
   .  Little radiographic improvement on CXR today.  Likely also
   mechanical component with third spacing in abdominal wall and
   peri-pancreas with pancreatitis.  Was able to wean to 45% FiO2
   yesterday; PEEP now at 10.
   -- will attempt to wean PEEP to 8 before giving a trial of PS
   -- continue diuresis as Na, BP tolerates
   -- has fentanyl patch, versed/fentanyl for sedation. Continue to wean.
   #) Hypertensive, tachycardic: Has baseline HTN on metoprolol and
   lisinopril at home;  \
   -- continue metoprolol 10 mg IV q6h \
   -- will defer starting lisinopril (ACEI) while trying to aggressively
   diurese, borderline renal function
   #) Fever: spiking through broad spectrum antibiotics.  Unclear cause.
   WBC count stable but elevated.  CT scan unrevealed for source, although
   performed without po/IV contrast. \
   - Possibly a drug reaction, though no eos on CBC/diff or urine, no
   rash.
   - Possible inflammatory rxn to pancreatitis with diurnal variation
   - cont to follow fever curve, WBC count
   - would d/c antibiotics as low suspicion for infection
   - f/u cx data; pan-s E Coli from sputum on [**11-10**], rare GNR on sputum
   [**2182-11-16**]
   #) Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides.
   -- repeat abd imaging without e/o obvious pseudocyst of necrotizing
   panc, but no contrast given
   -- Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia; has been running in the mid 100
s as
   insulin GGT has been uptitrated
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved. suspect secondary to inability to give PO
   water, insensible losses, and diuresis.
   -- check in PM in setting of diuresis
 D5W as needed with lasix
   #) ARF: Resolving, was in 3
s, now 1.3, stable; UOP good. Suspected ATN
   secondary to severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing
   hypotension, also with possible component of abdominal compartment
   syndrome. Patient also received dye with CT at OSH so contrast
   nephropathy also a possibility. Urine output has remained stable.

The patient's main medical complications include respiratory failure due to hypoxemic respiratory failure from ARDS, difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation, hypertension, tachycardia, fever, severe acute pancreatitis, hypernatremia, acute kidney injury (ARF), and gallstone pancreatitis.

The patient's respiratory failure is indicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure from ARDS, and there has been little radiographic improvement on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on 45% FiO2 and PEEP at 10, with plans to wean PEEP to 8 before attempting a trial of pressure support (PS). The patient will continue diuresis as sodium and blood pressure allow.

The patient's hypertension and tachycardia are being managed with metoprolol IV every six hours, and lisinopril (ACEI) will be deferred while aggressively diuresing and considering borderline renal function.

The patient's fever is unresolved despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the source of the fever is unclear. The WBC count is stable but elevated, and a CT scan did not reveal a source of infection. The possibility of a drug reaction, inflammatory reaction to pancreatitis with diurnal variation, or infection is being considered. The antibiotics will be discontinued as low suspicion"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery
   disease status-post CABG in [**4-/2182**], who presented with hypotension,
   bradycardia, epigastric pain, found severe (gallstone) pancreatitis
   with ARDS and pressor requirement.  Now off pressors > 48 hours.
   Spiked fever overnight on [**2-11**], [**11-16**], and [**11-17**].
   #) Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   Little radiographic improvement on CXR today.  Likely also mechanical
   component with third spacing in abdominal wall and peri-pancreas with
   pancreatitis.  Was able to wean to 45% FiO2 yesterday; PEEP now at 10.
   -- will attempt to wean PEEP to 8 before giving a trial of PS
   -- continue diuresis as Na, BP tolerates
   -- has fentanyl patch, versed/fentanyl for sedation. Continue to wean.
   #) Hypertensive, tachycardic: Has baseline HTN on metoprolol and
   lisinopril at home;  \
   -- continue metoprolol 10 mg IV q6h \
   -- will defer starting lisinopril (ACEI) while trying to aggressively
   diurese, borderline renal function
   #) Fever: spiking through broad spectrum antibiotics.  Unclear cause.
   WBC count stable but elevated.  CT scan unrevealed for source, although
   performed without po/IV contrast. \
   - Possibly a drug reaction, though no eos on CBC/diff or urine, no
   rash.
   - Possible inflammatory rxn to pancreatitis with diurnal variation
   - cont to follow fever curve, WBC count
   - would d/c antibiotics as low suspicion for infection
   - f/u cx data; pan-s E Coli from sputum on [**11-10**], rare GNR on sputum
   [**2182-11-16**]
   #) Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides.
   -- repeat abd imaging without e/o obvious pseudocyst of necrotizing
   panc, but no contrast given
   -- Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia; has been running in the mid 100
s as
   insulin GGT has been uptitrated
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved. suspect secondary to inability to give PO
   water, insensible losses, and diuresis.
   -- check in PM in setting of diuresis
 D5W as needed with lasix
   #) ARF: Resolving, was in 3
s, now 1.3, stable; UOP good. Suspected ATN
   secondary to severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing
   hypotension, also with possible component of abdominal compartment
   syndrome. Patient also received dye with CT at OSH so contrast
   nephropathy also a possibility. Urine output has remained stable.
   -- cont following CR & UOP

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous CABG surgery. He presented with hypotension, bradycardia, epigastric pain, severe (gallstone) pancreatitis, and ARDS. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period, requiring mechanical ventilation, pressor support, and multiple interventions.

The patient's condition remains critical with ongoing respiratory failure due to ARDS. The recent CT scan showed extensive pancreatic necrosis without drainable fluid collection. The patient continues to have intermittent episodes of tachypnea, and there are concerns about the possibility of mechanical complications related to third spacing in the abdominal wall and peri-pancreas.

The patient's blood pressure and heart rate remain uncontrolled, and he is currently on metoprolol for hypertension. There are concerns about the potential side effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which may be causing the patient's fever. The source of infection is unclear, and further evaluation is needed.

The patient has severe acute pancreatitis, likely caused by gallstones. There are no signs of pseudocyst formation or necrotizing pancreatitis on imaging. The patient's hyperglycemia is being managed with insulin infusions.

The patient's sodium levels were initially elevated but have since resolved. There are concerns about acute renal failure, which may be secondary to severe third spacing, relative hypovolemia, and possible abdominal compartment syndrome."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with severe pancreatitis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume and high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). His vital signs are stable, but he remains sedated and unresponsive. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of C-reactive protein and lactate. Imaging studies reveal pancreatic necrosis and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's fever curve is improving, and he is off vasopressors. However, he continues to have tachypnea and mild hypoxemia. The plan is to continue diuresis, attempt to wean FiO2/PEEP, and monitor for any changes in his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's history of severe pancreatitis and the presence of bilateral pleural effusions increase the risk of ARDS. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.
2. Infection: Pancreatic necrosis can be a source of infection, leading to sepsis. The patient's fever curve suggests an ongoing infection, and further investigation is needed through cultures and imaging studies.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline renal function may be compromised due to severe pancreatitis. Close monitoring of renal function and"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with severe pancreatitis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently off pressors and showing improving renal function. He continues on low tidal volume (Vt)/high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation, indicating respiratory support.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is now resolving. He experienced tachypnea on pressure support ventilation (PSV) overnight but was found to be alkalotic, suggesting the tachypnea may be secondary to pain. The plan is to trial PSV again today.

Fever has been present, but the curve has improved today. The repeat abdominal computed tomography (CT) shows extensive necrosis, which could explain the fever. The total leukocyte count (TLC) changed yesterday, and the patient's intravenous (IV) lines have not been changed. Follow-up cultures, including fungal, will be monitored, and the current antibiotics, vancomycin and meropenem, will continue for now.

The patient is hypertensive off home anti-hypertensives, although he had a brief period of hypotension yesterday. Metoprolol will be continued. Pancreatitis is ongoing, and supportive care will continue. It is likely that the patient will require a cholecystectomy in the future.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
   admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and necrosis.
    #) Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure from ARDS;
   stable and improving.  Ventillatory failure with latest gas showing
   resp alkalosis (was over breathing the vent by 14 BMP: 26
 40 RR).
   Also with elevated HR and BP while over-breathing.  Propofol was
   increased, which helped.
   -- unclear if pain is driving increased RR; no evidence of contraction
   alkalosis on labs despite diuresis yesterday
   -- fentanyl patch increased yesterday from 25 to 50 for better pain
   control; should start to have effect today
   -- will monitor TG and pancreatic status while on propofol; may need to
   switch back to versed/fentanyl if unable to wean off vent
   -- continue diuresis as Na, BP tolerates; will reduce volume of TPN to
   try to get negative I/O balance
   -- will attempt PSV trial again today assuming resp status stable
   #) Ileus: with decreased BS and no BM in one week; KUB
s earlier in
   week were negative for obstruction.   Likely [**12-16**] pancreatitis.   Lots
   of biliary secretions above ET tube; aspiration risk.
   -- started Reglan yesterday; still no BM.
   -- hope will see improvement over next day or two as now off fentanyl
   drip
   #) Hypertensive, tachycardic: Has baseline HTN on metoprolol and
   lisinopril at home;  holding ACEI in setting of recent renal failure &
   contrast exposure on [**11-18**] for CT.
   -- continue metoprolol 10 mg IV q6h
   -- will defer starting lisinopril (ACEI) while trying to aggressively
   diurese, borderline renal function
   #) Necrotic Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis.
   Based on gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of
   this imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides.   CT from [**11-19**] showed necrotic pancreas, but no
   drainable fluid collection to tap.  Will cont treating empirically for
   infected pancreatic necrosis given persistent fevers and rising WBC off
   abx, though no way to know for sure.
   -- supportive care; NPO
   -- cont insulin drip for glucose control
   -- will need cholecystitis in the long-term
   -- cont vanco/[**Last Name (un) 430**]
   #) Rising LFT
s: recent abd CT showed patent portal vein & ? small
   hepatic cysts
   #) Hypernatremia: Na increased again this morning to 147 after
   decreasing TPN volume with free water;
   -- will adjust volume of TPN; may go up from 2L to 2200-2400 (minimally
   to bring down)
   #) ARF: resolving; UOP good; Cr stable at 1.3

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues, admitted for pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and necrosis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has respiratory failure due to hypoxemic respiratory failure from ARDS, and there is also evidence of ventilatory failure with overbreathing of the ventilator. The patient's heart rate and blood pressure are elevated, and propofol has been increased to help control these symptoms. The patient's pain management has been improved with an increased dose of fentanyl patch. He is also receiving diuretics to reduce fluid overload and TPN volume has been decreased to achieve a negative I/O balance. The patient will continue to be monitored for triglycerides and pancreatic status while on propofol, and may need to switch back to versed/fentanyl if unable to wean off the ventilator. The patient has an ileus, with decreased bowel sounds and no bowel movements in one week. There are concerns about the risk of aspiration due to the accumulation of biliary secretions above the endotracheal tube. The patient is also hypertensive and tachycardic, with ongoing management of blood pressure and heart rate. The patient has necrotic pancreatitis, based on gallstones seen on CT and improvement in liver function tests and common bile duct. There are persistent fevers and rising white blood cell count, indicating a possible infected pancreatic necrosis. The patient is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues, admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and necrosis. He is currently in the ICU and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory status is stable and improving, but he continues to have hypoxemic respiratory failure from ARDS. There is concern about ventilatory failure due to over-breathing, which has resulted in respiratory alkalosis. The patient's heart rate and blood pressure are elevated, and propofol has been increased to help manage these symptoms.

The patient's pain control has been improved by increasing the fentanyl patch, and he will be monitored for triglyceride levels and pancreatic status while on propofol. If the patient cannot be weaned off the ventilator, a switch to versed/fentanyl may be necessary. Diuresis will be continued as sodium and blood pressure allow, with the goal of reducing fluid overload. The patient's ileus is ongoing, with decreased bowel sounds and no bowel movements for one week. He is at high risk for aspiration due to biliary secretions pooling above the endotracheal tube. Reglan has been started, and the patient will be given PO narcan to stimulate the gut.

The patient's hypertension and tachycardia are being managed with metoprolol, and lisinopril is being held due to recent renal failure and contrast exposure. The patient has necrotic pancreatitis, likely secondary"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 year old man with severe pancreatitis and MODS. Now off pressors
   with improving renal function. Continues on low Vt/high PEEP
   ventilation.
   Respiratory Failure:  ARDS, now resolving.  Tachypneic on PSV overnight
   which seemed sedation related.
     -Trial of PSV again today with wean of PEEP as able.
     -Continue Diuresis today.
     -Today is day 12 of intubation.  Will discuss with family likelihood
   of tracheostomy.
    Fever:  Fever curve improved again.  Repeat Abd CT (I+) shows
   extensive necrosis which could explain fever.  TLC changed [**11-18**].  PICC
   and a-line have not been changed.
     -Follow up pan culture results, including fungal
     -Mild LFT elevation but no evidence of cholecystitis/cholangitis on
   CT-->Will continue to monitor
     -Will continue Vanco/Meropenem for now
     HTN:  Now hypertensive off home anti-hypertensives, although did have
   a brief period of hypotension yesterday.
     -Continue metoprolol
    Pancreatitis:  Continue supportive care.  Likely will require
   cholecystectomy in the future.
    Renal Failure:  GFR at baseline, continue supportive care. Monitor for
   change after contrast load.
    Ileus:  Secondary to severe pancreatitis.  Bowel sounds present today.
     -Continue TPN for now. Monitor OGT output.
     -Increase reglan.
     -Trial of po narcan.
    FEN:  On TPN, will continue for now.
     -Sodium mildly up today, continue to monitor.  D5W PRN

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with severe pancreatitis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume (Vt) and high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation. The patient has been off vasopressors but became tachypneic and hypertensive overnight, which seems to be related to sedation. The patient's fever curve has improved again, and extensive necrosis seen on a repeat abdominal CT could explain the fever. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) has increased from the previous day.

The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 54 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 223. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, PRVC/AC ventilation mode, Vt set at 450 mL, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and respiratory system compliance of 75 cmH2O/mL. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate (HR) of 103 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 117/71 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with severe pancreatitis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently in the ICU and has been intubated for 12 days. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 117/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range. Imaging studies reveal an endotracheal tube and central venous line in good position, improved aeration in both lungs, and extensive necrosis in the abdomen, which could explain the fever.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that is now resolving. The patient is expected to continue on low tidal volume/high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation and may undergo a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) again today with weaning of PEEP as able. Diuresis will be continued, and the possibility of tracheostomy will be discussed with the family.

The patient also has fever, likely secondary to extensive necrosis seen on abdominal CT scan. Follow-up pan culture results, including fungal, will be"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
   admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and necrosis.
    #) Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure from ARDS;
   stable and improving.  Ventillatory failure with latest gas showing
   resp alkalosis (was over breathing the vent by 14 BMP: 26
 40 RR).
   Also with elevated HR and BP while over-breathing.  Propofol was
   increased, which helped.
   -- unclear if pain is driving increased RR; no evidence of contraction
   alkalosis on labs despite diuresis yesterday
   -- fentanyl patch increased yesterday from 25 to 50 for better pain
   control; should start to have effect today
   -- will monitor TG and pancreatic status while on propofol; may need to
   switch back to versed/fentanyl if unable to wean off vent
   -- continue diuresis as Na, BP tolerates; will reduce volume of TPN to
   try to get negative I/O balance
 will push diuresis 1-2L negative as
   sodium tolerated; will give free water boluses if needed to maintain
   sodium; can give diuril 500 mg PRN if maxing out on lasix
   -- will attempt PSV trial again today assuming resp status stable; will
   keep patient sedated with propofol (and fentanyl patch); may not
   tolerate sedation wean and may need to be acutely discontinued from
   sedation once vent settings are optimized.
   -- will have a family meeting to discuss goals of care and possibility
   of trach (has been on the vent for 12 days now)
    #) Ileus: with decreased BS and no BM in one week; KUB
s earlier in
   week were negative for obstruction.   Likely [**12-16**] pancreatitis.   Lots
   of biliary secretions above ET tube; aspiration risk.
   -- started Reglan yesterday; still no BM; will hold on increasing dose.
   -- hope will see improvement over next day or two as now off fentanyl
   drip (though still on fentanyl patch)
   -- will give PO narcan to try to stimulate the gut
    #) Hypertensive, tachycardic: Has baseline HTN on metoprolol and
   lisinopril at home;  holding ACEI in setting of recent renal failure &
   contrast exposure on [**11-18**] for CT.
   -- continue metoprolol 10 mg IV q6h
   -- will defer starting lisinopril (ACEI) while trying to aggressively
   diurese, borderline renal function
   #) Necrotic Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis.
   Based on gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of
   this imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides.   CT from [**11-19**] showed necrotic pancreas, but no
   drainable fluid collection to tap.  Will cont treating empirically for
   infected pancreatic necrosis given persistent fevers and rising WBC off
   abx, though no way to know for sure.
   -- supportive care; NPO
   -- cont insulin drip for glucose control
   -- will need cholecystitis in the long-term
   -- cont vanco/[**Last Name (un) 430**]
   #) Rising LFT
s: recent abd CT showed patent portal vein & ? small
   hepatic cysts; likely med effect (? Antibiotics)
   -- will cont to trend
   -- will consider RUQ US if continues to increase; nothing seen on
   recent abd CT that is concerning for hepatic process
   #) Hypernatremia: Na increased again this morning to 147 after
   decreasing TPN volume with free water;
   -- will adjust volume of TPN; may go up from 2L to 2200-2400 (minimally
   to bring down)
   #) ARF: resolving; UOP good; Cr stable at 1.3

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with extensive cardiac history, admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and necrosis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation for 12 days. 

The patient's current condition includes:
- Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure from ARDS; stable and improving.
- Hypertensive and tachycardic: Holding ACEI due to recent renal failure and contrast exposure.
- Ileus: Decreased bowel sounds and no bowel movements for one week.
- Hypernatremia: Sodium levels increased to 147 after decreasing TPN volume with free water.
- Rising liver function tests (LFTs): No hepatic process seen on recent abdominal CT.
- Necrotic pancreatitis: Severe acute pancreatitis with necrotic pancreas, but no drainable fluid collection to tap.
- ARF (acute renal failure): Resolving with good urine output and stable creatinine levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Failure to wean from mechanical ventilation: The patient has been unable to tolerate spontaneous breathing trials (PSV) due to tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypertension when sedation is decreased.
2. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers and rising white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. Empirical treatment for infected pancreatic necrosis has been started.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
   admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and necrosis.
    #) Failure to Wean, Respiratory failure: ventilation and oxygenation
   ok; difficulty weaning with VS instability  & tachypnea with PSV.
   Resistance calculated at 4, compliance 48 this morning.  Poor
   compliance likely from chest wall edema, ? pancreatitis causing local
   inflammation and ARDS.  TG stable.
   -- continue sedation with propofol 75 cc/hr; decrease as tolerated
   -- fentanyl 50 patch for pain control; may need boluses.
   -- will keep I/O goal even today; renal function decreasing which is
   limiting further diuresis
   -- family meeting to discuss goals of care and possibility of trach
   (has been on the vent for 12 days now) is planned for afternoon of
   [**2182-11-22**]
    #) Ileus: + BS now with decreased NG tube output, though still no BM
   in over one week; KUB
s earlier in week were negative for
   obstruction.   Likely [**12-16**] pancreatitis.   Lots of biliary secretions
   above ET tube; aspiration risk.
   -- cont Reglan and PO narcan
    #) Hypotensive: [**Last Name **] problem; given bump in Cr and lowish CVP, starting
   to dry out now; PEEP likely impeding venous return causing hypotension
   -- no need for boluses at this point
   -- decrease PEEP
   #) ARF: Cr bumped from 1.3 to 1.7 overnight likely from
   contrast-induced nephropathy (CT performed on [**11-19**]) and volume
   contraction.  Possibly also med effect , possibly from vancomycin
   -- will run I/O
s even w/o goal negative; will hold on giving back IVF
   at this point
   -- monitor UOP; was good overnight w/ little concern for obstruction
   -- renally dose medicines.
   #) Necrotic Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis.
   Based on gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of
   this imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides.   CT from [**11-19**] showed necrotic pancreas, but no
   drainable fluid collection to tap.  Will cont treating empirically for
   infected pancreatic necrosis given persistent fevers and rising WBC off
   abx, though no way to know for sure.
   -- supportive care; NPO
   -- cont insulin drip for glucose control
   -- will need cholecystitis in the long-term
   -- cont [**Last Name (un) 430**]
   #) Fevers: has been afebrile overnight; WBC stable with bandemia; vanco
   level high today
   -- hold today
s vanco dose; check in am
   -- cont [**Last Name (un) 430**] but renally dose
   #) Rising LFT
s: recent abd CT showed patent portal vein & ? small
   hepatic cysts; likely med effect (? Antibiotics)
   -- will cont to trend (somewhat higher on [**11-21**] though not increasing at
   same rate as earlier in week)
   -- will consider RUQ US if continues to increase; nothing seen on
   recent abd CT that is concerning for hepatic process
   #) Hypernatremia: stable now; cont to follow

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of extensive cardiac issues, admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and necrosis. He is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation for 12 days. The patient's main concerns include failure to wean from the ventilator, ileus, hypotension, acute kidney injury (AKI), necrotic pancreatitis, fevers, and rising liver function tests (LFTs). The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and elevated levels of amylase and lipase. Imaging studies reveal gallstones, necrotic pancreas, and no drainable fluid collection. The patient's condition requires careful management, including sedation, pain control, diuresis, and monitoring of kidney function. The patient's family meeting is planned for November 22nd to discuss goals of care and the possibility of tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Failure to wean from mechanical ventilation: This is a significant concern as the patient has been on the ventilator for 12 days. Factors contributing to this issue include tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypertension when sedation is decreased. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to poor compliance from chest wall edema and inflammation caused by pancreatitis and ARDS.

2. Ileus: The patient's bowel sounds are absent, and there has been no bowel movement in"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 year old man with severe pancreatitis and MODS. Now off pressors
   with improving renal function. Continues on low Vt/high PEEP
   ventilation.
   Respiratory Failure:  ARDS, now resolving.  Tachypneic on PSV yesterday
   even when sedated.
     -Decrease PEEP today given marginal BP
     -Check Compliance, resistance, NIF
     -Will hold diuresis today given rise in BUN/Cr
     -Today is day 13 of intubation.  Will discuss with family likelihood
   of tracheostomy.
    Fever:  Fever curve improved again.  Repeat Abd CT (I+) shows
   extensive necrosis which could explain fever.  TLC changed [**11-18**].  PICC
   and a-line have not been changed.
     -Follow up pan culture results, including fungal
     -Mild LFT elevation but no evidence of cholecystitis/cholangitis on
   CT-->Will continue to monitor
     -Will continue Vanco/Meropenem for now
    Hypotension:  BP's marginal today, likely related to diuresis and high
   PEEP
      -Decrease PEEP today
      -Holding on diuresis as above
      -Hold metoprol
    Pancreatitis:  Continue supportive care.  Likely will require
   cholecystectomy in the future.
    Renal Failure:  BUN/Cr up today.  Likely [**12-16**] contrast +/- diuresis
     -Holding on diuresis as above, goal is even.
     -Renally dose meds.
    Ileus:  Secondary to severe pancreatitis.  Bowel sounds present today.
     -Continue TPN for now. Monitor OGT output.
     -continue reglan/narcan
   FEN:  On TPN, will continue for now.
     -Sodium improved today, continue to monitor.  D5W PRN
     -TPN
    Rest of plan per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 63-year-old male with severe pancreatitis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea. His respiratory status is complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is now resolving. The patient's renal function is improving, but his BUN/Cr ratio has increased today.

The patient has extensive necrosis of the pancreas and surrounding tissues, which could explain his fever. His white blood cell count has increased, indicating an ongoing infection. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, but there is no evidence of cholecystitis or cholangitis on imaging. He is currently receiving antibiotics and antifungal therapy.

The patient's blood pressure is marginal today, likely due to diuresis and high PEEP. His ileus is secondary to severe pancreatitis, and he is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to his inability to tolerate enteral feeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS is resolving, but he may still be at risk for further respiratory complications.
2. Renal failure: The patient's BUN/Cr ratio has increased today, indicating potential worsening renal function.
3. Infection: The patient has extensive necrosis, fever, and an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an ongoing infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 year old man with severe pancreatitis and MODS. Now off pressors
   with improving renal function. Continues on low Vt/high PEEP
   ventilation.
   Respiratory Failure:  ARDS, now resolving.  Tachypneic on PSV yesterday
   even when sedated.
     -Decrease PEEP today given marginal BP
     -Check Compliance, resistance, NIF
     -Will hold diuresis today given rise in BUN/Cr
     -Today is day 13 of intubation.  Will discuss with family likelihood
   of tracheostomy.
    Fever:  Fever curve improved again.  Repeat Abd CT (I+) shows
   extensive necrosis which could explain fever.  TLC changed [**11-18**].  PICC
   and a-line have not been changed.
     -Follow up pan culture results, including fungal
     -Mild LFT elevation but no evidence of cholecystitis/cholangitis on
   CT-->Will continue to monitor
     -Will continue Vanco/Meropenem for now
    Hypotension:  BP's marginal today, likely related to diuresis and high
   PEEP
      -Decrease PEEP today
      -Holding on diuresis as above
      -Hold metoprol
    Pancreatitis:  Continue supportive care.  Likely will require
   cholecystectomy in the future.
    Renal Failure:  BUN/Cr up today.  Likely [**12-16**] contrast +/- diuresis
     -Holding on diuresis as above, goal is even.
     -Renally dose meds.
    Ileus:  Secondary to severe pancreatitis.  Bowel sounds present today.
     -Continue TPN for now. Monitor OGT output.
     -continue reglan/narcan
   FEN:  On TPN, will continue for now.
     -Sodium improved today, continue to monitor.  D5W PRN

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with severe pancreatitis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 79/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His blood glucose level is 91 mg/dL, white blood cell count is 15.7 thousand/mm³, hematocrit is 33.1%, platelet count is 455 thousand/mm³, creatinine level is 1.7 mg/dL, total CO2 level is 37 mmol/L, and lactate level is 1.1 mmol/L.

The patient has shown improvement in renal function but continues to experience respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There are bibasilar infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting atelectasis. The patient is expected to undergo a tracheostomy discussion with the family.

The patient's fever curve has improved, and extensive necrosis is seen on an abdominal CT scan. Mild liver function test elevations are noted, but there is no evidence of cholecystitis or cholangitis on CT. The patient will continue to be monitored for potential infections, including a fungal infection.

The patient's blood pressure is marginal today, likely related to diures"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
   admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and necrosis.
    #) Failure to Wean, Respiratory failure: ventilation and oxygenation
   ok; difficulty weaning with VS instability  & tachypnea with PSV.
   Resistance calculated at 4, compliance 48 this morning.  Poor
   compliance likely from chest wall edema, ? pancreatitis causing local
   inflammation and ARDS.  TG stable.
   -- continue sedation with propofol 75 cc/hr; decrease as tolerated
   -- fentanyl 50 patch for pain control; may need boluses.
   -- will keep I/O goal even today; renal function decreasing which is
   limiting further diuresis
   -- family meeting to discuss goals of care and possibility of trach
   (has been on the vent for 12 days now) is planned for afternoon of
   [**2182-11-22**]
    #) Ileus: + BS now with decreased NG tube output, though still no BM
   in over one week; KUB
s earlier in week were negative for
   obstruction.   Likely [**12-16**] pancreatitis.   Lots of biliary secretions
   above ET tube; aspiration risk.
   -- cont Reglan and PO narcan
    #) Hypotensive: [**Last Name **] problem; given bump in Cr and lowish CVP, starting
   to dry out now; PEEP likely impeding venous return causing hypotension
   -- no need for boluses at this point
   -- decrease PEEP
   #) ARF: Cr bumped from 1.3 to 1.7 overnight likely from
   contrast-induced nephropathy (CT performed on [**11-19**]) and volume
   contraction.  Possibly also med effect , possibly from vancomycin
   -- will run I/O
s even w/o goal negative; will hold on giving back IVF
   at this point
   -- monitor UOP; was good overnight w/ little concern for obstruction
   -- renally dose medicines.
   #) Necrotic Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis.
   Based on gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of
   this imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides.   CT from [**11-19**] showed necrotic pancreas, but no
   drainable fluid collection to tap.  Will cont treating empirically for
   infected pancreatic necrosis given persistent fevers and rising WBC off

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 63-year-old male with extensive cardiac history.
- He was admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and necrosis.
- The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for 12 days now.
- He is experiencing failure to wean from the ventilator due to respiratory failure.
- The patient also has ileus, with decreased NG tube output and no bowel movements in over a week.
- He has hypotension, which is likely due to impaired venous return caused by high PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure).
- The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), possibly due to contrast-induced nephropathy and volume contraction.
- He has necrotic pancreatitis, which is severe and acute.
- The patient has persistent fevers and rising WBC (white blood cell count), indicating a possible infection in the necrotic pancreas.
- He has rising liver function tests (LFTs), likely due to medication effects.
- The patient has hypernatremia, which is stable now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Failure to Wean: The patient's respiratory failure and poor compliance may make it difficult for him to be weaned off the ventilator.
2. Ileus: The patient's decreased NG tube output and lack of bowel movements"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
   admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and necrosis.
    #) Failure to Wean, Respiratory failure: ventilation and oxygenation
   ok; difficulty weaning with VS instability  & tachypnea with PSV.
   Resistance calculated at 4, compliance 48 this morning.  Poor
   compliance likely from chest wall edema, ? pancreatitis causing local
   inflammation and ARDS.  TG stable.  Propofol decreased from 80/75 to 65
   cc/hr overnight, but needed a bolus this morning.
   -- continue sedation with propofol 65 cc/hr; decrease as tolerated
   -- fentanyl 50 patch for pain control; may need boluses.
   -- will keep I/O goal even today; renal function decreasing which is
   limiting further diuresis
   -- family meeting to discuss goals of care and possibility of trach
   (has been on the vent for 12 days now) is planned for afternoon of
   [**2182-11-22**]
   #) Bloody OG output, Low volume: pt at risk for stress ulcers; no need
   for intervention currently
   -- cont IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] for now
   -- will check pm Hct with lytes
   -- maintain active T&S
    #) Ileus: + BS now with decreased NG tube output, though still no BM
   in over one week; KUB
s earlier in week were negative for
   obstruction.   Likely [**12-16**] pancreatitis.   Lots of biliary secretions
   above ET tube; aspiration risk.
   -- cont Reglan and PO narcan at current doses
   -- aspiration precautions
    #) Hypotensive: [**Last Name **] problem likely [**12-16**] high PEEP;  had been doing well
   overnight on PEEP 15
 12
 10
 8 with
   Improvement in BP, though became tachypneic and hypertensive this
   morning with low-ish BP and sats in upper 80
s.  RT went back up to
   PEEP 12 and FiO2 80 with high PaO2 on ABG.
   -- suspect mucous plug as cause of drop in sats
   -- will continue to wean FiO2 and PEEP going by PaO2 > 60
   #) ARF: improved rfom 1.7 to 1.5 overnight; Bun increased likely from
   blood in gut.  ARF likely from contrast-induced nephropathy (CT
   performed on [**11-19**]) and volume contraction.  Possibly also med effect ,
   possibly from vancomycin.
   -- will run I/O
s even w/o goal negative; will hold on giving back IVF
   at this point
   -- monitor UOP; was good overnight w/ little concern for obstruction
   -- renally dose medicines.
   #) Necrotic Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis.
   Based on gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of
   this imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides.   CT from [**11-19**] showed necrotic pancreas, but no
   drainable fluid collection to tap.  Will cont treating empirically for
   infected pancreatic necrosis given persistent fevers and rising WBC off
   abx, though no way to know for sure.
   -- supportive care; NPO
   -- cont insulin drip for glucose control
   -- will need cholecystitis in the long-term
   -- cont [**Last Name (un) 430**]
   #) Fevers: lowgrade temp overnight; vanco level 26 today
   -- hold today
s vanco dose; check in am
   -- cont [**Last Name (un) 430**] but renally dose
   -- tonight starting vanco 750 mg QD per pharm recs
    #) Rising LFT
s: recent abd CT showed patent portal vein & ? small
   hepatic cysts; likely med effect (? Antibiotics)
   -- stable today; will cont to trend
   -- will consider RUQ US if continues to increase; nothing seen on
   recent abd CT that is concerning for hepatic process
   #) Hypernatremia: stable now; cont to follow

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with extensive cardiac history, admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and necrosis. He is currently in the ICU and experiencing several medical complications. 

1. Failure to Wean: The patient is unable to be weaned off the ventilator due to respiratory failure, characterized by instability in vital signs and tachypnea. His resistance is calculated at 4, and compliance is 48. Poor compliance is likely from chest wall edema and local inflammation caused by pancreatitis and ARDS.

2. Bloody OG Output: The patient has a low volume of bloody output from the OG tube, indicating a risk for stress ulcers. No intervention is currently needed, but PPI will be continued.

3. Ileus: The patient has a decreased NG tube output and has not had a bowel movement in over a week. He is at risk for aspiration due to biliary secretions above the ET tube. Reglan and PO narcan will be continued, and aspiration precautions will be maintained.

4. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension likely due to high PEEP. His blood pressure improved overnight on PEEP 15 but became tachypneic and hypertensive this morning. PEEP was increased back to 12.

5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF improved from 1.7 to 1.5 overnight. His BUN increased likely"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with severe pancreatitis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently off pressors with improving renal function and continues on low tidal volume (Vt) high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation. The patient has been intubated for 14 days and requires mechanical ventilation. He also has gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), fever, hypotension, renal failure, ileus, and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with poor lung compliance, which is likely due to chest wall restriction. The plan is to wean down PEEP and FiO2 while monitoring PaO2 levels.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient is experiencing some bloody output from the oral gastric tube overnight. Immediate actions include IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI), checking packed cell volume (PCV) to ensure it is above 25, and holding aspirin.
3. Fever: The patient's fever curve improved, but he still has a fever. Repeat abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan shows extensive necrosis, which could explain the fever. TLC (total leukocyte count) changed on [**11-18**]. It is important to follow up on pan culture results, including fungal.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is marginal today,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
   admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and necrosis.
    #) Failure to Wean, Respiratory failure: ventilation and oxygenation
   ok; difficulty weaning with VS instability  & tachypnea with PSV.  Has
   poor complicance, high resistance.  Poor compliance likely from chest
   wall edema, ? pancreatitis causing local inflammation and ARDS.  TG
   stable.
   -- continue sedation with propofol; decrease as tolerated
   -- fentanyl 50 patch for pain control; may need boluses.
   -- back on lasix gtt, goal [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1335**] negative; renal function improving
   -- family mtg  [**2182-11-22**] --> plan for trach on Monday [**11-25**]
   #) Bloody OG output, Low volume: pt at risk for stress ulcers; no need
   for intervention currently.  Hct drifting slowly
   -- cont IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] for now
   -- Daily Hct
   -- maintain active T&S
    #) Ileus: + BS now with decreased NG tube output, though still no BM
   in over one week; KUB
s earlier in week were negative for
   obstruction.   Likely [**12-16**] pancreatitis.   Lots of biliary secretions
   above ET tube; aspiration risk.
   -- cont Reglan and PO narcan at current doses
   -- aspiration precautions
    #) Hypotensive: Was likely [**12-16**] high PEEP;  had been doing well with
   lowered PEEP.
   -- suspect mucous plug as cause of drop in sats
   -- will continue to wean FiO2 and PEEP going by PaO2 > 60
   -- hold further metoprolol unless tachycardic > 120
   #) ARF: improved to baseline 1.3;  ARF likely from contrast-induced
   nephropathy (CT performed on [**11-19**]) and volume contraction.  Possibly
   also med effect , possibly from vancomycin.
   -- back on lasix gtt, given improvement in Cr --> goal 500 cc - 1000 cc
   negative
   -- monitor UOP; was good overnight w/ little concern for obstruction
   -- renally dose medicines.
   #) Necrotic Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis.
   Based on gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of
   this imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides.   CT from [**11-19**] showed necrotic pancreas, but no
   drainable fluid collection to tap.  Will cont treating empirically for
   infected pancreatic necrosis given persistent fevers and rising WBC off
   abx, though no way to know for sure.
   -- supportive care; NPO
   -- cont insulin drip for glucose control
   -- will need cholecystitis in the long-term
   -- cont [**Last Name (un) 430**]
   #) Fevers: curve decreasing
   -- back on vanco 750 QD; check trough
   -- cont [**Last Name (un) 430**] but renally dose
    #) Rising LFT
s: recent abd CT showed patent portal vein & ? small
   hepatic cysts; likely med effect (? Antibiotics)
   -- improved today; will cont to trend
   -- will consider RUQ US if continues to increase; nothing seen on
   recent abd CT that is concerning for hepatic process
   #) Hypernatremia: stable now; cont to follow

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with extensive cardiac history, admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and necrosis. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, and there have been attempts to wean him off the ventilator but with instability in vital signs and difficulty in breathing. The patient also has bloody output from the nasogastric tube, ileus, hypotension, acute renal failure, necrotic pancreatitis, and fevers. There are concerns about stress ulcers, hypernatremia, and rising liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is dependent on the ventilator. There is difficulty weaning him off the ventilator due to poor compliance and high resistance, which could be attributed to chest wall edema and local inflammation from pancreatitis leading to ARDS.
2. Ileus: The patient has been without bowel movement for over a week, indicating a prolonged ileus. This can lead to complications such as infection, electrolyte imbalance, and malnutrition.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, which can be attributed to various factors such as mucous plug formation, high PEEP, or infected pancreatic necrosis.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy. Renal function has improved, but careful monitoring and management of"

- He was admitted with pancreatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and necrosis.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support and is expected to have a tracheostomy on Monday.
- His respiratory failure has improved, but there are concerns about weaning him off the ventilator due to instability in vital signs and tachypnea with pressure support ventilation (PSV).
- The patient's blood output from the nasogastric (NG) tube has decreased, putting him at risk for stress ulcers, although no intervention is currently needed.
- He is experiencing ileus, as evidenced by the absence of bowel movements for over a week.
- The patient's hypotension was likely caused by high PEEP, but it has improved with lowered PEEP.
- His acute renal failure (ARF) has resolved, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy and volume contraction.
- The patient has necrotic pancreatitis, which is causing complications such as persistent fevers, rising white blood cell count, and difficulty managing his condition.
- There are concerns about rising liver function tests (LFTs), which may be related to medication side effects.
- The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be addressed by correcting"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint and 24-hour events are documented at the beginning of the progress note. 

The patient has been weaned off propofol and is showing little movement. A plan for tracheostomy has been made for Monday. The patient's FiO2 was weaned to 0.4 and tolerated well with a paO2 of 83. Lasix was started to control the patient's pressure, and metoprolol was held. The patient received 500cc D5W to address rising sodium levels, and another 500cc D5W with potassium was given as the patient's sodium levels were still high at 146, and potassium levels were at 3.7 at 4pm. 

Vancomycin was stopped, and the patient tolerated pressure support (PS) for a while before becoming tachypneic. The PS was increased to 15/8, and the patient's respiratory rate (RR) decreased to the low 20s. Bowel sounds are improving, and laxatives have been added to the patient's treatment plan.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on [**2182-11-22**] at 08:30 PM and meropenem on [**2182-11-24**] at 06:18 AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
   admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and extensive pancreatic
   necrosis.
    #) Failure to Wean, Respiratory failure - ventilation and oxygenation
   ok; difficulty weaning with VS instability  & tachypnea with PSV.  Has
   poor complicance, high resistance.  Poor compliance likely from chest
   wall edema, ? pancreatitis causing local inflammation and ARDS. TG
   stable.
   -- FiO2 at 40%, increase as needed based on ABG and clinical status
   -- wean propofol as tolerated
   -- fentanyl 50 patch for pain control; may need boluses.
   -- back on lasix gtt, goal remains [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1335**] negative; renal function
   improving
   -- plans remains to trach on Monday [**11-25**]
   #) Bloody OG output [**2182-11-22**], now resolved: pt at risk for stress ulcers
   -- cont IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Daily Hct
   -- maintain active T&S
    #) Ileus: + BS now with decreased NG tube output, though still no BM
   in over one week; KUB
s earlier in week were negative for
   obstruction.   Likely [**12-16**] pancreatitis.   Lots of biliary secretions
   above ET tube; aspiration risk.
   -- cont Reglan and PO narcan at current doses
   -- continue bowel regimen
   -- aspiration precautions
    #) Hypotensive: resolved, was likely [**12-16**] high PEEP; has been doing
   well with lowered PEEP.
   -- hold further metoprolol unless tachycardic > 120
   #) ARFresolved to better than baseline of 1.3; ARF likely from
   contrast-induced nephropathy (CT performed on [**11-19**]) and volume
   contraction.  Possibly also med effect , possibly from vancomycin.
   -- back on lasix gtt, given improvement in Cr --> goal 1000 cc negative
   as tolerated by BP
   -- monitor UOP
   -- renally dose medicines.
    #) Necrotic Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis.
   Based on gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of
   this imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides.   CT from [**11-19**] showed necrotic pancreas, but no
   drainable fluid collection to tap.  Will cont treating empirically for
   infected pancreatic necrosis given persistent fevers and rising WBC off
   abx, though no way to know for sure.
   -- supportive care; NPO
   -- cont insulin drip for glucose control; may not need it for much
   longer
   -- will need cholecystiectomy in the long-term
   -- cont meropenem
   #) Fevers: curve decreasing
   -- if decompensates would restart vanc
   -- cont meropenem
    #) Rising LFT
s: recent abd CT showed patent portal vein & ? small
   hepatic cysts; likely med effect (? Antibiotics)
   -- stable today; will cont to trend
   -- will consider RUQ US if continues to increase; nothing seen on

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with extensive cardiac history admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and extensive pancreatic necrosis. The patient's current condition and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Failure to wean: The patient has difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation due to instability in vital signs and tachypnea while on pressure support ventilation (PSV). This could be attributed to chest wall edema and inflammation caused by pancreatitis leading to ARDS.

2. Respiratory failure - ventilation and oxygenation: The patient requires supplemental oxygen with a FiO2 of 40%. The ABG results should guide further adjustments in oxygenation.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which was likely due to high PEEP. The PEEP has been lowered, and the patient is doing well.

4. Bloody OG output: The patient had a previous episode of bloody output from the nasogastric (NG) tube, which has now resolved. The patient is at risk for stress ulcers, so proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is continued.

5. Ileus: The patient has a decreased NG tube output, although bowel sounds are improving. There is no bowel movement in over a week, likely due to pancreatitis. Biliary secretions above the endotracheal tube pose an aspiration risk.

6. ARF (acute renal failure): The patient's renal function has improved from baseline"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with extensive cardiac history, admitted with necrotic pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS and extensive pancreatic necrosis. He has been experiencing respiratory failure - ventilation and oxygenation difficulties, with poor compliance likely due to chest wall edema, possibly from pancreatitis causing local inflammation and ARDS. The patient's condition has been unstable with vital sign instability and tachypnea while on PSV. The patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal range, but there have been issues with hypernatremia, hypotension, ileus, and stress ulcers. The patient's renal function has improved, and he has been weaned off some medications. The patient's overall condition remains critical, and he is expected to undergo tracheostomy on Monday. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Failure to wean from the ventilator due to respiratory failure - ventilation and oxygenation difficulties.
2. Infection of the pancreatic necrosis, which may lead to sepsis.
3. Stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding due to prolonged bed rest and use of invasive procedures.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and inability to clear secretions.
6. Renal failure due to contrast-induced nephropathy from previous imaging studies and volume contraction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of extensive cardiac issues, admitted with necrotic pancreatitis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's main concerns include failure to wean from the ventilator, respiratory failure, bloody output from the gastrointestinal tract, ileus, acute renal failure, and necrotic pancreatitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Failure to wean from the ventilator: This can lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or lung injury.
2. Respiratory failure - ventilation and oxygenation: Poor compliance of the lungs due to chest wall edema may cause difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Bloody output from the gastrointestinal tract: Stress ulcers can occur in critically ill patients, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Ileus: Prolonged immobility and critical illness can result in delayed bowel movements, causing ileus.
5. Acute renal failure: Inadequate perfusion or damage to the kidneys can lead to acute renal failure, requiring dialysis and potentially affecting medication dosing.
6. Necrotic pancreatitis: Infected pancreatic necrosis may develop, leading to sepsis and systemic complications.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition and history."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with extensive cardiac history admitted for necrotic pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS. The patient's current medical conditions include failure to wean from the ventilator, respiratory failure due to ventilation and oxygenation problems, bloody output from the gastrointestinal tract (resolved), ileus, acute renal failure (resolved), and necrotic pancreatitis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Failure to wean from the ventilator: This can lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation, increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, and muscle weakness.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience worsening hypoxemia and hypercapnia, leading to further respiratory distress and potentially cardiac complications.

3. Bloody output from the gastrointestinal tract: While the issue has been resolved, there is still a risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.

4. Ileus: The patient may develop persistent ileus, resulting in abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, and inability to tolerate enteral feeding.

5. Necrotic pancreatitis: There is a risk of infection within the necrotic pancreatic tissue, leading to infected pancreatic necrosis. This can result in sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as dehydration, delirium, and seizures.

It is important to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical status closely to identify any potential complications early on and intervene accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
   admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and extensive pancreatic
   necrosis.
    #) Failure to Wean, Respiratory failure - ventilation and oxygenation
   ok; difficulty weaning with VS instability  & tachypnea with PSV.  Has
   poor complicance, high resistance.  Poor compliance likely from chest
   wall edema, ? pancreatitis causing local inflammation and ARDS. TG
   stable.
   -- FiO2 at 40%, increase as needed based on ABG and clinical status
   -- wean propofol as tolerated
   -- fentanyl 50 patch for pain control; may need boluses.
   -- back on lasix gtt, goal remains [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1335**] negative; renal function
   improving
   -- plans remains to trach on Monday [**11-25**]
   #) Bloody OG output [**2182-11-22**], now resolved: pt at risk for stress ulcers
   -- cont IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Daily Hct
   -- maintain active T&S
    #) Ileus: + BS now with decreased NG tube output, though still no BM
   in over one week; KUB
s earlier in week were negative for
   obstruction.   Likely [**12-16**] pancreatitis.   Lots of biliary secretions
   above ET tube; aspiration risk.
   -- cont Reglan and PO narcan at current doses
   -- continue bowel regimen
   -- aspiration precautions
    #) Hypotensive: resolved, was likely [**12-16**] high PEEP; has been doing
   well with lowered PEEP.
   -- hold further metoprolol unless tachycardic > 120
   #) ARFresolved to better than baseline of 1.3; ARF likely from
   contrast-induced nephropathy (CT performed on [**11-19**]) and volume
   contraction.  Possibly also med effect , possibly from vancomycin.
   -- back on lasix gtt, given improvement in Cr --> goal 1000 cc negative
   as tolerated by BP
   -- monitor UOP
   -- renally dose medicines.
    #) Necrotic Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis.
   Based on gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of
   this imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides.   CT from [**11-19**] showed necrotic pancreas, but no
   drainable fluid collection to tap.  Will cont treating empirically for
   infected pancreatic necrosis given persistent fevers and rising WBC off
   abx, though no way to know for sure.
   -- supportive care; NPO
   -- cont insulin drip for glucose control; may not need it for much
   longer
   -- will need cholecystiectomy in the long-term
   -- cont meropenem
   #) Fevers: curve decreasing
   -- if decompensates would restart vanc
   -- cont meropenem
    #) Rising LFT
s: recent abd CT showed patent portal vein & ? small
   hepatic cysts; likely med effect (? Antibiotics)
   -- stable today; will cont to trend

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and pancreatitis. He was admitted with necrotic pancreatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and extensive pancreatic necrosis. The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure, difficulty weaning from the ventilator, and hypotension. Other issues include bloody output from the oral gastric tube, ileus, hypotension, acute renal failure, necrotic pancreatitis, fevers, rising liver function tests, hypernatremia, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Failure to wean from the ventilator: The patient's poor compliance and high resistance during spontaneous breathing trials suggest that there may be underlying factors contributing to his inability to wean off the ventilator. These factors could include chest wall edema, inflammation from pancreatitis causing local complications, or ARDS.

2. ARDS: The patient has developed ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory distress and impaired gas exchange. Management of ARDS includes providing adequate oxygenation and ventilation support, avoiding barotrauma, and minimizing ventilator-associated complications.

3. Pancreatic necrosis: The patient's extensive pancreatic necrosis increases the risk of infection, abscess formation, and systemic complications. Empirical antibiotic therapy is being administered to cover for possible infected pancreatic necrosis.

4. Stress ulcers: The patient's recent bloody output from the oral gastric tube indicates a risk"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male who initially presented with severe gallstone pancreatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, and shock. However, the shock and renal failure have now resolved. 

The current assessment and plan indicate that the patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to resolved ARDS, atelectasis, abdominal distention, and volume overload. The patient has undergone tracheostomy (trach) and is now on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's ileus has improved with the passage of bowel movements over the weekend. The plan is to continue total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for now but will challenge the patient with enteral feeding today. The patient is also on proton pump inhibitor (PPI), prokinetic medication (Reglan), and narcan for ileus.

Renal failure has resolved, and the patient's fever has improved significantly with antibiotics. The rest of the plan is as per the resident's note.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving TPN without lipids, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, arterial line, PICC line, and multi-lumen central venous catheter. Prophylactic measures include low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), PPI for stress ulcers, and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male who initially presented with severe gallstone pancreatitis. He has had a complicated course, including the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, and shock. Currently, his condition has improved with the resolution of shock and renal failure. However, he still faces challenges such as atelectasis, abdominal distention, and volume overload. The patient recently underwent a tracheostomy (trach).

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 117/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 19 mmHg, indicating fluid overload. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 48, and his peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 19 cmH2O.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate levels. His hemoglobin (Hct) is within normal range, but his platelet count (Plt) is slightly low. His creatinine (Cr) level is elevated, indicating renal impairment. Other lab values, including electrolytes, glucose, and"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male who presented with severe gallstone pancreatitis, which was complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, and shock. The patient's respiratory failure has resolved, but he now has atelectasis, abdominal distention, and volume overload. He underwent a successful tracheostomy yesterday and has been weaned off propofol entirely. The ventilator support has been decreased to assist-control mode with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. The patient is also receiving continuous diuresis with furosemide and has started toilet feeding (TF) at a low rate. 

The patient's altered mental status is likely related to long-term sedation and ICU delirium. There are no plans for head imaging at this point, but if the patient continues not to interact after a few days, a head CT may be considered. The fentanyl patch dose will be decreased, and PRN doses will be held.

The patient's renal failure has resolved, and his glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is back to baseline. He still has low-grade fevers, and a pan culture will be done today. One line will be disconnected, and meropenem will be discontinued as the patient has completed more than 14 days of treatment for necrotic pancreas.

   63 yo M initally presented with severe gallstone pancreatitis, course
   c/b ARDS, renal failure and shock.  Shock and renal failure now
   resolved.
   Respiratory Failure: Resolved ARDS. Now problems include atelectasis,
   abdominal distention, volume overload.  Now s/p trach.  Vent
   requirements remarkably improved after sedation lightened.
     -Continue diuresis, goal CVP <6
     -Trach collar trial today.
    Ileus:  Had BM over the weekend
     -Increase TF gradually.  If tolerates TF, will being to decrease TPN
   in the future.
     -Continue reglan and po narcan.
   Altered mental status:  Most likely related to long term sedation with
   some degree of ICU delirium.
     -Will continue to monitor off sedation.  No plans for head imaging at
   this point, but if he continues to not interact after a few days-->head
   CT.
     -Decrease fentanyl patch and will try to hold PRN doses.
    Renal Failure:  GFR back to baseline.
    Fever:  Still with low grade fevers.
     -Pan culture today
     -D/c a line
     -Will d/c meropenem today as he has completed >14 days for necrotic
   pancreas.  Observe fever curve off of abx.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 63-year-old male initially presenting with severe gallstone pancreatitis.
- The patient developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, and shock. 
- The patient's respiratory failure due to ARDS has resolved, but now he is experiencing atelectasis, abdominal distention, and volume overload.
- The patient underwent a successful tracheostomy and has shown improved ventilator requirements after sedation was lightened.
- The patient's ileus has resolved as he had bowel movements over the weekend.
- The patient's altered mental status is likely due to long-term sedation and ICU delirium.
- The patient's renal failure has resolved, with the GFR returning to baseline.
- The patient continues to have low-grade fevers and a plan has been made to pan culture today, disconnect a line, and discontinue meropenem as it has been completed for necrotic pancreas.
- The rest of the plan is as per the resident note.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of ARDS and is currently experiencing atelectasis. This indicates a risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening of lung function.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented to the hospital with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus.

Upon arrival, the patient was immediately intubated due to severe respiratory distress and transferred to the ICU. The patient's vital signs were unstable, with a heart rate ranging from 120-130 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 90/70 mmHg. Oxygen saturation was maintained at 95% through mechanical ventilation.

The patient's chest pain and shortness of breath were initially attributed to a possible myocardial infarction. However, subsequent laboratory results revealed elevated levels of cardiac enzymes (CK-MB and Troponin-T), suggesting acute myocardial injury. This finding, along with the patient's risk factors, strongly indicated an ischemic event.

Further investigations, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram, were performed to assess the extent of the cardiac damage. The ECG showed signs of ischemia, while the echocardiogram revealed decreased ejection fraction and regional wall motion abnormalities, consistent with acute myocardial infarction.

The patient was started on appropriate medical management, including antithrombotic therapy with heparin and aspirin, as well as beta-blockers to reduce myocardial oxygen demand. Additionally, the patient received intravenous fluids and medications to manage pain and prevent complications such as stress ul"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
   admitted with severe gallstone pancreatitis complicated by extensive
   pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, and prolonged ileus.
    #) Failure to Wean, Respiratory failure
 still having difficulty
   weaning with VS instability  & tachypnea with trach collar.
   -- wean PSV as tolerated to trach collar
   -- fentanyl decreased to 50mcg patch for pain control as concern for
   mental status
   #) Mental status
 has been persistently altered since d/cing sedation
   -- no focal defificts on limited neuro exam
   -- would obtain NCHCT today
   -- consider neuro consult
   -- monitor
   #) Fever
 recurred shortly after vanco d/c
ed on [**11-23**]; [**Last Name (un) 430**] d/c
   [**11-26**] after 15 day course
   -- pancultured [**11-26**], f/u results
   -- CXR without obvious infiltrate
   -- given sputum GS with 2+ GPCs would restart vanco
   -- pancreatitis with infexted necrosis is a possibility. [**Doctor First Name **] c/s for

   #) Necrotic Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis.
   Based on gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of
   this imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides.   CT from [**11-19**] showed necrotic pancreas, but no
   drainable fluid collection to tap.
   -- persistent fevers off abx, concerning for infected necrosis
   -- [**Doctor First Name 458**] c/s
   -- hold on gram negative coverage for now
    #) Ileus: had large BM [**11-25**]
   -- cont reglan 5mg IV q6h until regularly stooling
   -- prn bowel regimen
   -- continue to uptitrate TFs per nutrition recs; has low residuals
   #) Rising LFT
s: resolving, was likely a med effect; never imaged RUQ
   with US, but had CT w/o evidence of problems.
   -- can stop trending for now
   #) Hypernatremia: resolved with D5w and FWB

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of extensive cardiac disease, admitted with severe gallstone pancreatitis complicated by extensive pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, and prolonged ileus. He has been experiencing persistent altered mental status since discontinuing sedation, and there are concerns about potential complications such as failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, respiratory failure, fever, and necrotic pancreatitis. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever. His laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated blood glucose, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies reveal bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions, possibly due to a different position, but no signs of interstitial edema or abnormal heart size. 

The patient's current medications include metoprolol, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), lansoprazole, meropenem, and fentanyl. His nutrition is being provided through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to the patient's difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation, infected necrosis of the pancreas, and possible infections in other body sites such as the bloodstream or urinary tract."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male who presented with severe gallstone pancreatitis. He has had a complicated course with ARDS, renal failure, and shock. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure with atelectasis, abdominal distention, volume overload, and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He also has a fever and thick yellow secretions, indicating a possible infection. The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to long-term sedation and ICU delirium. His renal function has improved, but he has developed diabetes as a sequelae of pancreatic necrosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to atelectasis and possible VAP. Immediate interventions include checking the chest X-ray, continuing diuresis to keep CVP below 6, weaning PSV as able, and restarting Vancomycin with goal levels of 15-20. Empiric zosyn/cipro should also be continued.
2. Infection: The presence of fever, thick yellow secretions, and GPC in sputum suggests an ongoing infection. Follow-up pan culture from yesterday and restarting Vancomycin with goal levels of 15-20 are recommended. PICC line removal and further evaluation for VAP should be considered.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to long-term sedation and ICU delirium. Monitoring off sed"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo M initally presented with severe gallstone pancreatitis, course
   c/b ARDS, renal failure and shock.  Shock and renal failure now
   resolved.  On minimal vent support at present.
   Respiratory Failure: Resolved ARDS. Now problems include atelectasis,
   abdominal distention, volume overload, and possible VAP.  Now s/p
   trach.  Back on the vent overnight.
     -Check CXR
     -Continue diuresis, goal CVP <6
     -Wean PSV as able today
   Fever:  Fever curve up overnight.  Has been off vanc for 3 days,
   meropenem stopped yesterday.  PICC in place since [**11-14**], CVC since [**11-18**].
   GPC now in sputum.
     -follow up pan culture from yesterday
     -D/c PICC line
     -F/u CXR as above
     -Restart Vancomycin with goal levels of 15-20.  Empiric zosyn/cipro.
   Ileus:  Had BM over the weekend, tolerating TF advancement
     -Discuss with nutrition regarding weaning TPN as TF rate increases.
     -Continue reglan
   Altered mental status:  Most likely related to long term sedation with
   some degree of ICU delirium.
     -Will continue to monitor off sedation.  No plans for head imaging at
   this point, but if he continues to not interact-->head CT.
     -Minimize sedating meds
    Renal Failure:  GFR back to baseline.
   Diabetes:  Likely sequelae of pancreatic necrosis.
     -Initiate long acting insulin as TPN weaned off.
   Rest of plan per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male who initially presented with severe gallstone pancreatitis. The patient's course was complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, and shock. The patient's current condition shows resolution of shock and renal failure, but now presents with respiratory failure, including atelectasis, abdominal distention, volume overload, and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been placed back on the ventilator overnight.

The patient also has a fever, which spiked overnight. Gram-positive cocci (GPC) have been identified in the sputum. The patient's central venous catheter (CVC) and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines are in place since November 18th and 14th, respectively. 

The patient is experiencing an ileus, but has been tolerating tube feed advancement. His mental status is altered, likely due to long-term sedation and ICU delirium. There are plans to minimize sedating medications and monitor the patient's response.

The patient previously had renal failure, but the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is now back to baseline. The patient is likely to develop diabetes as a sequelae of pancreatic necrosis. Long-acting insulin will be initiated as total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is weaned off.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's current issues include respiratory failure with atelectasis,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
   admitted with severe gallstone pancreatitis complicated by extensive
   pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, and prolonged ileus.
    #) Failure to Wean, Respiratory failure
 still having difficulty
   weaning with VS instability  & tachypnea with trach collar.
   -- cont to wean PSV as tolerated to trach collar
   -- fentanyl decreased to 50mcg patch for pain control as concern for
   mental status
   #) Mental status
 has been persistently altered since d/cing sedation
   though seems much improved today as his opens eyes to voice; still not
   moving limbs, however.
   -- cont to monitor; no need for head CT today
   #) Fever , Necrotic Pancreas: recurred shortly after vanco d/c
ed on
   [**11-23**]; [**Last Name (un) 430**] d/c
ed [**11-26**] after 15 day course.  Pancultured [**11-26**], with
   nothing growing from culture yet.  CXR without obvious infiltrate.
   -- cont vanco/zosyn/cipro for broad HAP/VAP coverage
   -- will pull left CVL today; send tip for culture
   -- will reimage abd with CT today looking for fluid collection in abd
   (none on prior CT); t/c surgery & ID consults in the am if he continues
   to spike overnight
    #) Ileus: had large BM [**11-25**]; no BM
s since then though with good
   BS/flatus.  TF at goal.
   -- cont reglan 5mg IV q6h until regularly stooling
   -- prn bowel regimen
   #) Rising LFT
s: resolving, was likely a med effect; never imaged RUQ
   with US, but had CT w/o evidence of problems.
   -- can stop trending for now
   #) Hypernatremia: resolved with D5w and FWB
   -- trend Na

- The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe gallstone pancreatitis, extensive pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, and prolonged ileus.
- He has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's mental status has been altered since discontinuing sedation, but it has shown some improvement.
- He has been experiencing recurrent fever, which occurred shortly after stopping vancomycin and cefepime. Cultures have been taken, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued.
- The patient had a large bowel movement on [**11-25**], but there have been no bowel movements since then.
- His liver function tests (LFT) were elevated but are now resolving, likely due to medication side effects.
- The patient had hypernatremia, which resolved with the administration of D5W and 5% dextrose in water by mouth.
- The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated to the 400s, and insulin therapy has been restarted.
- He has copious thick secretions and is receiving tracheostomy care.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 124/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe gallstone pancreatitis, extensive pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, and prolonged ileus. He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and difficulty weaning off the ventilator. The patient's mental status has been altered since discontinuing sedation, but there has been some improvement. He has had recurrent fevers, likely due to necrotic pancreas, despite being on antibiotics. The patient is still experiencing hyperglycemia and requires insulin therapy. He has a history of ileus and is currently on Reglan to promote bowel movements. The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and he will receive D5-1/2 NS to correct this. There are no known drug allergies. The patient is on multiple medications including insulin, heparin, and prophylactic medications for stress ulcers and DVT. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Failure to wean from the ventilator: The patient is still experiencing difficulty weaning off the ventilator, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of the ventilator settings may be necessary.
2. Mental status alteration: The patient's mental status has been persistently altered since discontinuing sedation. Continued monitoring is required, and further evaluation may be needed if there is no improvement.
3. Recurrent fever: The patient has had recurrent fevers despite being on antibiotics. This suggests the possibility of ongoing infection or antibiotic"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe gallstone pancreatitis, extensive pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, and prolonged ileus. He is currently admitted to the ICU with the following medical complications:

1. Failure to Wean: The patient is still experiencing difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation due to unstable vital signs and tachypnea with tracheostomy collar.

2. Mental Status: The patient has persistently altered mental status since discontinuing sedation. No focal deficits were found on the limited neurological examination. A neuro consult is considered, and monitoring is ongoing.

3. Fever: The patient's fever recurred after discontinuing vancomycin on 11/23. He was de-escalated from vancomycin on 11/26 after a 15-day course. Sputum gram-positive cocci (GPCs) were observed, and vancomycin was restarted due to the possibility of infected necrotic pancreatitis. A consultation with a surgeon is requested for evaluation.

4. Necrotic Pancreatitis: The patient has severe acute pancreatitis with necrosis confirmed by CT imaging. The presence of gallstones on CT and improvement in liver function tests (LFTs) and common bile duct (CBD) dilation suggest gallstone pancreatitis. No drainable fluid collection was seen on CT to guide intervention. Persistent fevers off antibiotics raise concerns for infected necrosis.

5. Ileus: The patient had a large bowel movement"

   Respiratory Failure: Resolved ARDS. Now problems include atelectasis,
   abdominal distention, volume overload, and possible VAP.  Now s/p
   trach.  Back on the vent overnight.
     -Continue diuresis, goal CVP <6
     -Wean PSV as able today
   Fever:  Fever curve improved overnight but still febrile. WBC also up.
   Possible sources include VAP, line infection or infected necrotic
   pancreas
     -follow up pan culture from yesterday
     -continue antibiotics for now
     -Will try to place peripherals, if not will place new CVC.
     -Repeat Abd CT to look for abdominal source for fevers.
   Ileus:  Had BM over the weekend, tolerating TF advancement
     -Continue off TPN, on TF..
     -Continue reglan
   Altered mental status:  Most likely related to long term sedation with
   some degree of ICU delirium. A little more interactive today (opening
   eyes to voice).
     -Will continue to monitor off sedation.  No plans for head imaging at
   this point, but will consider if no improvement.
     -Minimize sedating meds, remove fentanyl patch.
    Renal Failure:  Premedicate with mucomyst and IV bicarb.
   Diabetes:  Likely sequelae of pancreatic necrosis.
     -Initiate long acting insulin and try to wean IV insulin
   Rest of plan per resident note.

   Total time spent: 30 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe gallstone pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, renal failure, and shock. The patient has since resolved shock and renal failure but still requires mechanical ventilation at times.

The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, fever, ileus, altered mental status, renal failure, diabetes, and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and line infection.

The plan includes continuing diuresis to maintain a CVP less than 6, weaning PSV as able, placing peripherals for central venous catheterization if possible, and repeating an abdominal CT to investigate potential abdominal sources of fever.

For ileus management, the patient will continue off total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and onto tube feeding (TF), with the continuation of reglan medication.

Regarding altered mental status, the patient will be monitored for sedation reduction, and no immediate plans for head imaging are mentioned. The use of sedating medications, particularly fentanyl patches, will be minimized.

Renal failure management involves premedicating with mucomyst and IV bicarb.

Lastly, the patient is likely to develop diabetes as a consequence of pancreatic necrosis, and the plan includes initiating long-acting insulin and attempting to wean off IV insulin."

   Ileus:  Had BM over the weekend, tolerating TF advancement
     -Continue off TPN, on TF..
     -Continue reglan
   Altered mental status:  Most likely related to long term sedation with
   some degree of ICU delirium. A little more interactive today (opening
   eyes to voice).
     -Will continue to monitor off sedation.  No plans for head imaging at
   this point, but will consider if no improvement.
     -Minimize sedating meds, remove fentanyl patch.
    Renal Failure:  Premedicate with mucomyst and IV bicarb.
   Diabetes:  Likely sequelae of pancreatic necrosis.
     -Initiate long acting insulin and try to wean IV insulin
   Rest of plan per resident note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe gallstone pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, renal failure, and shock. He has been in the ICU and has shown improvement in his condition. However, he still requires mechanical ventilation and has several ongoing medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient previously had ARDS and is now experiencing atelectasis, abdominal distention, volume overload, and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Fever: The patient has a fever, which could be due to VAP, line infection, or infected necrotic pancreas.
3. Ileus: The patient had a bowel movement over the weekend and is tolerating tube feeding advancement.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is likely experiencing delirium due to long-term sedation.
5. Renal Failure: The patient had pre-renal failure but has now resolved.
6. Diabetes: The patient may develop diabetes as a sequelae of pancreatic necrosis.
7. ICU Care: The patient requires continued ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
   admitted with severe gallstone pancreatitis complicated by extensive
   pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, and prolonged ileus.
    #) Failure to Wean, Respiratory failure
 still having difficulty
   weaning with VS instability  & tachypnea with trach collar.
   -- cont to wean PSV as tolerated to trach collar
   -- will d/c fentanyl patch
   #) Mental status
 has been persistently altered since d/cing sedation
   though seems much improved today as his opens eyes to voice; still not
   moving limbs, however.
   -- cont to monitor; no need for head CT today
   #) Fever , likely necrotic pancreas: Spiking through vanc/zosyn/cipro.
   Fever recurred shortly after vanco d/c
ed on [**11-23**]; [**Last Name (un) 430**] d/c
ed [**11-26**]
   after 15 day course.  Pancultured [**11-26**], with nothing growing from
   cultures. CXR without obvious infiltrate. Lines have been d/c
   Repeat CT abdomen with no fluid collection but extensive necrosisi
   persists. Drug fever is on the differential as he was never truly off
   of all antibiotics for any significant period of time, and LFTs have
   elevated while on antibiotics.
   -- no evidence of HAP/VAP
 would scale back coverage today to necrotic
   panc coverage
   -- [**Doctor First Name 458**] c/s
   -- will reimage abd with CT today looking for fluid collection in abd
   (none on prior CT); , consider ID consult
    #) Ileus: had large BM [**11-25**], then none until [**11-28**]. Now appears to be
   resolving. TF at goal.
   -- d/c reglan
   -- prn bowel regimen
   #) Hypernatremia: will give D5-1/2 NS x 1L during day
   #) Hyperglycemia: has had high sugars since being taken off TPN
   -- cont insulin drip + NPH 40 units [**Hospital1 **] + SSI
 will calculate daily
   insulin needs over next 24 hours and adjust NPH as needed
   #_ Transaminitis: trending up with resumption of antibiotics argues for
   medication effect

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe gallstone pancreatitis, extensive pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, and prolonged ileus. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

1. Failure to wean: The patient occasionally becomes tachypneic with a tracheostomy collar, indicating difficulty in weaning off respiratory support. The plan is to continue weaning the patient from positive pressure ventilation as tolerated and remove the tracheostomy collar.

2. Mental status alteration: The patient has been experiencing persistent altered mental status since discontinuing sedation. He opens his eyes to voice but does not move limbs. Monitoring the patient's mental status and deferring head imaging for now.

3. Fever: The patient has recurrent fever, likely due to necrotic pancreas. Despite being on antibiotics (Vanco, Zosyn, Cipro), the fever persists. Cultures have been taken, and no growth has been observed. A repeat CT scan shows extensive necrosis but no fluid collection. Drug fever is considered as a possibility since the patient was never off all antibiotics for a significant period of time, and liver function tests (LFTs) have elevated while on antibiotics. There is no evidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

4. Ileus: The patient initially had a large bowel movement on [11-25] but then experienced none until"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe gallstone pancreatitis. He initially presented with ARDS, renal failure, and shock. The patient has since resolved his shock and renal failure but still requires mechanical ventilation intermittently. The current concerns include respiratory failure due to atelectasis, abdominal distention, volume overload, and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is febrile, and negative sputum cultures argue against VAP, but the line infection cannot be ruled out. Antibiotics have been continued, and follow-up cultures are planned.

The patient has also experienced ileus/fecal incontinence, with bowel movements over the weekend. He is now on tube feeding (TF) and will continue to be weaned off total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is recommended. The patient has altered mental status, likely related to long-term sedation and ICU delirium. Monitoring off sedation is advised, and plans for head imaging have not been made at this point. Renal failure is being monitored post-contrast load, and diabetes is suspected as a sequelae of pancreatic necrosis. Long-acting insulin has been initiated, and efforts to wean off IV insulin are being made. Transaminitis is trending up after restarting broad antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient still requires intermittent mechanical ventilation, and the presence of atelectasis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a tracheostomized individual who has been in the ICU for an extended period. They have been on a lasix infusion and various antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin. The patient's vital signs show a slight elevation in temperature, increased heart rate, and slightly elevated blood pressure. Respiratory support is being provided through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The patient's blood gas analysis indicates a respiratory acidosis with an increased pCO2 level. Fluid balance shows an overall positive balance. Lab results reveal leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows bibasilar atelectasis with no significant change, but pneumonia cannot be excluded. The patient's neurological status is poor, with opening eyes to voice or name but no responsiveness or movement. The patient has been receiving nutrition and insulin via a sliding scale. They are on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. Code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's imaging suggests the presence of pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially sepsis.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP"

   #) Mental status
 has been persistently altered since d/cing sedation,
   but slowly improving.
   -- cont to monitor, slow recovery, defer head imaging given constant
   but slow improvement
   #) Fever - possibly necrotic pancreas: Spiking through
   vanc/zosyn/cipro. Fever recurred shortly after vanco d/c

   growing from cultures. CXR without obvious infiltrate. Lines have been
   d/c
ed. Repeat CT abdomen with no fluid collection but extensive
   necrosis persists. Drug fever is on the differential as he was never
   truly off of all antibiotics for any significant period of time, and
   LFTs have elevated while on antibiotics.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe gallstone pancreatitis and extensive pancreatic necrosis.
- He was admitted with complications including ARDS, prolonged ileus, and fever.
- The patient has been on a tracheostomy collar, receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation support, and has been weaned off sedation.
- His mental status has been altered but is slowly improving.
- He has had recurrent fevers, and cultures have been negative. A CT scan shows persistent necrosis but no fluid collection.
- The patient was previously on antibiotics, which were stopped briefly before the fever recurred.
- He has been on lasix gtt for fluid management and is currently producing minimal residuals with TF at goal.
- The patient's sodium levels are persistently high at 147, and his blood sugars have been elevated since stopping TPN.
- He had a large bowel movement on 11/25, followed by none until 11/28, when he had multiple bowel movements.
- The patient's cardiac history includes extensive cardiac disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory failure: The patient is still on CPAP/PSV ventilation support and has a history of ARDS. Failure to wean off the ventilator could indicate ongoing respiratory distress.
2) Mental status changes: The patient's mental status has been altered since stopping sedation, but it is slowly improving. Monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo M initally presented with severe gallstone pancreatitis, course
   c/b ARDS, renal failure and shock.  Shock and renal failure now
   resolved.  Still requiring mechanical ventilation at times.
    Respiratory Failure: Resolved ARDS. Now problems include atelectasis,
   abdominal distention, volume overload, and possible VAP.  Now s/p
   trach.  Back on the vent overnight.
     -Continue diuresis today, goal CVP <6
     -Trach collar trial today
    Fever:  Fever curve improved overnight but still febrile.  Negative
   sputum cultures argue against VAP, doubt line infection but line still
   pulled.
      -follow up pan culture and cath tip cultures
     -continue antibiotics for now
     -Will ask surgery to see patient out of concern for possible infected
   necrotic pancreas
     -ID consult with ? of appropriate abx for infected pancreas and
   appropriate duration
     -Follow up Abd CT read although preliminarily no collection seen.
    Ileus/FEN:  Had BM over the weekend, TF at goal with minimal residuals
     -Continue off TPN, on TF.
     -D/C reglan
     -[**Month (only) 60**] need pancreatic enzyme replacement.
    Altered mental status:  Most likely related to long term sedation with
   some degree of ICU delirium. A little more interactive today (opening
   eyes to voice, moving extremities spontaneously).
     -Will continue to monitor off sedation.  No plans for head imaging at
   this point, but will consider if no improvement.
     -Minimize sedating meds
     Renal Failure:  Premedicated with mucomyst and IV bicarb.
      -Monitor Cr after contrast load.
    Diabetes:  Likely sequelae of pancreatic necrosis.
     -Initiate long acting insulin and try to wean IV insulin
   Transaminitis:  Trending up after restarting broad abx.
     -If continues to rise, consider RUQ U/S.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of acute gallstone pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), abdominal compartment syndrome, ARF (acute renal failure), and infected necrotic pancreas. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including Vanc (vancomycin), Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam), and Cipro (ciprofloxacin). The patient underwent a tracheostomy and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of poor responsiveness. Fever persisted despite antibiotic therapy, suggesting a possible source of infection, likely the infected necrotic pancreas. A surgical consult was requested for pancreatic biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. The patient tolerated wearing a tracheostomy collar during the day but required pressure support at night. Tracheal secretions were thick and yellow. The patient received fluids, including IV fluids and blood transfusions. The patient's vital signs were stable, with mild tachycardia and hypotension. Oxygen saturation was maintained at 93%. The patient's respiratory support included aerosol-cool delivery, tracheostomy tube, and standby ventilation mode. The patient's ABG results indicated respiratory acidosis with compensated metabolic alkalosis. The patient's lab results showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels, while other parameters were within normal limits. Imaging revealed no"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of acute gallstone pancreatitis, abdominal compartment syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute kidney injury (ARF). The patient has undergone tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 50%. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/81 mmHg to 145/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging studies have not revealed any new findings. 

The patient's assessment includes ongoing infection, likely due to necrotic pancreas, with negative cultures. There is concern for infected necrotic pancreas, and a surgical consult has been requested for pancreatic biopsy. The patient also has subacute mental status changes and requires further evaluation for potential causes, such as stroke. 

The plan includes continuation of appropriate antibiotic therapy, optimization of respiratory support, neurological evaluation, and monitoring of renal function. Nutrition support will be discussed, and insulin therapy will be titrated based on daily requirements. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis secondary to infected necrotic pancreas, stroke, and renal dysfunction."

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of acute gallstone pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), abdominal compartment syndrome, and ARF (acute renal failure). The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including Vanc (vancomycin) and Meropenem (Zosyn), for suspected infections. The patient also underwent tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of poor responsiveness. Cultures have persistently been negative, raising concerns for infected necrotic pancreas. Surgical consult has been requested for pancreatic biopsy. The patient's respiratory support and fluid balance are being closely monitored. The patient's labs show elevated WBC count, glucose levels, and lactic acid. Imaging studies have not revealed any new findings. The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, Prevail, metoprolol, furosemide, insulin NPH, and ISS (intermittent sequential sedation). The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing concerns regarding potential complications such as infection, respiratory distress, and renal dysfunction."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old with acute gallstone pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, abdominal compartment syndrome, and ARF. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube. The patient has persistent fevers despite antibiotic therapy, with cultures persistently negative. There is concern for infected necrotic pancreas. The patient's mental status has improved gradually but remains poor. Surgical consult is pending regarding the role for pancreatic biopsy.

24-hour events include tolerance of tracheostomy collar during the day and use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) at night. The patient requires frequent suctioning for thick yellow secretions. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/81 mmHg to 145/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on aerosol-cool mode with FiO2 of 50%. The patient is on standby mode with a respiratory support system.

Fluid balance shows an input of 4,282 mL and output of 3,430 mL, with a positive balance of 852 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated glucose levels, increased liver enzymes, and altered kidney function tests. Imaging and microbiology reports are pending"

   IMPRESSION: 1. Right frontal and right parietal hypodensities appear to
   represent infarct of unclear chronicity, but possibly subacute.
   Recommend MRI
   with diffusion-weighted imaging for further evaluation.
   2. Near complete opacification of the sphenoid sinus with opacification
   of
   multiple posterior ethmoid air cells. Opacification of multiple right
   mastoid
   air cells also observed.
   NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The right frontal hypodensity is
   associated with local tissue loss, and is therefore chronic. The right
   parietal low density region has no tissue loss and may be subacute.

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with extensive cardiac history, admitted with severe gallstone pancreatitis complicated by extensive pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, prolonged ileus, and fever. The patient has been persistently altered since discontinuing sedation, but slowly improving. There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this case:

1. Stroke: The patient has multiple right-sided hypodensities on NCHCT, which appear to represent infarcts of unclear chronicity, possibly subacute. This indicates a risk for further strokes or worsening neurological status.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV with a tracheostomy tube, indicating difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. This poses a risk for continued respiratory failure or need for prolonged ventilatory support.

3. Pancreatic necrosis and infection: The patient has extensive pancreatic necrosis, which increases the risk of infection and subsequent sepsis. The patient has had recurrent fevers despite antibiotic therapy, and there is a possibility of drug fever due to prolonged antibiotic use.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has had high sugars since being taken off TPN, indicating uncontrolled blood glucose levels. This can increase the risk of infections and other complications.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level remains persistently high at 147, indicating a risk for dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

6. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with extensive cardiac history, admitted with severe gallstone pancreatitis complicated by extensive pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, prolonged ileus, fever, and stroke. The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note:

1. Stroke: The patient has two distinct lesions on the brain CT scan, indicating a stroke. Neuro consultation has been requested, and carotid dopplers, echo with bubble study, and fasting lipids have been ordered. The patient is currently on Plavix, and PEG placement may be needed due to the stroke.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is still dependent on the tracheostomy collar and is not yet weaned off the ventilator. The plan is to continue weaning the patient off PSV mode as tolerated to the tracheostomy collar. Cough assist with MIE machine has been recommended for re-expansion of bibasilar atelectasis.

3. Fever: The patient has been experiencing fever, which may be due to necrotic pancreatitis. Cultures have been taken, and all cultures with NGTD (nontuberculous mycobacteria). Antibiotics have been changed accordingly.

4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are trending up, suggesting possible medication effect. No need for RUQ ultrasound as the patient is not a surgical candidate. GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) levels should"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with extensive cardiac history, admitted with severe gallstone pancreatitis complicated by extensive pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, prolonged ileus, fever, and stroke. The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from his current condition and previous medical history.

1. Stroke: The patient has two distinct lesions on the brain that appear to be of separate but likely subacute chronologies. Neuro consultation is recommended, along with carotid dopplers, echo with bubble study, fasting lipids, and continuing Plavix (stroke considered an ASA failure). The patient will likely need a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

2. Failure to Wean, Respiratory Failure: The patient is doing well with slow progression to tolerating more tracheostomy collar. Continuous weaning of pressure support ventilation (PSV) as tolerated to tracheostomy collar is advised. The use of a mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE) machine for cough assist and re-expansion of bibasilar atelectasis is also recommended.

3. Fever: The patient has persistent fever, possibly due to necrotic pancreatitis. Pancreatic culture was taken on [**11-26**] with nothing growing from any cultures. All lines have been removed, and antibiotics have been discontinued. Sinusitis is a possibility as seen on CT head. No evidence of hospital-acquired"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of necrotizing gallstone pancreatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), abdominal compartment syndrome, and generalized weakness. The patient also has altered mental status and evidence of prior strokes on head CT. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including critical illness myopathy, hypernatremia, acute elevation in transaminases, fungal sinusitis, pneumonia, and endocrine abnormalities. The patient is on various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, diuretics, insulin, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological Complications: The patient has altered mental status and evidence of prior strokes on head CT. This indicates a potential risk for further neurological complications such as cognitive impairment, seizures, or additional strokes.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient has ARDS and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a potential risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening respiratory function.
3. Renal Complications: The patient has ARF, and there is a potential risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and evidence of gallstone-related complications. There is a potential risk for ongoing liver dysfunction, cholangitis, or biliary obstruction.
5. Infectious Complications: The patient has evidence of fungal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues, admitted for severe gallstone pancreatitis complicated by extensive pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, prolonged ileus, fever, and stroke. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, stroke, fever, transaminitis, volume status issues, ileus, hypernatremia, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stroke: The patient has evidence of two distinct lesions on the head CT scan, indicating possible subacute chronologies. Further evaluation is recommended with carotid dopplers, echo with bubble study, and fasting lipids. The patient is being considered for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement due to the stroke being considered an ASA failure.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. The progress note mentions the need to continue weaning the patient off the ventilator while ensuring adequate oxygenation. The use of a tracheostomy collar and MIE machine for cough assist and re-expansion of bibasilar atelectasis is mentioned.

3. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers, possibly due to necrotic pancreatitis. Cultures have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initially initiated but later discontinued due to negative results. Sinusitis is a possibility as seen on the head CT scan.

4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues, admitted for severe gallstone pancreatitis, extensive pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, prolonged ileus, fever, and stroke. The patient has several medical complications, including stroke, respiratory failure, and transaminitis. The patient's condition requires ongoing monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stroke: The patient has two distinct lesions on the brain CT scan, indicating possible subacute chronologies. Further evaluation with carotid dopplers, echo with bubble study, and fasting lipids is recommended.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty weaning off the ventilator. Tracheostomy collar and MIE machine for cough assist are being used. Regular re-evaluation of respiratory function is necessary.
3. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, suggesting possible medication effect or infection. Discontinuation of antibiotics may help resolve this issue. Further investigation with GGT levels is recommended.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels remain high at 147. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and administration of D5W are needed to correct this imbalance.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels have been consistently elevated since stopping TPN. Adjustments to insulin regimen may be necessary for glycemic control.
6. Volume Status: The patient was initially positive for fluid overload but has since been managed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old with necrotizing pancreatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), and a tracheostomy. The patient has likely critical illness myopathy/neuropathy. The patient's condition has been improving. The patient has been off antibiotics for three weeks and remains afebrile. They are on T-piece ventilation with 40% FiO2 and will be weaned to keep SpO2 above 92%. The patient is tachypneic, likely due to a combination of CNS factors, anxiety/pain, and hypernatremia. The patient is hypernatremic and will receive an increase in D5W drip. Diuresis will continue with a target of -1L TBB. The patient had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and will restart Plavix, be on a statin, and have carotid dopplers done. The patient is receiving NPH (half dose while NPO). The patient is full code in the ICU, with prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is to be dispositioned to rehabilitation at [**Hospital 2773**]. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of ARDS and current tachypnea, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old with necrotizing pancreatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), and a tracheostomy. They have likely critical illness myopathy/neuropathy and are currently in the ICU. The patient's condition has been improving, but they still face several medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient remains on a T-piece and requires supplemental oxygen to maintain a SpO2 above 92%. They are also tachypneic, which could be due to CNS issues, anxiety, pain, or hypernatremia.
2. Renal complications: The patient is hypernatremic, and their D5W drip should be adjusted accordingly. Diuresis should continue, aiming for a target of -1L.
3. Neurological complications: The patient had a recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and requires restarting Plavix, statin therapy, and carotid doppler monitoring.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's transaminases are improving after stopping antibiotics, and an IR-guided post-pyloric tube will be placed tomorrow.
5. Infectious disease complications: Although the patient is currently off antibiotics and remains afebrile, they should await culture results before making any further decisions regarding ID management.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
   admitted with severe gallstone pancreatitis complicated by extensive
   pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, prolonged ileus, fever, and stroke.
   #) Stroke
 two distinct lesions appear of separate but likely subacute
   chronologies. Neuro curbsided.
   -- f/u carotid dopplers
   -- echo with bubble study this AM
   -- fasting lipids with LDL 109, TC 163, HDL 38
 near goal
   --  A1c 5.7%
   -- should go forward on plavix (stroke considered an ASA failure),
   would d/c ASA per MATCH trial
   -- no PEG given pancreatic inflammation, will get post pyloric feeding
   tube today
   #) Failure to Wean, Respiratory failure
 doing well with slow
   progession to tolerating more trach collar.
   -- cont trach collar
   -- continue MIE machine for cough assist, re-expansion of bibasilar
   atelectasis
   #) Fever - possibly due to necrotic pancreatitis. Pancultured [**11-26**],
   with nothing growing from any cultures. Lines have been d/c

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with extensive cardiac history, admitted with severe gallstone pancreatitis complicated by extensive pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, prolonged ileus, fever, and stroke. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that require ongoing management.

1. Stroke: The patient has two distinct lesions of separate but likely subacute chronologies. Neuro consultation has been requested, and further investigations such as carotid dopplers, echo with bubble study, and fasting lipids are planned.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is doing well with slow progression to tolerating more tracheal collar. The plan is to continue with the tracheal collar and MIE machine for cough assist and re-expansion of bibasilar atelectasis.

3. Fever: The patient's fever may be due to necrotic pancreatitis. Cultures have been obtained, and all lines have been removed. Antibiotics have been discontinued since December 1st.

4. Transaminitis: The trend in liver enzymes suggests a medication effect, and no further intervention is required.

5. Volume Status: The patient was initially 18L positive in the loss of sodium after aggressive volume resuscitation. Continuous lasix infusion is being given with the goal of -1L today.

6. Ileus: The patient's ileus has been resolving since November 25th. Tube feeding will be initiated once the post pyloric tube is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old individual with necrotizing pancreatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), and multiple right-sided infarcts on head CT, possibly subacute and chronic. The patient is improving, but there are ongoing assessments and plans in place for possible embolic stroke, pancreatic necrosis, transaminitis, fevers, respiratory failure, renal issues, diabetes management, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stroke: The presence of multiple right-sided infarcts on head CT suggests a potential complication of stroke. Further workup is ongoing, and anti-platelet therapy has been restarted.
2. Pancreatic necrosis: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infection or abscess formation within the pancreatic tissue. Surgical input is being sought, and plans for possible percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement are being discussed.
3. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are elevated, indicating a possible liver dysfunction or injury. Improving off antibiotics suggests a potential drug-induced liver injury.
4. Fevers: The patient has had low-grade fevers, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation. These have improved but need to be closely monitored.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to tolerate the tracheostomy collar, but ongoing pulmonary toilet (clearing of secretions)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of necrotizing pancreatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently improving. There are ongoing assessments and plans for possible embolic stroke, pancreatic necrosis, transaminitis, fevers, respiratory failure, renal function, diabetes, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stroke: The patient may be at risk for an embolic stroke due to his medical history and ongoing workup.
2. Pancreatic necrosis: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis, and there is a need for surgical input regarding the possibility of debridement or percutaneous endoscopic gastrotomy (PEG) placement.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has improving transaminitis, but it is important to continue monitoring liver function.
4. Fevers: The patient's fevers are improving, but they should be closely monitored to rule out any potential infections.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to tolerate the tracheostomy collar, but there is a risk for atelectasis and pneumonia due to his rapid shallow breathing pattern. Pulmonary toilet and possibly mechanical insufflation/exsufflation (MIE) or a vest device may be necessary for secretion clearance.
6. Renal function: The patient's creatinine levels are mildly elevated, likely due to diuresis. Close monitoring of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues, admitted for severe gallstone pancreatitis, extensive pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, prolonged ileus, fever, and stroke. The patient has multiple medical complications including stroke, respiratory failure, fever, transaminitis, volume status, ileus, hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, and renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stroke: The patient has two distinct lesions indicating a stroke. Further evaluation is needed, and neuro consultation has been requested.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging, but there is improvement in tolerating more time with the tracheal collar.
3. Fever: The patient has persistent fever, possibly due to necrotic pancreatitis. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been stopped since December 1st as no growth was observed.
4. Transaminitis: Liver enzymes have been elevated but are now trending down, suggesting a medication effect rather than hepatic injury.
5. Volume Status: The patient was previously in positive fluid balance but is now being closely monitored and managed with Lasix to achieve a goal of -1L fluid balance today.
6. Ileus: The patient previously had an ileus, but it has resolved since November 25th.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7311**] is a 63 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
   admitted with severe gallstone pancreatitis complicated by extensive
   pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, prolonged ileus, fever, and stroke.
   #) Stroke
 two distinct lesions appear of separate but likely subacute
   chronologies. Neuro curbsided.
   -- f/u carotid dopplers
   -- echo with bubble study: No evid PFO
   -- fasting lipids with LDL 109, TC 163, HDL 38
 near goal
   --  A1c 5.7%
   -- should go forward on plavix (stroke considered an ASA failure),
   would d/c ASA per MATCH trial
   -- no PEG given pancreatic inflammation, go post pyloric feeding tube
   #) Failure to Wean, Respiratory failure
 doing well with slow
   progession to tolerating more trach collar.
   -- cont trach collar
   -- continue MIE machine for cough assist, re-expansion of bibasilar
   atelectasis
   #) Fever - possibly due to necrotic pancreatitis. Pancultured [**11-26**],
   with nothing growing from any cultures. Lines have been d/c
   Sinusitis is a possibility as seen on CT head. Abx hx: vanco d/c
ed on
   [**11-23**]; [**Last Name (un) 430**] d/c
ed [**11-26**] after 15 day course.
   -- off all antibiotics since [**12-1**]
   -- has new dobnoff feeding tube
   -- no evidence of HAP/VAP in sputum, CXR without obvious infiltrate
   -- all cultures with NGTD
   -- Surgery/[**Doctor Last Name 2346**]
 no PEG b/c of sig pancreatic inflammation
   # Transaminitis: trended up with resumption of antibiotics, now
   trending down again, argues for medication effect
   -- no need for RUQ U/S as no a surgical candiadate
   # Volume Status
   - was 18L positive LOS after aggressive volume resuscitation
   - was on lasix gtt
 transitition to bolus lasix (40mg IV BID), need to
   titrate to 500-1000ml neg daily
   #) Ileus: Resolved since [**11-25**].
   -- TF resumed (were off overnight)
   #) Hypernatremia
 148 today
   -- resumed  FWB throught NGT
   -- check [**Hospital1 **] Na
   #) Hyperglycemia: had high sugars since being taken off TPN.
   -- calculating total daily insulin requirement sand uptitrating NPH [**Hospital1 **]
   as needed for better control
   #) Renal fucntion
 prerenal vs CIN
   -- repelete FWD with D5W and FWB
   -- trend daily, renally dose meds

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of extensive cardiac issues, admitted with severe gallstone pancreatitis, extensive pancreatic necrosis, ARDS, prolonged ileus, fever, and stroke. 

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including stroke, respiratory failure, fever, transaminitis, volume status issues, ileus, hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, and renal function concerns. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of stroke symptoms, respiratory distress, infection due to the presence of a tracheostomy tube, further pancreatic inflammation, and complications related to hyperglycemia and renal function. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's neurological status for any changes in stroke symptoms, continue with respiratory support as needed, maintain strict glycemic control, and monitor renal function closely."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old individual with necrotizing pancreatitis, ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), ARF (Acute Renal Failure), and other complications. The patient is currently improving but still faces several potential medical complications.

1. Pancreatic necrosis: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis, and there are no plans for surgical debridement at present. Surgical input is appreciated, and the decision to place a PEG (Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy) tube is also being considered based on the extent of necrosis and inflammation in the area.

2. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which is improving now that they are off antibiotics.

3. Fevers: The patient's fevers are improving and have remained low-grade even after stopping antibiotics.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to tolerate the tracheostomy collar and requires ongoing pulmonary toilet. There may be a need for mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE) or a vest device to aid with secretion clearance due to the patient's rapid shallow breathing pattern, which puts them at risk for atelectasis and pneumonia.

5. Renal function: The patient's creatinine levels have remained stable in the range of 1.0-1.4. Hypernatremia is present, and the patient will continue receiving free water boluses. Additionally,"

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo with necrotizing pancreatitis, ARDS, ARF, now improving.
   CVA's:  No clears source of emboli, [**Last Name (un) **] result still pending
     -F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7581**]
     -Continue anti-platelet therapy.
     -Continue statin
    Pancreatic necrosis: Appreciate surgical input.  No plans for any
   debridement at present.
     -Per surgery, no plans for PEG tube placement given extent of
   necrosis/inflammation in the area.
    Transaminitis:  Improving off antibiotics
    Fevers:  Improving and have remained low grade off antibiotics.
   Respiratory failure:  continues to tolerate trach collar.
     -Continue pulmonary toilet. But may need MIE/ Vest device to aid with
   secretion clearance. His rapid shallow breathing pattern puts him at
   risk for atelectasis/ PNA
   Renal:  Creatinine has remained stable in 1.0-1.4 range.
     -Hypernatremic- continue free water boluses.
     -Will put on standing lasix dose.  [**Month (only) 60**] be able to stop lasix in the
   coming days once edema is resolved.
   Diabetes:  Continue to titrate NPH as TF are restarted and increased.
   Rest of plan per Resident Note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old individual with necrotizing pancreatitis, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), ARF (acute renal failure), and other associated complications. The patient's current condition is improving.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to tolerate tracheostomy collar and may require mechanical insufflation/exsufflation (MIE) or a vest device to aid with secretion clearance due to a rapid shallow breathing pattern.

2. Renal issues: The patient's creatinine levels have remained stable between 1.0-1.4, indicating some degree of renal impairment. Hypernatremia is also present, and free water boluses will be continued. Standing lasix dose will be implemented to manage edema, which can be stopped once resolved.

3. Diabetes management: The patient's diabetes needs to be closely monitored and titrate NPH as tube feedings are restarted and increased.

4. Pancreatic necrosis: Surgical input is required for pancreatic necrosis, but no plans for debridement or PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) tube placement at present.

5. Transaminitis: The patient is improving off antibiotics, indicating a potential liver enzyme abnormality that should be monitored.

6. Cardiovascular complications: The absence of murmurs suggests no significant valvular heart disease, but the patient's history of necrotizing"
