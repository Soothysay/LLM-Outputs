   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 year old male with past medical history of atrial
   fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has
   been transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of a GI
   bleed.
   .
   #) GI Bleed: At this time appears to be secondary to small bowel source
   as identified on tagged scan at [**Hospital3 4627**], although could also be
   lower GI source as colonoscopy was obscurred by blood. Differential
   includes duodenal ulcer, Meckel's diverticulum, occult malignancy
   (proximal colon), AVM among other possibilities.
   - Maintain IV access, currently has Cordis in place, will check
   position on CXR. Also has two 18 gage PIV's.
   - Will discuss with GI, surgery, and IR best course of management.
   Suspect will likely repeat endoscopy and/or tagged RBC scan.
   Appreciate assistance from GI, surgery, and IR teams. If continues to
   have melena (had one episode on arrival) may need to go directly to
   angio.
   - Type and screen, cross match 4 units
   - Attempting to get copy of tagged RBC scan study from [**Hospital1 872**].
   - IV PPI drip
   - Monitor HCT Q6-8, transfuse for dropping HCT
   .
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation
   for several years. He has not been anticoagulated for a number of years
   due to alcohol abuse and fall risk. Should not currently be
   anti-coagulated due to bleeding. At home takes atenolol, holding at
   present given mild hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue amiodarone drip for now.
   - Holding ASA, other anticoagulation.
   .
   #) Alcohol withdrawal: Patient has been in hospital since [**2197-4-13**], no
   report of alcohol withdrawal symptoms from OSH.
   - CIWA, valium PRN scores >10
   - Folate, thiamine
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion, monitoring
   #) Hypertension: Holding antihypertensives in setting of on-going GIB
   and question of borderline systolic over last day(s).
   - Holding anti-hypertensives today.
   .
   #) History of B12 anemia: Per sign-out from [**Hospital3 4627**], baseline
   HCT is in low 30's.
   - Continue B12 supplementation, transfusion for acute bleeding.
   #) Fevers, leukocytosis: Noted at OSH, will need to follow up final
   urine and blood cultures from [**Hospital3 4627**].
   - Monitor WBC, fever trend, culture should she spike
   #) Tobacco abuse: Nicotine patches.
   .
   #) FEN: NPO at this time given on-going bleeding, if remains NPO for
   extended period, will need to discuss other nutritional support.
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion given history of alcohol use, atrial
   fibrillation, risk of further electrolyte derrangements and
   arrhythmias.
   - IVF for tachycardia, to compensate losses, low urine output.
   .
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - Pneumoboots
   - IV PPI drip
   - No need for VAP
   .
   #) Code: Full

   #) Emergency Contact: [**Name (NI) **] would not provide any family or friend
   contacts in event of emergency.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. 

The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. GI Bleed: The patient is experiencing a GI bleed, likely secondary to a small bowel source. The differential diagnosis includes duodenal ulcer, Meckel's diverticulum, occult malignancy (proximal colon), arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and other possibilities. The plan involves maintaining IV access, discussing management with the GI, surgery, and interventional radiology (IR) teams, repeating endoscopy, and/or tagged red blood cell (RBC) scan. If the patient continues to have melena, angiography may be needed.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not currently anticoagulated due to alcohol abuse and fall risk. The plan is to continue amiodarone drip for now and hold anti-coagulation.

3. Alcohol Withdrawal: Although there have been no reported symptoms of alcohol withdrawal from the originating hospital, the patient's history of alcohol abuse should be monitored. CIWA and valium PRN scores >10 may indicate the need for treatment.

4. Hypertension: Antihypertensive medications"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 year old male with past medical history of atrial
   fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has
   been transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of a GI
   bleed.
   .
   #) GI Bleed: At this time appears to be secondary to small bowel source
   as identified on tagged scan at [**Hospital3 4627**], although could also be
   lower GI source as colonoscopy was obscurred by blood. Differential
   includes duodenal ulcer, Meckel's diverticulum, occult malignancy
   (proximal colon), AVM among other possibilities.
   - Maintain IV access
 will get another 16g, and take out cordis
   - Will discuss with GI, surgery, and IR best course of management.
   - Will likely pursue  tagged RBC scan.
   - change to IV BID ppi
   - moniter hct q8
   .
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation
   for several years. He has not been anticoagulated for a number of years
   due to alcohol abuse and fall risk. Should not currently be
   anti-coagulated due to bleeding. At home takes atenolol, holding at
   present given mild hypotension at OSH.
   - d/c amiodarone
   - Holding ASA, other anticoagulation.
   - metoprol as needed
   .
   #) Alcohol withdrawal: Patient has been in hospital since [**2197-4-13**], no
   report of alcohol withdrawal symptoms from OSH.
   - CIWA, valium PRN scores >10
   - Folate, thiamine
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion, monitoring
   #) Hypertension: Holding antihypertensives in setting of on-going GIB
   and question of borderline systolic over last day(s).
   - Holding anti-hypertensives today.
   .
   #) History of B12 anemia: Per sign-out from [**Hospital3 4627**], baseline
   HCT is in low 30's.
   - Continue B12 supplementation, transfusion for acute bleeding.
   #) Fevers, leukocytosis: Noted at OSH, will need to follow up final
   urine and blood cultures from [**Hospital3 4627**].
   - Monitor WBC, fever trend, culture should she spike
   #) Tobacco abuse: Nicotine patches.
   .
   #) FEN: NPO at this time given on-going bleeding, if remains NPO for
   extended period, will need to discuss other nutritional support.
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion given history of alcohol use, atrial
   fibrillation, risk of further electrolyte derrangements and
   arrhythmias.
   - IVF for tachycardia, to compensate losses, low urine output.
   - checking ionized Ca
   .
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - Pneumoboots
   - No need for VAP
   #) Code: Full
   #) Emergency Contact: [**Name (NI) **] would not provide any family or friend
   contacts in event of emergency.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 year old male with past medical history of atrial
   fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has
   been transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of a GI
   bleed.
   .
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB): At this time appears
   to be secondary to small bowel source as identified on tagged scan at
   [**Hospital3 4627**], although could also be lower GI source as colonoscopy
   was obscurred by blood. Differential includes duodenal ulcer, Meckel's
   diverticulum, occult malignancy (proximal colon), AVM among other
   possibilities.
   - Maintain IV access
 will get another 16g, and take out cordis
   - Will discuss with GI, surgery, and IR best course of management.
   - Will likely pursue  tagged RBC scan.
   - change to IV BID ppi
   - moniter hct q8
   .
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Patient has a history of atrial
   fibrillation for several years. He has not been anticoagulated for a
   number of years due to alcohol abuse and fall risk. Should not
   currently be anti-coagulated due to bleeding. At home takes atenolol,
   holding at present given mild hypotension at OSH.
   - d/c amiodarone
   - Holding ASA, other anticoagulation.
   - metoprol as needed
   .
   #
 .H/O ALCOHOL ABUSE: Patient has been in hospital since [**2197-4-13**], no
   report of alcohol withdrawal symptoms from OSH.
   - CIWA, valium PRN scores >10
   - Folate, thiamine
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion, monitoring
   #) Hypertension: Holding antihypertensives in setting of on-going GIB
   and question of borderline systolic over last day(s).
   - Holding anti-hypertensives today.
   .
   #) History of B12 anemia: Per sign-out from [**Hospital3 4627**], baseline
   HCT is in low 30's.
   - Continue B12 supplementation, transfusion for acute bleeding.
   #) Fevers, leukocytosis: Noted at OSH, will need to follow up final
   urine and blood cultures from [**Hospital3 4627**].
   - Monitor WBC, fever trend, culture should she spike
   #) Tobacco abuse: Nicotine patches.
   .
   #) FEN: NPO at this time given on-going bleeding, if remains NPO for
   extended period, will need to discuss other nutritional support.
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion given history of alcohol use, atrial
   fibrillation, risk of further electrolyte derrangements and
   arrhythmias.
   - IVF for tachycardia, to compensate losses, low urine output.
   - checking ionized Ca

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. He was transferred from another hospital for further management of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), a heart rate of 119 beats per minute, blood pressure of 96/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is alert and oriented, but slightly agitated with tangential speech. Physical examination findings include pale conjunctiva, no scleral icterus, slightly dry mouth, poor dentition, supple neck, flat jugular venous pressure, clear lungs, irregular and tachycardic heart rhythm, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, warm extremities without edema, dried blood over hands, and normal neurologic examination. Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 25.2%, leukocyte count of 6.4 thousand/mm³, platelet count of 140 thousand/mm³, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 94 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia.
