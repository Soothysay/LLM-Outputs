   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Cryoprecipitate given at 2am b/c of +DIC labs.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * changed ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.
     * 4x loose maroon stools ON

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] new portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  Unfortunately given severe
   LGIB [**1-5**] ulcerative colitis she is not a candidate for
   anticoagulation.  Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory
   ascites.  Pleural fluid with many WBCs, may be from inflammation.  No
   organisms seen on gram stain.  Likely represents ascites fluid but when
   thinking of SBT may be falsely elevated due to blood in pleural space
   vs. inflammation.
   - needs CT of abdomen to assess vasculature for potential
   transplantation
   - albumin 50gm IV X 1 now with sodium bicarb for renal protection
   - paracentesis today to assess for SBP
   - f/u with hepatology, GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue CTX to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]), awaiting results of
   paracentesis
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: platelets 30 with INR 1.8.  Likely
   secondary to liver disease.  Active bleeding with melanotic stools.
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Some pain at site of chest tube (L
   shoulder)
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - one blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.
    -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   - will get Chest CT today to assess for staph abcesses given positive
   cultures
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic
   hypotension.
   -continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - continue prednisone 20 mg TID
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - will be due for remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**])
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse prn with goal HCT >28 given
   continue bleeing.
   -per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today
   . .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and refractory ascites. She was transferred to the ICU due to acute hepatic decompensation and anemia. On admission, she had a large left pneumothorax, which prompted an emergent CT placement. She also has thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy with a platelet count of 30 and INR of 1.8, likely secondary to liver disease. The patient is experiencing active bleeding with melena and will need to be closely monitored. She has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is currently stable on IV fluids. She also has a positive blood culture for coag positive Staphylococcus aureus, and her line has been changed. She has been diagnosed with severe/refractory ulcerative colitis despite steroid treatment. Her current medications include lactulose, rifaximin, ursodiol, and prednisone. She will need further evaluation and treatment by hepatology, GI, and transplant surgery teams. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 132/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 5 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her blood glucose level is 143 mg/dL, white blood cell count is"

   Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn: intra-abdominal,
   paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small bowel thickening
   (likely related to ascites and venous congestion from splanchnic
   thrombus).
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis.  Patient with worsening
   mental status. Lactulose held last night in setting of UGI bleed,
   likely contributing to depressed mental status today.
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - additional hepatology recs: avoid morphine, give neupogen, hold 6-MP,
   Remicaid
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   -if suspect variceal bleed, start octreotide drip and call hepatology
   asap (as per liver fellow recs)
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen last night.  Hematology consulted
   last night during episode of acute bleed.  Peripheral smear with
   schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.  Platelets down to
   13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of platelets last night
   w/acute bleed, platelets 27 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units and 1 unit
   of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs.  No PRBC given yesterday
   b/c HCt maintained.   Bleeding from NG, foley has eased up, but patient
   has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and bloody fluid from chest
   tube.  INR 1.8.  Neupogen given yesterday.
   -  1 unit platelets now
   - 2 U PRBC now
   - to consider FFP
   - re-check DIC labs (FDP, fibrinogen) -> consider cryoprecipitate based
   on results
   - repeat coags, Ch10 in am
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   - f/u hematology recs
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -continue to monitor on tele
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**]) in setting of
   pancytopenia.
   - hold 6MP in setting of pancytopenia
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse PRBC, FFP, platelets prn with
   goal HCT >28 given continue bleeing.
   - per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, UC/PSC, severe LGIB, h/o HIT, and acute decompensated hepatic failure. She presented with a large left pneumothorax, and CT placement was done. She has been diagnosed with acute hepatic decompensation, likely secondary to portal vein thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission. The patient also has thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, likely due to liver disease complicated by DIC/sepsis. She has been treated empirically with ceftriaxone for suspected SBP, switched to cefepime for broadened coverage. She is not a candidate for anticoagulation due to severe LGIB from ulcerative colitis. The patient has Staph bacteremia, with positive blood cultures for coag-positive SA. She has undergone chest tube placement for a pneumothorax, which has resolved. She also has atrial fibrillation/flutter, currently being managed with IV fluids. The patient has a history of refractory ulcerative colitis despite steroid treatment and has been on remicade. She has pancytopenia, likely due to marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy and DIC. She has had multiple episodes of GI bleeding, and her coagulation profile is abnormal with an INR of 1.8. She requires platelet transfusion, FFP, and PRBC transfusion as needed to maintain a hematocrit of >28%."

   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * change ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV

       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] new portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  Unfortunately given severe
   LGIB [**1-5**] ulcerative colitis she is not a candidate for
   anticoagulation.  Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory
   ascites.  Pleural fluid with many WBCs, may be from inflammation.  No
   organisms seen on gram stain.  Likely represents ascites fluid but when
   thinking of SBT may be falsely elevated due to blood in pleural space
   vs. inflammation.
   - needs CT of abdomen to assess vasculature for potential
   transplantation
   - albumin 50gm IV X 1 now with sodium bicarb for renal protection
   - paracentesis today to assess for SBP
   - f/u with hepatology, GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue CTX to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]), awaiting results of
   paracentesis
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: platelets 30 with INR 1.8.  Likely
   secondary to liver disease.  Active bleeding with melanotic stools.
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Some pain at site of chest tube (L
   shoulder)
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - one blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.
    -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   - will get Chest CT today to assess for staph abcesses given positive
   cultures
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic
   hypotension.
   -continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - continue prednisone 20 mg TID
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - will be due for remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**])
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse prn with goal HCT >28 given
   continue bleeing.
   -per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today

   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and portal vein thrombosis. She presented to the ICU with acute decompensated hepatic failure and anemia. The patient had a large left pneumothorax and was transferred to the ICU for emergent care. 

The patient's current condition includes acute hepatic decompensation, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 30, coagulopathy with an INR of 1.8, and active bleeding with melena. The patient also has a pneumothorax that has been treated with chest tube placement and is showing signs of improvement. Additionally, the patient has a history of Staph bacteremia and atrial fibrillation/flutter.

The patient's medical history includes severe refractory ulcerative colitis, for which she has received steroid treatment and infusions of Remicade. She is currently on prednisone and awaiting another infusion of Remicade.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 132/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a"

   HPI:
     * Were planning to do Dx paracentisis but platelets 13. Wanted to
       give platelets but as per transfusion medicine platelet transfusion
       contraindicated in HIT-Ab positive patients unless patient acutely
       bleeding. Decided to defer paracentisis esp since already treating
       empirically.
     * Called by nurse for patient w/BRB from NG tube - approx 200cc ->
       foley and chest tube also draining blood-tinged fluid.  Called
       hepatology, heme-onc.  Thought likely DIC - DIC labs sent.  Gave
       FFP x2 units, platelets, ordered 2 units prbc but did not give.
     * Cryoprecipitate given at 2am b/c of +DIC labs.
     * Hematology recs: pancytopenia is likely a combination of DIC +
       marrow suppression from immunosuppressive therapy used for UC. send
       labs for DIC and correcting coagulopathy (cryoglobulin for
       fibrinogen <100, FFP for INR >2.0, and platelets for any active
       bleeding or for platelet count <10,000). Can also try vitamin K,
       but unclear how helpful this will be as liver is likely not making
       clotting factors at this time. Also discussed with team that
       patient is likely neutropenic (ANC was 970 earlier today, but WBC
       has since dropped further) so would
     * changed ceftriaxone to cefepime for the time being to broaden
       coverage
     * CT abdomen/Pelvis: progression of splanchnic thrombus, now
       occluding L and R portal veins. Focal thrombus w/in the dilated SMV
       at the SMV-portal vein confluence. The SMV is still patent,
       however.  Some increase in ascites.  Signs of portal-htn:
       intra-abdominal, paraesophageal varices and splenomegally.  Small
       bowel thickening (likely related to ascites and venous congestion
       from splanchnic thrombus).
     * Patient with Afib w/RVR overnight. Did not want to use BB or CCB
       b/c of potential for hemmorhage and drop in BP. Gave fluids, HR
       stabilized.
     * 1 episode of BRBPR at 1:30am - Hct re-sent
     * Spoke with family, updated them [1]of the patient's condition.
     * 4x loose maroon stools ON

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] new portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  Unfortunately given severe
   LGIB [**1-5**] ulcerative colitis she is not a candidate for
   anticoagulation.  Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory
   ascites.  Pleural fluid with many WBCs, may be from inflammation.  No
   organisms seen on gram stain.  Likely represents ascites fluid but when
   thinking of SBT may be falsely elevated due to blood in pleural space
   vs. inflammation.
   - needs CT of abdomen to assess vasculature for potential
   transplantation
   - albumin 50gm IV X 1 now with sodium bicarb for renal protection
   - paracentesis today to assess for SBP
   - f/u with hepatology, GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue CTX to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]), awaiting results of
   paracentesis
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: platelets 30 with INR 1.8.  Likely
   secondary to liver disease.  Active bleeding with melanotic stools.
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Some pain at site of chest tube (L
   shoulder)
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - one blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.
    -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   - will get Chest CT today to assess for staph abcesses given positive
   cultures
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic
   hypotension.
   -continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - continue prednisone 20 mg TID
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - will be due for remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**])
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse prn with goal HCT >28 given
   continue bleeing.
   -per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today
   . .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 1 PIV

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute decompensated hepatic failure. She was transferred to the ICU due to a large left pneumothorax and concerns for tension pneumothorax. She underwent emergent chest tube placement and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC: The patient has new portal vein thrombosis seen on RUQ ultrasound. She is not a candidate for anticoagulation due to severe LGIB from ulcerative colitis. Other possibilities could include SBP or inflammation of the pleural fluid.
2. Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: The patient has a platelet count of 30 with an INR of 1.8, likely secondary to liver disease. She is experiencing active bleeding with melena.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient had a slowly developing left pneumothorax, possibly progressing to hemodynamic compromise. She underwent chest tube placement and has re-expansion of her left lung.
4. Staph Bacteremia: One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL is positive for coag-positive SA. The central line has been changed.
5. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: The patient has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter with rates up to"

   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   61 yo women with UC and PBC admitted with MRSA bacteremia,
   pancytopenia.
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient with blood from NG tube and blood from urine.  However Hct
   remained stable.  Seen by heme who felt that she probably had component
   of DIC, and gave recommendations for transfusion.    Got cryo for
   fibrinogen of 111.  Had AF with increased HR overnight then reverted to
   sinus rhythm.  MS poor this morning.  Is somewhat somnolent with
   decreased RR.    Received boluses of morphine.

   MRSA bacteremia:  Given that pleural fluid is also + for MRSA, this

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old woman with underlying conditions such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) admitted to the ICU with MRSA bacteremia and pancytopenia. The patient has experienced several complications during her stay in the ICU, including blood from the NG tube and blood from urine, which may indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient also has atrial fibrillation (AF), impaired skin integrity, liver function abnormalities, and acute pain.

The patient's vital signs show a stable hemoglobin concentration (Hct), but with decreased respiratory rate (RR) and increased heart rate (HR). The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, analgesics, and supportive care medications.

Laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 31 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, and leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2.3 K/uL. The coagulation profile shows prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), along with a low fibrinogen level. Other lab results show elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's microorganisms are positive for MRSA in pleural fluid and blood"

","The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) admitted to the ICU for MRSA bacteremia and pancytopenia. The patient has been experiencing blood from the NG tube and blood from urine, suggesting a potential component of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Fibrinogen levels are low, which supports this diagnosis. The patient also has atrial fibrillation (AF) with increased heart rate overnight, but reverted to sinus rhythm. Mental status is poor, and the patient is somnolent with decreased respiratory rate. She received boluses of morphine.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise. Firstly, there is a risk of further bleeding due to the low platelet count and coagulopathy. Transfusion of platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and cryoprecipitate may be necessary for supportive care. Secondly, the patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections. Thirdly, the patient has liver function abnormalities due to primary biliary cirrhosis. Monitoring for variceal bleeding is important in patients with cirrhosis. Fourthly, the patient has an MRSA bacteremia, and further investigation with an echocardiogram is needed to examine the valves, as MRSA can lead to endocarditis. Lastly,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis.  Patient with worsening
   mental status. Lactulose held last night in setting of UGI bleed,
   likely contributing to depressed mental status today.
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - additional hepatology recs: avoid morphine, give neupogen, hold 6-MP,
   Remicaid
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue lactulose, rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   -if hepatic failure improves would benefit from TIPS given portal vein
   thrombosis
   -if suspect variceal bleed, start octreotide drip and call hepatology
   asap (as per liver fellow recs)
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen last night.  Hematology consulted
   last night during episode of acute bleed.  Peripheral smear with
   schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.  Platelets down to
   13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of platelets last night
   w/acute bleed, platelets 27 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units and 1 unit
   of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs.  No PRBC given yesterday
   b/c HCt maintained.   Bleeding from NG, foley has eased up, but patient
   has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and bloody fluid from chest
   tube.  INR 1.8.  Neupogen given yesterday.
   -  1 unit platelets now
   - 2 U PRBC now
   - to consider FFP
   - re-check DIC labs (FDP, fibrinogen) -> consider cryoprecipitate based
   on results
   - repeat coags, Ch10 in am
   - will recheck CBC in the afternoon and consider platelet transfusion
   and FFP
   - f/u hematology recs
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -serial blood cultures
   -check echo for potential source
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -monitor serial CXR's
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] reccs
   -when patient leaves to go to CT, will place on wall suction per CT
   surgery, will place back on suction and get repeat CXR this afternoon
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -continue to monitor on tele
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade this week (last infused on [**10-10**]) in setting of
   pancytopenia.
   - hold 6MP in setting of pancytopenia
   - GI team aware and will see patient
   - continue to monitor HCT and transfuse PRBC, FFP, platelets prn with
   goal HCT >28 given continue bleeing.
   - per liver team consider KUB if develops increased bleeding to r/o
   toxic megacolon but will get CT scan today
   . .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 2 PIV (22 and 20 gauge). Should consider placing
   larger bore IV for resuscitation before acute decompensation occurs.
   .
   #Code status: presumed Full Code. Should discuss with family in light
   of current health issues.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis, which can lead to hepatic decompensation. The presence of intrahepatic and esophageal varices indicates a high risk for variceal bleeding.

2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has a history of refractory ascites, which is a risk factor for SBP. Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone has been initiated, but further evaluation and management are needed.

3. Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: The patient has low platelet counts and coagulation abnormalities, likely secondary to liver disease and possibly exacerbated by sepsis. Platelet transfusion and FFP have been given, but ongoing monitoring and management are necessary.

4. Staph bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Line change has been done, but the primary source of bacteremia remains unclear. Serial blood cultures and further investigation are required.

5. Pneumothorax: The patient had a pneumothorax that required chest tube placement. Ongoing monitoring and follow-up with serial chest X-rays are needed to ensure resolution of the pneumothorax.

6. Atrial Fibrillation"

   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis. Confirmed with Hepatology
   that even if patient recovers from bactermia/DIC, she will unlikely be
   a transplant candidate in the future.  Patient with worsening mental
   status. Lactulose given yesterday after UGI bleed ceased, mental status
   slightly improved this am (reported period of lucidity last night by on
   call person).  Family meeting w/team, hepatology, family decided to
   make patient [**Month/Day (2) 617**].  No further blood products to be given or invasive
   procedures to be performed as of 1600 on [**10-30**] (there is a note in the
   chart further clarifying this decision/discussion).
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen.  Hematology consulted.  Peripheral
   smear with schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.
   Platelets down to 13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of
   platelets two days ago w/acute bleed, 1 unit of platelets and 2U of
   PRBC yesterday. Platelets down to 16 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units
   and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs two days ago.  No
   PRBC given yesterday b/c HCt maintained.   No bleeding from NG, foley
   for last 24h, but patient has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and
   bloody fluid from chest tube.  INR 1.6.  Neupogen given two days ago
   and WBC today is 0.9.   This morning before patient was made [**Month/Day/Year 617**] she
   was given 1U of platelets.  DIC labs improved yesterday.
   -Because patient is [**Last Name (LF) 617**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] d/c serial Hcts, will not give any more
   platelets, FFP, or PRBCs.
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -d/c serial blood cultures
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -d/c serial CXR's
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade, 6MP
   .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 2 PIV (22 and 20 gauge).
   .
   #Code status: DNR/DNI after discussion over last 24 hours. [**Month/Day (4) 617**] now w/no

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications and conditions. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis. This condition may lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.

2. Severe Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding (LGIB): The patient has a history of severe LGIB due to ulcerative colitis. This can result in significant blood loss and anemia, leading to hypotension and shock.

3. Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: The patient has low platelet count and prolonged clotting time due to liver disease and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This increases the risk of bleeding and bruising.

4. Staph Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus, indicating a bloodstream infection. This can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not appropriately managed.

5. Pneumothorax: The patient had a large left pneumothorax, which required chest tube placement. If left untreated, it could have progressed to tension pneumothorax and compromised hemodynamic stability.

6. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: The patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with underlying conditions such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). She has a history of MRSA sepsis and is currently in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is hypotension and oliguria.

The patient developed respiratory distress during colloid resuscitation but responded to Lasix. However, she then developed atrial fibrillation (AF) and received a 250cc normal saline bolus, after which she improved. The patient refused platelets yesterday and also refused a chest X-ray.

The patient has several allergies, including Demerol, morphine sulfate, and heparin agents. Her last doses of antibiotics were ceftriaxone, vancomycin, rifampin, and cefepime.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/75 mmHg to 110/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination revealed no acute distress, jaundice, and warm skin. Her cardiovascular examination showed normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and her respiratory examination showed crackles in both lungs. The abdominal examination showed non-tender, distended abdomen, and her extremities were edemat"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis. Confirmed with Hepatology
   that even if patient recovers from bactermia/DIC, she will unlikely be
   a transplant candidate in the future.  Patient with worsening mental
   status. Lactulose given yesterday after UGI bleed ceased, mental status
   slightly improved this am (reported period of lucidity last night by on
   call person).  Family meeting w/team, hepatology, family decided to
   make patient [**Month/Day (2) 617**].  No further blood products to be given or invasive
   procedures to be performed as of 1600 on [**10-30**] (there is a note in the
   chart further clarifying this decision/discussion).
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]) [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   d/c at some point but not currently.
   -continue rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen.  Hematology consulted.  Peripheral
   smear with schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.
   Platelets down to 13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of
   platelets two days ago w/acute bleed, 1 unit of platelets and 2U of
   PRBC yesterday. Platelets down to 16 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units
   and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs two days ago.  No
   PRBC given yesterday b/c HCt maintained.   No bleeding from NG, foley
   for last 24h, but patient has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and
   bloody fluid from chest tube.  INR 1.6.  Neupogen given two days ago
   and WBC today is 0.9.   This morning before patient was made [**Month (only) 617**] she
   was given 1U of platelets.  DIC labs improved yesterday.
   -Because patient is [**Last Name (LF) 617**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] d/c serial Hcts, will not give any more
   platelets, FFP, or PRBCs.
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]. [**Month (only) 60**] consider d/c at some point but
   not currently.
   -d/c serial blood cultures
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -d/c serial CXR's
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade, 6MP
   .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS. D/C ISS and finger sticks to check
   blood glucose b/c have been normal (and patient is [**Month/Day (4) 617**]).
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 2 PIV (22 and 20 gauge). Not to replace if fall
   out.
   .
   #Code status: DNR/DNI after discussion over last 24 hours. [**Month/Day (4) 617**] now w/no

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, severe ulcerative colitis, and acute hepatic decompensation. She has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's condition has deteriorated, leading to a family meeting where they agreed to DNR/DNI, no further blood products, no invasive procedures, and no escalation of care. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, blood pressure of 128/75 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, somnolence, and confusion. She has a left-sided chest tube draining serosanguenous fluid, as well as ecchymosis over the anterior chest wall. Breath sounds are present bilaterally with crackles and coarse sounds at the left apex. The patient also has 3+ pitting edema in both knees, occasional ecchymoses, and spider angiomas.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 0.7 K/µL, hemoglobin of 27%, platelet count of 13 K/µL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 143 to 161 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal portal vein thrombosis,"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, severe ulcerative colitis, and acute decompensated hepatic failure. She has been transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and found to have a large left pneumothorax. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors:

1. Acute Hepatic Decompensation: The patient has evidence of portal vein thrombosis on RUQ ultrasound and CT. This is likely causing her acute hepatic decompensation. She is not a candidate for anticoagulation due to severe LGIB (ulcerative colitis). Another possibility could be spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), but the patient has refractory ascites and cannot undergo paracentesis. Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone and later switched to cefepime has been initiated. The patient is not a transplant candidate currently due to UC and sepsis.

2. Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: The patient has a low platelet count of 13, which is likely secondary to liver disease and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has received Neupogen, a growth factor to stimulate platelet production, and FFP (fresh frozen plasma) and cryoprecipitate have been given to correct coagulopathy. No further blood products will be given.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6410**] is a 61 yo F w/cirrhosis [**1-5**] UC/PSC, severe LGIB [**1-5**] UC,
   h/o HIT transferred from OSH with acute decompensated hepatic failure
   and anemia, found to have large left pneumothorax with concern for
   progression to tension PTX prompting emergent ICU transfer and CT
   placement.
   .
   #Acute Hepatic Decompensation/PBC - most likely [**1-5**] portal vein
   thrombosis seen on RUQ u/s on admission.  CT showed that clot extended.
   SMV still has some flow. Bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and
   esophageal varices noted as well.  Unfortunately given severe LGIB [**1-5**]
   ulcerative colitis patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.
   Other possiblity could be SBP given h/o refractory ascites.  Could not
   tap b/c of low platelets but treating empirically with ceftriaxone.
   Switched to Cefipime for broadened coverage.  Not a transplant
   candidate currently due to UC and sepsis. Confirmed with Hepatology
   that even if patient recovers from bactermia/DIC, she will unlikely be
   a transplant candidate in the future.  Patient with worsening mental
   status. Lactulose given yesterday after UGI bleed ceased, mental status
   slightly improved this am (reported period of lucidity last night by on
   call person).  Family meeting w/team, hepatology, family decided to
   make patient [**Month/Day (2) 617**].  No further blood products to be given or invasive
   procedures to be performed as of 1600 on [**10-30**] (there is a note in the
   chart further clarifying this decision/discussion).
   - give lactulose as BP tolerates, hold if multiple BMs as per
   hepatology
s recommendation.
   - hold paracentesis and treat empirically for SBP
   - f/u with GI and transplant surgery recommendations
   -continue cefipime to cover for SBP (day #1 = [**2193-10-26**])
   -continue rifaxamin, ursodiol as tolerated
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disease c/w
   DIC/sepsis.  Patient given Neupogen.  Hematology consulted.  Peripheral
   smear with schisocytes, several other types of dysmorphic RBCs.
   Platelets down to 13 in setting of acute bleed. Given 1 unit of
   platelets two days ago w/acute bleed, 1 unit of platelets and 2U of
   PRBC yesterday. Platelets down to 16 this am.  Also give FFP x2 units
   and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate given positive DIC labs two days ago.  No
   PRBC given yesterday b/c HCt maintained.   No bleeding from NG, foley
   for last 24h, but patient has had several melanotic stools/BRBPR and
   bloody fluid from chest tube.  INR 1.6.  Neupogen given two days ago
   and WBC today is 0.9.   This morning before patient was made [**Month/Day/Year 617**] she
   was given 1U of platelets.  DIC labs improved yesterday.
   -Because patient is [**Last Name (LF) 617**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] d/c serial Hcts, will not give any more
   platelets, FFP, or PRBCs.
   .
   # Staph bacteremia - One blood culture bottle from OSH drawn from CVL
   is positive.  Culture here positive for coag positive SA in [**3-8**]
   bottles.  Line changed.  Chest CT showed no abcesses, although pleural
   fluid had many WBCs, now growing G+ cocci.  Skin exam shows no foci for
   bacteremia, though patient has Hx of MRSA skin infections.  Still
   unclear primary source of bacteremia.
   -continue vanc, day #1 = [**2193-10-26**]
   -d/c serial blood cultures
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely slowly developing following placement of L
   subclavian line at OSH given no PTX, possibly progressing to
   hemodynamic compromise resulting in tachycardia and hypotension on the
   floor.  Now s/p chest tube placement with post CT xray showing
   reexpansion of her left lung.  Chest CT showed residual pneumothorax,
   but chest tube was sealed while at CT.  Again, post CT xray showed no
   pneumothorax.
   -continue chest tube to suction
   -d/c serial CXR's
   .
   #Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter - she has been going in and out PAF with
   rate up to 150's, BP stable since CT placed.  Has resolved with IVF,
   have avoided rate controlling agents for now given episodic hypotension
   and GI bleeding
   -IVF for tachycardia.
   .
   #. Ulcerative colitis: She has severe/refractory disease despite
   steroid treatment. Recently finished a course of cipro/flagyl as
   inpt/oupt.  Recently treated with remicaid on [**10-10**] followed by
   prednisone.
   - changed to stress dose hydrocoritsone
   - d/c mesalamine per liver reccs
   - hold remicade, 6MP
   .
   # FEN: NGT placed for tube feed to improve nutrition status, regular
   diet as well, replete lytes prn HRS
   .
   # Access: EJ in place, 2 PIV (22 and 20 gauge).
   .
   #Code status: DNR/DNI after discussion over last 24 hours. [**Month/Day (4) 617**] now w/no
   blood products to be given.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 61-year-old female with cirrhosis, severe ulcerative colitis, and a history of HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia).
- She was transferred to the ICU due to acute decompensated hepatic failure and anemia.
- The patient has a large left pneumothorax with concern for progression to tension pneumothorax.
- She also has evidence of portal vein thrombosis, bowel wall thickening, intrahepatic, and esophageal varices.
- The patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation due to severe LGIB (lower gastrointestinal bleeding) from ulcerative colitis.
- Other possible causes of her condition include SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) or DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation).
- The patient's mental status has been worsening, and lactulose has been given to manage hepatic encephalopathy.
- Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy are likely secondary to liver disease complicated by DIC.
- Blood cultures have shown Staph bacteremia, and the central venous line was changed.
- The patient underwent chest tube placement for a pneumothorax and has since had reexpansion of her left lung.
- She has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid heart rates, but her blood pressure has been stable.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint. The patient's family has agreed to no further blood transfusions, no more blood draws, and no escalation of care but continue with antibiotics. The patient continues to pass blood-tinged brownish red secretions per rectum (BRBPR).

The patient has allergies to Demerol (Injection), morphine sulfate, and heparin agents due to a positive HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). The last doses of antibiotics administered were ceftriaxone, rifampin, cefepime, and vancomycin.

The patient is receiving various infusions including pantoprazole (Protonix) and other medications. There are no changes to the patient's medical and family history.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/75 to 139/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 1,811 mL in and 1,825 mL out with a net loss of 14 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and arterial blood gas (ABG)"

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and cirrhosis. She was admitted to the ICU with MRSA sepsis and has since developed gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) overnight. The decision was made to pull back on care, discontinuing blood products and blood draws. The patient has allergies to Demerol, morphine sulfate, and heparin agents. She is on multiple medications including vancomycin, cefepime, pantoprazole, cholestyramine, rifaximin, lactulose, ursodeoxycholic acid, silymarin, and hydrocortisone. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/77 mmHg to 139/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals jaundice, warm skin, and soft distended abdomen. The patient is alert and oriented, but her neurologic assessment could not be completed due to her condition. Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.7 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 27. The patient's blood cultures grew"
