   Assessment and Plan
   36 year-old gentleman with history of smoking and hemoptysis who was
   recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass who comes with hemoptysis
   and a pulmonary embolus for anticoagulation.
   .
   #. Pulmonary embolus - Small provoked PE in the left upper lobe
   segmental artery. It is unclear how much the mass effect compressing
   the L pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins is contributing to low
   flow and stasis, versus hypercoagulable state secondary to malignancy.
   Patient was initially anticoagulated with heparin.  LENIs showed no
   evidence of DVT.
   - discuss with Radiology regarding if clot may be [**2-10**] tumor
   compression; if so, consider d/c of heparin gtt
   - d/c heparin gtt for now pending final decision if repeat biopsy is to
   be pursued
   .
   # hemoptysis
 Appears to be resolving.  Most likely source is mass
   given proximity with airway.  No clear evidence of fistula.  Currently
   breathing comfortably.

   #. Mediastinal mass - Patient has a mediastinal mass of ~14 cm X ~5
   cm.  He is a smoker with 22 pack-year.  By location differential
   diagnosis includes lymphoma, thymoma, angiomatous tumor.  He has
   history of reflux so esophageal cancer is in the differential, but not
   likely.  Germ cell tumor are very common in this age group.  Primary
   lung cancer is very unlikely.

","The patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of smoking and hemoptysis who was recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass. He presents with hemoptysis and a pulmonary embolus for anticoagulation. The patient has been anticoagulated with heparin, but there is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on lower extremity venous Doppler (LENS). The hemoptysis appears to be resolving, and the most likely source is the mass given its proximity to the airway. There is no clear evidence of a fistula, and the patient is breathing comfortably.

The patient has a mediastinal mass measuring approximately 14 cm x 5 cm. By location, the differential diagnosis includes lymphoma, thymoma, angiomatous tumor, and germ cell tumor. Primary lung cancer is unlikely. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.2, hemoglobin (Hct) of 28.7, platelet count (Plt) of 301, creatinine (Cr) of 0.8, glucose level of 101, and other lab values within normal ranges.

The patient stopped smoking three weeks ago. He continues to have bibasilar crackles in his lungs, and his left lung sounds slightly quieter. No masses or hepatosplenomegaly are noted on abdominal examination. Clubbing of the fingers is present. Neurologic examination"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old man with a history of smoking and hemoptysis, recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass. He was admitted to the ICU for anticoagulation due to a pulmonary embolus. The patient's current condition is stable, with resolving hemoptysis. He is currently on heparin for anticoagulation and has been given a large-bore IV access. The mediastinal mass is approximately 14 cm x 5 cm and could potentially be a lymphoma, thymoma, angiomatous tumor, or germ cell tumor. Further workup, including bronchoscopy and biopsy, is planned to determine the exact nature of the mass. The patient has stopped smoking three weeks ago and is currently being managed with pain medication, antibiotics for DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and elevation of the head of bed to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU pending further management decisions.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pulmonary embolus: The patient has already experienced a small provoked PE in the left upper lobe segmental artery. It is unclear how much the mediastinal mass is contributing to low flow and stasis in the pulmonary arteries versus the patient's hypercoagulable state secondary to malignancy.
2. Hemoptysis: Although the patient's hemoptysis appears to be resolving"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 453**] [**Known lastname 14231**] is a very nice 36 year-old gentleman with history
   of smoking and hemoptysis who was recently diagnosed with a mediastinal
   mass who comes with hemoptysis and a pulmonary embolus for
   anticoagulation.
   .
   #. Pulmonary embolus - Small provoked PE in the left upper lobe
   segmental artery. It is unclear how much the mass effect compressing
   the L pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins is contributing to low
   flow and stasis, versus hypercoagulable state secondary to malignancy.
   Patient has a mass and hemoptysis with normal coagulation profile, that
   makes managing challenging. IP was consulted and decided in
   anticoagulate with heparin and monitor in ICU. F/u LENIs to assess clot
   burden; if severe may not be able to stop anticoagulation for
   procedures.
   - F/u LENIs --> no dvt
   - Gentle heparin gtt --> consider d/c
   - Sitch to lovenox given malignancy once management of mass is decided
   (i.e. bronch, versus biopsy) until remision of cancer
   - Guaiac stools
   - HCT q8 hrs
   - Stop heparin gtt 5 hours prior to bronchoscopy
   .
   #. Hemoptysis - Patient with pulmonary embolus (small) and a very large
   mediastinal mass. He has been having hemoptysis for ~1 month and now is
   s/p CT-guided biopsy. The most likely source in the mass given its
   proximity with the airway. NO clear evidence of fistula are seen. He is
   breathing comfortably. Now he may be at higher risk of bleeding given
   heparin gtt.
   - Monitor in ICU
   - Intubate for ariway protection if bleeding
   - Bronchoscopy in AM vs f/u OSH bx
   - If major bleeding consider embolization
   - 2 Large IVs
   - T&S with 2 units crossmatched
   - Stop heparin gtt 5 hours prior to bronchoscopy
   .
   #. Mediastinal mass - Patient has a mediastinal mass of ~14 cm X ~5 cm.
   He is a smoker with 22 pack-year. By location differential diagnosis
   includes lymphoma, thymoma, angiomatous tumor. He has history of reflux
   so esophageal cancer is in the differential, but not likely. Germ cell
   tumor are very common in this age group. Primary lung cancer is very
   unlikely.
   - TSH --> 2.2
   - Serum calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone -->  9.4, 4.3, 15
   - Alpha fetoprotein --> 1.3
   - beta human chorionic gonadotropin -->  < 2
   - Consider Fractionated 24-hour urinary metanephrines and
   catecholamines
   - Bronchoscopy and biopsy in AM
   - Follow up final path report from [**Location (un) 755**]
   - Onc consult once pathology results back
   - Stop heparin gtt 5 hours prior to bronchoscopy
   .
   #. Smoking - Patient stopped smoking 3 weeks ago.
   .
   #. GERD - Continue tums for now.
   .
   #. FEN - NPO.
   .
   #. Access - PIV.

   #. Dispo - ICU for now until HCT stable, no hemoptysis and possible
   bronch.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old gentleman with a history of smoking and hemoptysis, recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass. He was admitted for anticoagulation due to a pulmonary embolus in the left upper lobe. The patient has been experiencing hemoptysis for about a month, and a CT-guided biopsy has been performed. The most likely source of the hemoptysis is the mass, which is located near the airway. The patient is currently stable and breathing comfortably. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolus - The patient has a small provoked pulmonary embolus in the left upper lobe. The management of this condition involves anticoagulation with heparin and monitoring in the ICU. Further evaluation with LENIs (lung scintigraphy) is needed to assess the clot burden. If severe, anticoagulation may not be stopped for procedures.
2. Hemoptysis - The patient has been experiencing hemoptysis for about a month, and it is likely originating from the mediastinal mass. Close monitoring in the ICU is necessary. Intubation for airway protection may be required if bleeding occurs. A bronchoscopy will be performed in the morning to further evaluate the source of hemoptysis. Embolization may be considered for major bleeding.
3. Mediastinal mass - The patient has a large mediastinal mass measuring 14 cm x 5 cm."

The patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of smoking, hemoptysis, and recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass. He was admitted to the ICU due to a pulmonary embolism (PE) and received anticoagulation therapy. The patient underwent a CT-guided biopsy of the mediastinal mass. His vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing throat pain post-bronchoscopy. The patient has a large mediastinal mass measuring approximately 14 cm x 5 cm. Differential diagnosis includes lymphoma, thymoma, angiomatous tumor, and germ cell tumors. The patient is also being evaluated for potential paraneoplastic syndromes. He has a history of reflux disease, but esophageal cancer is less likely. The patient stopped smoking three weeks ago. His current medications include heparin, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and ondansetron. The patient is expected to have further consultations with oncology and radiation oncology services.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient already experienced a small provoked PE in the left upper lobe segmental artery. There may be additional risks for further pulmonary emboli due to the presence of a large mediastinal mass causing compression of the pulmonary artery and veins, leading to low flow and stasis. Hypercoagulable state secondary to malignancy can also contribute to"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of smoking and hemoptysis. He was recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass and has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment.

The patient has several medical complications and potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a small provoked PE in the left upper lobe segmental artery. It is unclear how much the mass effect from the mediastinal mass is contributing to low flow and stasis, versus a hypercoagulable state secondary to malignancy. Heparin was initially stopped due to the low platelet count (LENIS negative), but was restarted post-bronchoscopy.

2. Hemoptysis: The patient has been experiencing hemoptysis for about a month, which is likely coming from the mediastinal mass given its proximity to the airway. There is no clear evidence of a fistula. The patient underwent a CT-guided biopsy of the mass.

3. Mediastinal mass: The patient has a large mediastinal mass measuring approximately 14 cm x 5 cm. The differential diagnosis includes lymphoma, thymoma, angiomatous tumor, esophageal cancer, and germ cell tumor. Further diagnostic tests are needed to determine the exact nature of the mass.

4. GERD: The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Protonix IV"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of smoking and hemoptysis, recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass. He was admitted for anticoagulation due to a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has been experiencing hemoptysis for about one month, and a CT-guided biopsy was performed. The most likely source of hemoptysis is the large mediastinal mass, as it is close to the airway. There is no evidence of fistula seen. The patient is currently stable in the ICU, monitored closely, and has had his heparin infusion restarted. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient already has a small provoked PE in the left upper lobe segmental artery. It is unclear how much the mass effect from the mediastinal mass is contributing to low flow and stasis, versus a hypercoagulable state secondary to malignancy. The patient is at risk of further clot formation and potential complications related to PE, such as recurrent PE, pulmonary hypertension, or right heart strain.

2. Hemoptysis: The patient has been experiencing hemoptysis for approximately one month, and the most likely source is the mediastinal mass. There is a risk of worsening hemoptysis or massive hemoptysis, which could lead to respiratory distress and hypoxia.

3. Mediastinal mass: The patient has a large mediastinal mass,"

   Mr. [**Known firstname 453**] [**Known lastname 14231**] is a 36 year-old gentleman with history of smoking

diagnostic (and we're awaiting transfer of the path slides to

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 36-year-old man with a history of smoking and hemoptysis.
- He has been diagnosed with a mediastinal mass and a pulmonary embolus.
- The first biopsy was not fully diagnostic, but it did stain positive for TTF-1.
- This, along with normal hCG, aFP, and LDH levels, raises concerns for advanced lung cancer.
- A definitive tissue diagnosis is needed before starting any therapy.
- If the diagnosis is non-small/squamous cell lung carcinoma, the patient may benefit from chemoradiation to treat the large primary mass.
- The patient has had episodes of hemoptysis, which is likely coming from the mass.
- He has a small provoked PE in the left upper lobe segmental artery, and it is unclear how much the mass effect is contributing to low flow and stasis.
- The patient has been restarted on heparin and transitioned to subcutaneous heparin only.
- He also has a large mediastinal mass measuring approximately 14 cm x 5 cm.
- The differential diagnosis for the mediastinal mass includes lymphoma, thymoma, angiomatous tumor, and germ cell tumors.
- Primary lung cancer is unlikely.
- Further investigations are needed, including TSH, serum calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, alpha fetoprotein, beta human chorionic gonadotropin, and fractionated 24-hour urinary metanephrines and catecholamines.
- Follow-up final path report from [**Location (un) 755**] is pending.
- Oncology consult once pathology results are available.
- The patient has stopped smoking for 3 weeks.
- He is currently stable in the ICU.
- The patient's vital signs and lab results are within normal limits.
- The patient has been called out to the oncology floor for bed availability.
- Potential medical complications that can arise include bleeding due to heparin therapy, infection, and further deterioration of the mediastinal mass.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient is at higher risk of bleeding due to heparin therapy. Close monitoring of vital signs and immediate intervention if there are any signs of significant bleeding.
2. Infection: As the patient is in the ICU, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired infections. Proper infection control measures should be followed, and regular monitoring for signs of infection should be done.
3. Deterioration of mediastinal mass: There is a possibility that the mediastinal mass may worsen or cause further complications. Regular imaging and clinical assessments should be performed to monitor any changes.
4. Pulmonary embolus: Although the patient has been started on heparin therapy, there is still a risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular assessment of oxygenation should be done.
