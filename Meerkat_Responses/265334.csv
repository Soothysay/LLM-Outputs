","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of depression, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder. She was admitted after ingesting a large amount of aspirin (ASA) and required intubation and dialysis. The patient's ASA levels are fluctuating, with the most recent level being 31. Other vital signs are within normal range, but there is a concern for continued gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of ASA if the levels continue to rise. The patient also has hypotension and tachycardia, which have been managed with vasopressor support. Fever is a concern due to multiple infectious sources, and the patient may need broad-spectrum antibiotics. Anemia is developing, possibly due to fluid administration and lowered platelet and white blood cell counts. The patient's suicidal attempt is also noted, and a psychiatric consult has been requested once she is extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued GI absorption of ASA leading to further toxicity.
2. Hypotension and tachycardia requiring continuous monitoring and vasopressor support.
3. Fever indicating a potential infection, which could be due to emergent invasive lines or aspiration.
4. Anemia development possibly due to fluid administration and lowered platelet and white blood cell counts.
5. Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the setting of ASA overdose.
6. Need for psychiatric evaluation and intervention for suicidal behavior."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of depression, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder.
- She was admitted with a large aspirin overdose.
- The patient underwent intubation and dialysis.
- D5W with 3 amps bicarb was started to prevent central hypoglycemia and assist in renal clearance of ASA.
- ASA levels were monitored, ranging from 38 to 31.
- A CT head was performed, which was negative.
- The patient has multiple allergies, including Cogentin, Benadryl, and unknown allergens.
- She received various medications such as Dexmedetomidine, Midazolam, Fentanyl, Heparin Sodium, and Pantoprazole.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows:
   - Temperature: 39.2°C (102.5°F) at one point, but currently stable at 36.8°C (98.2°F).
   - Heart rate: 91 bpm with a range of 81-144 bpm.
   - Blood pressure: Initially low at 103/51 mmHg, but improved to 115/60 mmHg.

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old woman with a history of depression, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder who was admitted after overdosing on aspirin (ASA). She is currently intubated in the ICU and experiencing several medical complications. The patient's ASA levels continue to trend down despite dialysis, and there is a concern for continued gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of ASA. Her bicarbonate levels were initially elevated, but have been adjusted to maintain a target pH range of 7.5-7.55. The patient also has anemia with a decreasing hematocrit (HCT) and thrombocytopenia. She is being closely monitored for signs of infection, including fever, and has received a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for anemia. Additionally, the patient is suspected of attempting suicide, and a psych consult has been ordered. She is currently receiving sedation with dexmedetomidine (Precedex) and antacid prophylaxis with pantoprazole (Protonix).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued GI absorption of ASA: This could lead to further toxicity and complications related to salicylate overdose.
2. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: These conditions need to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
3. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient initially presented with fever, but has since remained afebrile. However, there is still a high potential for multiple"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 26-year-old woman with a history of depression, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder who was admitted after ingesting a large overdose of aspirin (ASA). She presented with hypotension and tachycardia, for which she required vasopressor support but has since improved. The patient also had fever initially but has been afebrile since the morning of September 24th. She complained of a headache, nausea, and photophobia, which are symptoms consistent with ASA overdose. Her ASA level is still climbing despite dialysis.

The patient had an unplanned extubation on September 24th and self-extubated. She rewrote for psych medications but was nauseous all night and did not take them. She stayed on Precedex (dexmedetomidine), an infusion medication.

Renal did not want to pull the HD line at night, suggesting a possible need for hemodialysis (HD) in case it becomes necessary. The patient's bicarbonate level was high in the evening, so fluid administration was switched to 1 amp of NaHCO3/D5W. However, her bicarbonate level decreased to 7.46 at midnight, and she was given 2 amps of NaHCO3.

The patient developed a brisk bloody pink urine (BRBPR) in the evening, and her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) trended down from 32.3 to 22. She received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and was transfused with one unit of blood products. The source of bleeding is likely internal hemorrhoids. Hemolysis labs were requested.

The patient's serum creatinine level is 0.9, and her platelet count is 277 K/uL, which is low. Her other lab results include a WBC count of 7.5, sodium level of 141 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L, chloride level of 108 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 26.9, BUN level of 25 mEq/L, glucose level of 133, and lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L. Imaging studies, such as a CT scan of the head, showed no evidence of cerebral edema or acute intracranial abnormalities.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several medical complications, including anemia, acute thrombocytopenia, poisoning/overdose of salicylates, psychiatric disease, and fever of unknown origin. The planned interventions include discontinuing bicarb, discussing the possibility of pulling the HD line, continuing conservative management for the headache, considering a nasogastric tube for psych medications, and monitoring for hypotension/tachycardia. The patient's suicidal attempt is also being addressed with close monitoring and a psych consultation."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 26-year-old woman with a history of depression, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder who was admitted after an overdose of aspirin. She presented with hypotension, tachycardia, headache, nausea, and fever. Her ASA levels are still climbing despite dialysis, indicating ongoing absorption of aspirin. The patient has been extubated twice and has had multiple invasive lines placed. She has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and possible gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has a long history of depression and suicidal behavior.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia, along with the presence of hemorrhoids, raise concerns for ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Aspirin overdose: Despite dialysis, the patient's ASA levels continue to rise, indicating continued absorption of aspirin. This increases the risk of complications related to aspirin toxicity, such as bleeding and metabolic disturbances.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and the presence of multiple invasive lines increase the risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bloodstream infections.
4. Suicidal behavior: Given the patient's history of depression and suicidal behavior, close monitoring for any signs of self-harm or attempts is necessary.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored due to potential nephrotoxicity from aspirin overdose and the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of depression, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder who presented to the ICU after an aspirin overdose. He was treated with hemodialysis and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications. The patient's arterial line and HD line were pulled yesterday and cultured, and his renal catheter was also checked and replaced as needed. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 95/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has not been assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic status.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, but there is an elevated level of lactate and low levels of calcium and magnesium. Other lab results indicate elevated levels of troponin T, CK-MB, LDH, and ALT, while being low for albumin. Imaging studies, including a chest X-ray and abdominal X-ray, have been performed but do not show any significant abnormalities.

Assessment and plan:
The patient has several ongoing issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, the patient's recent aspirin overdose has resulted in a negative ASA level now, along with evidence of ileus or concretion on the kidney/"
