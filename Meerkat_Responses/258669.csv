 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 CHOLECYSTITIS, ACALCULOUS
   81 year old man with a history of CHF, Afib, COPD and DM2 presented to
   an OSH after several days of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea with new
   onset altered mental status.  He was found to be febrile, hypotensive,
   and hypoglycemic.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further management
   of sepsis.
   #  Sepsis: Patient presents with hypotension, elevated WBC with
   bandemia, low grade temperatures, RUQ pain and altered mental status.
   Infectious work up suggestive of acute cholecystitis per RUQ
   ultrasound. Lactate and creatinine at baseline.
   - trend temp, WBC, lactate
   - foley in place to monitor UOP
   - small bolus IVF for goal CVP > 10
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - follow up blood cultures
   - follow up final read of RUQ US
   - send C. diff given diarrhea and recent antibiotic use
   - consider CT torso to further evaluate for GI source of infection
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics vanc/zosyn
   - npo p mn for potential surgical intervention
   - follow up surgery recs in am
   #  Altered mental status: Consistent with delirium in the setting of
   infection, hypoglycemia and hypotension. Treat underlying infection.
   Monitor fsbs qid. Reorient frequently.
   #  Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation:  On digoxin and coreg for rate
   control. Currently in sinus tachycardia.
   - hold coumadin given supratherapeutic INR
   - hold nodal agents given current hypotension
   - monitor daily INR; FFP tonight given likely procedure in the am
   #  CKD Stage III: Creatinine 1.3 on presentation. Stable from lab
   report from OSH on [**12-24**].
   - continue to monitor creatinine and urine output
   - continue IVF
   - renally dose medications
   # DM2: Hold home glyburide and metformin.  Monitor fsbs qid/qachs and
   manage with sliding scale humalog.  Hypoglycemia at OSH likely due to
   poor po intake.
   # Chronic systolic CHF: History of dilated cardiomyopathy with severe
   AS (valve area 1.1 cm) per OSH medical records. EF reported as 20-25%.
   - Echo in am to evaluate for any wall motion abnormalities
   - hold lasix and spironolactone given active infection and hypotension
   # Elevated troponin: Patient with elevated troponin in the setting of
   sepsis; likely from demand.  Patient reports history of cardiac
   catheterization that did not warrant any intervention.  Patient's
   medication list, however, suggest significant cardiac history.
   - continue aspirin
   - restart beta blocker when hemodynamically stable.
   # Anemia: Per medical records this is anemia of CKD.  Hct unchanged
   from [**12-24**] (HCT 33).

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). He presented to the hospital with several days of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as new-onset altered mental status. Upon arrival, he was found to be febrile, hypotensive, and hypoglycemic. He was diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and acute cholecystitis. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. If left untreated or not properly managed, sepsis can progress to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Acute Cholecystitis: Although the patient is receiving antibiotics, there is a risk of complications such as gallbladder rupture or abscess formation if the infection is not adequately controlled.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ hypoxia if not promptly corrected.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood sugar levels require close monitoring to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia, which can have detrimental effects on the brain and other organs.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presented to the hospital with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and altered mental status. He was found to be febrile, hypotensive, and hypoglycemic. The patient was diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute cholecystitis, and several other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypotension, elevated white blood cell count with bandemia, low-grade temperatures, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, and altered mental status suggests sepsis. The infectious workup indicates acute cholecystitis, which could be the source of infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, trend temperatures, white blood cell count, lactate levels, and follow-up blood cultures are necessary. The patient should be kept nil per os (NPO) for potential surgical intervention. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is consistent with delirium in the setting of infection, hypoglycemia, and hypotension. Treatment of the underlying infection, monitoring fingerstick blood sugars (fsbs) frequently, and reorientation are important.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, altered mental status, fever, hypotension, and hypoglycemia. The patient was transferred to the hospital for further management of sepsis, which is likely caused by pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU and is being treated with antibiotics, pressors, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.3, but it has increased to 1.5. This could be due to contrast nephropathy from the CT scan or other factors. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting medications accordingly is important.
2. Elevated Troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible myocardial injury or NSTEMI. Further cardiac evaluation and treatment, including the use of heparin and aspirin, are necessary.
3. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is on digoxin and Coreg for rate control, but currently, he is in sinus tachycardia. Restarting Coumadin and initiating IV heparin are recommended.

   [**2181-3-12**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is
   mildly dilated at the sinus level. There are three aortic valve
   leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
   critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: moderately dilated left ventricle with severe global LV
   hypokinesis. Dilated and hypokinetic RV. The mid lateral wall has
   relatively preserved function. Calcific aortic stenosis that is
   probably severe/critical - low flow state makes calculation of valve
   area difficult. Mild mitral regurgitation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, altered mental status, fever, hypotension, and hypoglycemia. He was diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient also has several comorbidities including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, chronic systolic heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, and elevated troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It is important to monitor his vital signs, white blood cell count, and response to antibiotics.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level of 1.3 has increased to 1.5. This indicates a decline in kidney function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and adjustment of medications accordingly is necessary.
3. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and it is important to maintain rate control. Restarting Coumadin and initiating IV heparin are recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic medication noncompliance (CM), aortic stenosis (AS), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presents with sepsis, likely community-acquired pneumonia (PNA), and is currently in the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis likely due to PNA. Pressors are being weaned off, and vital signs are being monitored. Blood cultures and sputum gram stain results are pending.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has RLL infiltrate on CT torso, suggesting possible pneumonia. Antibiotics have been continued, and a chest PT has been ordered.
3. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient has evidence of dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. Treatment includes restarting beta-blockers when BP improves, starting statin therapy, and aspirin.
4. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has elevated troponins and a history of AF. Aspirin and heparin will be continued until INR > 2. Lipitor dosage has been increased to 80 mg.
5. Fluid overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance over the past 24 hours. This needs to be monitored and managed accordingly.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), aortic stenosis (AS), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), presenting with sepsis and likely community-acquired pneumonia (PNA). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, likely due to pneumonia. It is crucial to continue monitoring vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Lactate levels are also being monitored as an indicator of tissue perfusion.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia, and antibiotic therapy should be continued. Chest X-ray will be done to assess the progression of the infection.

3. Dilated Cardiomyopathy: The patient's dilated cardiomyopathy may contribute to his current condition. Medications such as beta-blockers, statins, and aspirin should be restarted when blood pressure improves.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and anticoagulation therapy with heparin should be initiated until the international normalized ratio (INR) is above 2. Continuing aspirin and increasing the dose of lipid will also be beneficial.

5. Renal Failure: There is a concern about renal failure"

   above.
   He is much relieved by sitting upright. He has a severe ischemic CM (
   EF less tha 15%) that has made treatment of his MRSA sepsis
   problem[**Name (NI) 595**]. However, with levophed infusion and intermittent fluid
   boluses, his SVO2 and lactates have been improving. UO has been steady
   too with creatinine of 1.7.
   He also has pseudomonas in his sputum that is pansensitive. He will
   need at least 10-14 days of antibiotics with help regarding secretion
   clearance ( nebs/ mucinex/ O2) as low dose coreg or beta-blockade is
   re-initiated for his HR.
   He continues to need ICU level care for now.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and altered mental status. He was diagnosed with sepsis due to pneumonia and MRSA bacteremia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for management.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis caused by pneumonia and MRSA bacteremia. The source of infection is likely the pneumonia. He requires continued treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Pressors may need to be weaned based on trends in central venous O2 saturation, lactate levels, and urine output. Cultures should be followed up, and sensitivities should be reviewed.

2. Chronic systolic CHF: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe aortic stenosis (AS). His ejection fraction (EF) is currently 10%. He has known triple vessel disease (3VD). The patient should be restarted on a beta-blocker and ACE inhibitors should be held until improved blood pressure is achieved.

3. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in sinus tachycardia. He is on digoxin"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presented to the hospital with several days of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as new-onset altered mental status. He was diagnosed with sepsis due to pneumonia and MRSA bacteremia.

The patient's current condition includes chronic systolic heart failure with severe aortic stenosis and known three-vessel disease (3VD). He is also experiencing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, acute-on-chronic renal failure, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible demand ischemia in the setting of known 3VD.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening heart failure, progression of renal failure, further deterioration of glycemic control, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Overall, the patient requires ongoing management of sepsis, optimization of heart failure medications, control of atrial fibrillation, renal support, glycemic control, and monitoring for potential complications."

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and new-onset altered mental status. He was transferred to the ICU for management of sepsis, which was found to be caused by pneumonia and MRSA bacteremia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 100/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. His heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient has several medical complications. He has chronic systolic heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe aortic stenosis and an ejection fraction of 10%. He also has known triple vessel disease (3VD). His renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level trending upward. He has anemia with a baseline hemoglobin of 33 g/dL. His blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating uncontrolled diabetes.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including vasopressors, antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam), anticoagulants (heparin and warfarin), beta-blockers,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock secondary to a severe case of MRSA infection. The patient's condition has been improving, with a decrease in bandemia and stable LFTs. However, he continues to require vasopressor support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA infection: The patient's current ICU admission is due to a severe case of MRSA infection. It is crucial to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or development of antibiotic resistance.
2. Septic shock: As the patient was initially admitted with septic shock, there is a risk of recurrence if the infection persists or if there is a new infection.
3. Chronic kidney disease: The patient has a pre-existing chronic kidney disease, which can be exacerbated by sepsis and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient's history of coronary artery disease puts him at risk for cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant therapy and invasive procedures increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can increase the risk of developing DVT.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's requirement for respiratory"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and cholecystitis, acalculous. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/57 mmHg to 136/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is also on norepinephrine and heparin infusions.

The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds with tachycardia, rales at the bases of the lungs, RUQ tenderness, no rebound or guarding, warm and dry extremities, and no focal neurologic deficits.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 21.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, elevated lactate level, and elevated troponin levels. Other lab results include elevated glucose, low calcium, low potassium, and low magnesium levels.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presented to the hospital with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, along with new-onset altered mental status. He was diagnosed with sepsis due to pneumonia and MRSA bacteremia. The patient's current conditions include chronic systolic CHF, paroxysmal AFib, acute-on-chronic renal failure, DM2, and elevated troponin levels, which may indicate demand ischemia in the setting of known three vessel disease (3VD). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, and it needs to be closely monitored and managed. There is a potential risk of progression to septic shock if not properly managed.
2. Organ Dysfunction: Since the patient is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, there is a possibility of developing organ dysfunction, particularly in the kidneys and liver, which could lead to acute kidney injury or hepatic failure.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of MRSA and P. aeruginosa in the sputum suggests a potential risk of worsening pneumonia, requiring appropriate antibiotic therapy and respiratory support if necessary.
4. CHF exacerbation: The patient's history of CHF and the current symptoms may"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of severe ischemic cardiovascular disease (ICM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and currently presenting with right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL) due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. The patient is in respiratory distress and has sepsis, as well as acute kidney injury (AKI) with an elevated creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation (AFib) with a rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Organ Dysfunction:
   - The patient's AKI may progress further due to decreased renal perfusion caused by low blood pressure and sepsis.
   - The patient's respiratory distress could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if oxygenation does not improve.
   - The patient's ischemic heart disease may worsen due to the stress on the heart caused by sepsis and low blood flow.

2. Infection:
   - The patient's MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia could lead to a worsening infection if the current antibiotic therapy is ineffective or if there is an emergence of antibiotic resistance.
   - There is a risk of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) due to the patient's hospitalization and use of invasive devices such as an arterial line and multi-lumen catheter.

3. Coagulation:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). The patient presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and altered mental status and was transferred to the ICU for sepsis management. He was found to have pneumonia and MRSA bacteremia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/55 mmHg to 134/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. His central venous pressure (CVP) is -22 mmHg, and mixed venous oxygen saturation is 53-98%. The patient has received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefepime, and his last dose of antibiotics was cefepime at 06:48 PM on 03/15/2181.

The patient's physical examination shows distant heart sounds, tachycardia, no murmurs, bibasilar rales in the lungs, RUQ tenderness without rebound or guarding in the abdomen, and 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and renal impairment.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including sepsis without organ dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, cholecystitis (acalculous), chronic systolic heart failure, wrist pain, acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease. The plan includes continuing vancomycin and monitoring the level, sending C. diff toxin, discontinuing heparin due to an INR of 2.8, and starting cefepime. The patient is also on pressors for maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg and has continuous ScVO2 monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis leading to septic shock, progression of renal failure, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization and hypercoagulable state, and worsening heart failure. Close monitoring and prompt management are necessary to prevent these complications."

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and altered mental status. He was found to have pneumonia and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. The patient is currently in the ICU for management of sepsis.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis due to pneumonia and MRSA bacteremia. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor the patient's response to treatment.

2. Chronic systolic CHF: The patient has chronic systolic congestive heart failure. He appears to be volume overloaded, and diuresis should be continued while still on pressors. The goal should be to maintain a heart rate below 80 beats per minute.

3. Paroxysmal AFib: The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, converting between sinus tachycardia and AFib. Metoprolol tartrate should be increased to 12.5 mg TID, and digoxin should be held due to acute renal failure. Heparin should be stopped, and warfarin dosage should be decreased since the INR is 2"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis caused by MRSA pneumonia, cardiogenic shock, and other medical conditions such as congestive heart failure (CHF), ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), and atrial fibrillation (Afib).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. MRSA bacteremia/pneumonia: The patient is still being treated with vancomycin, and the plan is to continue this treatment. If the infection does not improve or worsens, additional complications such as septic shock or organ failure may occur.

2. HoTN (hypotension of unknown etiology): The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. Weaning off the pressors and monitoring for any signs of further hypotension or organ dysfunction is crucial.

3. Heart failure: The patient has CHF and ICM, which can lead to worsening heart failure. The physician plans to maintain an even volume status, avoid diuretics for now, encourage oral intake, and wean off pressors as tolerated. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload or worsening respiratory status is important.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is on lopressor to control his heart rate, aiming for a heart rate below 100 beats per minute. Restarting home digoxin is planned. Monitoring for"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis. He is currently admitted to the ICU with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient has several medical complications, including severe sepsis with cardiomyopathy, acute heart failure, atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and possible septic joint or gout in the wrist. He also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA bacteremia/pneumonia: The patient has MRSA sepsis, which can lead to bacteremia and pneumonia. It is important to continue vancomycin and monitor for any signs of worsening infection.
2. Hypotension and shock: As the patient has sepsis with cardiomyopathy, there is a risk of persistent hypotension and shock. Close monitoring of blood pressure and continued weaning of pressors is necessary.
3. Heart failure: The patient's heart failure status appears to be stable, but there is a risk of exacerbation due to ongoing inflammation and fluid shifts. Monitoring fluid status and adjusting diuretic therapy accordingly is important.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which needs to be managed with rate control medications (e.g., Lopressor) and anticoagulation"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old man with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). He presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and new-onset altered mental status, and was diagnosed with sepsis due to MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia, as well as MRSA bacteremia.

The patient continues to require norepinephrine for blood pressure support. His vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/55 mmHg to 121/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. He is experiencing atrial fibrillation and has a history of gout flare, which has been treated with allopurinol and colchicine.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased hematocrit. His kidney function is compromised, as shown by an increased creatinine level. Other lab results reveal elevated troponin T, lactate, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, as well as abnormal electrolyte levels.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and altered mental status. He was transferred to the ICU for management of sepsis caused by MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia, as well as MRSA bacteremia. The patient is still dependent on norepinephrine for hemodynamic support. He also has wrist swelling, likely due to gout, but there is concern for a septic joint given his bacteremia. The patient has chronic systolic CHF, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. His INR is supratherapeutic, likely due to nutritional deficiency. The patient's condition is being managed with various medications and interventions, including diuretics, beta-blockers, statins, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis due to MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia, as well as MRSA bacteremia. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and closely monitor his vital signs and response to treatment.
2. Gout flare: The patient's wrist swelling may"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of atrial fibrillation, gout, and coronary artery disease. The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications, including MRSA bacteremia with Pseudomonas infection, left wrist swelling potentially due to septic joint or gout flare, hypotension requiring intermittent pressor support, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA bacteremia/pneumonia with Pseudomonas infection: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia, which is a serious bloodstream infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, there is a co-infection with Pseudomonas, a type of bacteria that can cause severe respiratory and bloodstream infections. Treatment involves continuous vancomycin and cefepime antibiotics.
2. Left wrist swelling: The patient has swelling in their left wrist, which could be due to a gout flare or a septic joint. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by urate crystal deposition. However, given the patient's current bacteremia, there is concern for a septic joint. Tapping the joint to relieve pressure and obtain fluid for analysis may be necessary.
3. Hypotension (HoTN): The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is a low blood pressure state. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. The cause of the hypot"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have been diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia, likely cardiogenic shock, and are on pressor support. The patient also has a swollen and painful wrist, which could be due to a gout flare or a septic joint. Additionally, the patient has atrial fibrillation and is being treated with beta-blockers to maintain a heart rate below 100 beats per minute. The patient's fluid balance and vital signs are being closely monitored, and they are receiving nutrition and glycemic control through regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has a history of DVT, CAD, and is on appropriate medications for these conditions. The patient's ICU care includes systemic anticoagulation, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and they are currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock due to MRSA bacteremia.
2. Complications related to the swollen and painful wrist, which could be a septic joint.
3. Cardiogenic shock.
4. Atrial fibrillation leading to potential clot formation and stroke risk.
5. Malnutrition and inadequate caloric intake.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism.
7. Complications related to the patient's history of coronary artery disease (CAD)."

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presented with several days of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, along with new-onset altered mental status. He was diagnosed with sepsis due to MRSA bacteremia and pseudomonas pneumonia. The patient continues to require pressor support and has been receiving vancomycin and cefepime. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis caused by MRSA bacteremia and pseudomonas pneumonia. It is crucial to monitor his vital signs, blood culture results, and response to antibiotics closely.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential.
3. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's history of CHF may worsen due to his current condition. Monitoring for signs of volume overload or low cardiac output is necessary.
4. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's conversion between sinus tachycardia and AFib should be closely monitored. Management of heart rate control and anticoagulation therapy is important.
5. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's elevated INR may require"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been experiencing atrial fibrillation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and cholecystitis. 

In the past 24 hours, the patient's vancomycin dose was adjusted, metoprolol was held due to subsequent hypotension, and the patient required pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. The patient also received intravenous normal saline to address low central venous pressure (CVP) and low mean arterial pressure (MAP). A tap of the left wrist joint was planned, but rheumatology recommended deferring it until the international normalized ratio (INR) is below 4. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/58 to 75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving norepinephrine at a dose of 0.02 mcg/kg/min.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,898 mL, including 79 mL of blood products. Output includes 697 mL of urine and 240 mL of blood products. The total fluid balance is -161 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, along with new-onset altered mental status. He was transferred to the ICU for management of sepsis and found to have pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient has sepsis due to MRSA and Pseudomonas pneumonia, as well as MRSA bacteremia. He requires pressor support, indicating persistent hypotension.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, which suggest acute kidney injury on top of his pre-existing chronic renal failure. This is likely due to poor perfusion caused by his septic state and poor forward flow.
3. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated, likely due to nutritional deficiency. This has resulted in the decision to hold warfarin therapy.
4. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient experiences episodes of atrial fibrillation, which can be attributed to his underlying heart conditions and acute illness.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including congestive heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia, as well as a possible acute or septic joint in the left wrist. He is being treated with antibiotics for MRSA and pseudomonal colonization. The patient's vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and low oxygen saturation. His lab results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, which is now more consistent with cardiogenic shock. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's persistent hypotension and inappropriate peripheral vasodilation suggest a cardiogenic shock picture. Continuous monitoring and administration of levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 55 and urine output (UOP) > 0.5 mL/kg/hr are recommended. The patient appears hypervolemic, and a goal of total body balance (TBB) -500 to -1L today will be aimed for. Lower extremities should be wrapped for leg edema.
2. MRSA pneumonia and pseudomonal colonization: The patient is already receiving vancomycin and cefepime. It is important to continue these antibiotics and consider input from the infectious disease team. Pulmonary toilet should also be continued.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. He presented with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and bacteremia, leading to hypotension and organ dysfunction. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with persistent hypotension and acute kidney injury. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. The patient's white blood cell count has been fluctuating, and there are signs of fluid overload with lower extremity edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and signs of inadequate peripheral vasodilation suggest a cardiogenic cause of shock. This could be due to his underlying cardiac disease, such as coronary artery disease (CAD).
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and reduced urine output indicate AKI. The cause of AKI could be prerenal due to hypotension or intrinsic renal damage.
3. MRSA infection: The patient initially presented with MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia. Although he is receiving appropriate antibiotics, there is a risk of ongoing infection and potential complications like septic shock.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms and abnormal arterial blood gas values indicate pneumonia. There is a concern for worsening respiratory function and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). He presented to the hospital with several days of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, along with new-onset altered mental status. He was diagnosed with sepsis caused by MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia, as well as MRSA bacteremia. The patient's blood pressures have improved, and he has been able to wean off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already being treated for sepsis with antibiotics. It is important to continue monitoring his vital signs and lab results for any signs of worsening infection or organ dysfunction.
2. Gout flare: The patient is experiencing wrist swelling, which is likely due to gout. He has been prescribed prednisone and colchicine to manage the symptoms. Regular follow-up with a rheumatologist is recommended to assess the joint inflammation.
3. Chronic systolic CHF: The patient has volume overload and requires diuresis to manage his chronic systolic heart failure. Monitoring his fluid balance and adjusting diuretic dosage accordingly is important.
4. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be managed carefully, especially considering his CHF. Restarting lopressor may"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis (AS), and currently admitted with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and bacteremia. He presents with persistent cardiogenic shock, atrial fibrillation, wrist pain, and other comorbidities. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he continues to require intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient has been improving from septic shock but still exhibits poor cardiac inotropy, making it difficult to overcome peripheral vasodilation. It is crucial to continue monitoring the patient's volume status and completing antibiotic therapy. For the cardiogenic component of shock, diuresis and restarting Diovan should be considered if the patient remains hemodynamically stable.
2. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient is currently being treated for MRSA pneumonia. It is important to ensure appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of worsening respiratory status or infection.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may require further management with anticoagulation and rate control medications. Restarting lopressor and holding digoxin are recommended. Additionally, the elevated INR needs to be addressed, and vitamin K can be given to correct it.
4. Cardiomyopathy"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and aortic stenosis (AS). He is currently admitted to the ICU with MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia, and persistent cardiogenic shock. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/48 mmHg to 110/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature of 36.6 C. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, diuretics, antiarrhythmics, and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient has persistent cardiogenic shock, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has MRSA pneumonia with bacteremia, which may require prolonged antibiotic therapy and can increase the risk of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and hospital-acquired infections.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can lead to ineffective cardiac output and embolic events if anticoagulation is inadequate.
4. Cardiomyopathy and Aortic Stenosis: The patient's underlying cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis can worsen his cardiac function and contribute to ongoing cardiogenic shock.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and was later transferred to the ICU for management of sepsis, pneumonia caused by MRSA and Pseudomonas, and MRSA bacteremia. The patient's blood pressure has improved and he has been weaned off of pressors. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis due to MRSA and Pseudomonas pneumonia, as well as MRSA bacteremia. This condition can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Monitoring vital signs and laboratory parameters will be crucial to assess the patient's response to treatment.
2. Chronic systolic CHF: The patient has a history of chronic systolic CHF and is currently volume overloaded. Diuresis will be attempted to remove excess fluid. It is important to monitor the patient's response to diuretic therapy and adjust the dosage accordingly.
3. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. His INR is still elevated at 4.7, which is above the therapeutic range for warfarin. The patient will continue on low-dose metoprolol"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and altered mental status. He was diagnosed with sepsis caused by MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia, as well as MRSA bacteremia. The patient's blood pressure has improved, and he has been weaned off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis due to MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia, and now has MRSA bacteremia. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of sepsis recurrence.
2. L wrist swelling: The patient has swelling in his left wrist, which may be due to gout or a septic joint. Arthrocentesis may be considered if the patient's INR is less than 4 and he continues to experience pain.
3. Chronic systolic CHF: The patient has volume overload and requires diuresis to manage his chronic systolic congestive heart failure. The goal is to achieve negative fluid balance of 1 liter within 24 hours.

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presented to the hospital with several days of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, along with new-onset altered mental status. He was diagnosed with sepsis due to MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia caused by MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient's blood pressures have improved, and he has been weaned off the pressors.

The patient is currently receiving vancomycin for MRSA and cefepime for Pseudomonas infection. A PICC line has been placed, and the goal is to diurese negative 500cc to 1 liter today. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/47 mmHg to 116/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

The patient has wrist swelling, which is likely due to gout, but other possibilities such as a septic joint cannot be ruled out. Pulse prednisone has provided symptomatic relief, and the plan is to consult rhe"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CHF, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and DM2. He presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and altered mental status, and was diagnosed with sepsis caused by MRSA bacteremia and pseudomonas pneumonia. His blood pressures have improved, and he has been weaned off pressors. He has been receiving antibiotics for MRSA and pseudomonas infections. He also has swelling in his left wrist, which may be due to gout or a septic joint. He has chronic systolic CHF with volume overload, acute on chronic renal failure, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. His INR is still elevated at 4.7. He has been started on metoprolol and will continue it along with restarting warfarin. His DM2 and CAD are being managed as well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient initially presented with sepsis caused by MRSA bacteremia and pseudomonas pneumonia. Although he has been receiving appropriate antibiotics, there is still a risk of ongoing infection and potential complications such as septic shock or organ dysfunction.

2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CHF, atrial fibrillation, and CAD. His current condition may exacerbate these underlying cardiac conditions, leading to further heart failure or arrhythmias.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure and ischemic cardiomyopathy. He presented with MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia, as well as possible pseudomonal pneumonia. The patient tolerated diuresis and has been off levophed for more than 36 hours. He has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, cefepime, furosemide, atorvastatin, omeprazole, colchicine, haloperidol, prednisone, and ASA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA Pneumonia/Bacteremia: The patient is being treated with vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia/bacteremia. It is important to monitor his response to the antibiotics and ensure that there is no worsening of the infection.
2. Pseudomonal Pneumonia: The patient is also being treated with cefepime for pseudomonal pneumonia. Monitoring for improvement and any signs of worsening infection is crucial.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure and is likely still volume overloaded. Gentle diuresis should be continued, and restarting Diovan and imdur may be necessary if tolerated. Further cardiology input may be required to address his worsened cardiomyopathy.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure (AoCRF): The patient is likely experiencing poor perfusion but is currently stable. Monitoring renal function and adjusting medications accordingly is"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. MRSA Pneumonia/bacteremia
    - Cont vancomycin day 10/6 weeks
    - day [**5-24**] cefepime for pseudomonal pna
    - picc today
   2. Wrist pain: improving with steroids
   - cont prednisone day [**2-16**]
    - cont colchicine and allopurinol
   3. Heart Failure:  he is likely still volume overloaded
    - cont gentle diuresis
    - wil need diovan and imdur restarted if he tolerates
   4. AoCRF: likely [**1-16**] poor perfusion, but stable
   5. CAD: cont asa/bb
   6. AFib:
    - will start coumadin tonight: 1 mg as he had vigorous response to 2.5
   mg but now s/p vit K
   7. FEN: tolerating PO diet
