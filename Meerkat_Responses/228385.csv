   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo W with new diagnosis of advanced ovarian ca with peritoneal
   seeding admitted with small bowel obstruction now s/p tumor debulking,
   TAH BSO and partial resection of small bowel and sigmoid, POD #1, now
   with persistent tachycardia overnight.
   Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia with rates stable in 130s.
   Hemodynamically stable. Rate minimally responsive to fluids. Afebrile
   overnight so not due to fever. However, spiked temp this morning. Hct
   stable and no signs of acute blood loss. Increased fentanyl and versed
   without improvement. Not wearing boots overnight and given malignancy
   and recent surgical procedure, high suspicion for PE. EKG without
   evidence  of R heart strain or S1Q3T3. Sats good but large A-a
   gradient.  Sent d dimer overnight. Likely will be positive, but if
   negative low likelihood of PE. However, given high level of concern
   will  send for CTA.
   - stat CTA
   - start heparin SC and pneumoboots
   - Fluid boluses PRN
   - Pain control
   - start empiric coverage with amp cipro flagyl
   Fevers: Spiked high temp raising suspicion that this is infectious
   rather than post op atelectasis.
   - f/u pan culture
   - f/u surgery recs
   - start empiric coverage as above
   .
   Hypotension: Large blood loss intraop and transiently on neo gtt.
   Hypotension likely secondary to hypovolemia in setting of blood loss
   and fluid shifts. Overnight BP has been stable off pressors. Urine
   output 45-80cc/hr. Received 2L of LR for tachycardia.
   - IVF boluses PRN
   - Consider levophed if MAP less than 60 or low urine output
   - monitor HCT
   - Aline in place
   .
   Respiratory: Intubated in setting of large dose narcotics for airway
   protection. Will maintain intubation while sending down for CTA. If
   negative for PE, will attempt extubation.
   - Wean sedation in AM
   - SBT and extubation if stable
   Adenocarcinoma: Extensive disease s/p debulking
   - F/U gyn onc recs
   - F/U surgery recs
   - keep NPO with NG tube to suction
   - Titrate pain control with fentanyl while sedated
   .
   .
   Non gap metabolic acidosis/Respiratory Acidosis: HC03 of 15, pC02 of
   35, expected 30 therefore mixed picture. Respiratory acidosis likely
   secondary to narcotics. Added on lactate and feel that acidosis more
   likely AG secondary to hypotension. Causes of non gap metabolic seem
   unlikely in this patient but include diarrhea, RTA, possible fistula.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old woman with a new diagnosis of advanced ovarian cancer and peritoneal seeding. She was admitted with small bowel obstruction and underwent tumor debulking, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and partial resection of small bowel and sigmoid. She is now on postoperative day (POD) #1 and experiencing persistent tachycardia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 132 beats per minute (tachycardia), blood pressure ranging from 113/67 to 138/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

She has several infusions including fentanyl, midazolam, and heparin sodium. She also has an arterial line and multi-lumen catheter in place. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and lactic acid levels, as well as decreased platelet count and magnesium level.

The assessment and plan include several concerns. The patient has persistent tachycardia, which is minimally responsive to fluids. She is hemodynamically stable but has a fever and a high suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE), especially considering her malignancy and recent surgical"

","The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a new diagnosis of advanced ovarian cancer with peritoneal seeding. She was admitted with small bowel obstruction and underwent tumor debulking, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and partial resection of the small bowel and sigmoid. Postoperative day (POD) #0, she required intermittent use of pressors intraoperatively and was admitted to the operating room for close monitoring.

The patient is currently experiencing sinus tachycardia with rates stable in the 130s. She is hemodynamically stable, with a blood pressure of 113/67 mmHg and a heart rate of 132 bpm. Her hematocrit is stable, and there are no signs of acute blood loss. Despite receiving increased doses of fentanyl and versed, her tachycardia has not improved. She is afebrile overnight, so fever is not the cause of her tachycardia. There is no evidence of right heart strain or S1Q3T3 on her EKG. Her oxygen saturation is good, but there is a large A-a gradient. She has been sent for a d-dimer test overnight.

Given her malignancy and recent surgical procedure, there is a high suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE). An EKG without evidence of right heart strain or S1Q3T3 does not rule out PE. Her large A-a gradient suggests respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a new diagnosis of advanced ovarian cancer and peritoneal seeding. She was admitted with small bowel obstruction and underwent tumor debulking, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and partial resection of the small bowel and sigmoid on postoperative day 2. The patient is currently experiencing persistent tachycardia, and her temperature has increased. She is receiving pain control with dilaudid PCA and has been extubated. She is also receiving antibiotics for empiric coverage. The patient has a history of fatigue, dry mouth, and abdominal pain. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure of 93/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device. Her current weight is 77.6 kg. She has been receiving various medications including morphine sulfate, fentanyl, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and others. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's increased temperature and recent administration of antibiotics suggest a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting the antibiotic regimen accordingly will be important.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving subcut"

","The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a new diagnosis of advanced ovarian cancer and peritoneal seeding. She was admitted with a small bowel obstruction and underwent tumor debulking surgery, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and partial resection of the small bowel and sigmoid on postoperative day 2. 

The patient is currently experiencing persistent tachycardia, fever, and respiratory distress. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 125 beats per minute, blood pressure of 93/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

Her physical examination reveals that she is well-nourished, normocephalic, and has symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds. Her abdomen is soft with bowel sounds present, and there is tenderness along the surgical incision site. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. Other lab values such as glucose, electrolytes, and coagulation profiles are within normal limits. 

Radiology images are not provided in the note. 

The patient's assessment includes sinus tachycardia, possible infection causing fever, respiratory distress likely due to atelectasis and pleural effusions, gastrointestinal obstruction, and pain management.

   hypvolemia give relatively low CVP.  PE unlikely given negative CTA.
   Can get LENI to r/o clots in LE.
   Hypoxemia:  Has b/l pleural effusions and atelectasis which are likely
   contributing to hypoxemia.  In additional is having shallow breaths due
   to abdmoninal pain that
   likely is contributing to atelectasis.
   Fevers:  on Amp/Cipro/Flagyl due to cover abdominal source.  Fluid
   collection around wound.
   Nutrition: on TPN, NPO
   Try to get OOB to chair and increase basal PCA rate for pain.

","The patient is a 44-year-old woman who presented with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and was found to have ovarian cancer with peritoneal seeding. She underwent small bowel resection on POD#2 and was extubated yesterday. She complains of pain and has sinus tachycardia in the range of 120-130s. A negative computed tomography angiography (CTA) rules out pulmonary embolism (PE). Her respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, blood pressure is 106/58 mmHg, heart rate is 129 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97% on aerosol-cool with FiO2 of 35%. She is receiving intravenous fluids, parenteral nutrition, and various medications including opioids for pain management.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, indicating a fever. Her abdominal pain is severe and located in the abdomen. She is unable to stand due to pain and has tender incision sites. She has bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis, contributing to her hypoxemia. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 219,000/mm3, elevated lactate levels, and slightly low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.

The patient is being managed with aggressive pain control, antibiotics to cover for potential abdominal source of infection, and close monitoring for any complications. She is also receiving total parenteral nutrition"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a new diagnosis of advanced ovarian cancer and peritoneal seeding. She was admitted with small bowel obstruction and underwent tumor debulking, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and partial resection of the small bowel and sigmoid on postoperative day 2. The patient has persistent tachycardia overnight, which may be due to infection or pain. She also has mild hypoxia and is on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds, clear lung sounds, and a non-tender vertical incision. Laboratory results indicate slightly elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's pain is well-controlled with Dilaudid PCA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's tachycardia could be due to an infection, as she has been started on antibiotics. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, or worsening pain, is important. Cultures should be checked regularly, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued or adjusted based on culture results.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (D"

   Imaging: LENIS negative
   Assessment and Plan
   Tachycardia:  Improved today.  Likely due to pain and fluid status.
   Given negative CTA and negative LENIS, PE is unlikely.
   Fevers:  afebrile
   Hypoxemia:  stil requiring a small amount of oxygen, likely due to
   atelectasis and effusions.  Should improve with ambulation and
   incentive spirometry.
   GI: NPO for now.
   Ovarian AdenoCA: S/P debulking,
   Pain control:  Continue PCA.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old woman who underwent abdominal surgery for ovarian cancer and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing tachycardia and pain control issues. 

The vital signs show a heart rate of 115 bpm, which is slightly improved from previous readings. Blood pressure is 97/61 mmHg, respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The review of systems indicates no chest pain, dyspnea, or gastrointestinal issues other than abdominal pain. The physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient with normal cardiovascular and respiratory findings, as well as soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. 

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, leukocyte count of 211 K/uL, sodium level of 138 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.1 mEq/L, and glucose level of 138 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated D-dimer levels and normal imaging studies.

The assessment and plan include improvement in tachycardia, likely due to pain and fluid status. The patient is afebrile and still requires a small amount of oxygen, likely due to atelectasis and effusions. Pain control measures will continue with PCA. The patient's ovarian adenocarcinoma is post-debulking, and she will"
