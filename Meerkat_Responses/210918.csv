   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Mr [**Known lastname 2536**] and was present for the key portions of
   the services provided. I also have read Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10445**]
s note above and
   concur with his findings and plan of care.  The patient has very severe
   COPD with what is felt to be baseline severe hypercarbia.  In this
   setting he was found to have a RLL endobronchial cancer at [**Hospital1 3356**] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for XRT. He came to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] due to
   his
triggering
 for hypoxemia which responded nicely to BIPAP used
   here yesterday in [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  This morning he actually seems close or at his
   baseline, though does, not surprisingly, demonstrate asterixis.   As
   he
s not been on RTC bronchodilators and has been on higher than
   necessary FiO2, we will give him Alb/Ipratropium Nebs RTC and titrate
   his nasal O2 to give only Sa02 of 91-93%.  He has not needed BIPAP so
   far today, but we think his using it at night on the [**Hospital1 **] would be
   beneficial in giving his resp muscles a needed rest.  He is being
   called out today, to commence XRT.
   35 min spent in the care of this severely ill patient.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. He presented to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory distress and was initially placed on non-invasive ventilation. The patient's respiratory distress improved with BiPAP and his ABG results showed improvement as well. He has a known diagnosis of SCC with right middle lobe collapse, for which he was transferred for palliative XRT. The patient also has a history of severe COPD with multiple hospitalizations for hypercapnic respiratory failure. He requires continued use of albuterol/iptropium nebs scheduled and BiPAP overnight. Additionally, the patient has benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and is on a regimen of Flomax. The patient's code status is DNI (do not intubate) and his disposition is to call out to the floor. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of severe COPD and acute exacerbation puts him at risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status and timely intervention with non-invasive ventilation or intubation if necessary is crucial.

2. Hypercarbia: The patient's elevated pCO2 levels indicate hypercarbia, which can lead to respiratory acidosis and subsequent complications such as confusion, agitation, and even seizures.

3. Cancer Progression: The patient's diagnosis"

He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 154/82 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is currently on non-invasive ventilation support.

The patient's physical examination reveals tearing in the left eye, left chest wall pain, and difficulty breathing. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. The patient's weight remains the same as upon admission.

Flowsheet data indicates that the patient has received a total input of 840 mL of fluids and an output of 950 mL, resulting in a balance of -110 mL. He is receiving O2 delivery through a nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set at a tidal volume of 305 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 85 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 67 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO"

","The patient's chief complaint is hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is currently experiencing an acute exacerbation of their condition. They also have a diagnosis of lung cancer (malignant neoplasm), prostatic hypertrophy (benign), and respiratory failure. 

The patient was initially noted to be somewhat somnolent with an elevated pCO2, but was oriented upon examination. They likely have a history of CO2 retention, which may be related to their RML collapse and recurrent SCC. The patient requires non-invasive BiPAP at night and will continue with this treatment. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1 C, blood pressure ranging from 154/82 to 115/64 mmHg, heart rate between 78-97 bpm, respiratory rate of 14-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and total CO2. The patient's blood glucose levels have fluctuated throughout the day. 

The patient has been started on non-invasive ventilation, with multiple episodes of starting and stopping due to their respiratory distress. They have also been placed on BiPAP for nighttime use. 

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the right base, trace edema in both lower extremities,"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted to be somewhat somnelent
   initially on the floor with an elevated pCO2.  Patient is orientated
   after arousal. Given his prior history of COPD likely he has history of
   CO2 retention, which improves with non-invasive BiPAP at night time. Pt
   has no history of OSA, did not receive pain medication prior to this
   episode. Likely related to his RML collapse [**1-23**] recurrent SCC. Pt.
   would benefit from palliative [**Month/Day (2) 357**], would make sense to transfer to [**Hospital1 966**]
   for [**Last Name (LF) 357**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] try to facilitate today.
   - will continue on non-invasive BiPAP

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of lung cancer. The patient is currently receiving BiPAP support at night and standing nebulizer treatments. The vital signs show a stable blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate, but the oxygen saturation is 88% despite being on supplemental oxygen.

The physical examination reveals signs of CO2 toxicity with redirectable mental status, warm skin, and oriented neurological assessment. The patient has diffuse rhonchi and trace crackles in the chest, scaphoid abdomen with soft and non-tender bowel sounds, and notable flapping on straight arm raise and myoclonus on extension.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and electrolyte imbalances including low potassium, calcium, and magnesium. The blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with a range of 67-143 mg/dL. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in the 80s, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio of 267, and a ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Mr [**Known lastname 2536**] and was present for the key portions of
   the services provided.  I have read Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8988**]
s note and agree with
   his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 2536**] remains stable and reports his
   breathing is at baseline. He is alert and seems comfortable. He
   tolerates BIPAP at night and PC02 is stable to improved at 83.  His Sat
   is approx 88-90% on 2L 02.  As the patient is normally on inhaled
   steroids, we will add budesonide or fluticasone inhaled to his
   Albuterol and Ipratropium nebs q4-6hr.
   Pt is a longstanding patient of  [**Hospital1 966**] where Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10454**] did his
   LLLobectomy. I
ve been in contact with [**Name (NI) 966**] physicians and  hospitalist
   Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10455**] there has accepted the patient to the floor there, where he
   should be evaluated for [**Last Name (STitle) 357**] for his new Rt lung cancer.  I believe the
   patient is stable enough for both the transfer and for care on the
   floor, provided he remains on his bronchodilators, BIPAP at night, and
   low flow 02.  I would accept sats of 88-91 as adequate and necessary to
   help prevent C02 retention.
   45 min spent in the care of this severely ill gentleman.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer (specifically, squamous cell carcinoma with right middle lobe collapse), and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). He is currently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely related to his COPD and RML collapse.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 132/73 mmHg, heart rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. His temperature is within normal range at 36.9°C. He is being supported with non-invasive BiPAP at night and is tolerating oxygen saturation above 85%.

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse rhonchi and trace crackles in the chest, with diminished breath sounds at the right base. He also exhibits flapping on straight arm raise and myoclonus on extension, which may indicate neurological involvement.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Blood chemistry is within normal limits except for elevated glucose levels and slightly decreased calcium levels. Arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with an elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2).

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure, acute exacerbation of COPD, lung cancer (SCC with RLL mass/collapse),"
