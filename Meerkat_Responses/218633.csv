   61 yo m with hx of AML, s/p 7+3 induction chemo c/b presumed fungal
   pneumonia treated with voriconazole, and reduced EF (30-40%), CAD s/p
   PCI with BMS x3 in LAD([**2149-12-24**]) who now presents with chest pain and
   fevers/tachycardia.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis/tachycardia: Pt has SIRS criteria, also has new
   leukocytosis and rigors. Blood pressures borderloine overnight.
   Lingular opacity concerning for aspergillus pneumonia given elevated
   Beta Glucan/Galactomannon. Unlikely that this would be contributing to
   this presentation given pt undergoing treatment for sometime. This
   morning CXR with more diffuse infiltration in the left lingula,
   possibly representing bacterial infection. UA unremarkable. No
   meningeal symptoms. Abdomen benign.
   - fluid boluses for now
   - continue vanc, cefipime and voriconazole
   - restart flagyl due to risk for reinfection with current abxs
   - f/u on blood cx
   - f/u on urine Cx
   - f/u on CXR read and repeat in AM
   - start tamiflu and send influenza DFA
   - contact and droplet precautions
   - monitor CBC with diff
   .
   # CAD, chest pain: Patient chest pain free. As above, patient s/p PCI
   with BMS to LAD several days prior to admission, now with chest pain
   and elevated troponin concerning for ACS. Possible etiologies include
   troponin leak from revascularization versus placque rupture in coronary
   artery that was not revascularized. In-stent thrombosis seems extremely
   unlikely as CP resolved with one SL nitro and minimal ECG changes.
   Also could be having demand ischemia in setting of tachycardia due to
   sepsis. Cardiac enzymes trending up overnight.
   - cycle CE until CK peaks
   - continue ASA, plavix, statin
   - telemetry
   - continue rate control with metoprolol, will change to short acting
   - heparin drip for now
   - repeat echo to evaluate for new wall motion defects
   - consider integrillin if pain continues
   .
   # Heart Failure: Pt with chronic systolic heart failure with recent TTE
   showing EF worsened to 30-40%. No clinical signs or symptoms of heart
   failure currently.
   - continue BB and ACE inhibitor as BP tolerates
   - monitor daily wts
   - Careful fluid hydration

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent induction chemotherapy and is now presenting with fever, tachycardia, and chest pain. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 39.8°C (103.6°F), heart rate of 134 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80-90s, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

The patient's physical examination shows a supple neck, no jugular venous distention, normal cardiac examination, clear lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no extremity abnormalities. The patient's neurological examination is also noted to be altered, with gross motor function intact but further assessment of gait and strength not performed.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (15.0 K/uL), hemoglobin (9.4 g/dL), creatinine (1.0 mg/dL), and blood urea nitrogen (18 mg/dL). The patient's troponin levels are elevated at 0.95, while other cardiac markers remain within normal ranges.

Imaging studies pending include a chest X-ray, ECG, and urine cultures. The patient's microbiology cultures are also"

   imaging last week, as well as OSH imaging from today confirming this
   finding that in the past was thought to be a Aspergillus infection,
   since the Ag was positive and B-glucan was present. He also has c/o of
   dysuria early today, however, UA is rather bland. Most likely sources
   of infection are pulmonary versus GU. He denies GI sx, however, did
   have C. diff infection on [**2149-12-2**], and just completed flagyl 2 days ago
   per pt. Now also has mild hypotension concerning for sepsis. Per OSH,
   CTA did not show a PE, however, pt is at risk for clots due to
   malignancy and could have a DVT elsewhere that could be causing his
   fever. Fevers could also be from recurrent AML, however, his diff is
   not consistent with this. Other possibility is fever from ASC, but this

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who has undergone induction chemotherapy. He presents with chest pain, fevers, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. The patient has a known lingular opacity on imaging, previously thought to be an Aspergillus infection. He also has dysuria and a positive blood culture for Aspergillus. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.8°C (103.6°F), heart rate of 134 bpm, blood pressure of 94/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is on multiple medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, vancomycin, metronidazole, heparin sodium, and meperidine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis suggests a possible septic state. The known lingular opacity and positive Aspergillus blood culture indicate a potential pulmonary source of infection. Other possible sources include urinary tract infection (UTI) and gastrointestinal (GI) infection.

2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and recently underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy (CTX).
- He presents with sepsis, which is characterized by hypotension, fever, and leukocytosis.
- The patient has a known lingular opacity on the chest X-ray, presumed to be a fungal pneumonia caused by Aspergillus infection.
- He recently had a Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and completed a course of Flagyl.
- The patient is responsive to intravenous fluid (IVF) boluses and requires continued fluid resuscitation.
- Antibiotics have been started, including vancomycin, voriconazole, cefepime, and Flagyl. Antibiotic therapy will be tailored based on culture results.
- The patient is also on tamiflu, awaiting DFA (diagnostic findings) pending.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with chest pain. His troponin levels are elevated, but the EKG shows no significant changes. This may not be related to stent occlusion as he is currently pain-free.
- The patient's heart function is compromised, with an ejection fraction of 30-40%. He is on beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, and careful fluid management is required.
- The patient is in acute myeloid leukemia post-induction chemotherapy and requires a bone"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo m with hx of AML, s/p 7+3 induction chemo c/b presumed fungal
   pneumonia treated with voriconazole, and reduced EF (30-40%), CAD s/p
   PCI with BMS x3 in LAD([**2149-12-24**]) who now presents with chest pain and
   fevers/tachycardia.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis/tachycardia: Pt has SIRS criteria, also has new
   leukocytosis and rigors. Blood pressures borderloine overnight.
   Lingular opacity concerning for aspergillus pneumonia given elevated
   Beta Glucan/Galactomannon. Unlikely that this would be contributing to
   this presentation given pt undergoing treatment for sometime. This
   morning CXR with more diffuse infiltration in the left lingula,
   possibly representing bacterial infection. UA unremarkable. No
   meningeal symptoms. Abdomen benign.
   - fluid boluses for now
   - continue vanc, cefipime and voriconazole
   - restart flagyl due to risk for reinfection with current abxs
   - f/u on blood cx
   - f/u on urine Cx
   - f/u on CXR read and repeat in AM
   - start tamiflu and send influenza DFA
   - contact and droplet precautions
   - monitor CBC with diff
   .
   # CAD, chest pain: Patient chest pain free. As above, patient s/p PCI
   with BMS to LAD several days prior to admission, now with chest pain
   and elevated troponin concerning for ACS. Possible etiologies include
   troponin leak from revascularization versus placque rupture in coronary
   artery that was not revascularized. In-stent thrombosis seems extremely
   unlikely as CP resolved with one SL nitro and minimal ECG changes.
   Also could be having demand ischemia in setting of tachycardia due to
   sepsis. Cardiac enzymes trending up overnight.
   - cycle CE until CK peaks
   - continue ASA, plavix, statin
   - telemetry
   - continue rate control with metoprolol, will change to short acting
   - heparin drip for now
   - repeat echo to evaluate for new wall motion defects
   - consider integrillin if pain continues
   .
   # Heart Failure: Pt with chronic systolic heart failure with recent TTE
   showing EF worsened to 30-40%. No clinical signs or symptoms of heart
   failure currently.
   - continue BB and ACE inhibitor as BP tolerates
   - monitor daily wts
   - Careful fluid hydration
   .
   # Acute AML s/p induction: BMT is aware of admission
   - transfer to BMT when aware

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who has undergone 7+3 induction chemotherapy. He also has a reduced ejection fraction (30-40%), coronary artery disease (CAD), and has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient presents with chest pain, fevers, tachycardia, and elevated cardiac enzymes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection, which can progress to sepsis if not treated promptly and appropriately.

2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient's chest pain and elevated troponin levels indicate a potential ACS. This could be due to plaque rupture or demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis.

3. Heart failure: Given the patient's chronic systolic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, there is a risk of exacerbation of heart failure.

4. Infection: The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest an infection, possibly bacterial or fungal in nature. This could be related to his immunocompromised state due to AML treatment.

5. Thrombosis: The patient is at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and other"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent induction chemotherapy. He also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the placement of three bare metal stents (BMS) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient presents with chest pain, fevers, and tachycardia. He has been treated with voriconazole for presumed fungal pneumonia, and his cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's white blood cell count is improving, suggesting either treatment of infection or a side effect of chemotherapy. There is concern for Aspergillus pneumonia, but the flu swab is negative. The patient also has a positive stool culture for Clostridium difficile. The patient's abdominal examination is benign, and his urine analysis is unremarkable. He is currently on several medications including vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and voriconazole. The patient's cardiac enzymes are still uptrending, and there is a concern for ACS or plaque rupture in a coronary artery that was not revascularized. In-stent thrombosis seems unlikely. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits, and his oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula. His respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen delivery. The patient's fluid balance is positive, indicating fluid overload. There are no signs of heart failure at present, but the patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30-40%. The patient is currently being monitored closely in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes, and history of CAD raise concerns for ACS. This may require further intervention such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
2. Fungal Pneumonia: The patient's presentation and elevated Beta Glucan/Galactomannon levels suggest the possibility of fungal pneumonia, specifically Aspergillus. Ongoing surveillance and antifungal therapy will be necessary.
3. Clostridium difficile Infection: The positive stool culture for C. difficile indicates an infection caused by this bacterium. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and bowel regimen should be continued.
4. Bleeding: The patient has received blood transfusions, and there is concern for bleeding complications, particularly in the context of anticoagulant therapy. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential.
5. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, and fluid overload is evident from the positive fluid balance. Careful monitoring and adjustment of fluid intake/output are required to prevent worsening heart failure.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rate has been elevated, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of increased troponin levels due to hypotension. He was found to be in atrial fibrillation and received heparin for prophylaxis. The patient's chest pain subsided after receiving morphine and has been in sinus rhythm since 00:40. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 144/74 mmHg and a heart rate of 83 bpm. The patient is receiving multiple medications including diltiazem, heparin, amiodarone, metoprolol, and morphine. He has a history of chronic heart failure, hypotension, and aspergillus infection. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated at 15.0 K/uL, and his troponin levels continue to rise. Other lab results show anemia, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute coronary syndrome, leukemia, chronic systolic heart failure, hypotension, and invasive aspergillus infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent induction chemotherapy and presented with chest pain, fevers, and tachycardia. He has a reduced ejection fraction (30-40%) and coronary artery disease (CAD) with three bare metal stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). 

The patient's condition includes:

1. Fever/Leukocytosis/Tachycardia: The patient's white blood cell count is improving, which may indicate treatment of infection or a side effect of chemotherapy.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a left lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray, which is concerning for Aspergillus pneumonia given elevated beta glucan and galactomannan levels. He is being treated with antifungals.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a + stool Clostridium difficile.
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has chest pain and elevated troponin levels, suggesting possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Possible etiologies include troponin leak from revascularization, plaque rupture in a non-revascularized coronary artery, or demand ischemia due to sepsis.
5. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent induction chemotherapy and presented with chest pain, fevers, and tachycardia. The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (30-40%) and coronary artery disease (CAD), for which he had percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's current condition includes fever, leukocytosis, and tachycardia. Laboratory results indicate elevated troponin levels and positive findings for C. difficile in stool. Imaging studies reveal worsening pneumonia, and there are concerns about possible aspergillus pneumonia. The patient's cardiac enzymes are also trending upwards.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's presentation of fever, leukocytosis, and positive findings for C. difficile in stool suggests an ongoing infection. This could lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's chest pain, elevated troponin levels, and recent PCI indicate a possible ACS. This condition requires immediate attention and intervention to prevent further complications like myocardial infarction.
3. Cardiac Failure: The patient's reduced ejection fraction and symptoms of chest pain may suggest cardiac failure. Appropriate management of fluid balance and medication adjustment is crucial to prevent exacerbation of heart failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent induction chemotherapy and had presumed fungal pneumonia treated with voriconazole. He also has reduced ejection fraction (30-40%) and coronary artery disease (CAD) with three bare metal stents in the left anterior descending artery. The patient presents with chest pain, fevers, and tachycardia. 

24-hour events include the spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm, substernal chest pressure with diaphoresis, and worsening pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Voriconazole, Metronidazole, Vancomycin, and Cefepime. He is also receiving infusions of Diltiazem, Heparin Sodium, and Amiodarone. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 144/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. His cardiac rhythm is currently sinus rhythm. The patient has trace bilateral lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, increased troponin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes and kidney function are within normal limits.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who has undergone induction chemotherapy and presented with chest pain, fevers, and tachycardia.
- The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (30-40%) and coronary artery disease (CAD), for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) several days prior to admission.
- The patient's current condition includes:
   - Chest pain and fevers/tachycardia: The patient's white blood cell count is improving, suggesting treatment of infection or a side effect of chemotherapy. There is concern for aspergillus pneumonia given elevated Beta Glucan/Galactomannon, although he is being treated with antifungals. The urine analysis is unremarkable, and there are no meningeal symptoms. The abdomen is benign, and the flu swab is negative. The stool culture is positive for Clostridium difficile.
   - CAD and chest pain: The patient's chest pain has resolved, and cardiac enzymes are trending up overnight. There is concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), possibly due to troponin leak from revascularization or plaque rupture in a coronary artery that was not revascularized. In-stent thrombosis seems unlikely as the pain resolved with minimal ECG changes."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent induction chemotherapy. He also has a reduced ejection fraction (30-40%) and coronary artery disease (CAD) with three bare-metal stents in the left anterior descending artery.

The patient presented with chest pain, fevers, and tachycardia. His fever and white blood cell count are now consistently normal, and the findings on the chest X-ray have improved. He tested positive for Clostridium difficile in his stool and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with flagyl and voriconazole. The patient is also on contact precautions and will need a follow-up on blood and urine cultures.

The patient's cardiac status includes atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was converted back to sinus rhythm using intravenous amiodarone and is now being continued orally. He was also on diltiazem and heparin, but these have been discontinued.

Regarding heart failure, the patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%. There are no clinical signs or symptoms of heart failure currently. The plan is to continue beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors if the patient's blood pressure is sufficient. Daily weight monitoring, careful fluid hydration as needed, and an echocardiogram will be done.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone 7+3 induction chemotherapy. He is currently presenting with chest pain, fevers, and tachycardia. The patient also has a reduced ejection fraction (30-40%) and coronary artery disease (CAD) for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) on December 24th.

Based on the information provided, the patient is currently being treated for several medical conditions. These include sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), leukemia (specifically AML), heart failure (chronic systolic), hypotension, and aspergillus infection.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 132/80 mmHg to 136/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, normal creatinine levels, and mildly elevated troponin-T levels. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole), antifungals (voriconazole"
