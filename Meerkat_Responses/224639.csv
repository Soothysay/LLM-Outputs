   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   .
   # Shock/PEA arrest: Likely hypovolemic in the setting of acute blood
   loss from LUE AVF arteriole bleed and hypotension.  s/p cut down at
   bedside with brachial artery tied off.  CE negative x 1.  ECG with new
   conduction delay and TWI may be a result of CPR and not an etiology.
   Patient also with recent positive blood cultures, but has been negative
   while on vanc.  Likely this is not a result of septic shock. Patient
   s/p massive transfusion protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U platelets, 2U
   FFP.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Defer artic cooling protocol given return to baseline MS per family
   - Consider pressure support with levophed prn
   - Attempt to wean pressure support and try spontaneous breathing trial
   this AM; continue light sedation versed/fentanyl as needed
   - Follow up EKG and CE
   .
   # LUE AVF bleed: Stable. Opened spontaneously and likely etiology of
   shock/PEA arrest.  Transplant cut down at bedside and sutured artery
   and vein shut.  Currently packed and wrapped tightly.  Unclear if
   patient will need to go to OR to have this revised or if current
   suturing is appropriate.  Likely will need some type of revision.
   Probably unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut
   down may need to be cleaned out and re-assessed.  Currently fibrinogen
   not low 297, INR mildly elevated at 1.3.  At this time low suspicion
   for DIC.  Will continue to monitor.
   - Follow up transplant surgery recommendations
   - Continue hemostasis with sutures, packing and ACE bandage
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Will need emergent OR if rebleed
   - Consider desmopressin in setting of uremic platelets (will hold for
   now)
   .
   # Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic to 6.9 on initial presentation with
   ECG changes. Patient received calcium gluconate, bicarb and some
   insulin during the code.  ECG in ICU without T-wave changes although
   QRS is wider than before.  K currently at 4.
   - If increases, renal aware and can place urgent HD line
   - Trend K overnight, if continues to increase will continue medical
   management
   - Follow-up renal recs
 will place tunnel IR in RIJ and plan for HD
   this PM
   - Trend lactate
 downtrending 1.3 from 8.1 peak
   - Check ionized calcium
 1.13
   .
   # Fever: Source at this time likely the old AV fistula site or possibly
   IJ stent.  Patient with fairly extensive fever work up that was
   unrevealing.  TEE was not done, but low suspicion for endocarditis.
   Unclear at this point it patient will need to have old AV fistula/graft
   site evaluated for infection and debrided.
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Follow up CXR, culture
   .
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   .
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.  Currently intubated, depending on O2
   requirement may need to have HD to decrease volume.
   -I/O, HD when able.
   -consider HD if needed.
   .
   # Dementia: Baseline poor mental status in setting of vascular
   dementia. Per discussion with NH staff, patient receives psychotropics
   for agitation (trazodone, citalopram, and olanzapine), as well as prn
   olanzapine.
   .
   # HTN: Hold anti-hypertensives bleed.
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Continue synthroid
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.  See AV bleed for more info.
   -Trend hct.
   -Consider epo as outpatient.
   .
   # CVA: On aspirin as outpatient.
   -Hold in setting of bleed.
   .
   # HLD: Hold statin so not to confuse any elevation in CK.
   .
   # FEN: OG tube in place.  If not being extubated in am, then will start
   tube feeds and consult nutrition.
   # PPx: Holding hep SC in setting of bleed. Pneumoboots for DVT proph.
   PPI for ulcer proph.  Vent bundle.
   # Access: Femoral [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] need to re-eval access in AM. Given report
   by ED of difficulty in threading RIJ and lack of compressibility of
   RIJ/[**Last Name (LF) 3871**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] re-eval with ultrasound to assess for thrombus. Can also
   consider dedicated U/S or CT with contrast.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week, congestive heart failure, and cerebrovascular accident. The patient was admitted from a nursing home with fever, altered mental status, and hyperkalemia with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes.

The patient experienced an arteriovenous (AV) fistula hemorrhage and subsequent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She underwent a cutdown procedure at the bedside with brachial artery ligation and received massive transfusion protocol with 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC), 2 units of platelets, and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP).

The patient's current assessment includes ongoing hypotension and hypovolemia due to the AV fistula bleed. Her ECG shows new conduction delay and T-wave inversion (TWI), which may be a result of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and not an etiology. The patient also has positive blood cultures but has been negative while on vancomycin, suggesting that it is unlikely to be septic shock. 

The patient's LUE AV fistula bleed is stable, but there is uncertainty regarding the need for surgical revision. The patient's hyperkalemia has improved from 6.9 to 4, and her lactate levels are downtrending from a peak of 8.1.

The patient's fever is likely originating from the old AV fistula site or possibly the internal jugular (IJ) stent. Extensive fever workup has been unrevealing, and there is low suspicion for endocarditis.

Other ongoing concerns include the patient's diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, dementia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, anemia secondary to end-stage renal disease, cerebrovascular accident, and hyperlipidemia.

In terms of medical complications, potential issues may include ongoing hypotension and hypovolemia due to the AV fistula bleed, the need for potential surgical intervention on the AV fistula, ongoing monitoring and management of hyperkalemia, evaluation of fever sources, and ongoing care for the patient's comorbidities."

   .
   # Episodes of apnea: Improving. Likely [**3-14**] severe metabolic alkalosis;
   may also be [**3-14**] residual sedating meds. Changed vent to [**11-14**] this AM.
   Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Repeat ABG this PM to assess metabolic alkalosis
   - Wean vent as tolerated to [**6-14**] and consider spontaneous breathing

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week, congestive heart failure, and cerebrovascular accident. She was admitted from her nursing home with fever, altered mental status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes. The patient is now status post arteriovenous (AV) fistula hemorrhage and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/PEA arrest: The patient likely experienced hypovolemic shock due to acute blood loss from the left upper extremity (LUE) AV fistula arteriole bleed and hypotension. She received a massive transfusion protocol and received 5 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of platelets, and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma. The patient should continue to be monitored for any signs of shock or hemodynamic instability.
2. Hyperkalemia/ESRD: The patient presented with hyperkalemia, which was initially at 6.9 and caused ECG changes. She received calcium gluconate, bicarb, and insulin during the code, and her potassium level is currently at 4. It is planned to place a temporary vascular access line by interventional radiology (IR) today. The patient will also undergo hemodialysis (HD) this afternoon following IR line placement. Restarting"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   # Infected Graft
   ID suspected infection and started vancomycin. Admitted when aneurismal
   and seeming septic. Ruptures with exsanguination ion floor. Non-sterile
   ligation and transfusion. Now ACE bandages.
   - Appreciate input from transplant about wash-out
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Need to establish other access for HD
   # Access and HD
   Presently marginally viable femoral triple lumen. Can take 200 cc rate.
   Will need alternate access, but not tunneled.
   -
   # Episodes of apnea: Improved. Likely [**3-14**] severe metabolic alkalosis;
   may also be [**3-14**] residual sedating meds. Vent now at 5/5. Goal is to
   wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial in PM
   - Hold sedating meds
 back to pre-admission psychotropics
   # Shock/PEA arrest: Likely hypovolemic in the setting of acute blood
   loss from LUE AVF arteriole bleed and hypotension.  s/p cut down at
   bedside with brachial artery tied off.  CE negative x 1.  ECG with new
   conduction delay and TWI may be a result of CPR and not an etiology.
   Patient also with recent positive blood cultures, but has been negative
   while on vanc.  Likely this is not a result of septic shock. Patient
   s/p massive transfusion protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U platelets, 2U
   FFP.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Defer artic cooling protocol given return to baseline MS per family
   - Consider pressure support with levophed prn
   - Attempt to wean pressure support and try spontaneous breathing trial
   this AM; continue light sedation versed/fentanyl as needed
   - Follow up EKG and CE
   - Continue to trend lactate
   # LUE AVF bleed: Stable. Opened spontaneously and likely etiology of
   shock/PEA arrest.  Transplant cut down at bedside and sutured artery
   and vein shut.  Currently packed and wrapped tightly.  Unclear if
   patient will need to go to OR to have this revised or if current
   suturing is appropriate.  Likely will need some type of revision.
   Probably unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut
   down may need to be cleaned out and re-assessed.  Currently fibrinogen
   not low 297, INR mildly elevated at 1.3.  At this time low suspicion
   for DIC.  Will continue to monitor.
   - Follow up transplant surgery recommendations
   - Continue hemostasis with sutures, packing and ACE bandage
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Will need emergent OR if rebleed
   - Consider desmopressin in setting of uremic platelets (will hold for
   now)
   # Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic to 6.9 on initial presentation with
   ECG changes. Patient received calcium gluconate, bicarb and some
   insulin during the code.  ECG in ICU without T-wave changes although
   QRS is wider than before.  K currently at 4. Will attempt temporary VIP
   line placement by IR today.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   - Restart home renal meds (nephrocaps, etc)
   # Fever: Source at this time likely the old AV fistula site or possibly
   IJ stent.  Patient with fairly extensive fever work up that was
   unrevealing.  TEE was not done, but low suspicion for endocarditis.
   Unclear at this point it patient will need to have old AV fistula/graft
   site evaluated for infection and debrided.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Follow up CXR, culture
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.

   dementia. Per discussion with NH staff, patient receives psychotropics
   for agitation (trazodone, citalopram, and olanzapine), as well as prn
   olanzapine.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   # Infected Graft
   ID suspected infection and started vancomycin. Admitted when aneurismal
   and seeming septic. Ruptures with exsanguination ion floor. Non-sterile
   ligation and transfusion. Now ACE bandages.
   - Appreciate input from transplant about wash-out and removal of graft
   components
   - Continue vancomycin, likely for six weeks
   - Need to establish other access for HD
   # Access and HD
   Presently marginally viable femoral VIP line. Can take 200 cc rate.
   Will need alternate access, but not tunneled.
   - Continue with non-tunneled lines given intercurrent infection
   - Tunneled line and perhaps new AV fistula in future for continuing HD
   - Follow renal and transplant recs with respect to HD access
   # Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic, elevated creatinine and
   hyperphosphatemic on admission.  All will improve with dialysis.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   - Continue nephrocaps
   - Take off three liters today if pressure tolerates
   # Episodes of apnea: Improved. Likely [**3-14**] severe metabolic alkalosis;
   may also be [**3-14**] residual sedating meds. Vent now at 5/5. Goal is to
   wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial again
   - Hold sedating meds
 back to pre-admission psychotropics
   - Hopefully off vent later today (after HD and if stable at that time)
   # Shock/PEA arrest: Secondary to rapid exsanguination. Recovered with
   transfusion. CE still negative in view of creatinine/renal failure.
   Patient s/p massive transfusion protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U
   platelets, 2U FFP. Cooling was deferred in view of patient
s mental
   status
 baseline after resuscitation per family.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - No levophed unless necessary
   # LUE AVF bleed: Stable. Opened spontaneously and likely etiology of
   shock/PEA arrest.  Transplant cut down at bedside and sutured artery
   and vein shut.  Currently packed and wrapped tightly.  Unclear if
   patient will need to go to OR to have this revised or if current
   suturing is appropriate.  Likely will need some type of revision.
   Probably unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut
   down may need to be cleaned out and re-assessed.  Currently fibrinogen
   not low 297, INR mildly elevated at 1.3.  At this time low suspicion
   for DIC.  Will continue to monitor.
   - Follow up transplant surgery recommendations
   - Continue hemostasis with sutures, packing and ACE bandage
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Will need emergent OR if rebleed
   - Consider desmopressin in setting of uremic platelets (will hold for
   now)
   # Fever: Presently afebrile. Likely source of fever was graft
   infection. Need to be mindful of graft and stents nearby. Patient with
   fairly extensive fever work up that was unrevealing.  TEE was not done,
   but low suspicion for endocarditis initially
 this may seed and need
   to be checked at some point.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Follow up cultures
   - Possible debridement and wash-out
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.
   - HD to take off some volume today, as tolerated by pressure
   # Dementia, Neurology and Psychiatric Mental Status: Diagnosed
   previously as multi-infarct dementia.
   - Continue memantine
   - Continue citalopram
   - Continue PRN seroquel
   # HTN: Hold anti-HTN due to bleed.
   - Holding labetalol 100 mg and amlodipine 7.5 QD
   # Hypothyroid:
   - Continue synthroid
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.
   - Transfusion goal 21, if end-organ hypoxia or 30 if sepsis evident
   - Consider EPO as outpatient.
   # CVA: On aspirin as outpatient.
   - Hold in setting of bleed.
   # HLD: Hold statin so not to confuse any elevation in CK.
   - Restarted statin yesterday (simva. 40 mg)
   # FEN: OG tube in place.  Hold tube feeds as plan extubation.
   # PPx: Holding heparin SC in setting of bleed. Pneumoboots for DVT
   proph.  PPI for ulcer proph.  Vent bundle.
   # Access: Femoral [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] need to re-eval access. Can remove femoral

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance hemodialysis (MWF HD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted from her nursing home with fever, altered mental status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes. The patient experienced an aneurysmal and ruptured arteriovenous fistula (AVF) leading to exsanguination and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She received a massive transfusion and has been stabilized.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infected Graft: The patient has an infected AVF, which was suspected by the healthcare team. Vancomycin was started, and the patient will continue with this antibiotic for six weeks. There is a need for graft wash-out and removal of graft components. Another access for hemodialysis (HD) needs to be established due to the compromised femoral line.

2. Access and HD: The patient requires alternate access for HD as the current femoral VIP line is marginally viable. A tunneled line and possibly a new AV fistula may be needed in the future for continuing HD.

3. Hyperkalemia/ESRD: The patient has hyperkalemia, elevated creatinine, and hyperphosphatemia on admission. These conditions will improve with dialysis. The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   # Episodes of apnea: Improving. Likely [**3-14**] severe metabolic alkalosis;
   may also be [**3-14**] residual sedating meds. Changed vent to [**11-14**] this AM.
   Goal is to wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Repeat ABG this PM to assess metabolic alkalosis
   - Wean vent as tolerated to [**6-14**] and consider spontaneous breathing
   trial in PM
   - Limit sedation; consider propofol, haldol prn
   # Shock/PEA arrest: Likely hypovolemic in the setting of acute blood
   loss from LUE AVF arteriole bleed and hypotension.  s/p cut down at
   bedside with brachial artery tied off.  CE negative x 1.  ECG with new
   conduction delay and TWI may be a result of CPR and not an etiology.
   Patient also with recent positive blood cultures, but has been negative
   while on vanc.  Likely this is not a result of septic shock. Patient
   s/p massive transfusion protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U platelets, 2U
   FFP.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Defer artic cooling protocol given return to baseline MS per family
   - Consider pressure support with levophed prn
   - Attempt to wean pressure support and try spontaneous breathing trial
   this AM; continue light sedation versed/fentanyl as needed
   - Follow up EKG and CE
   - Continue to trend lactate
   # LUE AVF bleed: Stable. Opened spontaneously and likely etiology of
   shock/PEA arrest.  Transplant cut down at bedside and sutured artery
   and vein shut.  Currently packed and wrapped tightly.  Unclear if
   patient will need to go to OR to have this revised or if current
   suturing is appropriate.  Likely will need some type of revision.
   Probably unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut
   down may need to be cleaned out and re-assessed.  Currently fibrinogen
   not low 297, INR mildly elevated at 1.3.  At this time low suspicion
   for DIC.  Will continue to monitor.
   - Follow up transplant surgery recommendations
   - Continue hemostasis with sutures, packing and ACE bandage
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Will need emergent OR if rebleed
   - Consider desmopressin in setting of uremic platelets (will hold for
   now)
   # Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic to 6.9 on initial presentation with
   ECG changes. Patient received calcium gluconate, bicarb and some
   insulin during the code.  ECG in ICU without T-wave changes although
   QRS is wider than before.  K currently at 4. Will attempt temporary VIP
   line placement by IR today.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   - Restart home renal meds (nephrocaps, etc)
   # Fever: Source at this time likely the old AV fistula site or possibly
   IJ stent.  Patient with fairly extensive fever work up that was
   unrevealing.  TEE was not done, but low suspicion for endocarditis.
   Unclear at this point it patient will need to have old AV fistula/graft
   site evaluated for infection and debrided.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Follow up CXR, culture
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.  Currently intubated, depending on O2
   requirement may need to have HD to decrease volume.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   # Dementia: Baseline poor mental status in setting of vascular
   dementia. Per discussion with NH staff, patient receives psychotropics
   for agitation (trazodone, citalopram, and olanzapine), as well as prn
   olanzapine.
   # HTN: Hold anti-HTN due to bleed.
   # Hypothyroid: Continue synthroid
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.  See AV bleed for more info.
   -Trend hct.
   -Consider epo as outpatient.
   # CVA: On aspirin as outpatient.
   -Hold in setting of bleed.
   # HLD: Hold statin so not to confuse any elevation in CK.
   # FEN: OG tube in place.  Hold tube feeds as plan extubation.
   # PPx: Holding hep SC in setting of bleed. Pneumoboots for DVT proph.
   PPI for ulcer proph.  Vent bundle.
   # Access: Femoral [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] need to re-eval access. Can remove femoral

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week, congestive heart failure, and cerebrovascular accident. She was admitted from her nursing home with fever, altered mental status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes. The patient experienced an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) hemorrhage and subsequent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and massive transfusion protocol.

Current Assessment:

1. Episodes of apnea: Improving, likely due to severe metabolic alkalosis or residual sedating medications. Ventilator settings changed to CPAP/PSV mode.
2. Shock/PEA arrest: Likely hypovolemic due to acute blood loss from left upper extremity (LUE) AVF arteriole bleed and hypotension. The brachial artery was tied off, and the patient received blood products.
3. Fever: Source likely the old AV fistula site or possibly inferior vena cava (IVC) stent. Extensive fever workup was unrevealing, and low suspicion for endocarditis.
4. LUE AVF bleed: Stable, opened spontaneously, and likely etiology of shock/PEA arrest. Transplant cut down at bedside and sutured artery and vein shut. Currently packed and wrapped tightly. Unclear if patient will need to go to the operating room (OR) to have this revised or if current suturing is appropriate.
5. Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic to 6.9 on initial presentation with ECG changes. Patient received calcium gluconate, bicarb, and some insulin during the code. ECG in ICU without T-wave changes, although QRS is wider than before. K currently at 4. Attempting temporary vascular access (VIP) line placement by interventional radiology (IR) today.
6. DM2: Accuchecks and insulin subcutaneous (ISS).
7. CHF: Based on last transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), patient with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and diastolic CHF. Chest X-ray (CXR) with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with regard to oxygenation. Currently intubated, depending on O2 requirement may need to have hemodialysis (HD) to decrease volume.
8. Dementia: Baseline poor mental status in setting of vascular dementia. Per discussion with nursing home staff, patient receives psychotropics for agitation (trazodone, citalopram, and olanzapine), as well as prn olanzapine.
9. HTN: Hold antihypertensive medication due to bleed.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   # Infected Graft
   ID suspected infection and started vancomycin. Admitted when aneurismal
   and seeming septic. Ruptures with exsanguination ion floor. Non-sterile
   ligation and transfusion. Now ACE bandages.
   - Appreciate input from transplant about wash-out and removal of graft
   components
   - Continue vancomycin, likely for six weeks
   - Need to establish other access for HD
   # Access and HD
   Presently marginally viable femoral VIP line. Can take 200 cc rate.
   Will need alternate access, but not tunneled.
   - Continue with non-tunneled lines given intercurrent infection
   - Tunneled line and perhaps new AV fistula in future for continuing HD
   - Follow renal and transplant recs with respect to HD access
   # Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Hyperkalemic, elevated creatinine and
   hyperphosphatemic on admission.  All will improve with dialysis.
   - Plan for HD this PM following IR line placement
   - Continue nephrocaps
   - Take off three liters today if pressure tolerates
   # Episodes of apnea: Improved. Likely [**3-14**] severe metabolic alkalosis;
   may also be [**3-14**] residual sedating meds. Vent now at 5/5. Goal is to
   wean off vent as soon as possible.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial again
   - Hold sedating meds
 back to pre-admission psychotropics
   - Hopefully off vent later today (after HD and if stable at that time)
   # Shock/PEA arrest: Secondary to rapid exsanguination. Recovered with
   transfusion. CE still negative in view of creatinine/renal failure.
   Patient s/p massive transfusion protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U
   platelets, 2U FFP. Cooling was deferred in view of patient
s mental
   status
 baseline after resuscitation per family.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - No levophed unless necessary
   # LUE AVF bleed: Stable. Opened spontaneously and likely etiology of
   shock/PEA arrest.  Transplant cut down at bedside and sutured artery
   and vein shut.  Currently packed and wrapped tightly.  Unclear if
   patient will need to go to OR to have this revised or if current
   suturing is appropriate.  Likely will need some type of revision.
   Probably unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut
   down may need to be cleaned out and re-assessed.  Currently fibrinogen
   not low 297, INR mildly elevated at 1.3.  At this time low suspicion
   for DIC.  Will continue to monitor.
   - Follow up transplant surgery recommendations
   - Continue hemostasis with sutures, packing and ACE bandage
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Will need emergent OR if rebleed
   - Consider desmopressin in setting of uremic platelets (will hold for
   now)
   # Fever: Presently afebrile. Likely source of fever was graft
   infection. Need to be mindful of graft and stents nearby. Patient with
   fairly extensive fever work up that was unrevealing.  TEE was not done,
   but low suspicion for endocarditis initially
 this may seed and need
   to be checked at some point.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Follow up cultures
   - Possible debridement and wash-out
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.
   - HD to take off some volume today, as tolerated by pressure
   # Dementia, Neurology and Psychiatric Mental Status: Diagnosed
   previously as multi-infarct dementia.
   - Continue memantine
   - Continue citalopram
   - Continue PRN seroquel
   # HTN: Hold anti-HTN due to bleed.
   - Holding labetalol 100 mg and amlodipine 7.5 QD
   # Hypothyroid:
   - Continue synthroid
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.
   - Transfusion goal 21, if end-organ hypoxia or 30 if sepsis evident
   - Consider EPO as outpatient.
   # CVA: On aspirin as outpatient.
   - Hold in setting of bleed.
   # HLD: Hold statin so not to confuse any elevation in CK.
   - Restarted statin yesterday (simva. 40 mg)
   # FEN: OG tube in place.  Hold tube feeds as plan extubation.
   # PPx: Holding heparin SC in setting of bleed. Pneumoboots for DVT
   proph.  PPI for ulcer proph.  Vent bundle.
   # Access: Femoral [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] need to re-eval access. Can remove femoral
   [**First Name3 (LF) 2643**] if successful IR placement of VIP line.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 76F DM, ESRD, CVA admitted with PEA arrest /
   resp failure and hemorrhagic shock from AVF bleed. HD line placed,
   guidewire removed by IR. HCT stable, home meds restarted.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.0 BP 160/60 HR 80 RR 25 with sat 100 on PSV 5/50
   0.5 7.35/52/64 (?v). Frail woman, NAD on vent, follows commands. CTA B.
   RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. L arm dressing c/d/i. Chronic stasis changes. Labs
   notable for WBC 8K, HCT 29, K+ 4.8. BCX +MRSA. CXR with clear lungs.
   Agree with plan to manage acute respiratory failure with PSV, plan to
   extubate today following HD. Mental status stable post arrest, continue
   to hold all sedatives. For sepsis / septic shock [**3-14**] MRSE bactermia /
   AVF infection / aneurysm, continue vanco per HD protocol, transpant
   surgery following, monitor serial cultures, may need to go to OR for
   removal of infected graft material for source control. For ESRD, VIP HD
   line in placed but not functioning well; may need to be rewired or
   replaced in AM. Will slowly restart antihypertensives. Remainder of
   plan as outlined above. Patient is critically ill; total time: 35 min

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, end-stage renal disease on maintenance weekly hemodialysis (MWF HD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient was admitted from her nursing home with symptoms including fever, altered mental status, and hyperkalemia with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes. 

The patient experienced an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) bleed, leading to hemorrhagic shock and subsequent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient was successfully resuscitated with massive transfusion protocol and received packed red blood cells (pRBCs), platelets, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient's femoral AVF bleed was stabilized by suturing the artery and vein, and the area is currently wrapped tightly with an ACE bandage.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including infected graft, access and hemodialysis (HD) issues, hyperkalemia/ESRD, episodes of apnea, shock/PEA arrest, left upper extremity (LUE) AVF bleed, fever, dementia/neurology/psychiatric mental status, hypertension, hypothyroidism, anemia, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hyperlipidemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance hemodialysis (MWF HD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted from her nursing home with fever, altered mental status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes. The patient experienced an arterial-venous fistula (AVF) hemorrhage and subsequent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. 

The patient has multiple medical complications that require attention, including access issues related to her ESRD, graft site infection and bleeding, post-extubation respiratory issues, shock/PEA arrest, fever of unknown origin, diabetes mellitus type 2, CHF, dementia/neurology/psychiatric mental status, hypertension, hypothyroidism, anemia, cerebrovascular accident, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Graft site infection and bleeding: The patient's graft site has ruptured and is bleeding. There is a concern about the possibility of needing to go to the operating room for debridement/wash-out and removal of graft components. Close monitoring of the wound and continued tight wrapping with ACE bandages is recommended.

2. Endovascular infection: The patient has been diagnosed with an endovascular infection, likely Staphylococcus aureus coagul"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with a PMH significant for DM 2, ESRD on MWF HD, dCHF, CVA
   admitted from her nursing home with 2 days of fever, altered mental
   status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes, who is now status post A-V
   fistula hemorrhage and PEA arrest.
   .
   # Access/HD/ESRD: Presently marginally viable femoral VIP line. Can
   take 200 cc rate. Will need tunneled line and perhaps new AV fistula in
   future for continuing HD
   - Follow up with renal regarding postponing tunneled line access until
   Monday so as to continue to monitor blood cultures
   - Plan for repeat HD session today
   - Continue with non-tunneled lines given concurrent infection
   - Follow ID, renal and transplant recommendations with respect to HD
   access
   - Continue nephrocaps
   - Continue daily blood culture
   .
   # Graft site/LUE AVF bleed: s/p non-sterile ligation at bedside after
   spontaneous rupture and exsanguination. Unclear if patient will need to
   go to OR to have this revised or if current suturing is appropriate.
   Currently packed and wrapped tightly with ACE bandages. Probably
   unrealistic to salvage graft, but given emergent nature of cut down may
   need to be cleaned out and re-assessed. Not bleeding.
   - Appreciate and continue to follow input from transplant about
   possible OR for debridement/wash-out and removal of graft components
   - Continue to keep ACE bandage wrapped tightly and left UE elevated as
   tolerated; continue dressing changes per surgery
   - Continue to trend Hct
   - Continue vancomycin, likely prolonged course up to six weeks for
   endovascular infection
   - Obtain vancomycin trough (keep > 15 per ID recs)
   .
   # s/p extubation. Prior episodes of apnea resolved; likely [**3-14**] to
   severe metabolic alkalosis or residual sedating medication.
   - Obtain VBG off femoral line
   - Continue to hold off sedating medication
   .
   # Shock/PEA arrest: No longer in shock. Likely secondary to rapid
   exsanguination and had recovered with transfusion. CE still negative in
   view of creatinine/renal failure. Patient s/p massive transfusion
   protocol and received 5U pRBC, 2U platelets, 2U FFP. Cooling was
   deferred in view of patient
s mental status
 baseline after
   resuscitation per family.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - No levophed unless necessary
   .
   # Fever: Afebrile. Likely source of fever was graft infection. Need to
   be mindful of graft and stents nearby. Patient with fairly extensive
   fever work up that was unrevealing.  TEE was not done, but low
   suspicion for endocarditis initially
 this may seed and need to be
   checked at some point.
   - Continue vanc for broad gram+ coverage
   - Continue to follow up cultures
   .
   # DM2: Accuchecks and ISS.
   .
   # CHF: Based on last TTE, patient with preserved LVEF and diastolic
   CHF. CXR with signs of mild fluid overload without difficulty with
   regard to oxygenation.
   - HD to take off some volume today, as tolerated by pressure
   .
   # Dementia, Neurology and Psychiatric Mental Status: Diagnosed
   previously as multi-infarct dementia.
   - Continue memantine
   - Continue citalopram
   - Continue PRN seroquel
   .
   # HTN: Hold anti-HTN due to bleed.
   - Holding labetalol 100 mg and amlodipine 7.5 QD
   - Consider start amlodipine 5mg qd if elevated BPs
   .
   # Hypothyroid:
   - Continue synthroid
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-35, likely secondary to ESRD.  Now with
   acute bleed as above.
   - Transfusion goal 21, if end-organ hypoxia or 30 if sepsis evident
   - Consider EPO as outpatient.
   .
   # CVA: On aspirin as outpatient.
   - Hold in setting of bleed.
   .
   # HLD: Restarted simvastatin (initially held so as not to confuse with
   elevating CKs)
   .
   # FEN: Start PO renal diet.
   # PPx: Holding heparin SC in setting of bleed. Pneumoboots for DVT
   proph.  PPI for ulcer proph.  Vent bundle.
   # Access: Femoral VIP line, plan to tunneled line on Monday
   # Code: Full code (confirmed)
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) 4003**],[**First Name3 (LF) **] (daughter) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11263**] (c)/[**Telephone/Fax (1) 11264**] (h)
   # Dispo: ICU level of care.
    Agree with plan to manage acute respiratory failure with PSV, plan to
   extubate today following HD. Mental status stable post arrest, continue
   to hold all sedatives. For sepsis / septic shock [**3-14**] MRSE bactermia /
   AVF infection / aneurysm, continue vanco per HD protocol, transpant
   surgery following, monitor serial cultures, may need to go to OR for
   removal of infected graft material for source control. For ESRD, VIP HD
   line in placed but not functioning well; may need to be rewired or
   replaced in AM. Will slowly restart antihypertensives. Remainder of
   plan as outlined above. Patient is critically ill; total time: 35 min

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week, congestive heart failure, and cerebrovascular accident. She was admitted from her nursing home with fever, altered mental status, and hyperkalemia with ECG changes. The patient experienced an arterial-venous fistula hemorrhage and had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Graft site/LUE AVF bleed: The patient had a non-sterile ligation at bedside after spontaneous rupture and exsanguination. There is uncertainty about whether the patient will need to go to the operating room (OR) to have this revised or if the current suturing is appropriate. The graft may not be salvageable, and further assessment is needed.
2. Shock/PEA arrest: The patient is no longer in shock, likely secondary to rapid exsanguination and recovery with transfusion. Continuous cardiac monitoring is necessary.
3. Fever: The patient was febrile, likely due to graft infection. Extensive fever workup was unrevealing, but low suspicion for endocarditis initially. Mindful of graft and stents nearby, TEE may be needed at some point.
4. DM2: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, which requires ongoing management with Accuchecks and insulin sliding scale.
