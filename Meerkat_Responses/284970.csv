","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of early dementia, hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and depression. She presented to the emergency department (ED) after experiencing a syncopal episode and was found to have multiple melanotic stools. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being monitored for possible gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, renal failure, and other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleeding: The patient has multiple melanotic stools, which is concerning for GI bleeding, possibly from an upper source due to her history of PUD. The plan includes aggressive management of GI bleeding with intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI), two large bore IVs, q6 hr HCTs, holding home ASA and atenolol, transfusing for HCT <30, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) per GI this afternoon.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure (BP) readings indicate the need for close monitoring and prompt management. Hypotension can be a result of ongoing GI bleeding or other underlying causes.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) may indicate an infection or stress response. However, bowel ischemia is also a consideration. Monitoring"

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of early dementia, hypertension, coronary artery disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, and depression. She presented to the emergency department after experiencing a syncopal episode and was found to have multiple melanotic stools.

The patient appears well and is alert, oriented, and in no acute distress. 

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. These include:

1. Syncope: The patient's syncopal episode could be due to various causes such as vasovagal reaction, arrhythmia, or hypoglycemia. Since the patient has not shown any clear history of these conditions, transient hypotension caused by gastrointestinal bleeding is suspected, especially considering the presence of abdominal pain.

2. Melanotic Stools: The presence of melanotic stools indicates gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly from an upper source given the patient's history of peptic ulcer disease.

3. Abdominal Pain: The differential diagnosis for the patient's abdominal pain includes pain from gastrointestinal bleeding, bowel ischemia, or coronary ischemia.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count"

The syncopal episode could be due to various causes such as vasovagal response, arrhythmia, or hypoglycemia. However, the history is not particularly suggestive of any of these.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo female presents with syncopal episode and multiple melanotic
   stools.  EGD w/ blood in stomach, but no active bleeding site.  Hct has
   been relatively stable as have VS.
   .
   #GIB: EGD w/ blood in stomach, but no active bleeding site.  Unclear
   why pt has red blood in stool if source is from UGI tract, since pt
   does not seem to be bleeding large/brisk volumes.  [**Month (only) 51**] need to clarify
   w/ lower scope.
   -[**Hospital1 7**] IV PPI
   -two large bore IVs
   -q12 hr HCTs
   -hold home ASA, atenolol
   -transfuse for significant  drop in hct
   -f/u GI recs; ? lower scope
   .
   #Syncope: Multiple possible etiologies including vasovagal, arrythmia,
   or hypoglycemia, although history is not particularly suggestive for
   any of these. Suspect that if pt has had some ongoing GI bleeding, this
   could have resulted in transient hypotension.
   -monitor on tele
   -consider echo before discharge
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Unclear source and thus far afebile.  Has persisted
   longer than would suspect w/ stress response.
   -monitor for now, send urine cx as pt c/o some dysuria.  CIS.
   .
   #RF: Pt's Cr is above level in [**2184**] but unclear how far off she is from
   recent baseline. Continue gentle hydration PRN and trend.
   .
   #CAD: Holding ASA and BB in setting of probable acute bleed. Plan to
   re-add as soon as possible. Continue Zetia.
   .
   #HTN: Holding home atenolol. Will monitor for now and treat as needed.
   .
   #Depression/psych: Continue home meds.
   .
   #Hypothyroid: Continue home levothyroxine.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient underwent an endoscopy on [**2190-9-3**] at 01:45 PM, during which blood was visualized in the stomach but no active source of bleeding was identified. The patient was given Fentanyl and Midazolam, and their vital signs remained stable.

The patient's allergies, infusions, and other medications are documented. There are no significant changes to the medical and family history.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent endoscopy. The flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, neurologic assessment, and lab results. The labs show elevated WBC count, slightly low platelet count, normal hemoglobin levels, and elevated creatinine levels.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, VAP, and code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: Despite no active source of bleeding being identified during endoscopy, there is still a possibility of ongoing bleeding or re-bleeding in the stomach.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulability can increase"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of early dementia, hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and depression.
- She presented to the emergency department after experiencing a syncopal episode and was found to have several large melanic stools.
- The patient underwent an endoscopy which revealed blood in the stomach but no active source of bleeding.
- She received Fentanyl and Midazolam during the procedure, and her vital signs remained stable.
- The patient's allergies, infusions, and other ICU medications are noted.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the syncopal episode.
- Flow sheet data shows stable vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.
- The patient has received a total of 1,475 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 786 mL through IV fluids and 275 mL through urine.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine levels.
- Other lab values including troponin-T, CK/CKMB, glucose, and electrolytes are within normal range.
- The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Code status is full code, and the patient's total time spent in the ICU is mentioned.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The presence of elevated white blood cell count and prophylactic antibiotics suggest a possible infection, which needs to be closely monitored.
2. Bleeding: Although no active source of bleeding was found during the endoscopy, the patient's history of PUD and the presence of blood in the stomach indicate a risk for bleeding complications.
3. Organ dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level indicates potential kidney dysfunction, and close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
4. Respiratory issues: As the patient is in the ICU, there is a risk of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the use of mechanical ventilation.
5. Thromboembolic events: The prophylactic DVT medication indicates a concern for thromboembolic events, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

These are potential complications that can arise based on the patient's current health progress in the ICU."

   84 yo female presented with syncopal episode and multiple melanotic
   stools.
   .
   #Syncope: Multiple possible etiologies including vasovagal, arrythmia,
   or hypoglycemia, although history is not particularly suggestive for
   any of these. Suspect that if pt has had some ongoing GI bleeding,
   particularly in the setting of abd pain, this could have resulted in
   transient hypotension.
   -monitor on tele
   -Check Orthostatics
   -aggressive managment of possible GI bleeding as below
   -monitor for evidence of recurrence
   -consider echo before discharge
   .
   #Melanotic stools: Concering for GI bleeding, potentially from upper
   source given pt's prior h/o PUD.
   -[**Hospital1 7**] IV PPI
   -two large bore IVs
   -q6 hr HCTs
   -hold home ASA, atenolol
   -transfuse for HCT <30
   -EGD per  GI this afternoon
   .
   #Abd pain: Ddx includes pain from GIB, bowel ischemia or coronary
   ischemia.
   -ROMI
   -consider CTA abd if clinically worsening but will defer for now given
   renal failure
   -Check lactate, C. Diff tox
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Likely stress demargination but bowel ischemia also a
   consideration. No other clear source and thus far afebile.
   -monitor for now, plan as above
   .
   #RF: Pt's Cr is above level in [**2184**] but unclear how far off she is from
   recent baseline. Has received 1L fluid in ED; continue gentle hydration
   PRN and trend.
   .
   #CAD: Holding ASA and BB in setting of probable acute bleed. Plan to
   re-add as soon as possible. Continue Zetia.
   .
   #HTN: Holding home atenolol. Will monitor for now and treat as needed.
   .
   #Depression/psych: Continue home meds.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo female presented with syncopal episode and multiple melanotic
   stools.
   1) Syncope: Not hemodynamically unstable in the MICU. Possibly related
   to a sentinel bleed and transient hypotension. Cardiogenic causes are
   certainly possible, perhaps exacerbated by her UGIB. Will likely need
   TTE prior to discharge. Continue to monitor on Tele.
   2) Melanotic stools: Concerning for GI bleeding, suspect  upper source
   given pt's prior h/o PUD and visualized blood in the stomach. Continue
   [**Hospital1 7**] IV PPI. Maintain two large bore IVs. Would like to check a Hct this
   morning (none since yesterday) and continue to monitor Hct [**Hospital1 7**].
   Continue to hold home ASA, atenolol. Transfuse for HCT <30. F/u with GI
   re c-scope or not (suspect not given visualized blood in the stomach.)
   3) Abd pain: Suspect that this was from pain related to UGIB, bowel
   ischemia or coronary ischemia. Can consider CTA abdomen if clinically
   worsening but will defer for now given renal failure.
   4) Leukocytosis: Likely stress response but bowel ischemia also a
   consideration. No other clear source and remains afebrile; infectious
   w/u if she does mount a fever. Would send UA prior to d/c
ing Foley
   given her level of discomfort and no other clear source for
   leukocytosis.
   5)RF: Creatinine is above level in [**2184**] but unclear how far off she is
   from recent baseline. Has received 1L fluid in ED; continue gentle
   hydration PRN and trend. Would endeavor to keep her net positive today.
   Recheck creatinine this morning. Given she
s having significant
   discomfort from Foley, OK to d/c this today.
   6) CAD: Holding ASA and BB in setting of probable acute bleed. Plan to
   re-add as soon as possible. Continue Zetia.
   7) HTN: Holding home atenolol. Will monitor for now and treat as
   needed.
   8) Depression/psych: Continue home meds.
   9) Hypothyroid: Continue home levothyroxine.
   10) FEN: Check albumin to correct calcium.
   11) Dispo: OK to send to floor after rechecking Hct and creatinine this
   morning.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with early dementia, hypertension, coronary artery disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, and depression. She presented to the emergency department with a syncopal episode and multiple melanotic stools. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) yesterday, which revealed blood in the stomach but no active source of bleeding. She received fluids overnight due to decreased urine output, and her vital signs remain stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Syncope: The patient's syncopal episode may be related to a sentinel bleed and transient hypotension. Cardiogenic causes are possible, possibly exacerbated by her upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Continuous monitoring on Tele and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) prior to discharge may be necessary.
2. Melanotic stools: The patient's melanotic stools are concerning for gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly an upper source given her history of peptic ulcer disease and visualization of blood in the stomach during EGD. Continuous IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy should be maintained, along with monitoring of hemoglobin concentration (Hct) and continuing to hold home aspirin and atenolol. Blood transfusion should be considered for Hct <30.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain may be attributed to pain related to upper gastrointestinal bleeding, bowel ischemia, or coronary ischemia. Consideration"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female who presented with a syncopal episode and multiple melanotic stools. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed blood in the stomach but no active bleeding site. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has been relatively stable, as have vital signs.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications that could arise:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The presence of blood in the stomach raises concerns about ongoing or potential gastrointestinal bleeding. Despite no active bleeding site observed during the EGD, the patient's melanotic stools indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. The plan includes transitioning from intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to oral PPI, placing two large bore intravenous lines, monitoring HCTs every 12 hours, holding home aspirin (ASA), adding back beta-blockers (BB), and following up with gastrointestinal recommendations.

2. Syncope: The patient experienced a syncopal episode, which could have multiple etiologies including vasovagal, arrhythmia, or hypoglycemia. Since the history is not particularly suggestive of these causes, it is suspected that transient hypotension due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding may have caused the syncope. Monitoring the patient on telemetry and for recurrence is recommended.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has persistently elevated white blood cell count, which is unclear in source and thus far afebrile"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female who presented with a syncopal episode and multiple melanotic stools. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) revealed blood in the stomach but no active bleeding site. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) has been relatively stable, as have vital signs. The assessment includes three main concerns: gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), syncope, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The presence of blood in the stool and the findings from the EGD suggest potential ongoing bleeding. It is important to monitor the patient's HCT and vital signs closely and consider transfusion if there is a significant drop in HCT. Transitioning from intravenous (IV) proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to oral PPI and adding back beta blockers (BB) are planned. Following gastrointestinal recommendations is also advised.

2. Syncope: The patient experienced a syncopal episode, which could be due to various causes such as vasovagal response, arrhythmia, or hypoglycemia. Given the possibility of ongoing GI bleeding, transient hypotension could have contributed to the syncope. Monitoring the patient on telemetry and for recurrence is recommended.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. However, the patient is currently afebrile and the leukocytosis has persisted longer than expected"
