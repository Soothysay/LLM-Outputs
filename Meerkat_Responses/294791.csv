   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo M with unknown past medical history presents with apparent
   intentional drug overdose, with likely phenytoin and TCAs, now s/p
   intubation for airwary protection.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology but may be related to drug
   overdose. First dilantin level subtherapeutic but will need to be
   cautiously followed Q4H. If levels exceed 20, patient may need extra
   dose of charcoal due to risk of enterohepatic recirculation. TCA
   positive on Serum tox, but no EKG changes so less likely to be toxic
   from TCA. No clear toxic prodrome fits this clincal picture as patient
   without tachycardia, hypertension and diaphoresis (sympathomimetics);
   agitation, tachycardia, flushing (anticholinergics); miosis, lack of
   response to narcan (opiods); or autonomic instability, clonus, tremors
   (serotonin syndrome). No dramatic AG, so less likely ethylene glycol or
   methanol toxicity. Afebrile and without leukocytosis so infection seems
   less likely. No dramatic electrolyte abnormalities. Seizure less likely
   given dilantin level. CT head without acute ICH, but given questionable
   history and possiblilty of a fall, ICH must be ruled out.
   - Appreciate Toxicology input
   - Crystalloid IVFs
   - Change midazolam and fentanyl to propafol to avoid benzo intoxication
   clouding the mental status picture
   - Repeat lytes for AG, and LFTSs
   - Monitor Dilanitn Q4H and repeat charcoal if greater than 20
   - EKG Q4H and challenge with intravenous sodium bicarbonate ([**1-31**] meq/kg
   push) if QRS greater than 100ms
   - F/u CT head
   .
   # Airway protection: Intubated for airway protection, without overt
   respiratory failure. ABG without acidemia, hypoxia, or hypercarbia. CXR
   clear, with possibility of some signs of aspiration on right side.
   Given history of charcoal aspiration, extubation may be difficult
   tommorow.
   - Continue AC ventilation overnight
   - Change Fent/Midaz to Propafol as above in hopes of extubating
   tommorow. Wean propafol in AM.
   - RSBI in AM prior to rounds
   - Repeat ABG now
   .
   # Suicideal ideation: Per report patient was attempted to hurt himself
   by taking a ""handful of pills"".
   - Pt awake and conversant now
   - Will get psych consult to discuss suicidal ideation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with an unknown medical history who presented with an apparent intentional drug overdose, possibly involving phenytoin and TCAs. He was intubated for airway protection and remained intubated overnight. The patient is now extubated and alert, responding to commands. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 125/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has rhonchi in his right lung and good air entry. Other physical examination findings are unremarkable. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and slightly low platelet count. Assessment and plan include monitoring for altered mental status, repeating dilantin levels every 4 hours, and considering an additional dose of charcoal if levels exceed 20. The patient is also being monitored for potential complications such as seizures, infection, and electrolyte imbalances. A CT head is planned to rule out intracranial hemorrhage. The patient's airway protection status is stable, and he may be extubated tomorrow. There are concerns about suicide ideation, and a psychiatric consultation has been requested. The patient's nutritional needs are being met, and prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin and stress ulcer prevention are in place."

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 125/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including propofol, famotidine, and heparin. He has a history of antibiotic use but the specific medication is not mentioned.

The patient's laboratory results indicate normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and albumin. However, the patient has slightly elevated levels of sodium and chloride, and slightly decreased levels of potassium and bicarbonate.

The patient's assessment includes altered mental status with an unclear etiology, possibly related to drug overdose. The first dilantin level is subtherapeutic, but will need to be cautiously monitored every four hours.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 yo M with unknown past medical history presents with apparent
   intentional drug overdose, with likely phenytoin and TCAs, now s/p
   intubation for airwary protection.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology but may be related to drug
   overdose. First dilantin level subtherapeutic but will need to be
   cautiously followed Q4H. If levels exceed 20, patient may need extra
   dose of charcoal due to risk of enterohepatic recirculation. TCA
   positive on Serum tox, but no EKG changes so less likely to be toxic
   from TCA. No clear toxic prodrome fits this clincal picture as patient
   without tachycardia, hypertension and diaphoresis (sympathomimetics);
   agitation, tachycardia, flushing (anticholinergics); miosis, lack of
   response to narcan (opiods); or autonomic instability, clonus, tremors
   (serotonin syndrome). No dramatic AG, so less likely ethylene glycol or
   methanol toxicity. Afebrile and without leukocytosis so infection seems
   less likely. No dramatic electrolyte abnormalities. Seizure less likely
   given dilantin level. CT head without acute ICH, but given questionable
   history and possiblilty of a fall, ICH must be ruled out.
   - Appreciate Toxicology input
   - Crystalloid IVFs
   - Change midazolam and fentanyl to propafol to avoid benzo intoxication
   clouding the mental status picture
   - Repeat lytes for AG, and LFTSs
   - Monitor Dilanitn Q4H and repeat charcoal if greater than 20
   - EKG Q4H and challenge with intravenous sodium bicarbonate ([**1-31**] meq/kg
   push) if QRS greater than 100ms
   - F/u CT head
   .
   # Airway protection: Intubated for airway protection, without overt
   respiratory failure. ABG without acidemia, hypoxia, or hypercarbia. CXR
   clear, with possibility of some signs of aspiration on right side.
   Given history of charcoal aspiration, extubation may be difficult
   tommorow.
   - Continue AC ventilation overnight
   - Change Fent/Midaz to Propafol as above in hopes of extubating
   tommorow. Wean propafol in AM.
   - RSBI in AM prior to rounds
   - Repeat ABG now
   .
   # Suicideal ideation: Per report patient was attempted to hurt himself
   by taking a ""handful of pills"". Will need to readress when patient
   awake, and may require psych consult.
   .
   # FEN: D51/2 NS, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals x2
   # Communication: None. No response at family phone numbers. Will need
   to readress in AM.
   # Code:  Full presumed
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with an unknown past medical history who presented with an apparent intentional drug overdose, likely involving phenytoin and TCAs. He was intubated for airway protection. The patient's mental status is altered, but the etiology is unclear. His first dilantin level was subtherapeutic, and he will need to be closely monitored with repeat measurements every four hours. If dilantin levels exceed 20, the patient may require an additional dose of charcoal due to the risk of enterohepatic recirculation. The patient tested positive for TCA on serum tox, but there are no EKG changes indicating toxicity from TCA. The patient does not exhibit signs consistent with other toxic ingestions such as sympathomimetics, anticholinergics, opioids, or serotonin syndrome. There are no dramatic AG (anion gap) abnormalities, so ethylene glycol or methanol toxicity is less likely. The patient is afebrile and does not have leukocytosis, making infection less likely. There are no dramatic electrolyte abnormalities. Seizure is less likely given the dilantin level. A CT head was performed without acute ICH, but given the questionable history and possibility of a fall, ICH must be ruled out.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to a suspected overdose of phenytoin and tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). The patient had attempted suicide. Since admission, the patient's condition has remained stable with flat dilantin levels and normal EKG readings. The patient was extubated this morning and is currently breathing on his own with the assistance of a BiPAP machine. Vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated heart rate of 106 beats per minute. The patient is alert and oriented, but experiences dizziness. Review of systems is negative for fever, chest pain, dyspnea, or any other significant symptoms. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and trace edema in the left lower extremity. Neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive and follows simple commands, but movement, tone, and skin assessments were not performed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: Although the patient is now extubated and breathing on his own, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to the previous overdose and potential damage to the respiratory system.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of airway protection issues, which puts him at risk for aspiration pneumonia if he inhales food, liquids, or vomit into his lungs.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: TCAs can cause cardiac toxicity and arrhythmias"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with an unknown medical history who presented with an apparent intentional drug overdose involving phenytoin and TCAs. The patient was intubated for airway protection. The altered mental status has resolved, and it is believed to be related to the poly-drug overdose. The patient tested positive for TCAs in serum toxicology but did not show any EKG changes. Seizure is less likely given the dilantin level. The patient attempted suicide by taking a ""handful of pills"" and expressed suicidal ideation. The patient is now awake and conversant, and psychiatry has deemed him medically stable enough for section 12. He is on a regular diet, receiving subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis, and has two peripheral lines. There was no response at the patient's family phone numbers, so they will be contacted later today per the patient's request. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be dispositioned to the psychiatry floor after consultation with medicine.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to airway protection, which puts him at risk for respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Infection: Being intubated and immobile, the patient is at an increased risk for developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related"

   # Altered mental status: Appears to be related to drug overdose. First
   dilantin level subtherapeutic but will need to be cautiously followed
   Q4H. If levels exceed 20, patient may need extra dose of charcoal due
   to risk of enterohepatic recirculation. TCA positive on Serum tox, but
   no EKG changes so less likely to be toxic from TCA. No clear toxic
   prodrome fits this clincal picture as patient without tachycardia,
   hypertension and diaphoresis (sympathomimetics); agitation,
   tachycardia, flushing (anticholinergics); miosis, lack of response to
   narcan (opiods); or autonomic instability, clonus, tremors (serotonin
   syndrome). No dramatic AG, so less likely ethylene glycol or methanol
   toxicity. Afebrile and without leukocytosis so infection seems less
   likely. No dramatic electrolyte abnormalities. Seizure less likely
   given dilantin level. CT head without acute ICH, but given questionable
   history and possiblilty of a fall, ICH must be ruled out.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU. They have been stable throughout the day, with no significant events reported. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in temperature. They are on prophylactic heparin and famotidine. The patient's lab results show some abnormalities, including an elevated white blood cell count and decreased platelet count. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and PSV/SBT mode on the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection. This could potentially lead to sepsis or septic shock if not treated promptly.
2. Bleeding: The decreased platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding. This could manifest as spontaneous bleeding or difficulty in clotting after invasive procedures.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient's respiratory support indicates a compromised respiratory function. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) if proper precautions are not taken.
4. Pressure injuries: Prolonged immobility in the ICU can lead to pressure injuries. Adequate turning and pressure relief measures should be implemented to prevent this.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient is on prophylactic heparin, there is still a risk of developing DVT due to immobility. Regular assessment and appropriate prophylaxis should be continued."

   .
   # Altered mental status: Appears to be related to drug overdose. First
   dilantin level subtherapeutic but will need to be cautiously followed
   Q4H. If levels exceed 20, patient may need extra dose of charcoal due
   to risk of enterohepatic recirculation. TCA positive on Serum tox, but
   no EKG changes so less likely to be toxic from TCA. No clear toxic
   prodrome fits this clincal picture as patient without tachycardia,
   hypertension and diaphoresis (sympathomimetics); agitation,
   tachycardia, flushing (anticholinergics); miosis, lack of response to
   narcan (opiods); or autonomic instability, clonus, tremors (serotonin
   syndrome). No dramatic AG, so less likely ethylene glycol or methanol
   toxicity. Afebrile and without leukocytosis so infection seems less
   likely. No dramatic electrolyte abnormalities. Seizure less likely
   given dilantin level. CT head without acute ICH, but given questionable
   history and possiblilty of a fall, ICH must be ruled out.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with an unknown medical history who presented with an apparent intentional drug overdose, likely involving phenytoin and TCAs. The patient required intubation for airway protection. The patient's mental status is altered, which is believed to be related to the drug overdose. Dilantin levels are subtherapeutic, but will need to be closely monitored. There is a concern for enterohepatic recirculation, so extra doses of charcoal may be needed if levels exceed 20. The patient tested positive for TCAs on serum tox, but without EKG changes, it is less likely that the patient is experiencing toxicity from TCAs. The patient does not exhibit symptoms consistent with sympathomimetic, anticholinergic, opioid, or serotonin syndrome. There are no signs of infection, and electrolyte abnormalities are not significant. Seizure is less likely given the dilantin level. A CT scan of the head showed no acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but given the questionable history and possibility of a fall, ICH must still be ruled out.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure - Although less likely due to the subtherapeutic dilantin level, seizure should still be considered as a potential complication given the patient's ingestion of phenytoin.
2. Infection - The patient is at risk for developing infections due to his altered mental status and potential immobility.
3. Electrolyte imbalances - While currently within normal range, the patient's electrolytes should continue to be trended as imbalances can occur in critically ill patients.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) - The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters.
5. Stress ulcer - The patient may develop stress ulcers due to the critical illness and potential use of medications like corticosteroids.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to endotracheal intubation.
7. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) - Although the initial CT scan was negative, it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of ICH, especially considering the patient's history and potential fall."

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old man admitted to the ICU for a suspected overdose of Dilantin and TCA. He is currently intubated but not extubated. His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 127/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He has mild diffuse abdominal tenderness and right lower extremity edema. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level. He has been receiving various medications including heparin for DVT prophylaxis, famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has an altered gag reflex and inability to protect his airway, which increases the risk of aspiration and subsequent pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic heparin is being administered, but monitoring for signs and symptoms of DVT is crucial.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and the use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Famotidine is being administered for prophylaxis, but close monitoring for"
