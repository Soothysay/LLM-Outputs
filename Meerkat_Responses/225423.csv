   Assessment and Plan
   The pt is a 48y/o M with PMH of Hepatitis C, HCC and alcoholic
   cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status requiring intubation for
   airway protection in the setting of suspected opioid overdose.
   .
   # Encephalopathy - most likely multifactorial involving end stage liver
   disease,?anoxic-insult given unknown down time, and drug toxicity. Head
   CT negative at OSH. Appears to be waking up more today as propofol is
   lightened.  Plan to:
   - hold sedating medications
   - increase lactulose to 60ml po q2h, titrate to stool 4-6x/day (no
   stool yet overnight)
   - given his improved responsiveness on exam, will plan to wean propofol
   #Respiratory failure
 in the setting of encephalopathy and need for
   airway protection. CXR actually improved this AM.  Will attempt to wean
   vent settings to PS and try to extubate today if possible.
   # EtOH Cirrhosis/HepC/HCC
 per recent history, his HCC is rapidly
   progressing and his liver function is rapidly declining.  He has many
   stigmata of liver disease, both on exam and laboratory testing.
   - s/p one dose of vitamin K last night, unlikely to improve coags, but
   will repeat coags today
   - c/s liver team today, ?role of steroids given his current hepatic
   function
   - family meeting to assess goals of care
   # Hx of heavy EtOH abuse - maintain on CIWA scale with ativan per
   protocol
   # PNA - CXR consistent with consolidation at bases, given unclear
   duration of pt's down time prior to transfer to ED will cover for
   possible aspiration PNA.
   - Continue Zosyn (obtain ID approval today)
   - F/u sputum culture .
   # Guaiac + NGT aspirate - pt with history varices and significant
   variceal bleeding, also EtOH abuse. Hct stable overnight and
   hemodynamics not c/w acute bleed.
   - Continue to follow q6-8h Hcts
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider EGD if evidence of active bleeding
   - two type and screens sent
   - 2 PIV
   # Hypotension
 likely secondary to physiology of hepatic failure and
   possibly opioid toxicity.  Improved with volume resuscitation and
   albumin overnight.  Physiology c/w a distributive process given her
   warm extremities and bounding pulses.
   - Continue to hold home BP meds
   - Follow BPs and urine ouput closely, adjust regimen as needed
   #Hyponatremia
 Likely secondary to end-stage liver disease and
   component of pre-renal azotemia. Improving appropriately with NS.
   Continue to follow q6h Na, lytes, and renal function.
   #Hypokalemia
 Replete K+ today with an IV bolus, repeat K+ this

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a medical history of Hepatitis C, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and alcoholic cirrhosis. He was admitted with altered mental status, suspected opioid overdose, and required intubation for airway protection. The patient's current condition includes encephalopathy, respiratory failure, liver disease, hypotension, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and a large flank hematoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and sedation indicate encephalopathy, which can be multifactorial due to end-stage liver disease, anoxic insult, and drug toxicity.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires airway protection due to encephalopathy and respiratory failure. Weaning off ventilator settings and attempting extubation today is planned.
3. EtOH Cirrhosis/HepC/HCC: The patient's rapidly progressing HCC and declining liver function suggest advanced liver disease. Vitamin K supplementation and a family meeting to assess goals of care are necessary.
4. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has a history of heavy alcohol abuse and consolidation at the bases on chest X-ray, indicating possible aspiration PNA. Zosyn coverage and sputum culture follow-up are planned.
5. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of varices and significant variceal bleeding, as well as ethanol abuse. Hcts"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and alcoholic cirrhosis. He was admitted with altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection, suspected opioid overdose, and negative head CT at OSH. The patient's encephalopathy is likely multifactorial, involving end-stage liver disease, possible anoxic-insult, and drug toxicity.

The patient's respiratory failure is due to the need for airway protection in the setting of encephalopathy. His chest X-ray improved this morning, and he will be weaned off ventilator settings to partial support and attempted extubation today if possible.

The patient has multiple stigmata of liver disease, both on exam and laboratory testing. His liver function is rapidly declining, and he has a history of heavy ethanol abuse. He is currently being maintained on the CIWA scale with ativan per protocol. 

The patient also has pneumonia consistent with consolidation at the bases, and given unclear duration of his downtime prior to transfer to the emergency department, he will be covered for possible aspiration pneumonia. Antibiotic coverage with Zosyn has been initiated, and follow-up sputum culture is planned.

Guaiac positive NGT aspirate suggests a possible gastrointestinal bleed, particularly in the context of his history of varices and significant variceal bleeding. However, his hemodynamics are stable overnight, and he is not showing"

   A/P: The pt is a 48y/o M with PMH of Hepatitis C, HCC and alcoholic
   cirrhosis admitted with encephalopathy after being found unresponsive
   with an empty bottle of oxycontin.
   .
   # Encephalopathy - most likely multifactorial including ESLD and
   narcotic overdose with suspected oxycontin ingestion. Pt also with
   evidence of infection with PNA.
   - hold sedating medications
   - start lactulose 30ml Q2 with goal >4BM daily for hepatic
   encephalopathy
   - treat suspected PNA with zosyn
   - maintain invasive ventilation overnight given opiate ingestion,
   continue sedation with propofol
   - maintain on CIWA scale
   - liver consult in am
   .
   # EtOH Cirrhosis/HepC/HCC - pt with recent history of EtOH use. Tox
   negative at OSH. DF 78. INR 2.8. Pt felt not to be candidate for
   chemotherapy or surgical intervention
   - will give 10mg IV vit k now
   - consider glucocorticoids given DF if no correction of INR with Vit K
   - family meeting to assess goals of care
   .
   # EtOH abuse - maintain on CIWA scale with ativan
   .
   # PNA - CXR consistent with consolidation at bases, given unclear
   duration of pt's down time prior to transfer to ED will cover for
   possible aspiration PNA
   - start zosyn
   - obtain suptum culture
   - repeat CXR in am
   .
   # Guaiac + OT aspirate - pt with history varices, also EtOH abuse
   - cycle HCT
   - IV PPI
   - consider EGD if evidence of active bleeding
   - 2 PIV
   .
   # Large Flank Hematoma - given unclear duration prior to discovery of
   pt and extend of hematoma will check CK
   - area demarcated and will follow clinically
   .
   # Relative Hypotension - likely mulitfactorial with medication overdose
   and ESLD
   - hold BP meds for now
   - IVF
   - check urine lytes and Na
   - cycle HCT given oropharynx aspirate at OSH

","Summary:
- The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), and alcoholic cirrhosis admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy after suspected opioid overdose.
- The patient has evidence of infection with pneumonia (PNA) and a positive guaiac test indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with controlled blood pressure and oxygen saturation at 100%.
- The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes and low albumin levels.
- The patient has been started on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, zosyn for suspected PNA, and propofol for sedation due to opioid ingestion.
- The patient will receive IV vitamin K and glucocorticoids if there is no correction of INR with vitamin K.
- Family meeting to assess goals of care is planned.
- The patient is maintained on CIWA scale for ethanol abuse and given Ativan.
- Chest X-ray is consistent with consolidation at the bases, so zosyn has been started, and sputum culture is pending.
- Repeat CXR in the morning is planned.
- EGD is considered if evidence of active bleeding is present.
- Large flank hematoma is being monitored clinically, and CK level will be checked.
- Relative hypotension is likely multifactorial and will be managed with IV fluids and holding BP medications.
- The patient is NPO for now.
- Two peripheral IV lines are in place.
- Code status is full.
- Disposition is ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a potential complication of liver cirrhosis and can cause altered mental status and confusion.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has evidence of infection with PNA, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The positive guaiac test suggests possible gastrointestinal bleeding, which can result in hypotension and hemodynamic instability.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, which can affect kidney function and lead to renal dysfunction.
5. Hepatorenal syndrome: Given the patient's history of liver disease, hepatorenal syndrome is a potential complication that can cause renal dysfunction.
6. Hepatitis C recurrence: The patient has a history of Hepatitis C, which can recur after liver transplantation or other interventions.
7. Hepatocellular carcinoma progression: The patient has a history of HCC, which can progress and cause complications such as bleeding or obstruction.
8. Opioid withdrawal: The patient may experience opioid withdrawal symptoms after the overdose and cessation of opioids.
9. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of developing DVT.
10. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and stress can lead to the development of stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause bleeding.

These are some potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided. However, further assessment and monitoring are required to confirm their presence and manage them appropriately."

","The patient is a 92-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, oxycontin overdose, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of altered mental status, which may be due to opiates, possible etoh use, and hepatic encephalopathy. He also has bloody nasogastric tube output, suspected pneumonia, and hypoNa (low sodium levels).

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/56 to 155/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. His weight is currently 92.7 kg.

The patient received propofol infusion at a rate of 20 mcg/kg/min and pantoprazole (Protonix) at midnight. He also received piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) at 2:30 AM.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and lactate levels. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal range. The liver function tests indicate elevated ALT and AST levels, while the bilirubin level is slightly elevated. The electrolyte levels show low sodium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, suspected oxycontin overdose, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient's condition remains critical. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the respiratory failure, the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Infection: The patient has been prescribed antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. There is a risk of developing antibiotic resistance or worsening infection.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests show elevated levels of AST and ALT, suggesting ongoing liver damage. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
4. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged PTT and low fibrinogen level indicate a potential bleeding risk. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate values are within normal limits, but there may be an increased risk of cardiovascular events due to liver failure and other underlying conditions.
6. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU may lead to malnutrition, which can impair wound healing and increase the risk of infections.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT formation. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent clot"

   Assessment and Plan
   The pt is a 48y/o M with PMH of Hepatitis C, HCC and alcoholic
   cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status requiring intubation for
   airway protection in the setting of suspected opioid overdose.
   .
   # Encephalopathy - most likely multifactorial involving end stage liver
   disease,?anoxic-insult given unknown down time, and drug toxicity. Head
   CT negative at OSH. Appears to be waking up more today as propofol is
   lightened.  Plan to:
   - hold sedating medications
   - increase lactulose to 60ml po q2h, titrate to stool 4-6x/day (no
   stool yet overnight)
   - given his improved responsiveness on exam, will plan to wean propofol
   #Respiratory failure
 in the setting of encephalopathy and need for
   airway protection. CXR actually improved this AM.  Will attempt to wean
   vent settings to PS and try to extubate today if possible.
   # EtOH Cirrhosis/HepC/HCC
 per recent history, his HCC is rapidly
   progressing and his liver function is rapidly declining.  He has many
   stigmata of liver disease, both on exam and laboratory testing.
   - s/p one dose of vitamin K last night, unlikely to improve coags, but
   will repeat coags today
   - c/s liver team today, ?role of steroids given his current hepatic
   function
   - family meeting to assess goals of care
   # Hx of heavy EtOH abuse - maintain on CIWA scale with ativan per
   protocol
   # PNA - CXR consistent with consolidation at bases, given unclear
   duration of pt's down time prior to transfer to ED will cover for
   possible aspiration PNA.
   - Continue Zosyn (obtain ID approval today)
   - F/u sputum culture .
   # Guaiac + NGT aspirate - pt with history varices and significant
   variceal bleeding, also EtOH abuse. Hct stable overnight and
   hemodynamics not c/w acute bleed.
   - Continue to follow q6-8h Hcts
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider EGD if evidence of active bleeding
   - two type and screens sent
   - 2 PIV
   # Hypotension
 likely secondary to physiology of hepatic failure and
   possibly opioid toxicity.  Improved with volume resuscitation and
   albumin overnight.  Physiology c/w a distributive process given her
   warm extremities and bounding pulses.
   - Continue to hold home BP meds
   - Follow BPs and urine ouput closely, adjust regimen as needed
   #Hyponatremia
 Likely secondary to end-stage liver disease and
   component of pre-renal azotemia. Improving appropriately with NS.
   Continue to follow q6h Na, lytes, and renal function.
   #Hypokalemia
 Replete K+ today with an IV bolus, repeat K+ this
   afternoon.
   # Large Flank Hematoma - given unclear duration prior to discovery of
   pt and extent of hematoma, we checked a CK which was normal.  Area
   outlined, will continue to follow closely. Moving both lower
   extremities equally.
   # FEN - NPO for now, hoping for possible extubation today.
   .
   # Access - 2 PIVs
   .
   # Code
 Full for now. Will attempt to clarify his wishes with his
   family today.
   # Dispo - ICU

- The patient is a 48-year-old male with a medical history of Hepatitis C, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and alcoholic cirrhosis.
- He was admitted with altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection in the setting of suspected opioid overdose.
- The patient's encephalopathy is multifactorial, involving end-stage liver disease, possible anoxic-insult, and opiate or EtOH toxicity.
- He has been improving since yesterday and has not received lactulose since yesterday morning, with adequate bowel movements.
- The patient's respiratory failure required intubation, but he was extubated yesterday and is now on 2LNC with oxygen saturation ranging from 90-100%. No changes in chest X-ray.
- He has multiple stigmata of liver disease, including spider angiomas, ecchymosis, and a palpable mass in the epigastric area consistent with a liver mass.
- The patient has a history of heavy EtOH abuse and is being maintained on CIWA scale with ativan per protocol.
- He has positive guaiac and NGT aspirate, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding, but hemodynamics are stable and not consistent with an acute bleed.
- The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to the physiology of hepatic failure and possibly opioid toxicity. He has been volume resuscitated and given albumin.
- He has hyponatremia likely secondary to end-stage"

   Assessment and Plan
   The pt is a 48y/o M with PMH of Hepatitis C, HCC and alcoholic
   cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status requiring intubation for
   airway protection in the setting of suspected opioid overdose.
   .
   # Encephalopathy - most likely multifactorial involving end stage liver
   disease,?anoxic-insult given unknown down time, and drug toxicity. Head
   CT negative at OSH. Appears to be waking up more today as propofol is
   lightened.  Plan to:
   - hold sedating medications
   - increase lactulose to 60ml po q2h, titrate to stool 4-6x/day (no
   stool yet overnight)
   - given his improved responsiveness on exam, will plan to wean propofol
   #Respiratory failure
 in the setting of encephalopathy and need for
   airway protection. CXR actually improved this AM.  Will attempt to wean
   vent settings to PS and try to extubate today if possible.
   # EtOH Cirrhosis/HepC/HCC
 per recent history, his HCC is rapidly
   progressing and his liver function is rapidly declining.  He has many
   stigmata of liver disease, both on exam and laboratory testing.
   - s/p one dose of vitamin K last night, unlikely to improve coags, but
   will repeat coags today
   - c/s liver team today, ?role of steroids given his current hepatic
   function
   - family meeting to assess goals of care
   # Hx of heavy EtOH abuse - maintain on CIWA scale with ativan per
   protocol
   # PNA - CXR consistent with consolidation at bases, given unclear
   duration of pt's down time prior to transfer to ED will cover for
   possible aspiration PNA.
   - Continue Zosyn (obtain ID approval today)
   - F/u sputum culture .
   # Guaiac + NGT aspirate - pt with history varices and significant
   variceal bleeding, also EtOH abuse. Hct stable overnight and
   hemodynamics not c/w acute bleed.
   - Continue to follow q6-8h Hcts
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider EGD if evidence of active bleeding
   - two type and screens sent
   - 2 PIV
   # Hypotension
 likely secondary to physiology of hepatic failure and
   possibly opioid toxicity.  Improved with volume resuscitation and
   albumin overnight.  Physiology c/w a distributive process given her
   warm extremities and bounding pulses.
   - Continue to hold home BP meds
   - Follow BPs and urine ouput closely, adjust regimen as needed
   #Hyponatremia
 Likely secondary to end-stage liver disease and
   component of pre-renal azotemia. Improving appropriately with NS.
   Continue to follow q6h Na, lytes, and renal function.
   #Hypokalemia
 Replete K+ today with an IV bolus, repeat K+ this
   afternoon.
   # Large Flank Hematoma - given unclear duration prior to discovery of
   pt and extent of hematoma, we checked a CK which was normal.  Area
   outlined, will continue to follow closely. Moving both lower
   extremities equally.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma), alcoholic cirrhosis, and suspected opioid overdose. He was admitted with altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection. The patient's encephalopathy is most likely multifactorial, involving end-stage liver disease, anoxic-insult given unknown downtime, and drug toxicity. The head CT was negative at OSH.

The patient's respiratory failure is in the setting of encephalopathy and the need for airway protection. The chest X-ray improved this morning, and the plan is to attempt to wean vent settings to PS and try to extubate today if possible.

The patient has a history of heavy EtOH abuse and is being maintained on CIWA scale with ativan per protocol. He also has pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration, and is being covered with Zosyn (ID approval today). The patient's guaiac is positive, indicating a possible gastrointestinal bleed, especially considering his history of varices and significant variceal bleeding. However, his Hct is stable overnight, and hemodynamics do not suggest an acute bleed.

The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to the physiology of hepatic failure and possibly opioid toxicity. It improved with volume resuscitation and albumin overnight. The patient's hyponatremia is likely secondary to end-stage liver disease"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a medical history of Hepatitis C, Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), and alcoholic cirrhosis. He was admitted with altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection due to suspected opioid overdose. The patient's encephalopathy is most likely multifactorial, involving end-stage liver disease, possible anoxic insult, opiate or ethanol toxicity, portal vein thrombosis, GI bleed, and hyponatremia. Mentation has been improving since yesterday. The patient has not received lactulose since yesterday morning, but has had adequate bowel movements. He was extubated yesterday and was on 2LNC with no issues. 

The patient has stigmata of liver disease on examination and laboratory testing. There are no changes in coagulation overnight. A Hepatology consult is appreciated, and vitamin K should be given to improve coagulation. A RUQ ultrasound is scheduled today to assess for portal vein thrombosis. A family meeting is planned to assess goals of care.

The patient has a history of heavy ethanol abuse and will be maintained on CIWA scale with ativan per protocol. There is a concern for possible aspiration pneumonia due to unclear duration of the patient's downtime prior to transfer to the emergency department. Sputum culture is pending. The patient has a history of varices and significant variceal bleeding, but hemodynamics are not consistent"

   Assessment and Plan
   The pt is a 48y/o M with PMH of Hepatitis C, HCC and alcoholic
   cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status requiring intubation for
   airway protection in the setting of suspected opioid overdose.
   .
   # Encephalopathy - most likely multifactorial involving end stage liver
   disease,?anoxic-insult given unknown down time, and opiate (Oxycontin)
   or EtOH toxicity, portal vein thrombosis, GI bleed, hyponatremia (126
   upon admission). Head CT negative at OSH. Improving mentation since
   yesterday. Has not received lactulose since yesterday morning, adequate
   BMs.
   - hold sedating medications
   -Will change lactulose 60ml from PO to PR q2h as pt unable to tolerate
   PO; titrate to stool 4-6x/day
   -Will follow hepatology recs
   #Respiratory failure
 intubated for airway protection and then
   extubated yesterday. Sat 90-100 on 2LNC. No changes in CXR.
   -Continue on with 2LNC and attempt weaning.
   # EtOH Cirrhosis/HepC/HCC
 per recent history, his HCC is rapidly
   progressing and his liver function is rapidly declining.  He has many
   stigmata of liver disease, both on exam and laboratory testing.  No
   change in coags O/N
   -Appreciate Hepatology consult
   - RUQ U/S to assess for portal vein thrombosis today
   - family meeting to assess goals of care
   # Hx of heavy EtOH abuse - maintain on CIWA scale with ativan per
   protocol
   -will decrease ativan from 1.0 to 0.5mg PRN per CIWA scale
   # PNA - CXR consistent with consolidation at bases, given unclear
   duration of pt's down time prior to transfer to ED will cover for
   possible aspiration PNA-bilateral. Sputum Cx c/w mixed species
   -          Continue Unasyn
   -          Await speciation of Cx.
   # Guaiac + NGT aspirate - pt with history varices and significant
   variceal bleeding, also EtOH abuse. Hct stable overnight and
   hemodynamics not c/w acute bleed.
   - Continue to follow q12h Hcts
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider EGD if evidence of active bleeding
   - two type and screens sent
   - 2 PIV
   # Hypotension
 likely secondary to physiology of hepatic failure and
   possibly opioid toxicity.  s/p volume resuscitation and albumin.  No
   issues O/N.
   - Continue to hold home BP meds as BP is WNL
   - Follow BPs and urine ouput closely, adjust regimen as needed
   #Hyponatremia
 Likely secondary to end-stage liver disease and
   component of pre-renal azotemia. Improving appropriately with NS, yet
   correction occurred rapidly suggesting free water deficit.
   -Will provide free water at 1L of [**1-5**] NS at 100cc/hr
   #Hypokalemia
 Repleted K+ this am. Continue to follow K+
   # Large Flank Hematoma - given unclear duration prior to discovery of
   pt and extent of hematoma, we checked a CK which was normal.  Area
   outlined, improving. Moving both lower extremities equally.
   # FEN
 NPO for now.
   .
   # Access - 2 PIVs
   .
   # Code
 Full for now. Will attempt to clarify his wishes with his
   family.
   # Dispo

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, overdose, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was successfully extubated and is currently on CPAP/PSV with an FiO2 of 50%. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/53 to 137/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is 92.7 kg.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 5,127 mL and a total output of 2,920 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,207 mL. The patient is receiving medications including pantoprazole, lorazepam, and other ICU medications.

The patient's laboratory results show normal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, there are elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), lactate, lactic acid, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), bilirubin, and cardiac markers (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T). The patient also has low albumin levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure indicates a high risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or worsening hypoxemia.
2. Infection: The elevated levels of white blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cirrhosis, and hepatic encephalopathy. He presented with respiratory failure and was successfully extubated. The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to multi-factorial causes including opiates, possible etoh use, and hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose is being administered per rectum, and Rifaximin will be added once the patient can tolerate oral medication. The patient had bloody nasogastric tube output but this has resolved. There is no indication for endoscopy at present. The patient is also diagnosed with pneumonia, possibly due to Unasyn. Additionally, the patient has hypotonicity, which may be pre-renal in nature due to liver failure. The patient's blood work reveals elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and lactulose. He is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with supplemental oxygen. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/53 to 137/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 5,127 mL and output of 2,920 mL. The patient's weight is currently"
