","The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a chief complaint of acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has a history of aspiration pneumonia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation. The patient received 0.5 mg of Ativan, which led to unresponsiveness with pH 7.26 and continued AF/RVR.

Upon arrival in the ICU, the patient was started on non-invasive ventilation (BIPAP) and responded well with an improved pH of 7.38 and decreased respiratory rate. A chest X-ray revealed fluid overload, and she was placed on a Lasix drip. The patient also received digovern overnight and tolerated it well.

The patient's allergies include sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, haloperidol, and unknown allergies to olanzapine, risperidone, and propranolol.

The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix) at 1 mg/hour, metoprolol, heparin, N-acetylcysteine nebs, atrovent, valproic acid, Lasix gtt at 1 mg/hour, met 10 mg q 6, cefepime, and others.

The patient has a proven aspiration risk and unchanged review of systems since admission except for respiratory distress.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, hypertension, and COPD. The patient was initially placed on non-invasive ventilation but experienced a stoppage of ventilation at 6:00 PM. An EKG was performed at 10:30 PM, and the patient was restarted on non-invasive ventilation at 11:00 PM.

The patient's mental status improved after holding sedatives and being placed on BIPAP overnight. Bipap was discontinued in the morning with a stable mental status. The patient was started on digoxin for atrial fibrillation, and Plavix was discontinued as likely PEG placement is needed, according to PCP [Last Name (NamePattern4)] [Last Name (STitle) 5888].

The patient's NG tube was replaced and tube feeds restarted. The patient experienced flash pulmonary edema with wheezing and desaturation to the mid 80's, along with RVR. The patient was given metoprolol 10mg IV, Lasix 20mg IV, and morphine 0.5mg IV, and placed on Bipap with good effect. An additional 20mg IV Lasix was given in the morning.

The patient has allergies to sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, and haloperidol. The last dose of antibiotics was cefipime at 10:00 PM.

The patient is currently on various infusions including metoprolol, morphine sulfate, and furosemide (Lasix). Other medications include digoxin and Lasix.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure and gross pulmonary edema. The patient's mental status has improved after holding sedatives and being placed on BIPAP. She was started on digoxin for atrial fibrillation. The patient's urine output improved after receiving IV lasix. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is triggered by benzodiazepine and heart failure. There is a positive fluid balance since admission and a chest X-ray showing gross overload.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which was likely exacerbated by an acute infection on admission. The patient responded to IV metoprolol but continues to have episodes of atrial fibrillation.
3. Schizophrenia: The patient has stable schizophrenia and is currently on depakote and perphenazine.
4. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient failed a video swallow test and is currently NPO (nothing by mouth). She will be reevaluated later this week.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Although the patient has no symptoms, her urine analysis showed growth of sensitive Klebsiella, which will be covered by cefepime.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- On admission, she was placed on non-invasive ventilation but stopped due to desaturation. She was then intubated and put on CPAP mode with a face tent.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103-116/84-98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%.
- She is currently on digoxin for atrial fibrillation and metoprolol for rate control.
- The patient's physical examination revealed diffuse expiratory wheezing and ronchi, decreased breath sounds at the bases, and a ventral hernia that is non-tender.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and elevated troponin-T levels.
- The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP mode with a face tent, with a set FiO2 of 50% and SpO2 of 91%.
- The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 53, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 166.

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [Known Lastname 5683], an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, was admitted to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. She had been transferred from another hospital after experiencing aspiration pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure (not ARDS), atrial fibrillation, schizophrenia, and possible urinary tract infection (UTI).

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is being treated for hypercarbic respiratory failure, which was triggered by benzodiazepine use and heart failure due to positive fluid balance since admission. The plan includes continuing cefepime to complete treatment for aspiration pneumonia, using bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) as needed, monitoring arterial blood gas (ABG), avoiding sedating medications, diuresis with lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1 liter, controlling heart rate, and maintaining full code status per discussion with the primary care physician.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation improved with IV metoprolol and digoxin. Lopressor is being continued, and anticoagulation is not currently required as the patient was not on it at baseline. ASA 325 is also continued.

3. Schizophrenia: The patient's schizophrenia is stable, and the current medications (dep"

Ms. [**Known lastname 5683**], an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, was admitted to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. She had been transferred from another hospital after experiencing aspiration pneumonia. The patient's respiratory failure was likely triggered by benzodiazepine use and heart failure, as indicated by a positive fluid balance since admission and a chest X-ray showing gross overload.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 74/45 mmHg to 137/97 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 89% on aerosol-cool with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient is awake, alert, and oriented, but has decreased breath sounds and diffuse expiratory wheezing and ronchi.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal renal function. The patient's troponin-T level is within normal range, while the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) is high. The electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

Plan:
1. Continue cefepime to complete the course for aspiration pneumonia.
2. Use bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) as needed, transitioning to a face mask if tolerated.
3. Monitor arterial blood gas (ABG) levels.
4. Avoid sedating medications.
5. Diurese with lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1 liter.
6. Control heart rate.
7. Patient is full code, per discussion with primary care physician.
8. Perform peritoneal lavage (lytes) and chest tube insertion (PT).
9. Provide nasogastric (NG) suctioning as needed.
10. Send sputum for culture.

Potential Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure.
4. Negative fluid balance leading to hypotension.
5. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility.
6. Stress ulcer due to critical illness.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
8. Potential need for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube due to failed video swallow.
9. Urinary tract infection (UTI) due to indwelling urinary catheter.
10. Anemia due to chronic disease or volume shifts.

Note: The patient's condition is unstable, and careful monitoring and management are required to prevent potential complications."

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 5683] is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension who was admitted to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been experiencing respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, possible aspiration pneumonia, schizophrenia, hypertension, and lower extremity edema. The patient is currently NPO due to a failed video swallow test and is at risk for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute hypercarbic respiratory failure is a significant concern. This condition can lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood, causing acidosis and potential organ damage if not managed properly.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may worsen due to acute infection or other underlying conditions. This irregular heart rhythm can lead to decreased cardiac output, blood clots, and an increased risk of stroke.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's inability to swallow properly increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. This condition occurs when food, liquids, or saliva are inhaled into the lungs instead of being swallowed. Aspiration pneumonia can cause infection, inflammation, and respiratory distress.
4. Schizophrenia: While the patient's schizophrenia appears to be stable at the moment, it is essential to continue her medication regimen to manage her symptoms and prevent any exacerbations.
5. Hypert"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 5683], an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, was admitted to the ICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. She had been on cefepime for aspiration pneumonia and was weaned off BiPAP. A small left pleural effusion was detected but not tapped. Her blood pressure improved, and she was sitting well. She has allergies to sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, and haloperidol. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was cefepime at 10:00 PM. She is currently on various medications including Lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory issues. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/50 mmHg to 140/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a positive fluid balance. The patient is receiving oxygen delivery through an aerosol-cool device and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a pressure support of 14 cmH2O, respiratory rate of 12, peak end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates a pH of 7.48, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 61 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 108 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 5 L/min. The patient's physical examination reveals irregularly irregular heart rhythm, no appreciable murmur, jugular venous distention (JVD), decreased breath sounds in the upper third of the lungs, and a ventral hernia. Neurologic examination is not assessed. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 31.5%, platelet count (Plt) of 272, creatinine (Cr) of 0.6 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.06, and glucose levels ranging from 94 to 114 mg/dL. The chest X-ray indicates bilateral pleural effusions. The patient has a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and previous aspiration pneumonia. She is currently diagnosed with respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and positive fluid balance. The plan includes continuing gentle diuresis, controlling heart rate, and monitoring ABG. The patient is also being monitored for potential complications such as UTI, anemia, and lower extremity edema. She is expected to remain in the ICU until her respiratory status improves."

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. She also has a positive fluid balance since admission and a chest X-ray showing gross overload. The patient's current medications include cefepime, lopressor, digoxin, ASA 325, depakote, and perphenazine. She is currently NPO due to a failed video swallow test and has a nasogastric tube placed. Her code status is full code. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis if not managed properly.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration risk is high due to her failed video swallow test and being NPO. This increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
3. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of clot formation and potentially lead to stroke if not managed with anticoagulation.
4. Lower Extremity Edema: The patient has lower extremity edema, which may be related to heart failure or medication-induced fluid retention.
5. Schizophrenia: The patient has a history of schizophrenia, and her medication regimen includes depakote"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note, but there are several significant events mentioned.

The patient experienced hypoxia in the morning and was placed on Bipap, which was later weaned off as the patient was sitting well. An ultrasound showed a small left pleural effusion, but it was not tapped. The patient's blood pressure improved, and their beta-blocker dose was decreased.

The patient has allergies to sulfonamides and unknown allergies to olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, and haloperidol. The last dose of antibiotics administered was cefipime at 10:00 PM.

The patient is receiving multiple infusions, including lansoprazole (Prevacid) at 8:00 AM and heparin sodium (prophylaxis) at 10:00 PM. They are also on other medications.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 97 bpm with a range of 82-115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/50 mmHg to 140/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Last Name 5683] is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was transferred to the MICU from another hospital with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been on BiPAP support intermittently and is currently off it. She has a small left pleural effusion, but no tapping was done. Her blood pressure improved, and her oxygen saturation is at 97%. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and possible aspiration pneumonia. She also has an anemia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and lower extremity edema. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is hypercarbic in nature and is likely due to aspiration pneumonia and heart failure. Monitoring ABG, controlling heart rate, and diuresis with Lasix are part of the management plan to prevent further complications.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which has been exacerbated by acute infection. Management includes controlling heart rate with IV metoprolol and adding digoxin. Anticoagulation is also being considered due to the increased risk of stroke.

3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has been NPO since she failed the video swallow test. She may need a percutaneous end"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure (improving), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (improved), and schizophrenia (stable). The patient has been NPO (nothing by mouth) due to a failed video swallow test, and further evaluation is planned.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions such as BIPAP or mechanical ventilation may be necessary if there is a deterioration in oxygenation or ventilation.
2. Recurrence of atrial fibrillation: Although the patient's heart rate is currently controlled, regular monitoring of heart rhythm and appropriate management of atrial fibrillation should be continued to prevent complications such as thromboembolism.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's inability to protect her airway, there is a risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate measures to prevent aspiration, such as maintaining proper head positioning and suctioning, should be implemented.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs. The use of compression stockings and early mobilization can help reduce this risk.

Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/46-133/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool delivery device.

The patient's physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, jugular venous distention (JVD), a ventral hernia that is non-tender, no edema, and no skin assessment performed. Neurologic examination was not assessed due to patient's alertness and orientation.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, and electrolytes including sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and magnesium are also within normal limits. Kidney function is slightly impaired with a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. Cardiac markers such as troponin-T are within normal limits.

The patient's respiratory failure is improving, and she has been weaned off supplemental oxygen. Gentle diuresis is being continued due to contraction alkalosis, aiming for an even fluid balance. Chest physiotherapy"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and previous aspiration pneumonia. She was admitted to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has shown improvement in her respiratory status, but continues to require a facemask and supplemental oxygen. She has a positive fluid balance since admission and chest X-ray indicates fluid overload. The patient's atrial fibrillation is now controlled with IV lopressor and digoxin. She is not on anticoagulation at baseline. The patient's schizophrenia is stable, and she is currently NPO due to failed video swallow. Her code status is full code. The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for a urinary tract infection and her anemia is stable. She also has hypertension and lower extremity edema, for which she is receiving medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute hypercarbic respiratory failure is improving, but she still requires a facemask and supplemental oxygen. Continuous monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary. Potential complications include worsening respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and barotrauma.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is currently controlled with IV lopressor and digoxin. Close monitoring of her heart rate and rhythm is essential to prevent complications such as stroke or"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who is mildly somulent. They have a history of atrial fibrillation and are currently on digoxin and metoprolol. The patient also has a past medical history of schizophrenia and is being treated with valproic acid and perphenazine. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, likely triggered by sedating medications. They have bilateral effusions and an opacity on the left lower lobe of their chest. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/46 to 133/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 68, HCO3- of 71, PO2 of 41, and SaO2 of 20%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may worsen if they do not respond to treatment or if their underlying condition progresses.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an elevated PaCO2 level, indicating hypercarbic respiratory failure. This can lead to metabolic acidosis, which is already suspected in this case. Prompt management is crucial to prevent further complications.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: Due to the patient's increased somulence and aspiration"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and unknown allergies. The patient received Lasix and started on acetazolamide for diuresis due to alkalosis. He also had hypoxia and tachycardia, but improved with ABG and ECG changes. The patient spoke with his primary care physician about long-term nutrition goals and felt that a feeding tube (J-tube) was reasonable. His Lopressor dose was increased due to atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. A bedside ultrasound showed a left pleural effusion that may be loculated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed. Adequate oxygenation and ventilation need to be maintained.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which can lead to poor cardiac output and an increased risk of stroke. Rate control and anticoagulation therapy may be required.
3. Pleural Effusion: The presence of a left pleural effusion could compromise lung function and increase the risk of infection. Further evaluation and management, such as thoracentesis or chest tube placement, may be necessary.
4. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating ongoing fluid losses. Close monitoring and careful fluid management are crucial"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and previous aspiration pneumonia. She was admitted to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely triggered by benzodiazepine use and heart failure. The patient has shown improvement in her respiratory status, but still requires supplemental oxygen and facemask support.

The patient also has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which has responded well to IV lopressor and digoxin. Her schizophrenia is being managed with depakote and perphenazine.

The patient failed a video swallow test and is currently NPO (nothing by mouth). She will undergo a repeat evaluation today, and if she fails again, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) may be necessary. The patient completed an antibiotic course for a urinary tract infection and her anemia is currently stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has since improved but still requires support. The risk of respiratory failure could arise if the patient's respiratory status worsens or if she develops any complications related to her underlying conditions.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which is currently being managed with IV lopressor and digoxin. However, there is a potential for recurrence"

","The patient in the ICU is a 68-inch tall individual with an unknown weight. The chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 95 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 112/58 mmHg to 134/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device.

The patient has been held on Lasix and started on Acetazolamide for diuresis due to alkalosis. They experienced hypoxia and tachycardia but showed improvement with an improved ABG and ECG without strain. The patient also spoke with their primary care physician about long-term nutrition goals and felt that a jejunostomy tube was reasonable.

The patient has a left pleural effusion as seen on ultrasound. They have a history of allergies to sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, haloperidol, and unknown allergies to antibiotics cefipime.

The patient received cefipime at 10:00 PM, lansoprazole at 8:00 AM, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis at 8:26 PM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flow sheet data shows that the patient received a"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known Last Name 5683**] is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and previous aspiration pneumonia. She was transferred to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been on a 12-day course of cefepime and has remained afebrile. Her current condition includes respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, schizophrenia, potential need for a feeding tube, and a left pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is improving but may still require support with supplemental oxygen. There is a risk of recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure if sedating medications are used or if there is fluid overload.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure. Rate control measures are in place with the use of Lopressor.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a worsening left pleural effusion, which could potentially lead to respiratory compromise if it continues to accumulate. Thoracentesis may be necessary to remove excess fluid.
4. Schizophrenia: The patient's schizophrenia is stable on her current medication regimen. However, any changes in medication or stress could potentially exacerbate her psychiatric symptoms.
5. Aspiration Risk: Due to the patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and"

   fibrillation, HTN s/p aspiration [**Hospital 967**] transferred to MICU with acute
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure- Improving.  triggered by
   benzodiazepine and heart failure given positive fluid balance since
   admission and CXR showing fluid overload.
   - completed 12 day course cefepime on [**5-4**] and has remained afebrile
   - continue facemask, wean supplemental O2 as tolerated
   - gentle diuresis given contraction alkalosis, even to 500cc neg daily
   - goal I/O: even today
   - continue chest PT and NG suctioning prn
   - no sedating medications
   - control heart rate
   - patient full code per discussion with PCP [**2191-4-26**]
   #Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation -  Improved, HR now 90
s. Often
   exacerbated by mucous plugging.
   -cont IV lopressor, digoxin, ASA 325
   -not on anticoagulation at baseline
   #Schizophrenia - stable
   -continue depakote and perphenazine
   # [**Name (NI) 5860**] pt failed video swallow and is currently NPO. Pt will be
   reevaluated later this week. In the ICU question was raised whether
   aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal neurological signs. Likely
   [**2-14**] weakness and infection, and expect to improve.
   - failed video swallow X 1, apprec speech and swallow repeat eval today
   - strict NPO
   - if fails repeat S&S then may need PEG long term --> discuss with PCP
   # UTI- completed abx course

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition shows improvement in respiratory failure and atrial fibrillation. She is still experiencing lower extremity edema and has a left pleural effusion. The patient has been on various medications including Lasix, acetazolamide, Lopressor, digoxin, ASA, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has since improved. However, there is still a need for continued facemask oxygen supplementation and monitoring.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. It is crucial to control the heart rate and maintain rhythm stability.
3. Pleural Effusion: The presence of a left pleural effusion may require further evaluation and intervention to address fluid accumulation.
4. Lower Extremity Edema: The patient's lower extremity edema could indicate fluid overload or heart failure. Monitoring and management of fluid balance are essential.
5. Schizophrenia: The patient's schizophrenia is stable with ongoing treatment, but close monitoring for any psychiatric symptoms is necessary.
6. Aspiration Risk: Given the patient's failure of video swallow and ongoing risk of aspiration, alternative feeding"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of schizophrenia and has been on multiple medications, including olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, haloperidol, and cefipime for presumed aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8 C (98.2 F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/47 mmHg to 133/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AF).

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), normal platelet count (Plt), and creatinine (Cr) within normal range. Troponin-T levels are normal, while C-reactive protein (CRP) is elevated.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, symmetric chest expansion, rhonchorous breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and attentive mental status.

Assessment and plan include:
- Respiratory issues: hypercarbic respiratory failure due to acute on chronic decompensation likely triggered by sedating medications.
- Atrial fibrillation (AF): digoxin and propranolol prescribed, not on anticoagulation at baseline, continue ASA"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5683**] is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has a positive fluid balance since admission, indicating possible heart failure. The chest X-ray shows fluid overload and effusion, which is transudative but did not improve much after thoracentesis. The patient is currently on a ventilator, receiving supplemental oxygen, and has impaired airway clearance and arousal, attention, and cognition due to sedation. She also has impaired muscle performance and acute respiratory failure. The patient's pneumonia is severe, and there is suspicion of aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's impaired airway clearance and acute respiratory failure increase the risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.
2. Cardiac Complications: The positive fluid balance suggests possible heart failure, and the presence of effusion on the chest X-ray may indicate cardiac dysfunction.
3. Infection: The patient has severe pneumonia, and there is a possibility of developing other infections, especially since she is immobile and on a ventilator.
4. Neurological Complications: The impaired arousal, attention, and cognition may be due to sedation or underlying neurological issues. There is a risk of further neurological decline if the cause is not addressed.
5. Aspiration: Given"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5683**], an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, was transferred to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia due to aspiration, impaired airway clearance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and atrial fibrillation. The patient's current condition is improving, but she remains on a facemask with supplemental oxygen as tolerated. Gentle diuresis is being performed due to contraction alkalosis, and a thoracentesis is planned given the worsening effusion on CXR. The patient is NPO and will be reevaluated later this week. She has completed a 12-day course of cefepime and remains afebrile. Other ongoing treatments include chest physical therapy, NG suctioning prn, and medications for her schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia due to aspiration, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential sepsis if not adequately managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can progress to chronic respiratory failure if not effectively treated. This can result in respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5683**] is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was transferred to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes pneumonia, impaired nutrition, impaired airway clearance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient remains hypoxic and has severe pneumonia. There is a concern for heart failure due to a positive fluid balance since admission and CXR showing fluid overload as well as effusion. A transudative effusion is present, but little improvement has been seen post-thoracentesis.
2. Trapped lung: A CT chest will be obtained today to evaluate for trapped lung.
3. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rate is currently stable, but often exacerbated by mucous plugging.
4. Schizophrenia: The patient's schizophrenia is stable and being managed with depakote and perphenazine.
5. Aspiration: The patient failed a video swallow and is currently NPO. There is a possibility of placing a J-tube per discussion with the primary care physician.
6. UTI: The patient has completed an antibiotic course for a urinary tract infection and will have"

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was initially admitted with left lower lobe (LLL) aspiration and is now experiencing a large transudative left pleural effusion and concern for trapped lung. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/43 mmHg to 124/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient is being monitored for various parameters such as fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support.

The patient underwent thoracentesis, which revealed negative transudative fluid. She was also placed on bipap for a short period last night. The patient has allergies to sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, and haloperidol. Her last dose of antibiotics was on [**2191-5-6**] at 05:05 PM.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was initially admitted for left lower lobe aspiration and now presents with a large transudative left pleural effusion and concern for trapped lung. The patient's current condition includes aspiration pneumonia, pleural effusion, hypercarbia, atrial fibrillation, obesity, and metabolic alkalosis. She is currently on various medications including antibiotics, diuretics, antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, and antacids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Trapped lung: The presence of a large transudative left pleural effusion may lead to respiratory complications such as a trapped lung, which can impair lung function and oxygenation.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of LLL aspiration increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. This can cause further respiratory distress and potential sepsis if not treated promptly.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's ongoing atrial fibrillation can lead to an irregular heartbeat and potentially result in poor blood circulation, increasing the risk of clot formation and stroke.
4. Hypercarbia: Elevated levels of carbon dioxide (hypercarbia) may occur due to inadequate ventilation or respiratory muscle weakness. This can cause respiratory acidosis and lead to symptoms like confusion, dizziness, and fatigue.
5. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis requires careful monitoring and management to prevent"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They have undergone a thoracentesis procedure, which revealed negative transudative fluid. The patient was placed on bipap for a short period last night and had 1.2 liters of serous, straw-colored fluid drained from their chest, which was sent for cultures.

The patient has allergies to sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, and haloperidol. They are currently receiving various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, atrovent q6, valproic acid, perphenazine, MVI, lansoprazole, colace, digoxin 0.125, ASA, and metoprolol 25 three times a day.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flow sheet data shows vital signs such as temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, along with hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support.

The patient is on high-flow neb with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with specific settings for tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP). The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of carbon dioxide ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from her current condition.

1. Pneumonia: The patient is diagnosed with pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. This can be a serious complication as it may lead to sepsis and respiratory failure.

2. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect her airway due to impaired arousal, attention, and cognition increases the risk of further aspiration events.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is indicated by hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. It is important to control the heart rate and prevent clot formation due to the increased risk of stroke associated with atrial fibrillation.

5. Impaired Muscle Performance: The patient has impaired muscle performance, particularly with right eye ptosis. This could be a result of the respiratory failure or an underlying neurological condition.

6. Impaired Airway Clearance: The patient has impaired airway clearance, evidenced by decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally and bronchial breath sounds at the left base. This increases the risk of recurrent pneumonia and"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known lastname 5683] is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was transferred to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia due to aspiration, impaired airway clearance, altered nutrition, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be caused by sepsis, pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiac ischemia, or valproate overdose. Further evaluation is needed, including blood cultures, checking valproate levels, ruling out abdominal pathology, and considering Vanc/Zosyn if persistent hypotension.

2. Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient still experiences hypoxia despite improvement on BiPAP. Severe pneumonia and potential heart failure due to fluid overload are suspected. Close monitoring of vital signs, ABG analysis, and weaning of BiPAP as tolerated is necessary. Chest PT and NG suctioning should be continued, and sedating medications should be avoided.

3. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rate should be controlled, and metoprolol should be increased to 25 TID. Digoxin level should be checked, and ASA 325 should be continued.

4. Schizophrenia: The patient's medication for schizophrenia should be continued.

5. Aspiration: The patient failed the video swallow test, and further evaluation is required. The decision regarding whether to place a feeding tube will be made later this week.

6. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient completed an antibiotic course for UTI. Repeat urinalysis should be done today due to the altered mental status.

7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to volume shifts. It is currently stable.

8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension should be managed with lopressor.

9. Lower extremity edema: The patient's edema may be caused by fluid overload. Holding the home dose of spironolactone is recommended.

10. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: The patient should receive subcutaneous heparin.

11. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient should receive a proton pump inhibitor.

12. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis: The patient should receive appropriate measures for VAP prevention.

13. Code status: The patient is currently set to full code.

14. Disposition: The patient will remain in the ICU for further management."

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has severe pneumonia, which may be aspiration-related. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation but is now on non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP). The CT scan revealed a large plug in the left mainstem with left lower lobe collapse, but bronchoscopy did not show obvious plugging. The patient's respiratory status has improved with BiPAP.

2. Alteration in nutrition: The patient has impaired airway clearance and impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, which may contribute to malnutrition. She is currently receiving Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 47 mL/hour.

3. Muscle performance: The patient has impaired muscle performance, with strength rated at 3/5. This could be due to prolonged immobilization and sedation.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure, specifically hypercarbic respiratory failure. She responded well to non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP) and is no longer in respiratory failure.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which is often exacerbated by mucous plugging. Her heart rate is now controlled with metoprolol 25 T"

   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Hypotension
 Unclear etiology, responsive to IV fluids and
   re-positioning. Did not receive any new medications and was not
   diuresed yesterday to trigger this. Also not febrile.
   # Hypercarbic/ Hypoxic respiratory failure-  Pt still hypoxic.  Severe
   PNA. ? heart failure given positive fluid balance since admission and
   CXR showing fluid overload as well as effusion. Transudative effusion,
   but little improvement post- throacentesis. CT revealed large plug in
   left mainstem with LLL collapse, but bronchoscopy did not reveal
   obvious plugging. Now improved on BiPAP.
   - cont BiPAP, monitor VBG and MS, wean as tolerated
   - completed 12 day course cefepime on [**5-4**] and has remained afebrile
   - keep even for I/O
   - continue chest PT and NG suctioning prn
   - no sedating medications
   - control heart rate, inc BB to metoprolol 25 TID
   - patient full code per discussion with PCP [**2191-4-26**]
   #Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation -  Improved, HR now 90
s. Often
   exacerbated by mucous plugging.
   -inc lopressor to 25 TID
   - cont  digoxin, ASA 325
   -not on anticoagulation at baseline
   #Schizophrenia - stable
   -continue depakote and perphenazine
   # [**Name (NI) 5860**] pt failed video swallow and is currently NPO. Pt will be
   reevaluated later this week. In the ICU question was raised whether
   aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal neurological signs. Likely
   [**2-14**] weakness and infection, and expect to improve.
   - failed video swallow X 1
   - strict NPO
   - may need to place J- tube per discussion with guardian
   # UTI- completed abx course
   - check repeat U/A today given mental status not at baseline
   # Anemia- currently stable, may have been volume shifts. stable
   # Hypertension - lopressor
   # Lower extremity edema - hold home dose spironolactone for now given

   Patient is critically ill. Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Addendum: patient had bloody NG aspirate. Appreciate ENT evaluation.
   Clot was found in the right nare and suctioned out. Will keep NG and
   start Afrin 2 sprays [**Hospital1 **].
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient received a 250cc bolus for low blood pressure in the afternoon and was found hypotensive with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40-50 in the morning. The patient required a 500cc bolus, non-invasive ventilation, bronchoscopy, and invasive ventilation. The patient's allergies include sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, haloperidol, and unknown medications. The last dose of antibiotics was infusions with atrovent q6, valproic acid 500 mg tid, perphenazine 6mg q day, MVI, lansoprazole, colace, dig.125 q day, asa, metoprolol 25 three times a day, and free water 150 q4hr.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 88 bpm (81-109), blood pressure ranging from 124/40 (61) mmHg to 87/30 (50) mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute (18-29), oxygen saturation of 94%, and atrial fibrillation (AF) heart rhythm. The patient's height is 68 inches, and the total intake includes 1488 mL of total in, 661 mL of PO, 698 mL of TF, and 490 mL of IVF. The total output includes 1660 mL of total out, 245 mL of urine, and 416 mL of NG. The balance shows a negative fluid balance of 172 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with a bipap mask, ventilator mode set to CPAP/PSV, set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 18 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O, and spontaneous breathing rate (RR) set at 16 breaths per minute. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.25, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 45 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 36 mmHg, base excess (BE) of -2 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) of 139 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 102 mEq/L, magnesium (Mg++) of 2.3 mg/dL, phosphate (PO43-) of 2.8 mg/dL, glucose (Glucose) of 114 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 27 mg/dL.

Physical examination reveals a normocephalic head, flat jugular venous pulse (JVP), decreased left base, bronchial left lower lobe (LL) mild, bronchial right base, and decreased abdominal examination. The patient's skin is warm, and neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and moves all four extremities. The patient's peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC) line is clean, dry, and intact.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.9 x 10^3/mm^3, hemoglobin (Hct) of 27.5%, platelet count (Plt) of 96 x 10^3/mm^3, creatinine (Cr) of 0.6 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 50 mmHg, lactic acid of 1"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 86-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has a history of schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. The patient initially presented with left lower lobe aspiration and was found to have a large transudative left pleural effusion, which is concerning for a trapped lung. He also experienced hypotension, aspiration, effusion, hypercarbia, atrial fibrillation, somnolence, metabolic alkalosis, and schizophrenia.

24-hour events include receiving a 250cc bolus for low blood pressure, hypotension with a mean arterial pressure in the 40-50 range, decreased mentation, and receiving a 500cc bolus. The patient underwent non-invasive ventilation, bronchoscopy, and invasive ventilation. Allergies are listed for sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, haloperidol, and an unknown allergy. Medications include atrovent, valproic acid, perphenazine, MVI, lansoprazole, colace, digoxin, asa, metoprolol, and free water.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/40 to 87/30 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation"

   - shift to Lt - with element collapse/plugging
   -re: US drainage of effusion is transudative; do not suspect CHF. There
   is concern for trapped lung.
   -suctioning and chest PT
   -Will CT scan chest today and consider bronchoscopy.
   Hypercarbia
   -Acute on chronic, decompensation likely triggered by sedating meds
   -cefipime for presumed asp PNA completed

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. He was initially admitted for left lower lobe aspiration, and now presents with a large transudative left pleural effusion and concern for trapped lung. The patient's condition has been unstable with hypotension, aspiration, pleural effusion, hypercarbia, atrial fibrillation, somnolence, metabolic alkalosis, and schizophrenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has experienced low blood pressure, which may be due to various factors such as medication side effects (e.g., perphenazine), infection, or sepsis.
2. Aspiration: The patient has a history of left lower lobe aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia and further respiratory complications.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has developed a large transudative left pleural effusion, which can compromise lung function and increase the risk of infection.
4. Trapped Lung: The pleural effusion may result in a trapped lung, impairing effective gas exchange and ventilation.
5. Hypercarbia: The patient has elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood, indicating inadequate ventilation and respiratory support.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a pre-existing condition of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to irregular heart rhythm and potentially worsen cardiac output.

   Patient is critically ill. Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Addendum: patient had bloody NG aspirate. Appreciate ENT evaluation.
   Clot was found in the right nare and suctioned out. Will keep NG and
   start Afrin 2 sprays [**Hospital1 **].
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, aspiration, large transudative left pleural effusion, concern for trapped lung, hypercarbia, atrial fibrillation, somnolence, metabolic alkalosis, and schizophrenia. 

Key interventions and assessments include:
- Hypotension: The patient is receiving a bolus of normal saline (NS) and will start Vancomycin/Cefepime antibiotics. A low dose of norepinephrine (Neo) may be considered if there is no improvement with the bolus.
- Aspiration: Tube feeds have been initiated through the nasogastric (NG) tube, and percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) may be considered. Repeat swallow examination has been deferred.
- Effusion: The left lung is near-white out, and an ultrasound-guided drainage of the effusion has been performed. The effusion is transudative, and there is concern for a trapped lung. Suctioning and chest physical therapy will be implemented, and a CT scan of the chest will be done today. Bronchoscopy may also be considered.
- Hypercarbia: The patient has acute-on-chronic hypercarbia, which was likely triggered by sedating medications. Diuretics will be held at this time"

The patient was initially admitted for left lower lobe (LLL) aspiration and now presents with a large transudative left pleural effusion and concern for trapped lung. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/40 mmHg to 61/30 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on non-invasive ventilation using a bipap mask and has a history of atrial fibrillation. 

The physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the left base, bronchial markings in the left lower lobe, mild bronchial markings in the right base, and decreased tactile fremitus. The patient is also noted to have a PICC line in place, with no evidence of infection. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal limits, hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, platelet count of 227 K/uL, blood glucose levels ranging from 97 mg/dL to 114 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia (sodium level of 117 mEq/L) and hyperkalemia (potassium level of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is hypotension, which was initially present in the morning and responded to intravenous fluid (IVF) bolus. The patient underwent pan-culture to rule out infectious etiology, and valproate and digoxin levels, as well as liver function tests (LFTs), were within normal limits.

The patient developed hemoptysis in the afternoon, and a chest X-ray revealed new fluffy infiltrates on the left side. It is concerning for blood, and the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) consulted suggested that it was likely trauma from the nasogastric tube (NGT). The patient was started on Afrin with a good response, and the plan is to remove the NGT if the hemoptysis recurs.

The patient has allergies to sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, haloperidol, and unknown allergens. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2191-5-8**] at 10:00 PM. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) since [**2191-5-8**] at 10:00 PM. Other medications include ICU medications and other prescribed medications.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged"

   # Hypotension
 Unclear etiology, responsive to IV fluids and
   re-positioning. Did not receive any new medications and was not
   diuresed yesterday to trigger this. Also not febrile. Ddx includes
   sepsis, PE, cardiac ischemia
   - pan culture (urine, blood, sputum, stool)
   - if persistently hypotensive, would start Vanc/Zosyn and change out
   lines
   - will check valproate level as this can also cause hypotension
   - check LFTs to rule out abd pathology
   # Hypercarbic/ Hypoxic respiratory failure-  Pt still hypoxic.  Severe
   PNA. ? heart failure given positive fluid balance since admission and
   CXR showing fluid overload as well as effusion. Transudative effusion,
   but little improvement post- throacentesis. CT revealed large plug in
   left mainstem with LLL collapse, but bronchoscopy did not reveal
   obvious plugging. Now improved on BiPAP.
   - cont BiPAP, monitor VBG and MS, wean as tolerated
   - completed 12 day course cefepime on [**5-4**] and has remained afebrile
   - check ABG
   - keep even for I/O
   - continue chest PT and NG suctioning prn
   - no sedating medications
   - control heart rate, inc BB to metoprolol 25 TID
   - patient full code per discussion with PCP [**2191-4-26**]
   #Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation -  Improved, HR now 90
s. Often
   exacerbated by mucous plugging.
   - when BP lopressor to 25 TID
   - check digoxin level, continue ASA 325
   -not on anticoagulation at baseline
   #Schizophrenia - stable
   -continue depakote and perphenazine
   # [**Name (NI) 5860**] pt failed video swallow and is currently NPO. Pt will be

   aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal neurological signs. Likely
   [**2-14**] weakness and infection, and expect to improve.
   - failed video swallow X 1
   - strict NPO
   - need to place J- tube per discussion with guardian
   # UTI- completed abx course

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 5683] is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

24-hour events include hypotension in the morning, which responded to intravenous fluids. A pan-culture was done to rule out an infectious etiology. Valproate and digoxin levels are within normal range, and liver function tests (LFTs) are also normal. The patient developed hemoptysis in the afternoon, with new fluffy infiltrates on the left side seen on a chest X-ray. Blood cultures were obtained, and the patient is on prophylactic heparin. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. She has impaired airway clearance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, as well as impaired muscle performance. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 72/38 mmHg to 96/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. An arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, and PaO2 of 70 mmHg. 

The patient's physical examination reveals bronchial breath sounds on the right side, more than on the left side. The patient is alert but less awake, responsive to stimuli, and has a ventral hernia. Neurologically, the patient moves all extremities independently but has strength of 3/5 and right eye ptosis. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 8.7-8.8 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) of 25.1-25.3%, platelet (Plt) count of 183-231 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr) of 0.4-0.5 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 38-45 mmHg, blood glucose of 91-101 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal range. 

The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension of unclear etiology, severe pneumonia, alteration in nutrition, impaired balance, impaired airway clearance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis, pulmonary embolism, cardiac ischemia, aspiration pneumonia, heart failure, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)."

   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Hypotension
 Unclear etiology, responsive to IV fluids and
   re-positioning. Did not receive any new medications and was not
   diuresed yesterday to trigger this. Also not febrile. Ddx includes
   sepsis, PE, cardiac ischemia. [**Month (only) 8**] be related to receiving sedating meds
   - change timing of perphenazine
   - pan culture (urine, blood, sputum, stool)
   - if persistently hypotensive, would start Vanc/Zosyn and change out
   lines
   - check LFTs to rule out abd pathology
   # Hypercarbic/ Hypoxic respiratory failure-  Pt still hypoxic.  Today
   on CXR, white out of left lung which is most likely due to
   atelectasis.  Pneumonia course has been c/b transudative effusion, but
   little improvement post- throacentesis. CT revealed large plug in left
   mainstem with LLL collapse, but bronchoscopy did not reveal obvious
   plugging. Completed 12 day course cefepime on [**5-4**] and has remained
   afebrile
   - cont BiPAP, monitor VBG and MS, wean as tolerated
   - aggressive CT and deep suctioning
   - repeat U/S today and tap any effusions
   - keep even to negative for I/O if BP can tolerate
   - control heart rate, inc BB to metoprolol 25 TID
   - patient full code per discussion with PCP [**2191-5-7**]
   - check BNP
   #Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation -  Improved, HR now 90
s. Often
   exacerbated by mucous plugging.
   - when BP lopressor to 25 TID
   - check digoxin level, continue ASA 325
   -not on anticoagulation at baseline
   #Schizophrenia - stable
   -continue depakote and perphenazine
   # [**Name (NI) 5860**] pt failed video swallow and is currently NPO. Pt will be
   reevaluated later this week. In the ICU question was raised whether
   aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal neurological signs. Likely
   [**2-14**] weakness and infection, and expect to improve.
   - failed video swallow X 1
   - strict NPO
   - J- tube per discussion with guardian ongoing, she will talk to PCP
   and requesting legal input
   # UTI- completed abx course
   - check repeat U/A today given mental status not at baseline
   # Anemia- currently stable, may have been volume shifts. stable
   # Hypertension - lopressor

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive, but responded to IV fluids and repositioning. The etiology of hypotension is unclear, but possible causes include sepsis, pulmonary embolism, or cardiac ischemia. Further investigation is needed, including a pan culture, checking liver function tests, and considering the possibility of abdominal pathology.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. There has been little improvement post-thoracentesis, and a large plug in the left mainstem with LLL collapse was found on CT scan. However, bronchoscopy did not reveal obvious plugging. The patient completed a 12-day course of cefepime and has remained afebrile. Management includes continuing BiPAP, monitoring vital signs and arterial blood gases, and aggressive chest physiotherapy.

3. Hypercarbic/Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient remains hypoxic despite being on BiPAP. The whiteout of the left lung on CXR is most likely due to atelectasis. Repeat U/S and tapping any effusions are recommended. Additionally, it is important to control heart rate and consider adjusting"

   Attending Note:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   86 F schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, HTN initial admission with
   aspiration pneumonia (probably mostly LLL), now with transudative left
   pleural effusion and concern for trapped lung, and hypoxic acute
   respiratory failure.
   Overnight events include hypotension that was fluid-responsive. Bloody
   aspirate from right nare seems to have stopped. Pt pulled out NG and
   new tube inserted down left nare.
   Exam is unchanged. BP 95/45, sat 92% on 80% HF mask. CXR today shows
   increased LUL opacification similar to pre-thoracentesis film from last
   week. There was bleeding from right nare yesterday but I doubt new
   opacity is related to aspirated blood. Bronch on 2 days ago did not
   show mucus or other lesions obstructing airway. She is 3 liters
   positive and there is therefore concern for recurrent pleural effusion
   with LUL atelectasis. Plan is to continue with chest PT, reevaluate for
   thoracentesis, and possibly insert pigtail for continued drainage of
   effusion.
   Other issues that need to be addressed include NG tube feeding. She
   would benefit from a PEG for longterm nutrition as she is at high risk
   of aspiration. The patient
s legal guardian would like to have more
   information about this before deciding. A meeting with the patient
   PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 5888**], is being planned.  Goals of care will also need to be
   discussed at this meeting.
   In terms of mental status, she is somnolent but easily arousable. We
   will avoid sedating medications, delay dose of perphenazine (may be
   causing hypotension), and consider asking for psychiatry
s input.
   Rest of plan as detailed in Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5967**]
s note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension who was initially admitted for left lower lobe (LLL) aspiration pneumonia. The patient now presents with a large transudative left pleural effusion and concern for trapped lung. Other medical issues include hypotension, nose bleed, aspiration, hypercarbia, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), somnolence, metabolic alkalosis, and schizophrenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent pleural effusion: The patient's recent increase in left upper lobe (LUL) opacification suggests a concern for recurrent pleural effusion with LUL atelectasis. Continuous drainage of the effusion may be necessary to prevent its recurrence.

2. Trapped lung: The large transudative left pleural effusion can lead to trapping of the lung, reducing its functional capacity. This can result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of LLL aspiration pneumonia indicates a risk of recurrent aspiration events. If these events lead to further respiratory infections, it can complicate the patient's clinical course.

4. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which may be related to medications such as perphenazine or other underlying causes. Close monitoring and adjustment of treatment are necessary to maintain stable blood pressure.

5. AFIB: The patient's existing atr"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, and haloperidol. The patient was on prophylactic heparin sodium infusion since 10:00 PM on [**2191-5-8**]. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for impaired airway clearance and impaired arousal, attention, and cognition. Vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 87 bpm, hypotension with a blood pressure of 95/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on high flow neb, and temperature within normal range. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals atrial fibrillation with a heart rhythm of AF. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,104 mL, including 1,110 mL of TF, 740 mL of IVF, and 605 mL of blood products. Total output is 1,000 mL of urine and 305 mL of blood products. Respiratory support is provided through a high flow neb with SpO2 of 98%. ABG results are pending. Physical examination findings are not assessed due to patient's impaired arousal, attention, and cognition. Labs show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 231 K"

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was initially admitted for left lower lobe aspiration and now presents with a large transudative left pleural effusion, concern for trapped lung, hypotension, nose bleed, and hypercarbia. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 95/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high flow nasal cannula. 

Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the left base, bronchial markings in the left lower lobe, and mild bronchial markings on the right base. The patient's neurologic examination is normal, with attentiveness, ability to follow simple commands, and response to verbal stimuli. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.7-9.3 K/uL, hematocrit of 27.5-28.7%, platelet count of 271-296 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose of 91-107 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances. 

The patient's medical complications include aspiration pneumonia, large transudative left pleural effusion, hypotension, nose bleed, and hypercarbia.

   86 F schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, HTN initial admission with LLL
   aspiration.  Now with large transudative left pleural effusion and
   concern for trapped lung.
   Effusion
   -Lt lung near white-out returned status post tap recurred in setting of
   fluid for hypotension.
   -re: US drainage of effusion is transudative; Will re-ultrasound if
   large pocket will consider IP placing Pig tail drain
   Hypotension
   -Cultures pending
   -Send Differential on WBC
 no left shift
   -perpehenazine can cause severe hypotension but on low dose, will
   change timing of dose tomorrow to see if correlates with low BP.
   Nose Bleed
   -Afrin
   -NG changed to left nares
   Aspiration
   -Tube feeds per NG for now
   -Will consider Peg, guardian would like to have family meeting to help
   issues regarding PEG.  Will schedule with PCP and guardian
   [**Name9 (PRE) 6000**] [**Name2 (NI) 1070**] deferred.
   Hypercarbia
   -Acute on chronic, decompensation likely triggered by sedating meds
   -cefipime for presumed asp PNA completed
   -Will hold diuresis at this time looks euvolemic

   Metabolic alkalosis-Improved
   -Suspect portion of contraction
   -Responded nicely to diamox will hold further diamox.
   Schizophrenia
   -Stable
   -Continue depakote and perphenazine may need to hold if workup for
   hypotension negative per PCP has decompensated off meds in past.  Will
   change timing of perphenazine to see if it is associated with
   hypotension

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension.
- Initial admission was for left lower lobe aspiration.
- Current concerns include a large transudative left pleural effusion, hypotension, nose bleed, aspiration, hypercarbia, atrial fibrillation, somnolence, metabolic alkalosis, and schizophrenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Effusion: The presence of a large transudative left pleural effusion indicates fluid accumulation in the lungs. If not managed properly, it can lead to respiratory distress and compromised oxygenation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension suggests inadequate blood circulation. If left untreated, it can result in organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Nose Bleed: The patient's nose bleed may be due to the use of Afrin and trauma from the nasogastric (NG) tube. If not addressed, it can lead to significant blood loss and anemia.
4. Aspiration: The patient's aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs can cause pneumonia and respiratory failure if not managed promptly.
5. Hypercarbia: Elevated carbon dioxide levels indicate respiratory acidosis. If not corrected, it can lead to further respiratory compromise and organ dysfunction.
6. Atrial Fibrillation (AF"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 5683], an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, was admitted to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. She had previously been admitted to Hospital [967] for aspiration pneumonia. Upon transfer, her vital signs were as follows: temperature 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate 109 bpm, blood pressure 109/54 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 94%. She was unresponsive to stimuli, alert oriented, and lying in bed with a facemask, coughing with secretions. Physical examination revealed bronchial breath sounds on the right side, a ventral hernia, no edema, and mottled skin on the lower extremities. Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 8.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. Chest X-ray revealed opacification of the left lung with unchanged tracheal deviation. The patient was diagnosed with hypotension, hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumonia, alteration in nutrition, impaired airway clearance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), atr"

The patient's current conditions include hypotension, hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumonia, aspiration, alteration in nutrition, impaired balance, impaired airway clearance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), atrial fibrillation, and schizophrenia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is unclear in etiology and may be related to receiving sedating medications. Differential diagnoses include sepsis, pulmonary embolism (PE), and cardiac ischemia. Further investigation is needed, including obtaining cultures and considering antibiotic therapy.
2. Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains hypoxic despite being on BiPAP. The CXR shows opacification of the left lung, indicating a possible effusion. A CT scan revealed a large plug in the left mainstem with LLL collapse. However, bronchoscopy did not reveal obvious plugging. Consultation with an interventional pulmonology specialist for a pigtail catheter placement is recommended. Aggressive chest physiotherapy and deep suctioning should be continued. The patient's blood gases should be closely monitored, and weaning from BiPAP should be done as tolerated"

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the provided progress note. However, the note mentions that the patient has pneumonia and aspiration, along with other medical conditions and complications. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of allergies to sulfonamides and unknown allergies to olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, haloperidol, and possibly heparin. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and heparin sodium.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2,434 mL and output of 1,815 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 619 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery and ABG results of pH 7.39, PaCO2 45 mmHg, and PaO2 not mentioned.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is less awake but responsive to stimuli, alert oriented, and lying in bed with a facemask. The patient has bronchial breath sounds on the right side compared to the left, a ventral hernia, no edema, mottled lower extremities, and right eye ptosis.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 240 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 95 mg/dL, hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L, and low albumin at 2.6 g/dL. The patient's creatinine level is 0.6 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 39 mg/dL, and glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient's imaging shows opacification of the left lung, unchanged tracheal deviation, and no mention of other radiological findings. Microbiology results indicate growth of gram-positive cocci from the PICC line.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypotension, pneumonia, alteration in nutrition, impaired balance, impaired airway clearance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient is being managed with ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pneumonia and respiratory failure, development of further electrolyte imbalances, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer bleeding, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   change timing of dose tomorrow to see if correlates with low BP.
   Nose Bleed
   -Afrin x 3 days
   -NG changed to left nares
   Aspiration
   -Tube feeds per NG for now
   - Goal to place J Peg to be placed by surgery.
   -Repeat swallow deferred.
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)-Stable improved
   -Hold lopressor and dig
   -not on anticoagulation at baseline
   -cont ASA
   Somolence-Improving
    -Avoid sedating meds
   Metabolic alkalosis-Improved

   Attending Note:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   86 F schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, HTN initial admission with
   aspiration pneumonia (probably mostly LLL), now with transudative left
   pleural effusion and concern for trapped lung, and hypoxic acute
   respiratory failure.
   Notable events include: CNS grew from PICC blood culture. We discussed
   case with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5888**] and appreciate very much her input. Patient spoke to
   Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5888**] and would be in favor of having J-tube placed. Lasix held this
   AM due to concern of hypotension.
   Currently stable vitals. BNP ~4000, HCO3 39, WBC 8.7. BP 104/49, HR 75,
   sat 91% on 60% HF mask. CXR today shows opacification of left lung with
   mediastinal shift to the left c/w atelectasis similar to
   pre-thoracentesis film from last week. Bronch 3 days ago did not show
   mucus or other lesions obstructing airway. She is 600 ml positive for
   24 hrs with known transudative effusion - concern is for recurrent

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was initially admitted for left lower lobe aspiration pneumonia and now presents with a large transudative left pleural effusion and concern for trapped lung due to aspiration/PNA. 

The patient has experienced several notable events, including CNS growth from PICC blood culture, discussion of the case with Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 5888], and the patient's decision to have a J-tube placed. Lasix was held due to concern of hypotension. 

The patient's current vital signs include a blood pressure of 104/49, heart rate of 75, oxygen saturation of 91% on 60% HF mask. Her CXR shows opacification of the left lung with mediastinal shift to the left, indicating atelectasis similar to the pre-thoracentesis film from last week. 

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications include hypoxic respiratory failure with ongoing high O2 requirements, likely due to left lung collapse, in part related to pleural effusion. She also has atrial fibrillation that is rate-controlled and significant metabolic alkalosis. 

The plan involves pigtail drainage of pleural fluid, J tube, and likely repeat bronchoscopy before extubation. The patient will continue perphenazine and depakote for schizophrenia. 

The patient is critically"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has a history of schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. Upon admission, she experienced left lower lobe aspiration and is now presenting with a large transudative left pleural effusion and concern for trapped lung due to aspiration/pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 123/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high flow neb. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals a decreased left lung with mild bronchial congestion on the left base, as well as soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. Her PICC line is clean, dry, and intact.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 6.7 to 8.8 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine levels between 0.4 and 0.6 mg/dL, and normal glucose levels between 91 and 107 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Trapped lung: The large pleural effusion may lead to trapped lung syndrome, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 86-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. He was initially admitted for left lower lobe aspiration and now presents with a large transudative left pleural effusion, concern for trapped lung, and hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been intubated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Trapped lung due to pleural effusion: The presence of a large left pleural effusion can lead to lung collapse or trapping, impairing oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis, fluid loss, or medication side effects. Hypotension can compromise organ perfusion and lead to multiple organ dysfunction.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's initial admission was for left lower lobe aspiration, which can result in pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia can worsen respiratory failure and require additional treatment.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of clot formation and embolic events such as stroke.
5. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's lab results show an elevated bicarbonate level, suggesting metabolic alkalosis. This condition may be due to vomiting, diuretic use, or other causes and can have implications for electrolyte balance and acid-base regulation.
6. Schizophrenia: The patient's schizophrenia requires ongoing management with medication. Discontinuation or adjustment of antipsychotic medications may be necessary to optimize his mental health status while minimizing potential side effects.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and prompt management of potential complications are essential to improve his chances of recovery."

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name 5683] is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was transferred to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with pneumonia due to aspiration. She has a large pleural effusion, which has been managed with a pigtail catheter. The patient also has a growing coag-negative staphylococcus infection in her PICC line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which responded to IV fluids and repositioning. It is unclear what caused the hypotension, but it seems to have resolved.
2. Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains hypoxic despite being on mechanical ventilation. The cause of her respiratory failure is attributed to a large pleural effusion, which has improved after pigtail catheter drainage. However, the patient still requires oxygen supplementation.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia due to aspiration. Despite completing a 12-day course of cefepime, she remains at risk for further infections and complications related to her respiratory status.
4. Pleural Effusion: The patient had a large pleural effusion that was causing compression of the lung. The effusion has been managed with a pigtail catheter, but there"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was transferred to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is of unclear etiology, but it responds to IV fluids and repositioning. Differential diagnoses include sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and cardiac ischemia. Further investigations such as blood cultures and checking liver function tests are recommended.

2. Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient still experiences hypoxia despite being on BiPAP. A large left pleural effusion was identified on chest X-ray, which improved after thoracentesis and pigtail catheter placement. CT scan revealed a large plug in the left mainstem with LLL collapse, although bronchoscopy did not reveal obvious plugging. The patient completed a 12-day course of cefepime and has remained afebrile. Management includes continuing BiPAP, monitoring ventilation and metabolic status, weaning as tolerated, aggressive chest physiotherapy, deep suctioning, and controlling heart rate.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia course has been complicated by a transudative effusion. The cause of the effusion may be related to the aspiration pneumonia. Management involves controlling heart rate, incressing beta"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name] is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was transferred to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include hypotension, hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure, coag-negative sepsis from PICC line, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hypertension. The patient has been on sedating medications, which may be related to her hypotension. She has completed a 12-day course of cefepime and remains afebrile. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and aspiration, and her muscle performance is impaired.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's coag-negative sepsis from the PICC line needs to be closely monitored. If persistent hypotension occurs, the healthcare team may consider starting Vanc/Zosyn and changing out lines.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute hypercarbic respiratory failure requires ongoing respiratory support. Aggressive chest physiotherapy and deep suctioning are recommended to improve airway clearance.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's hypotension may be due to cardiac ischemia. Further evaluation and management are necessary to rule out this condition.
4. Stroke: The patient's altered mental status raises concerns about the possibility of a stroke. Regular neurological assessments should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-inch tall male admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. The patient underwent chest tube placement due to pleural effusion caused by coag-negative staphylococcal infection. The patient also received a bedside pigtail drainage with immediate drainage of over 1 liter, followed by surgery to place a G-J tube due to the open procedure being unable to perform a J-tube. The patient's allergies include sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, haloperidol, and unknown allergies. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 05/10/2191 at 01:40 PM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature range of 36.5 - 35.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 67 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 121/48 to 137/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on high-flow nebulization. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,222 mL total in, with outputs of 4,635 mL total out, resulting in a negative balance of 3,413 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a high-flow neb device, with an ABG result of 7.45/58/165, PaO2/FiO2 ratio"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-inch tall individual with an unknown weight. They were admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. Upon admission, the patient had a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 121/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia, aspiration, alteration in nutrition, impaired balance, impaired airway clearance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

The patient received chest tube placement due to pleural effusion, which resulted in the drainage of over 1 liter of fluid. They underwent surgery for the placement of a G-J tube but were unable to have a J tube due to it being an open procedure. The patient also received perphenazine, diamox, and heparin sodium for various reasons.

The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable throughout their stay in the ICU, with occasional fluctuations in blood pressure. They have been on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery and have maintained an oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 58 mmHg, and HCO3- of 165 mmol/L, indicating respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 F schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, HTN initial admission with LLL
   aspiration.  Now with large transudative left pleural effusion and
   concern for trapped lung from aspiration/PNA improved s/p pig tail.
   Effusion/Fluid status
   -Lt lung near white-out returned status post tap recurred in setting of
   fluid for hypotension.
   - Pig tail drain with sig improvement in lung aeration down to 2L
   -Goal negtive
   Hypotension-resolved
   -Cultures picc + Coag negative staph
   -Will d
c vanc
   -Send Differential on WBC
 no left shift
   -perpehenazine can cause severe hypotension but on low dose she did not
   drop her pressure yesterday afternoon
   Nose Bleed
   -Afrin x 3 days completed no evidence of bleeding
   -NG changed to left nares
   Aspiration
   -Tube feeds per NG for now
   -Goal to place J Peg to be placed by surgery will be open so needs to
   be scheduled
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)-Stable improved
   -Hold lopressor and dig
   -Will check Dig level 1 week after last.
   -not on anticoagulation at baseline
   -cont ASA
   Somolence-Improving
    -Avoid sedating meds
   Metabolic alkalosis-Improved
   -Suspect portion of contraction
   -Will give KCL
   -One does of diamox again today
   Schizophrenia
   -Stable
   -Continue depakote and perphenazine may need to hold if workup for
   hypotension negative per PCP has decompensated off meds in past.  Will
   change timing of perphenazine to see if it is associated with
   hypotension
   -If hypotension with perphenazine will call Psyc consult for
   alternative regimen.  Was not hypotensive yesterday.

   Attending Note:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   86 F schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, HTN initial admission with
   aspiration pneumonia (probably mostly LLL), now with transudative left
   pleural effusion causing left lung atelectasis s/p catheter drainage,
   and acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Overnight events noted. Pigtail catheter inserted with drainage of 1.7
   L total so far. CNS x 1 bottle grew from PICC blood culture. We
   discussed case with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5888**] and appreciate very much her input. Patient
   spoke to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5888**] and would be in favor of having J-tube placed.
   Currently stable vitals, weight 67 kg today (admission weight 82 kg).
   Responsive when stimulated, responds to commands,  dry MM, moves 4
   extrem, lungs clear ant/lat, S1S2 reg, abd soft, NT, ND, Ext no edema.
   BNP ~4000 (down from [**Numeric Identifier 2380**] on [**4-22**]. HCO3 34 (got dose of diamox), WBC
   7.1. MAP of 55, HR 85-90, sat 98% on 2L nasal canula. CXR today shows
   reexpanded left lung, no new infiltrates or effusions. Catheter in
   place. I can
t appreciate any pneumothorax today.
   IMP
   - hypoxic respiratory failure with ongoing but improving O2
   requirements. Significant improvement after effusion drained and left
   lung reexpanded.
   - Persistent hypotension appears to be volume related. Looking back at
   the ins/outs from the floor prior to MICU readmission, she was positive
   by several liters and now negative 9 L since the readmit to MICU on
   [**5-1**]. Weight is curiously at 67 kg today which would suggest she is
   volumed depleted explaining her hypotension, significant metabolic
   alkalosis and dry mucus membranes on exam.
   - Afib rate controlled.
   Plan
   Hydrate gently today (will give at least another liter today), continue
   pigtail drainage of left effusion, J tube probably tomorrow, decrease
   lopressor to 12.5 mg TID. Will continue perphanazine and depakote for
   schizophrenia. CT head given new dysphagia and lethargic mental status.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was initially admitted for left lower lobe (LLL) aspiration and now presents with a large transudative left pleural effusion. The patient has been improving after placement of a pigtail catheter, which has significantly improved lung aeration and resolved hypotension.

24-hour events include the placement of a chest tube, planning for a feeding tube, and receiving diamox twice. The patient has multiple allergies, including sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, and haloperidol.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 101/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 65.4 kg, down from 82.2 kg on admission. Fluid balance shows an input of 1222 mL and output of 4635 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -3341 mL.

The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 58 mmHg, HCO3- of 165 mEq/L, BE of -34 mEq/L, and O2 saturation of 412. Chest X-ray"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was initially admitted with left lower lobe (LLL) aspiration and now presents with a large transudative left pleural effusion, concern for trapped lung from aspiration/pneumonia, and improvement post pigtail placement.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pleural effusion: The patient has a large transudative left pleural effusion. This could potentially lead to respiratory distress if it continues to accumulate or becomes infected.

2. Trapped lung: The patient's left lung is near white-out, indicating possible trapped lung due to aspiration. If left untreated, this can lead to further respiratory compromise and pneumonia.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which was initially thought to be related to perphenazine use. However, further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause. If hypotension recurs or persists, it may indicate a more serious underlying condition such as sepsis or cardiac dysfunction.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Close monitoring of cardiac rhythm and consideration of anticoagulation therapy may be necessary.

5. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has evidence of metabolic alkalosis, possibly related to nasogastric tube feeding or diuretic use. App"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has a history of schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. The patient was initially admitted with left lower lobe aspiration. Currently, the patient has a large transudative left pleural effusion and concern for trapped lung due to aspiration/pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), a heart rate of 73 bpm with atrial fibrillation, a blood pressure of 101/45 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and has an ABG showing pH 7.45, PaCO2 58 mmHg, PaO2 412, and FiO2 0.21.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the left with mild bronchial markings at the left base, and decreased breath sounds but less on the right. The patient's neurologic examination is normal.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 6.7 to 9.3 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin ranging from 25.1 to 28.0 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 183 to 296 thousand/mm3, creatinine ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 mg/dL, and blood glucose ranging from 91 to 136 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include several conditions: large transudative left pleural effusion, hypotension, pneumonia/aspiration, impaired airway clearance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, respiratory failure (not ARDS), atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal), and schizophrenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Trapped lung: The large pleural effusion may lead to a trapped lung, which can compromise oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's condition suggests pneumonia due to aspiration, which can worsen respiratory failure and potentially progress to severe pneumonia or sepsis.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This can be attributed to various factors, including sepsis, volume depletion, or medication effects.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of clot formation and embolic events such as stroke.

5. Impaired airway clearance: The patient's impaired airway clearance may lead to further aspiration events and worsening respiratory status.

6. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, which requires immediate attention and intervention to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

7. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's laboratory results indicate metabolic alkalosis, which may require"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia due to aspiration. The patient has a history of hypotension, altered nutrition, impaired airway clearance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, respiratory failure, acute atrial fibrillation, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 101/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support and has been receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's renal function is within normal range. The patient has undergone several procedures and interventions, including chest tube placement, central venous catheter placement, and arterial catheter placement. The patient's overall condition remains unstable with ongoing hypotension and respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis. Pneumonia due to aspiration can lead to systemic infection and septic shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's impaired airway clearance, impaired respiratory mechanics, and respiratory distress indicate the risk of further respiratory"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 5683], an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, was transferred to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been receiving sedating medications and has experienced hypotension, pneumonia due to aspiration, altered nutrition, impaired balance, impaired airway clearance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), atrial fibrillation, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's unclear etiology of hypotension needs further evaluation. Differential diagnoses include sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and cardiac ischemia. Adjustments in medication timing and fluid management should be considered.
2. Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient still experiences hypoxia but has shown improvement. Continued aggressive chest physiotherapy and deep suctioning are recommended. A repeat CT scan without contrast should be done to evaluate for trapped lung, and the possibility of VATS/decortication may be considered.
3. Pneumonia due to Aspiration: The patient has pneumonia likely due to aspiration. Continued aggressive chest physiotherapy and deep suctioning are necessary. Repeat chest X-rays should be performed to monitor improvement.
4. Altered Nutrition: The patient's nutritional status is compromised. PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and altered nutrition. He has a history of unknown allergies to several medications. The patient is currently receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and has been on various ICU medications. His vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and impaired oxygen saturation. He requires respiratory support with a nasal cannula. The patient's lab results indicate abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, total carbon dioxide, glucose, liver enzymes, and electrolyte levels. The patient's muscle performance and cognitive functions are also impaired.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's impaired airway clearance and acute respiratory failure indicate a potential risk for respiratory complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's current diagnosis of pneumonia suggests an ongoing infection that requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events.
4. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion and could lead to organ dysfunction.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's alteration in nutrition suggests a risk for malnutrition, which can impact wound healing and overall recovery.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's"

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was initially admitted for lower left lobe aspiration and now presents with a large transudative left pleural effusion and concern for trapped lung from aspiration/pneumonia. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the aspiration pneumonia and pleural effusion. Other potential medical complications that can arise include hypotension, pneumonia, alteration in nutrition, impaired airway clearance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, and respiratory failure. The patient's current treatment plan includes antibiotics for the aspiration pneumonia, pigtail drain for the pleural effusion, tube feeds through the nasogastric tube, and scheduling for a jejunostomy tube placement. The patient's atrial fibrillation is stable, and she is not on anticoagulation at baseline. She will continue to receive aspirin."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 F schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, HTN initial admission with LLL
   aspiration.  Now with large transudative left pleural effusion and
   concern for trapped lung from aspiration/PNA improved oxygenation s/p
   pig tail but residual pneumothorax which is concerning for trapped lung
   Effusion pig tail
   - Will repeat CT scan and consult thoracics if concern for trapped
   lung.
   Hypotension-resolved

   -perpehenazine can cause severe hypotension but on low dose she did not
   drop her pressure yesterday afternoon
   Nose Bleed
   -Afrin x 3 days completed no evidence of bleeding
   -NG changed to left nares
   Aspiration
   -Tube feeds per NG for now
   -Goal to place J Peg to be placed by surgery will be open so needs to
   be scheduled

   hypotension negative per PCP has decompensated off meds in past.  Will
   change timing of perphenazine to see if it is associated with
   hypotension
   -If hypotension with perphenazine will call Psyc consult for
   alternative regimen.  Was not hypotensive yesterday.

   Attending Note:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   86 F schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, HTN initial admission with
   aspiration pneumonia (probably mostly LLL), now with transudative left
   pleural effusion causing left lung atelectasis s/p catheter drainage,
   and acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Events noted: lopressor decreased, CT head without evidence of stroke
   or acute hemorrhage. Pigtail catheter continues to drain ~500 cc fluid,
   on suction. I/O positive ~700 ml. CT chest done today which was
   reviewed
 to be reviewed with radiologist.
   Currently stable vitals, weight 67.4 kg today (admission weight 82 kg).
   Responsive when stimulated, responds to commands,  dry MM, moves 4
   extrem, lungs clear ant/lat, S1S2 reg, abd soft, NT, ND, Ext no edema.
   HCO3 29, WBC 7.9. MAPs improved, HR 81-101, sat 97% on 2L nasal canula.
   CXR today shows re-expanded left lung with slightly larger apical
   pneumothorax, right pleural effusion.
   IMP
   - hypoxic respiratory failure with improving O2 requirements.
   Significant improvement after effusion drained and left lung
   reexpanded.
   - Pneumothorax. Will need to review CT chest with radiologist. It
s not
   clear if air is truly a pneumothorax or as a result of trapped lung.
   Will put CT on water seal and repeat CXR today.
   - Hypotension improved with lowering lopressor and giving IVF.
   - Afib rate controlled.
   Plan
   Continue with gentle hydration if hypotensive, continue pigtail
   drainage of left effusion, J tube likely to be put in on Monday. Will
   continue perphanazine and depakote for schizophrenia. Rest of plan as
   detailed in Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5967**]

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was initially admitted for aspiration pneumonia and now presents with a large transudative left pleural effusion and concern for trapped lung due to aspiration/PNA. The patient has improved oxygenation after pigtail catheter placement but still has a residual pneumothorax, which is concerning for trapped lung. 

The patient's vital signs have stabilized, with a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 102/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 2L nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, responding to commands and moving all four extremities. The physical examination reveals vesicular breath sounds bilaterally with bronchial breath sounds at the left base and decreased breath sounds at the left base. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 28.3 g/dL, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, blood glucose of 126 mg/dL, and potassium of 4.3 mEq/L. The patient has a history of metabolic alkalosis, which has improved, and atrial fibrillation, which is currently stable. 

Plan:
1. Continue tube feeds and plan for J-tube placement.
2. Monitor and manage the pigtail catheter drainage"

   diuresed yesterday to trigger this. Also not febrile. Ddx includes
   sepsis, PE, cardiac ischemia. [**Month (only) 8**] be related to receiving sedating meds
   - change timing of perphenazine
   - pan culture (urine, blood, sputum, stool) unrevealing
   - goal I/O even today
   # Hypercarbic/ Hypoxic respiratory failure-  Pt still hypoxic but
   substantially improved down to several liters NC from face mask.  CXR
   today is improved with re-expansion of left upper lobe.  BNP still up
   4,000, likely still volume up.  Pigtail placed on [**5-10**] with drainage of
   a large amount of fluid and substantial improvement on CXR. Completed
   12 day course cefepime on [**5-4**] and has remained afebrile. She had
   recurrent LL effusion with was tapped X 1 followed by rapid
   accumulation. Now s/p IP placed pigtail to drain transudate likely from
   a trapped lung.
   - repeat CT scan shows small PTX, pt placed on water seal
   - will clamp chest tube for 4 hrs and repeat CXR to eval size of PTX
   - once drainage decreased to 100 cc/24 hrs, then can consider d/c tube
   - further discussion re: need for decortication
   - repeat film this morning
   - aggressive CPT and deep suctioning
   - patient full code per discussion with PCP [**2191-5-7**]
   #Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation -  Improved, HR now 90
s. Often
   exacerbated by mucous plugging.
   - lopressor [**Month (only) 453**] back to  12.5mg TID given hypotension
   - continue ASA 325
   - not on anticoagulation at baseline
   #Schizophrenia - stable

   aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal neurological signs. Likely
   [**2-14**] weakness and infection, and expect to improve.
   - failed video swallow X 1
   - strict NPO
   - guardian agreed to PEG

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5683**], an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, was admitted to the ICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. She also has a past medical history of hypertension, stroke, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing recurrent left lower lobe effusions. A pigtail catheter has been placed to drain the fluid, and a chest tube may be necessary if there is significant accumulation. The patient's respiratory status has improved, with re-expansion of the left upper lobe seen on recent imaging. She remains hypoxic but is expected to improve with continued treatment. Other issues include hypotension, anemia, and hypertension, which are being managed accordingly. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition will be determined after further evaluation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and current respiratory failure indicate a risk for developing pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening oxygenation, is essential.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of lung sounds and sputum cultures will help in early detection and management.
3. Pleural effusion: The recurrent left lower lobe effusions indicate a risk"

   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Hypotension
 Unclear etiology, responsive to IV fluids and
   re-positioning. Did not receive any new medications and was not
   diuresed yesterday to trigger this. Also not febrile. Ddx includes
   sepsis, PE, cardiac ischemia. [**Month (only) 8**] be related to receiving sedating meds
   - change timing of perphenazine
   - pan culture (urine, blood, sputum, stool) unrevealing
   - goal I/O even today
   # Hypercarbic/ Hypoxic respiratory failure-  Pt still hypoxic but
   substantially improved down to several liters NC from face mask.  CXR
   today is improved with re-expansion of left upper lobe.  BNP still up
   4,000, likely still volume up.  Pigtail placed on [**5-10**] with drainage of
   a large amount of fluid and substantial improvement on CXR. Completed
   12 day course cefepime on [**5-4**] and has remained afebrile. She had
   recurrent LL effusion with was tapped X 1 followed by rapid
   accumulation. Now s/p IP placed pigtail to drain transudate likely from
   a trapped lung.
   - repeat CT scan shows small PTX, pt placed on water seal
   - further discussion re: need for decortication
   - repeat film this morning
   - aggressive CPT and deep suctioning
   - patient full code per discussion with PCP [**2191-5-7**]
   #Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation -  Improved, HR now 90
s. Often
   exacerbated by mucous plugging.
   - lopressor [**Month (only) 453**] back to  12.5mg TID given hypotension
   - check digoxin level
   - continue ASA 325
   - not on anticoagulation at baseline
   #Schizophrenia - stable
   -continue depakote and perphenazine
    # [**Name (NI) 5860**] pt failed video swallow and is currently NPO. Pt will be
   reevaluated later this week. In the ICU question was raised whether
   aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal neurological signs. Likely
   [**2-14**] weakness and infection, and expect to improve.
   - failed video swallow X 1
   - strict NPO
   - guardian agreed to PEG
   - consulted Gen surgery, will need to be intubated
   # Anemia- currently stable, may have been volume shifts. stable

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including hypotension, pneumonia, alteration in nutrition, impaired airway clearance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), atrial fibrillation, and anemia.

The patient's hypotension is of unclear etiology but is responsive to IV fluids and repositioning. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and cardiac ischemia. The patient's hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure has improved, but she still requires nasal cannula oxygen. The chest X-ray shows improved re-expansion of the left upper lobe, and a pigtail catheter was placed on [**5-10**] with drainage of a large amount of fluid.

The patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is improved, with a heart rate now at 90 bpm. The patient often experiences exacerbations due to mucous plugging. Lopressor has been restarted at 12.5 mg TID, and the patient's digoxin level should be checked. She continues on ASA 325 and is not on anticoagulation at baseline.

The patient's schizophrenia is stable, and she is currently"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. The patient was initially admitted with left lower lobe (LLL) aspiration. Currently, the patient has a large transudative left pleural effusion and a concern for trapped lung due to aspiration/pneumonia. Oxygenation has improved following a pigtail catheter placement, but there is still a residual pneumothorax, which is concerning for trapped lung.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), a heart rate of 106 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 121/55 mmHg to 131/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 2L. The patient's weight has decreased from 82.2 kg at admission to 67.4 kg currently.

The patient has received various medications, including lansoprazole, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), atrovent, valproic acid, perphenazine, MVI, docusate, digoxin, aspirin, metoprolol, and a lidocaine patch.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 7.1 to 9.2 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level ranging from 25.1% to 28"

   Attending Note:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   86 F schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, HTN initial admission with
   aspiration pneumonia (probably mostly LLL), now with transudative left
   pleural effusion causing left lung atelectasis s/p catheter drainage,
   and acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Events noted: pigtail catheter drainage 75 cc/24 hrs on water seal. I/O
   positive 1.5 L.
   Currently stable vitals, weight kg today (admission weight 82 kg).
   Responsive when stimulated, responds to commands,  dry MM, moves 4
   extrem, lungs clear ant/lat, S1S2 reg, abd soft, NT, ND, Ext no edema.
   HCO3 32, WBC 7.3. MAPs ~57-87, HR 95-105, sat 96% on 2L nasal canula.
   IMP
   - hypoxic respiratory failure with improved O2 requirements.
   Significant improvement after effusion drained and left lung
   reexpanded.
   - Small pneumothorax. CT was reviewed with radiologist. There appears
   to have been mucus plugging the airways which, in addition to the
   effusion, was causing atelectasis. No worsening of pneumothorax on
   water seal. Will clamp and repeat CXR today.
   - Hypotension improved but with lower lopressor dose. Would keep
   positive balance.
   - Afib rate controlled on dig, lopressor. Tachycardia today likely due
   to a combination of vol depletion + lower BB dose.
   Plan
   Continue with gentle hydration, increase lopressor, consider d/c chest
   tube depending on xray, J tube likely to be put in on Monday. Rest of
   plan as detailed in Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5967**]
s note.
   Total time 35 minutes. Full Code.
","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was initially admitted with left lower lobe (LLL) aspiration and now presents with a large transudative left pleural effusion and concern for trapped lung from aspiration/pneumonia. The patient's oxygenation has improved after pigtail catheter drainage, but there is a residual pneumothorax. Her vital signs are relatively stable, and she is responsive with clear lungs. Her WBC count is within normal limits, and her HCO3 level is elevated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Trapped lung: The patient's large transudative left pleural effusion and residual pneumothorax may lead to a trapped lung, causing difficulty in breathing and inadequate oxygenation.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The initial LLL aspiration could have led to aspiration pneumonia, which can cause respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which may be due to various factors such as medication side effects or fluid imbalance. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events.
5. Schizophrenia: The patient's schizophrenia may require ongoing medication management to control symptoms and prevent decompensation.
