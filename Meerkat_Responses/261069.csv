","The patient is a 57-year-old male with squamous carcinoma involvement of the right face and a history of facial bleeding. He is currently in the ICU for rebleeding and has been tamponaded. The patient has a documented DNR/DNI status and has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells. His blood pressure and heart rate are stable. The patient's wound is wrapped, and he will continue to be transfused while actively bleeding, with the goal of maintaining his hematocrit level. Supportive care with saline and packed red blood cells will be provided to maintain blood pressure. Another discussion with the family regarding goals of care is needed, as the patient will likely bleed again regardless of whether embolization is performed or not. Intubation would be required for embolization, but this goes against the patient's documented DNR/DNI wishes. Unfortunately, the patient is currently not oriented, and his family has been unreachable. Efforts will continue to reach the family.

The patient's wound has been cultured and shows growth of Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The patient has completed a full course of vancomycin and meropenem for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which also covers the sensitivities of the organisms identified. However, the patient was started on cephalexin on the floor for increased white blood cell"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma involving the right face and a history of facial bleeding. He has been admitted to the ICU for rebleeding and tamponaded. The patient has a known allergy to morphine, which caused a rash. He received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and began bleeding slowly again.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/61 to 137/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,893 mL and output of 515 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,378 mL. His respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a non-invasive device, with an ABG showing pH of 7.26.

Physical examination reveals a face wrapped in a bandage, with a large fungating mass encompassing nearly the entire right side of the face, invading the right orbit. The patient has regular cardiac rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His lungs are clear bilaterally, and he has no abdominal abnormalities. Extremities are warm and well-perfused, with no edema or calf pain. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma involving the right face and a history of facial bleeding. He was transferred to the ICU due to repeat bleeding and is currently tamponaded. The patient has allergies to morphine and has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells. His vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 115/61 mmHg and a heart rate of 62 bpm. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 97%. The patient's physical examination shows a large fungating mass encompassing nearly the entire right side of the face, invading the right orbit. Other findings include regular rhythm, normal rate, and normal S1, S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The patient is awake, alert, and answering questions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of facial bleeding due to squamous cell carcinoma. Despite being tamponaded, he began bleeding slowly again. There is a potential for further bleeding, which may require additional transfusions and interventions.
2. Infection: The patient's wound is cultured with Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). He was previously treated with vancomycin and zosyn for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which also covers the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma involving the right face and a history of facial bleeding. He has been admitted to the ICU with repeat bleeding, which is being tamponaded with a pressure dressing. The patient's hematocrit is stable at around 31%, and he has received 4 units of transfused blood on [**2198-3-24**]. His blood pressure and heart rate are stable. The patient's wound is wrapped, and he will be monitored with frequent checks of hematocrit every 6 hours. He may require additional transfusions while actively bleeding. The patient's blood pressure will be supported with saline and PRBCs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Facial Bleeding: The patient has a large fungating growth of squamous cell carcinoma, causing facial bleeding. Despite receiving blood transfusions, the patient is at risk of further bleeding.
2. Wound Infection: The patient's wound is cultured with Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and MSSA. Although he has completed a full course of vancomycin and zosyn for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) that also covers his sensitivities, he is now on Keflex due to increased white blood cell count and confusion. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and consider antibiotic treatment based on culture results.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma involving the right face and a history of facial bleeding. He has been admitted to the ICU due to bleeding from a large fungating growth of squamous cell carcinoma. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure (BP) of 139/68 mmHg and heart rate (HR) of 75 bpm. His hemoglobin (Hct) level is currently at 32%, after receiving 4 units of transfused blood on [**2198-3-24**]. The patient's wound is wrapped, and he will need ongoing monitoring of his Hct level every 6 hours, with transfusion if actively bleeding. Supportive care with saline and packed red blood cells (prbcs) will be provided to maintain BP. 

The patient has a DNR/DNI status, indicating do not resuscitate/do not intubate. There will be a discussion with the family regarding goals of care, as the patient is likely to bleed again regardless of whether he undergoes embolization or not. The patient also requires intubation for embolization, which conflicts with his previously documented DNR/DNI status. 

Additionally, the patient has been cultured with Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, and Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). He has completed a full course of vancomycin"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with a large right cheek mass. They have a history of SCC bleed, which has now stopped, and there are no plans for reintubation or embolization. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/58 mmHg to 139/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently not receiving respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 10.5 g/dL, indicating anemia. This could be secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding) mentioned in the assessment and plan.
2. Airway Compromise: The patient has an inability to protect their airway, putting them at risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, and impaired airway clearance. This may require intervention to secure the airway.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which could be due to the SCC bleed or other factors. This could increase the risk of infection and require appropriate wound care management.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium level is elevated at 11.8 mg/dL, indicating hypercalcemia. This"

   Plan:  Bleeding is currently stopped and no need for any further
   intervention at this time.  However, given the incurable and
   unfortunately progressive nature of his tumor, there is not much that
   can be done to stop this progressive process.  We attempted to hold a
   family meeting today but were unable and patient has little insight
   into his condition, however the hospice approach appears to be most
   reasonable under the given unfortunate circumstances.

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a large, uncurable, and unsurgically respectable squamous cell carcinoma of the face. He was previously intubated for a procedure to cauterize a sphenopalatine artery bleed complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), improved, extubated, and sent to the floor. Now, he returns due to bleeding from his tumor, which has currently stopped.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37°C (98.6°F), pulse 75 bpm, blood pressure 103/58 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%. On examination, there is a large right-sided facial tumor, and the patient appears alert and awake. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, heart sounds are regular, abdomen is soft and non-tender, extremities show no edema, and neurologic examination reveals the patient is awake and alert.

The patient has a history of incurable squamous cell carcinoma of the face, recurrent bleeding from the carcinoma, and previously established do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status. The plan is to continue monitoring the patient closely, as the bleeding has stopped for now. However, given the progressive nature of the tumor, further interventions may not be feasible. The hospice approach appears to be the most reasonable option under the circumstances."
