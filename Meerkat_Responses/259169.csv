   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis now hypotensive with probable
   sepsis and coagulopathy.
   .
   # SIRS/Septic Shock: Patient continues to have levophed requirement.
   Leukocytosis increased today to 35 with bandemia on admission.  Likely
   represent biliary sepsis given gall stone pancreatitis.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam, will add genta or ciprofloxacin for added
   coverage if patient decompensates
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - ERCP for stone extraction.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300.
   - Decrease Tv to [**5-22**] ml/kg
   - Continue amp/sulbactam as above
   - Sputum cx from ETT with gram stain for 3 GNR and GPC in setting of
   post-intubation collection.
   - Follow-up culture data.
   - f/u ABG
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Secondary to obstructing stone.
   - ERCP for stone removal, will follow-up with ERCP team, will need FFP
   prior to procedure.
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP suggests that patient is not intravascular volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   - NGT/OGT placement today. [**Month (only) 8**] need to be IR guided or help from ERCP
   team.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin. She has received
   FFP and vitamin K.  She also has a low normal fibrinogen in setting of
   acute illness, suggestive of relative deficiency.  Split products also
   elevated, all of which suggest that patient may be heading towards DIC
   even without low platelets.  Patient also may have a coagulopathy in
   setting of antibiotic use while on coumadin.
   - DIC labs Q6H
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100

   # Anion Gap acidosis: Likely lactic acidosis with AG of 14 this AM.
   Likely secondary to lactic acidosis.
   - trend lytes
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient. INR this AM 2.1.
   - hold anticoagulation for ERCP, will need FFP prior to procedure.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history significant for atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis, hypotension, probable sepsis, and coagulopathy. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several ongoing medical issues.

1. SIRS/Septic Shock: The patient continues to require levophed support, indicating ongoing hypotension. Leukocytosis with bandemia suggests biliary sepsis secondary to gallstone pancreatitis. The patient will be continued on ampicillin-sulbactam and gentamicin or ciprofloxacin may be added if the patient decompensates. Fever curve and WBC monitoring will be done, along with weaning off levophed with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65. Blood and urine cultures will also be followed up.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient aspirated during central venous line insertion after being placed in the Trendelenburg position. Now, the patient has bilateral infiltrates and a PO2/FiO2 ratio <300. The tidal volume will be decreased to 5-22 ml/kg. Ampicillin-sulbactam will be continued, and sputum cultures from the endotracheal tube will be obtained for gram stain for three Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci in the setting of post-intubation collection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis, and congestive heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU with sepsis, pancreatitis, and respiratory failure. She is currently on invasive ventilation, arterial line, and multi-lumen central venous catheter. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 115/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and elevated D-dimer levels suggestive of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She also has anion gap acidosis and is at risk for aspiration pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed properly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and complications related to endotracheal tube placement.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis, and there is a risk of further complications such as pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation.
4. DIC: The patient's elevated D-dimer levels, low fibrinogen, and split"

   [**Age over 90 **]F transferred from OSH with septic shock from biliary source,
   subsequently developed aspiration event requiring intubation; remains
   critically ill with hemodynamic instability; plans to undergo ERCP this
   morning.
   1) Septic Shock:  Currently requiring levophed for hemodynamic support,
   she has metabolic acidosis with lactate of 2.5.  Currently cultures are
   pending; abdominal imaging at OSH with biliary stone.
   - Continue unasyn; will consider addition of quinolone or gentamicin if
   clinical deterioration.
   - Await culture results to tailor antibiotics
   - CVP currently 13, UOP is maintained; less likely she would be fluid
   responsive at this time; will follow clinically today and bolus if drop
   in CVP and evidence that fluid would increase stroke volume.
   - Plan for ERCP today for relief of obstruction
   2) Acute Respiratory Failure:  hypoxemic failure related to aspiration
   event.  PaO2 84 on PEEP 8, FiO2 .60.
   - Will titrate PEEP today to decrease FiO2 following ERCP.
   - Also given aspiration event and sepsis, also P/F < 200, will place on
   low tidal volume ventilation 6-8cc/kg Vt to prevent VILI.
   3) Coagulopathy: related to coumadin, hepatic dysfunction, DIC given
   elevated INR.
   - follow coags, fibrinogen today; no indication for replacement
   currently (fibrinogen 169)
   4) Pancreatitis:  Amylase/Lipase trending down from OSH
   - will monitor fluid balance, recognizing risk of third spacing.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill elderly female admitted to the ICU for biliary sepsis. She required increasing doses of vasopressors and had an aspiration event leading to intubation. She has been placed on mechanical ventilation and is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, vasopressors, sedatives, and pain management. The patient's vital signs are stable with controlled oxygenation and hemodynamics. However, she has metabolic acidosis with an elevated lactate level. Her laboratory results show signs of infection, coagulopathy, and pancreatitis. The patient's condition remains critical, and she will undergo ERCP today for relief of obstruction. Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of respiratory function, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, progression of coagulopathy, and worsening of pancreatitis."

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill, elderly individual admitted to the ICU for biliary sepsis. They developed hypotension requiring increasing doses of vasopressors and had an aspiration event necessitating intubation. The patient's current condition includes septic shock, acute respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and pancreatitis. They are receiving various medications and interventions, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and respiratory support. The patient is expected to undergo an ERCP procedure today for relief of obstruction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued hemodynamic instability and potential deterioration despite vasopressor support.
2. Progression of acute respiratory failure and difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation.
3. Development of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome due to prolonged critical illness and sepsis.
4. Further deterioration in coagulation status leading to increased bleeding risk.
5. Potential complications from the ERCP procedure, such as pancreatitis, perforation, or bleeding.
6. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
7. Possible development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization.
8. Nutritional deficiencies and glycemic control issues while being NPO and on insulin sliding scale."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]F transferred from OSH with septic shock from biliary source,
   subsequently developed aspiration event requiring intubation; remains
   critically ill with hemodynamic instability; plans to undergo ERCP this
   morning.
   1) Septic Shock:  Currently requiring levophed for hemodynamic support,
   she has metabolic acidosis with lactate of 2.5.  Currently cultures are
   pending; abdominal imaging at OSH with biliary stone.
   - Continue unasyn; will consider addition of quinolone or gentamicin if
   clinical deterioration.
   - Await culture results to tailor antibiotics
   - CVP currently 13, UOP is maintained; less likely she would be fluid
   responsive at this time; will follow clinically today and bolus if drop
   in CVP and evidence that fluid would increase stroke volume.
   - Plan for ERCP today for relief of obstruction
   2) Acute Respiratory Failure:  hypoxemic failure related to aspiration
   event.  PaO2 84 on PEEP 8, FiO2 .60.
   - Will titrate PEEP today to decrease FiO2 following ERCP.
   - Also given aspiration event and sepsis, also P/F < 200, will place on
   low tidal volume ventilation 6-8cc/kg Vt to prevent VILI.
   3) Coagulopathy: related to coumadin, hepatic dysfunction, DIC given
   elevated INR.
   - follow coags, fibrinogen today; no indication for replacement
   currently (fibrinogen 169)
   4) Pancreatitis:  Amylase/Lipase trending down from OSH
   - will monitor fluid balance, recognizing risk of third spacing.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill elderly female who was admitted to the ICU for biliary sepsis. Upon arrival, she required increasing doses of vasopressors and central venous pressure monitoring due to hypotension. She also experienced an aspiration event, leading to intubation. The patient has a history of allergies to morphine, causing hallucinations. She received Unasyn as her last dose of antibiotics at 04:11 AM. Currently, she is on infusions of norepinephrine, fentanyl, and midazolam. She is also receiving ICU medications such as pantoprazole and flowsheet data.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is currently experiencing hemodynamic instability and requires levophed support. She has metabolic acidosis with lactate levels of 2.5. Cultures are pending, and there is evidence of a biliary stone on abdominal imaging.
   - Continue with Unasyn antibiotics and consider adding a quinolone or gentamicin if clinical deterioration occurs.
   - Await culture results to tailor antibiotics.
   - Monitor CVP and provide fluid bolus if there is a drop and evidence of increased stroke volume.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemic failure related to an aspiration event. Her PaO2 is 84 on PEEP 8, FiO2 0.60.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis now hypotensive with probable
   sepsis and coagulopathy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient continues to have levophed requirement.  Leukocytosis
   trending down today to 24.8. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone
   pancreatitis with successful ERCP yesterday.  Blood cultures from OSH
   speciated as pan-sensitive E.coli.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300.  Tv decreased yesterday to 350 and PEEP increased to
   8.  Sputum cx from ETT with gram stain for 3 GNR and GPC in setting of
   post-intubation collection.
   - RSBI this AM deferred.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam as above
   - Follow-up culture data.
   - f/u ABG
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p successfuly
   ERCP yesterday.  NGT placed yesterday.  Transaminases continue to trend
   up, lipase today 26.
   - Trend lipase, LFTs
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP suggests that patient is not intravascular volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin. She has received
   FFP and vitamin K. Platelets continue trend down, this morning at 84.
   Fibrinogen has been in the 300s.  D-dimer continues to be elevated.
   - DIC labs Q6H
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient previously with metabolic acidosis due to elevated
   lactate in setting of sepsis.  Last ABG 7.34/38/151. AML with anion gap
   of 10, although this likely represents a true anion gap in setting of
   hypoalbuminemia.  There may also be a combination of gap and non-gap
   acidosis secondary to IVF
   - ABG with lactate later today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 25.6 from 29.3 on admission.  There may be
   dilutional component, although LDH is WNL this morning.
   - Check haptoglobin and smear.
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for hct<25.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.
   .
   # CAD:
   - holding ASA and lisinopril
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits
   - holding ASA

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, presenting with gallstone pancreatitis. She is now experiencing hypotension, probable sepsis, and coagulopathy. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure yesterday and has shown improvement. However, she continues to require vasopressor support and has respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent leukocytosis and requirement for vasopressor support suggest ongoing sepsis. Blood cultures have identified pan-sensitive E. coli, indicating a possible biliary source of infection. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and further monitoring of fever curve and WBC count is necessary. Weaning of vasopressor support should be done cautiously with the goal of maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed bilateral infiltrates after aspiration during central venous line insertion, leading to respiratory failure. Decreasing tidal volume (Vt) and increasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were implemented. RSBI (rapid shallow breathing index) assessment was deferred. Sputum cultures from the endotracheal tube revealed the presence of gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci, suggesting a possible infection. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and follow-up culture data should be monitored. ABG (arterial blood gas) analysis"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis now hypotensive with probable
   sepsis and coagulopathy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient continues to have levophed requirement.  Leukocytosis
   trending down today to 24.8. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone
   pancreatitis with successful ERCP yesterday.  Blood cultures from OSH
   speciated as pan-sensitive E.coli.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300.  Tv decreased yesterday to 350 and PEEP increased to
   8.  Sputum cx from ETT with gram stain for 3 GNR and GPC in setting of
   post-intubation collection.
   - RSBI this AM deferred.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam as above
   - Follow-up culture data.
   - f/u ABG
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p successfuly
   ERCP yesterday.  NGT placed yesterday.  Transaminases continue to trend
   up, lipase today 26.
   - Trend lipase, LFTs
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP suggests that patient is not intravascular volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin. She has received
   FFP and vitamin K. Platelets continue trend down, this morning at 84.
   Fibrinogen has been in the 300s.  D-dimer continues to be elevated.
   - DIC labs Q6H
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient previously with metabolic acidosis due to elevated
   lactate in setting of sepsis.  Last ABG 7.34/38/151. AML with anion gap
   of 10, although this likely represents a true anion gap in setting of
   hypoalbuminemia.  There may also be a combination of gap and non-gap
   acidosis secondary to IVF
   - ABG with lactate later today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 25.6 from 29.3 on admission.  There may be
   dilutional component, although LDH is WNL this morning.
   - Check haptoglobin and smear.
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for hct<25.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.
   .
   # CAD:
   - holding ASA and lisinopril
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits
   - holding ASA
   .
   # FEN: NPO, replete lytes as necessary, IVFs
   .
   # PPX: SCDs, bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: PIV, a-line, CVL
   .
   # CODE: Full for now per family

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history significant for atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis, now presenting with hypotension, probable sepsis, and coagulopathy. The patient continues to have a requirement for levophed, indicating ongoing hypotension. The leukocytosis is trending down today to 24.8. It is likely biliary sepsis given the patient's gallstone pancreatitis and successful ERCP yesterday. Blood cultures from OSH speculated as pan-sensitive E.coli. 

Continue with the current antibiotic regimen of Amp/sulbactam. Monitor the fever curve and WBC. Wean levophed with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65. Follow-up blood and urine cultures.

The patient aspirated in the setting of CVL insertion after being placed in the trendelenburg position. Now with bilateral infiltrates and a PO2/FiO2 <300. TV decreased yesterday to 350 and PEEP increased to 8. Sputum culture from ETT with gram stain for 3 GNR and GPC in the setting of post-intubation collection.

Continue with the current antibiotic regimen of Amp/sulbactam. Follow-up culture data. Follow-up ABG.

The patient has gallstone pancreatitis, successfully ERCP yesterday. NGT placed yesterday. Transaminases continue to trend up, lipase today at 26.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis now hypotensive with probable
   sepsis and coagulopathy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient continues to have levophed requirement.  Leukocytosis
   trending down today to 24.8. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone
   pancreatitis with successful ERCP yesterday.  Blood cultures from OSH
   speciated as pan-sensitive E.coli.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300.  Tv decreased yesterday to 350 and PEEP increased to
   8.  Sputum cx from ETT with gram stain for 3 GNR and GPC in setting of
   post-intubation collection.
   - Lighten sedation and assess neuro status.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam as above
   - Follow-up culture data.
   - f/u ABG
   - Decrease FiO2 as PaO2 was 151
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p successfuly
   ERCP yesterday.  NGT placed yesterday.  Transaminases continue to trend
   up, lipase today 26.
   - Trend lipase, LFTs
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP suggests that patient is not intravascular volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin. She has received
   FFP and vitamin K. Platelets continue trend down, this morning at 84.
   Fibrinogen has been in the 300s.  D-dimer continues to be elevated.
   - Trend coags
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient previously with metabolic acidosis due to elevated
   lactate in setting of sepsis.  Last ABG 7.34/38/151. AML with anion gap
   of 10, although this likely represents a true anion gap in setting of
   hypoalbuminemia.  There may also be a combination of gap and non-gap
   acidosis secondary to IVF
   - ABG with lactate later today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 25.6 from 29.3 on admission.  There may be
   dilutional component, although LDH is WNL this morning.
   - Check haptoglobin.
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for hct<25.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.
   .
   # CAD:
   - holding ASA and lisinopril
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits
   - holding ASA

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, presenting with gallstone pancreatitis, now hypotensive with probable sepsis and coagulopathy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing biliary sepsis given the gallstone pancreatitis. Blood cultures have identified pan-sensitive E.coli. Continuous monitoring of fever curve and WBC is necessary. Weaning of levophed with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 should be considered, along with follow-up blood and urine cultures. Monitoring of urine output (UOP), MAP, central venous pressure (CVP), and bolus as necessary is also important.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient aspirated during central venous line insertion after being placed in the Trendelenburg position. This has resulted in bilateral infiltrates and a PO2/FiO2 ratio <300. Decreasing tidal volume (TV) to 350 and increasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 8 have been implemented. A sputum culture from the endotracheal tube has shown the presence of three Gram-negative rods (GNR) and one Gram-positive cocci (GPC). Lightening sedation and assessing neuro status is essential. Continuing ampicillin/sulbactam as above, following-up culture data, and decreasing FiO2 as the partial pressure of oxygen"

   [**Age over 90 **]yoF here with biliary sepsis, subsequent ecoli bacteremia; now s/p
   ERCP with relief of obstruction. Continues with ventilatory support for
   hypoxemic respiratory failure in setting of aspiration and vasopressor
   support for sepsis.
   1.       ID/Sepsis:  Cholangitis from biliary obstruction, resolving.
   OSH microbiology data revealed ecoli bacteremia (pansensitive).
   Hemodynamically she remains in vasodilatory septic shock requiring
   stable levophed support over last 24hours.  Her CVP is > 8, has
   maintained 40-60cc UOP and her anion gap lactic acidosis is resolving.
   Leukocytosis also improving steadily.
   - Continue unasyn;
   - CVP currently 10, UOP is maintained; less likely she would be fluid
   responsive at this time; will follow clinically today and bolus if drop
   in CVP and evidence that fluid would increase stroke volume.
   2.       Respiratory Failure/Aspiration event:  hypoxemic respiratory
   failure.  Improved PaO2 on increased PEEP. P/F ratio 225.  Tolerating
   ventilatory on ARDSnet low tidal volumes.  Secretions minimal.
   -          Wean FiO2/PEEP today as her oxygenation will tolerate
   -          ARDSnet with Vt 350
   -          Hold sedation today for daily awakening, possible SBT if she
   wakes up, though limited by hemodynamic instability for extubation
   currently.
   3.       GI: biliary obstruction from stone
 s/p ERCP with stent.
   Resolving.
   -          Follow LFTs/bilirubin
   4.       Heme: coagulapathy related to coumadin and possible early
   DIC.  INR was reversed upon admission.
   - follow coags daily, no role for transfusion of cryo given normal
   fibrinogen
   ICU Care

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female who was admitted with biliary obstruction and cholangitis. She underwent an ERCP procedure yesterday with stent placement for an obstructing stone. Her OSH cultures revealed pansensitive e.coli, and her antibiotics were tailored to unasyn only. The patient continues to have hemodynamic instability with stable pressor requirement but shows evidence of adequate perfusion with maintained urine output and improvement of lactic acidosis. She remains intubated on a ventilator due to hypoxemic respiratory failure and requires vasopressor support for sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ID/Sepsis: The patient has cholangitis from biliary obstruction, which is resolving. However, she still has e.coli bacteremia. She remains in vasodilatory septic shock requiring stable levophed support. The patient's CVP is within an acceptable range, and her urine output is maintained. Her anion gap lactic acidosis is improving. It is important to continue monitoring her fluid status and adjust fluid administration accordingly.

2. Respiratory Failure/Aspiration Event: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure. Her PaO2 has improved on increased PEEP, and she is tolerating ventilatory support on ARDSnet low tidal volumes. Secretions are minimal. It would be appropriate to wean FiO2/PEEP today as her oxygenation allows. Daily awakening and possible spontaneous breathing trial (SB"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill elderly female admitted with biliary obstruction and cholangitis. She underwent ERCP yesterday with stent placement for an obstructing stone. The patient has continued hemodynamic instability with stable pressor requirement (levophed 0.16 mcg/kg/min), but shows evidence of adequate perfusion with maintained urine output and improvement of lactic acidosis. Her OSH cultures returned pan-sensitive E. coli, and her antibiotics were tailored to Unasyn only. No significant clinical change in her status over the last 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's biliary sepsis and subsequent E. coli bacteremia indicate an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's critical condition and hemodynamic instability may lead to organ dysfunction, including renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular dysfunction.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated on a ventilator, and there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobilization and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs, which can potentially travel to the lungs and cause a"

   ERCP with relief of obstruction. Continues with ventilatory support for
   hypoxemic respiratory failure in setting of aspiration and vasopressor
   support for sepsis.
   1.       ID/Sepsis:  Cholangitis from biliary obstruction, resolving.
   OSH microbiology data revealed ecoli bacteremia (pansensitive).
   Hemodynamically she remains in vasodilatory septic shock requiring
   stable levophed support over last 24hours.  Her CVP is > 8, has
   maintained 40-60cc UOP and her anion gap lactic acidosis is resolving.
   Leukocytosis also improving steadily.
   - Continue unasyn;
   - CVP currently 10, UOP is maintained; less likely she would be fluid
   responsive at this time; will follow clinically today and bolus if drop
   in CVP and evidence that fluid would increase stroke volume.
   2.       Respiratory Failure/Aspiration event:  hypoxemic respiratory
   failure.  Improved PaO2 on increased PEEP. P/F ratio 225.  Tolerating
   ventilatory on ARDSnet low tidal volumes.  Secretions minimal.
   -          Wean FiO2/PEEP today as her oxygenation will tolerate
   -          ARDSnet with Vt 350
   -          Hold sedation today for daily awakening, possible SBT if she
   wakes up, though limited by hemodynamic instability for extubation
   currently.
   3.       GI: biliary obstruction from stone
 s/p ERCP with stent.
   Resolving.
   -          Follow LFTs/bilirubin
   4.       Heme: coagulapathy related to coumadin and possible early
   DIC.  INR was reversed upon admission.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: Able to wean levophed requirement to 0.03.  Leukocytosis
   trending down today to 23.1. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone
   pancreatitis s/p ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as
   pan-sensitive E. coli.  Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.  Delta down yesterday
   [**2-16**], so patient may not be fluid responsive.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300 afterward aspiration event.  Sputum culture with OP
   flora.  RSBI this AM 79.   Sedation turned off yesterday and patient
   continues to be minimally responsive.
   - Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness.
   - SBT/PS trial today
   - Decrease FiO2 as last PaO2 elevated.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP and delta down suggests that patient is not intravascular
   volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets stable this AM at 80.  Fibrinogen has been in the 339.
   D-dimer continues to be elevated in 5000s.  Smear this AM with
   occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given course, coagulopathy
   likely secondary to antibiotic administration.  Patinet restarted on
   heparin here and may have received heparin products as OSH.
   - Check heparin PF4 antibodies.
   - Trend coags
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100.
   .
   # Acidosis: Most recent pH 7.37 with resolved acidosis.  Last ABG
   7.34/32/138.
   - Recheck ABG later today if vent settings change.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 24.2 from 29.3 on admission.  Have been between
   24-26 for the past 24 hours. There may be dilutional component, and
   hemolysis labs negative
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck post-transfusion hct
   - Check haptoglobin.
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for hct<25.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is pancreatitis, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has undergone several interventions.

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with biliary sepsis due to gallstone pancreatitis. Blood cultures have identified pan-sensitive E. coli. The patient's leukocytosis is trending down, and lactate levels are within normal range. The plan is to continue administering amp/sulbactam, monitor fever curve and WBC count, wean levophed with a goal MAP >65, follow up with blood and urine cultures, and monitor UOP, MAP, CVP, and fluid responsiveness.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient aspirated during central venous line insertion after being placed in the Trendelenburg position. As a result, bilateral infiltrates were observed, and the PO2/FiO2 ratio is less than 300. Sputum culture with oral flora has been done. The patient's RSBI is 79. Sedation will be continued as needed, and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) or pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial will be attempted today. FiO2 will be decreased if last PaO2 is elevated.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis and has undergone ERCP. Transaminases are trending down, and lipase levels are within normal range. The patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: Able to wean levophed requirement to 0.03.  Leukocytosis
   trending down today to 23.1. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone
   pancreatitis s/p ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as
   pan-sensitive E. coli.  Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.  Delta down yesterday
   [**2-16**], so patient may not be fluid responsive.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300 afterward aspiration event.  Sputum culture with OP
   flora.  RSBI this AM 79.   Sedation turned off yesterday and patient
   continues to be minimally responsive.
   - Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness.
   - SBT/PS trial today
   - Decrease FiO2 as last PaO2 elevated.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP and delta down suggests that patient is not intravascular
   volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets stable this AM at 80.  Fibrinogen has been in the 339.
   D-dimer continues to be elevated in 5000s.  Smear this AM with
   occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given course, coagulopathy
   likely secondary to antibiotic administration.  Patinet restarted on
   heparin here and may have received heparin products as OSH.
   - Check heparin PF4 antibodies.
   - Trend coags
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100.
   .
   # Acidosis: Most recent pH 7.37 with resolved acidosis.  Last ABG
   7.34/32/138.
   - Recheck ABG later today if vent settings change.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 24.2 from 29.3 on admission.  Have been between
   24-26 for the past 24 hours. There may be dilutional component, and
   hemolysis labs negative
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck post-transfusion hct
   - Check haptoglobin.
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for hct<25.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.
   .
   # CAD:
   - holding ASA and lisinopril
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits
   - holding ASA
   .
   # FEN: NPO, replete lytes as necessary, IVFs
   .
   # PPX: SCDs, bowel regimen

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis,
   coagulopathy, and anemia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Levophed weaned and discontinued.  Leukocytosis trending down
   today to 23.1. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone pancreatitis s/p
   ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli.
   Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam for total of 14 days.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.  Delta down yesterday
   [**2-16**], so patient may not be fluid responsive.
   - If patient remains hemodynamically stable for 24 hours, will set goal
   balance at -1000cc and diurese as necessary tomorrow.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Sedation off since yesterday with
   some improvement in mental status.  Currently on prn sedation.
   Tolerating PS 5/5, 0.4 with Vt >500 and RR 12.  Will not plan on
   extubating today given mental status, so will continue PS for a couple
   of hours and then covert back to AC.  Patient with blood in oropharynx
   today, likely secondary to traumatic NGT placement. Will observe today
   and consult ENT as necessary if intervention warranted.
   - Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness.
   - Assess mental status
   - Consult ENT if blood in orophayrnx persists.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 24.2 from 29.3 on admission.  Have been between
   24-26 for the past 24 hours. There may be dilutional component, and
   hemolysis labs negative
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck post-transfusion hct
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis, and sepsis. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, sepsis, anemia, pancreatitis, coagulopathy, and acidosis. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics for suspected biliary sepsis caused by pan-sensitive E. coli. She has received FFP and vitamin K for an elevated INR. Her platelet count is stable at 80, and fibrinogen levels are within normal range. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is still at risk for sepsis due to the ongoing infection. Close monitoring of fever curve and white blood cell count is necessary. Blood and urine cultures should be followed up, and the patient's UOP, MAP, and CVP need to be monitored for fluid responsiveness.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has aspirated during central venous line insertion and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Extubation is planned but may be delayed due to mental status changes. Sedation will be continued, and the patient's response to sedation and mental status will be assessed. Consultation with ENT is required if blood in the oropharynx persists.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased from 29.3 on admission to 24.2. There may be a dilutional component,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: Able to wean levophed requirement to 0.03.  Leukocytosis
   trending down today to 23.1. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone
   pancreatitis s/p ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as
   pan-sensitive E. coli.  Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.  Delta down yesterday
   [**2-16**], so patient may not be fluid responsive.
   - When patient is off levophed, will set goal balance at -1000cc and
   diurese as necessary.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300 afterward aspiration event.  Sputum culture with OP
   flora.  RSBI this AM 79.   Sedation turned off yesterday and patient
   continues to be minimally responsive.
   - Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness.
   - SBT/PS trial today
   - Decrease FiO2 as last PaO2 elevated.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP and delta down suggests that patient is not intravascular
   volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets stable this AM at 80.  Fibrinogen has been in the 339.
   D-dimer continues to be elevated in 5000s.  Smear this AM with
   occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given course, coagulopathy
   likely secondary to antibiotic administration.  Patinet restarted on
   heparin here and may have received heparin products as OSH.
   - Check heparin PF4 antibodies.
   - Trend coags
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100.
   .
   # Acidosis: Most recent pH 7.37 with resolved acidosis.  Last ABG
   7.34/32/138.
   - Recheck ABG later today if vent settings change.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 24.2 from 29.3 on admission.  Have been between
   24-26 for the past 24 hours. There may be dilutional component, and
   hemolysis labs negative
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck post-transfusion hct
   - Check haptoglobin.
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for hct<25.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.
   - hold anticoagulation.

   # CAD:
   - holding ASA and lisinopril

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis,
   coagulopathy, and anemia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Levophed weaned and discontinued.  Leukocytosis trending down
   today to 23.1. Likely biliary sepsis given gall stone pancreatitis s/p
   ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli.
   Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam for total of 14 days.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.  Delta down yesterday
   [**2-16**], so patient may not be fluid responsive.
   - If patient remains hemodynamically stable for 24 hours, will set goal
   balance at -1000cc and diurese as necessary tomorrow.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Now with bilateral infiltrates
   and PO2/FiO2 <300 afterward aspiration event.  Sputum culture with OP
   flora.  RSBI this AM 79.   Sedation turned off yesterday and patient
   continues to be minimally responsive.
   - Continue prn sedation and assess for responsiveness.
   - SBT/PS trial today
   - Decrease FiO2 as last PaO2 elevated.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - PRN IVFs given probable third spacing as well as sepsis, althouch
   current CVP and delta down suggests that patient is not intravascular
   volume deplete.
   - Keep NPO
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets stable this AM at 80.  Fibrinogen has been in the 339.
   D-dimer continues to be elevated in 5000s.  Smear this AM with
   occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given course, coagulopathy
   likely secondary to antibiotic administration.  Patinet restarted on
   heparin here and may have received heparin products as OSH.
   - Check heparin PF4 antibodies.
   - Trend coags
   - Cryo if fibrinogen <100.
   .
   # Acidosis: Most recent pH 7.37 with resolved acidosis.  Last ABG
   7.34/32/138.
   - Recheck ABG later today if vent settings change.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct this AM 24.2 from 29.3 on admission.  Have been between
   24-26 for the past 24 hours. There may be dilutional component, and
   hemolysis labs negative
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC, recheck post-transfusion hct
   - Check haptoglobin.
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **], transfuse for hct<25.
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history significant for atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis, coagulopathy, and anemia. She was admitted with respiratory failure after aspirating during central venous line insertion and has been on mechanical ventilation since then. She also has anemia with a Hct of 24.2 from 29.3 on admission, pancreatitis, coagulopathy, acidosis, and a history of atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with biliary sepsis likely due to gallstone pancreatitis. She is currently being treated with antibiotics (amp/sulbactam) for a total of 14 days. Monitoring her fever curve and WBC count, as well as following up with blood and urine cultures, is important to assess the progress of sepsis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient aspirated during CVL insertion and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She is tolerating pressures of 5 cm H2O and tidal volumes greater than 500 mL, with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. However, mental status is still a concern, so extubation is not planned for today.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased from 29.3 on admission to 24.2 this morning. There may be a dil"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on coumadin with
   gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis, coagulopathy, and
   anemia.
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Sedation reduced over past [**12-16**]
   days with improvement in mental status.  Currently on prn sedation.
   Concern for flash pulmonary edema overnight after 250ml bolus given
   possible given that patient has been hypertensive (increased afterload)
   and chest radiograph consistent with fluid overload. Given 1 dose of
   furosemide 10mg IV x1 with good diuresis. Patient with blood in
   oropharynx today, likely secondary to traumatic NGT placement. Will
   observe today and consult ENT as necessary if intervention warranted.
   - Gently diurese for net negative goal of -500cc. Consider additional 1
   dose of furosemide today.
   - If unable to wean off of ventilator today, consider increasing
   sedation to increase comfort
 hypertensive and tachycardic overnight
   likely secondary to discomfort on ventilator.
   - Assess mental status
   - Consult ENT if blood in orophayrnx persists.
   # Sepsis: Levophed weaned and discontinued.  Leukocytosis trending down
   today to 18.2. Likely biliary sepsis given gallstone pancreatitis s/p
   ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as pan-sensitive E. coli.
   Lactate 1.7.
   - Continue Augmentin for total of 14 days
 antibiotic start date [**9-26**]
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor [**Month/Year (2) **], MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.
   # Anemia: Hct stable around 27.
   - Continue to monitor.
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - Start TF today.
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets slowly falling. Previous fibrinogen 339, D-dimer in 5000s,
   and recent smear with occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given
   course, coagulopathy likely secondary to antibiotic administration and
   acute stress. Coags currently within normal range.
   # Acidosis: Resolved.  Last ABG 7.34/32/138.
   # Afib: On coumadin as outpatient.

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, who presented with gallstone pancreatitis. She has since developed sepsis, coagulopathy, and anemia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient aspirated during central venous line insertion while being placed in the Trendelenburg position. She is currently extubated but requires close monitoring.

2. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis trending down and is likely experiencing biliary sepsis due to gallstone pancreatitis. Blood cultures have identified pan-sensitive E. coli, and she is being treated with Augmentin for a total of 14 days. Regular monitoring of fever curve and WBC is necessary.

3. Atrial fibrillation (a-fib): The patient had a-fib with rapid ventricular response after aggressive diuresis. She was given diltiazem and a 250cc bolus, which helped in controlling the heart rate. She was also on levophed for a few minutes and reverted back to sinus rhythm. Metoprolol is being continued at a low dose, and anticoagulation is being held.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is stable around 28.8%. Close monitoring is required, but no specific interventions are mentioned at this time.

5. Pancreatitis: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on coumadin with
   gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis, coagulopathy, and
   anemia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Pt has been off sedation with
   fentanyl bolus with improvement of mental status.  Currently on prn
   sedation. Pt was diuresed and negative 1.9L yesterday.  Pt did have
   a-fib w/ RVR yesterday after aggressive diuresis.  No new blood in
   oropharynx.
   - will attempt to extubate this AM
   - cont gently diurese for net negative goal of -500cc.
   - Assess mental status, improving
   .
   # Sepsis: Off pressors, Levophed weaned and discontinued.  Afebrile.
   Leukocytosis trending down today to 14.2. Likely biliary sepsis given
   gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP with blood cultures at OSH speciated as
   pan-sensitive E. coli.  Pt sputum grew rare GNR.
   - Continue Augmentin for total of 14 days
 antibiotic start date [**9-26**]
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u blood and urine cultures.
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP and bolus as necessary.
   .
   #A-fib: Pt with a-fib w/ RVR yesterday after aggressive diuresis.  Pt
   given diltiazem and 250cc and pressures dropped, was on levophed for
   several minutes and pt reverted back to sinus.  Started on low dose
   metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].  Will hold on restarting anti-coagulation and
   discuss with patient and PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] at high risk given co-morbities, but
   patient high risk for fall given age and mental status.
   - cont metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold anticoagulation, pt on ASA
   - consider amio if pt has a-fib w/ RVR and pressures cont to be low.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable around 28.8.
   - Continue to monitor.
    .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP.
   Transaminases trending down and lipase WNL.
   - Started TF yesterday.
   - can restart diet if extubated, given pt is able to swollow
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin on admission. She
   has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission for INR >5.
   Platelets slowly falling. Previous fibrinogen 339, D-dimer in 5000s,
   and recent smear with occasional schistocytes. Unlikely to be DIC given
   course, coagulopathy likely secondary to antibiotic administration and
   acute stress. Coags currently within normal range.
    .
   # CAD:
   - holding lisinopril
   - Cont ASA
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits
   - Cont ASA
   .
   # FEN: TF, replete lytes as necessary
   - if extubated need to assess aspiration risk

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history significant for atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis, coagulopathy, and anemia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, sepsis, a-fib, anemia, pancreatitis, coagulopathy, CAD, history of CVA, fluid/electrolyte imbalance, pressure ulcers, and central venous access.

The patient's recent events include being placed in the Trendelenburg position after CVL insertion and experiencing respiratory failure. She was given diuretics and developed a-fib with rapid ventricular response. The patient's mental status improved after fentanyl bolus. She is currently on prn sedation and is expected to undergo extubation this morning.

The patient also has sepsis, which was likely biliary sepsis given her gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP. Blood cultures at OSH were specified as pan-sensitive E. coli. The patient's leukocytosis is trending down today. She is being treated with Augmentin for a total of 14 days. Blood and urine cultures will be monitored, and the patient will continue to be monitored for fever curve and WBC.

The patient's a-fib was managed with diltiazem and metoprolol. Anticoagulation was held due to the patient's high risk for bleeding, especially with mental status changes."

","The patient is a 93-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypotension and urosepsis. She has been admitted to the ICU due to biliary sepsis and subsequently developed an aspiration event requiring intubation. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate ranging from 78 to 129 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 112/68 to 151/85 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 14 to 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. 

Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg, fluid balance with an input of 960 mL and output of 2,865 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,905 mL. 

The patient's respiratory support includes being on an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation, set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 0 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 55, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio"

","Summary:
The patient is a 93-year-old female who was admitted with biliary sepsis and subsequently developed aspiration pneumonia requiring intubation. She has been experiencing respiratory failure, and yesterday she failed a spontaneous breathing trial due to pulmonary edema. However, she has been diuresed and is currently on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her mental status has improved, and she is following commands. The patient also has an infection with E. coli bacteremia, which is being treated with a two-week course of augmentin for the biliary source. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and was in rate-controlled ventricular response (RVR) yesterday but is now back in sinus rhythm (SR) after receiving diltiazem. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, and there is no abdominal pain. The patient's blood pressure is currently 151/85 mmHg, heart rate is 83 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on CPAP. She has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg, and her fluid balance since 12 AM is negative 1.905 liters.

","Summary:
The patient is a 93-year-old female admitted with biliary sepsis and subsequent aspiration event requiring intubation. She is currently in the ICU and experiencing hypotension and urosepsis. The patient has had several medical events, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, transient hypotension, and hypoxemia. She has been treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but she still shows signs of respiratory failure. The patient's laboratory results indicate some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing hypoxemia despite diuresis. There is a concern for secretions, although her mental status has improved. Further efforts to wean her off the ventilator through a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) should be considered.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient has biliary sepsis caused by E. coli bacteremia. A two-week course of augmentin is planned to target the biliary source of infection. Close monitoring of her hemodynamic stability is necessary.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response yesterday but is now in normal sinus rhythm after being treated with diltiazem. She should continue to be monitored for any cardiac arrhythmias, and Lopressor should"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis, and other comorbidities. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's recent events include aspiration during central venous line insertion, extubation complicated by pulmonary edema and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and ongoing sepsis with blood and sputum cultures sent. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/81 to 155/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and a sinus rhythm heart rhythm. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.2 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine levels, low potassium levels, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Blood cultures have grown pan-sensitive E. coli. 

The patient is currently being treated with Augmentin for sepsis, metoprolol for atrial fibrillation, and furosemide for fluid management. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to continued dependence on mechanical ventilation, sepsis secondary to biliary origin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. On admission, vital signs included a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 148/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on room air, and a temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius. The patient was started on IV fluids and antibiotics.

Over the course of the 24 hours, the patient's temperature continued to be elevated, reaching a peak of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit. Blood cultures were drawn, and sputum culture was sent. The patient received 10 mg of Lasix at noon but was held back from aggressive diuresis due to the fever. The patient was given heparin sodium for prophylaxis and fentanyl for pain management. 

On the flow sheet, the patient's weight increased from 51 kg to 60 kg, possibly due to fluid resuscitation. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate remained stable within normal limits. The respiratory support mode was changed to CPAP/PSV with a tidal volume of 556 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.

","Summary:
Mrs. [Known Lastname 1717], a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis, is currently admitted to the ICU. She has been experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration during central venous line insertion, sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, anemia, pancreatitis, coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia, coronary artery disease, history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and fluid/electrolyte imbalance. The patient has undergone an ERCP procedure and has received treatment with Augmentin for a total of 14 days. She is currently on prn sedation and being weaned off ventilatory support. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubate the patient if tolerated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of aspiration and pulmonary edema indicate a risk for further respiratory complications.
2. Sepsis: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient's ongoing fever and leukocytosis suggest a potential for ongoing infection and sepsis.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib/RVR): The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with RVR may persist or recur, requiring close monitoring and management.
4. Anemia: The patient's stable Hct level of 27"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis, and sepsis. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure after aspirating during central venous line insertion. The patient was extubated but developed pulmonary edema and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She is currently on prn sedation and her mental status has improved. The patient's blood and sputum cultures were sent due to fever, and she is likely experiencing biliary sepsis given her gallstone pancreatitis. She is being treated with Augmentin for a total of 14 days. 

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which she is being treated with metoprolol. Anticoagulation is being deferred to outpatient due to a supratherapeutic INR. 

The patient has anemia, pancreatitis, coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia, coronary artery disease, and a history of cerebrovascular accident without residual deficits. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure due to aspiration during CVL insertion. If not closely monitored, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of biliary sepsis, and if not properly managed, can lead to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. She has been admitted to the ICU for gallstone pancreatitis, biliary sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and was successfully extubated yesterday. However, she had increasing secretions and difficulty clearing her airway, which led to temporary increased oxygen requirement but resolved with suctioning. 

The patient is currently stable, but she has been made NPO due to the risk of aspiration. She has been converted to IV medications, and her antibiotics have been changed to amp/sulbactam. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 134/66 mmHg, heart rate of 59 bpm, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal limits. Her respiratory support consists of a nasal cannula with FiO2 set at 70%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Her liver enzymes are within normal limits, but her serum amylase and lipase levels are elevated. The microbiology results indicate no growth in the urine culture and yeast in the sputum. 

The patient's plan includes weaning off supplemental oxygen, monitoring for sepsis by observing fever curve and WBC count, and assessing urine output, mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history significant for atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient was extubated yesterday after experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration during central venous line insertion. She had increased secretions and difficulty clearing her airway temporarily, but has been stable overnight.

The patient's sepsis is currently being treated with antibiotics, specifically amp/sulbactam. Her white blood cell count has resolved, and she is being monitored for fever, urine output, mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), mental status, and fluid requirements.

The patient developed RVR in the setting of aggressive diuresis and was given diltiazem, which led to transient hypotension requiring brief periods of levophed. She has since been started on metoprolol 12.5 mg orally twice a day, converted to IV yesterday. Anticoagulation has been deferred due to a supratherapeutic INR on presentation and will be restarted on an outpatient basis.

The patient has anemia with a hematocrit level of 27.2%. She has received one unit of packed red blood cells during admission. Her platelet count is stable at 73, up from 65 yesterday. Her coagulation profile is being monitored, and she received"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who was admitted with gallstone pancreatitis, biliary sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient underwent an ERCP and was successfully extubated yesterday. She is currently on NPO status due to the risk of aspiration and has been converted to IV medications. The patient's respiratory status has been stable overnight, but she had increased secretions and difficulty clearing her airway yesterday afternoon. Her blood cultures are negative for growth, and she has shown improvement in her sepsis with a resolution of leukocytosis. The patient developed RVR in the setting of aggressive diuresis but was broken with diltiazem. She has a history of congestive heart failure, hypertension, and a previous cerebrovascular accident without residual deficits. Her HCT is stable at 27.2%. There is concern for deep vein thrombosis in her left upper extremity, and she will undergo an ultrasound to rule out DVT. The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia are being closely monitored, and she will receive ASA for her history of CAD and CVA. She is also receiving PPI prophylaxis and heparin for DVT prophylaxis."

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis and afib
   with RVR now extubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Was succesfully extubated
   yesterday. Yesterday afternoon had increasing secretions and difficulty
   clearing airway with temporary increase in oxygen requirement that
   resolved with suctioning.  Has been stable from respiratory standpoint
   overnight.  Was made NPO for concern of aspiration risk and converted
   to IV meds.
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated.
   - Gentle diuresis with 10 mg IV lasix with net TBB -500cc.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient afebrile and hemodynamically stable over past 24
   hours. Leukocytosis now resolved.  Converted to amp/sulbactam yesterday
   as patient made NPO and NGT removed post-extubation.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam or amox/clav ([**6-27**]) depending on ability to
   tolerate PO.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # A-fib: Developed RVR in setting of aggressive diuresis broken with
   diltiazem complicated by transient hypotension requiring brief period
   of levophed.  Has since been started on metoprolol 12.5 po bid
   converted to iv yesterday. Anticoagulation not yet restarted given
   supratherapeutic INR on presnetation and will be deferred to
   outpatient.
   - Continue metoprolol. Was coverted to IV yesterday as patient NPO, but
   will switch back if tolerating PO today.
   - hold anticoagulation, continue ASA
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable 27.2.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<25. Has received 1u PRBC during
   admission.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who presented with gallstone pancreatitis, biliary sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient underwent an ERCP for the pancreatitis and was successfully extubated yesterday after experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration during central venous line insertion. The patient is currently extubated and has been stable overnight. She has increased secretions and difficulty clearing her airway, so she has been made NPO and converted to IV medications. Her vital signs are stable, and she has shown improvement in her respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had respiratory failure due to aspiration, which led to her being placed on mechanical ventilation. Although she was successfully extubated, there is a risk of recurring respiratory failure if she aspirates again or if her respiratory function deteriorates.

2. Sepsis: The patient presented with biliary sepsis, which has improved but requires close monitoring. The patient's leukocytosis has resolved, and she is currently on antibiotics. There is a risk of sepsis recurrence if the infection spreads or if the antibiotics are not effective.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and developed RVR during aggressive diuresis. She was given diltiazem, but it caused transient hypotension. She is now on met"

   - will hold on lasix for now given hypernatermia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient afebrile and hemodynamically stable over past 24
   hours. Leukocytosis now resolved.  Converted to amp/sulbactam as
   patient made NPO and NGT removed post-extubation.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam IV  ([**7-28**]) due to inability to tolerate PO.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits on history.  Fmaily concerned
   yesterday that pt was not using left hand.  Pt was examined yesterday
   and today and pt has no obvious deficits.  Pt is using her left hand
   and there was no neglect on left side.
   - cont to monitor and image if symtpoms appear
   - Cont ASA
   .
   #Hypernatermia: Pt w/ sodium 148.  Free water deficit is 1.5L.  Will
   get S&S  and if patient passes will replete via po intake.  If patient
   does not pass will give through IVF.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, gallstone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, respiratory failure, sepsis, history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) without residual deficits, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, anemia, left upper extremity swelling, hypertension, pancreatitis, coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia, coronary artery disease (CAD), feeding tube (FEN), prophylactic medications (PPX), and vascular access. The patient was admitted with gallstone pancreatitis and developed sepsis, respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation with RVR. She underwent an ERCP procedure and was extubated successfully. The patient is currently stable hemodynamically but has several ongoing issues that need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure due to aspiration in the setting of central venous line insertion. She was successfully extubated but had increasing secretions and difficulty clearing her airway. She is currently being weaned off supplemental oxygen and is expected to continue improving.

2. Sepsis: The patient had sepsis, which is now resolved. However, she remains on IV antibiotics due to the inability to tolerate oral medications. Her fever curve and white blood cell count will be monitored, and she will continue to"

   after being placed in tren position.  Was succesfully extubated [**10-1**].
   Pt with increasing secretions and difficulty clearing airway with
   temporary increase in oxygen requirement that resolved with
   suctioning.  Was made NPO for concern of aspiration risk and converted
   to IV meds. Pt was negative -725cc.
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated.
   - Gentle diuresis with 10 mg IV lasix with net TBB -500cc.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient afebrile and hemodynamically stable over past 24
   hours. Leukocytosis now resolved.  Converted to amp/sulbactam as
   patient made NPO and NGT removed post-extubation.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam IV  ([**7-28**]) due to inability to tolerate PO.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits on history.  Fmaily concerned
   yesterday that pt was not using left hand.  Pt was examined yesterday
   and today and pt has no obvious deficits.  Pt is using her left hand
   and there was no neglect on left side.

   # A-fib: Developed RVR in setting of aggressive diuresis broken with
   diltiazem complicated by transient hypotension requiring brief period
   of levophed.  Has since been started on metoprolol 12.5 po bid
   converted to iv due to aspiration. Anticoagulation not yet restarted
   given supratherapeutic INR on presnetation and will be deferred to
   outpatient.
   - Continue metoprolol. Was coverted to IV as patient NPO
   - hold anticoagulation, continue ASA

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1717**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH significant for afib on
   coumadin with gall stone pancreatitis complicated by sepsis and afib
   with RVR now extubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient aspirated in setting of CVL insertion
   after being placed in tren position.  Was succesfully extubated [**10-1**].
   Pt with increasing secretions and difficulty clearing airway with
   temporary increase in oxygen requirement that resolved with
   suctioning.  Was made NPO for concern of aspiration risk and converted
   to IV meds. Pt was negative -725cc.
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated.
   - Gentle diuresis with 10 mg IV lasix with net TBB -500cc.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient afebrile and hemodynamically stable over past 24
   hours. Leukocytosis now resolved.  Converted to amp/sulbactam as
   patient made NPO and NGT removed post-extubation.
   - Continue amp/sulbactam IV  ([**7-28**]) due to inability to tolerate PO.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC
   - Monitor UOP, MAP, CVP, mentation and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # A-fib: Developed RVR in setting of aggressive diuresis broken with
   diltiazem complicated by transient hypotension requiring brief period
   of levophed.  Has since been started on metoprolol 12.5 po bid
   converted to iv due to aspiration. Anticoagulation not yet restarted
   given supratherapeutic INR on presnetation and will be deferred to
   outpatient.
   - Continue metoprolol. Was coverted to IV as patient NPO
   - hold anticoagulation, continue ASA
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable 26.6.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<25. Has received 1u PRBC during
   admission.
   .
   # LUE Swelling: No evidence of DVT on U/S. Unlikely to be cellulitlis
   as hand without erythema.
   -cont to monitor
   .
   # HTN: BP overnight normal to elevated.
   - Restart lisinopril 5 mg daily today.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with gallstone pancreatitis s/p successful
   ERCP.
   - Clears - ADAT.
   .
   # Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: Patient anticoagulated with coumadin
   on admission. She has received FFP and vitamin K on initial admission
   for INR >5. Platelets currently stable at 106.
   - Trend coags, CBC
   .
   # CAD:
   - Cont ASA
   .
   # Hx of CVA: no residual deficits
   - Cont ASA

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who was admitted with gallstone pancreatitis and subsequently developed sepsis and respiratory failure. She underwent an ERCP procedure for her pancreatitis and has been extubated. The patient is currently receiving IV antibiotics, beta-blocker, and diuretic therapy. She has shown improvement in her vital signs and respiratory status, but still requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient previously experienced respiratory failure due to aspiration during central venous line insertion. She was successfully extubated but still has an increased risk of aspiration, especially while being kept NPO. Close monitoring of her airway and respiratory effort is necessary.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently afebrile and hemodynamically stable, there is still a risk of recurrent sepsis due to her underlying condition and immunocompromised state. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, white blood cell count, and fluid balance is essential.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed rapid ventricular response in the setting of aggressive diuresis and required treatment with diltiazem. She has since been started on metoprolol, and anticoagulation has been deferred until outpatient management. Monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is crucial.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is stable at 26.6%. Close"
