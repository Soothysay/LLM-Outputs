   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 81 year old male s/p hemorrhagic stroke now with pneumonia, fever,
   hypoxia.
   1. Pneumonia: Retrocardiac opacity--HAP vs. VAP vs. aspiration. Cover
   for VAP for now given the progression of his opacity after
   extubation--vancomycin/Zosyn/Cipro for now.
   - Last sputum ([**9-6**]) with 4+ GNR and 2+ GPC, will repeat and follow
   cultures.
   - Has blood cultures pending
   - Continue respiratory support.
   - Tolerating CPAP currently, but low threshold for intubation given the
   underlying insult is pneumonia and not likely to be easily reversible.
   Family agrees to repeat intubation if necessary.
   - Suctioning/chest PT as tolerated
   - Follow ABG.
   - Currently, BP stable and not tachycardic (on beta blocker).
   - Follow UOP and bolus fluid as needed.
   2. Hemorrhagic CVA: per neuro step-down team, concern for worsening
   neurologic status over last 24 hours--but ? toxic-metabolic in the
   setting of worsening infection. On current exam, not awaking to name or
   following commands, but is moving right limbs. Pupils are equal and
   reactive. [**Month (only) 60**] require repeat CT head--hold off for now.  BP control
   with metoprolol, currently SBP 140s.
   3. ECG changes with recurrent hypoxia: Hypoxia much more likely related
   to pulmonary disease, however, ischemia is possible given change in
   axis and R-wave progression.
   - CEs negative
   - may require echocardiogram if does not improve with above pulmonary
   interventions. Continue beta blocker, statin.
   4. Psych: continue donepezil, lexapro. hold clonazepam given worsening
   mental status.
   5. Thrombocytopenia: improving, even though on heparin.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male who has had a hemorrhagic stroke and is now experiencing pneumonia, fever, and hypoxia. The patient's medical history includes a hemorrhagic CVA, ECG changes with recurrent hypoxia, and psych issues. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include worsening pneumonia, worsening neurologic status due to the hemorrhagic CVA, cardiac ischemia, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

The patient's pneumonia appears to be worsening, as indicated by the increasing opacity on the chest X-ray. The presence of fever and hypoxia suggests a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The neurologic status of the patient is also concerning, as there is a worsening neurologic status reported over the last 24 hours. The patient is not awakening to name or following commands, but is moving right limbs. This could indicate a possible worsening of the hemorrhagic CVA or potentially toxic-metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of worsening infection. 

ECG changes with recurrent hypoxia raise concerns for possible cardiac ischemia. The patient's ECG shows changes such as a change in axis and R-wave progression. 

Lastly, the patient has thrombocytopenia, which is improving even though the patient is on heparin. This could indicate a potential risk for DVT, and prophyl"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hemorrhagic stroke, now presenting with pneumonia, fever, and hypoxia. He is currently in the ICU and requires respiratory support. The patient has a worsening neurologic status, with concerns about toxic-metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of worsening infection. There are ECG changes indicating possible ischemia. The patient also has thrombocytopenia and a pulsatile mass on the head at the site of a CSF shunt. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has retrocardiac opacity, suggesting pneumonia. This condition can worsen and lead to sepsis or respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Worsening Neurologic Status: The patient's neurologic status is deteriorating, which could be due to the underlying hemorrhagic stroke, toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, or a new brain insult. This requires close monitoring, and further imaging or interventions may be necessary.
3. Ischemia: The ECG changes suggest possible ischemia, which could be related to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease or as a result of hypoxia due to pneumonia.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which can increase the risk of bleeding, especially if the platelet count continues to decline.
5. Pulsatile Mass on Head: The presence of a pulsatile mass at the"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 81 year old male s/p hemorrhagic stroke now with pneumonia, fever,
   hypoxia.
   1. Pneumonia: Retrocardiac opacity--HAP vs. VAP vs. aspiration. Cover
   for VAP for now given the progression of his opacity after
   extubation--vancomycin/Zosyn/Cipro for now.
   - Last sputum ([**9-6**]) with 4+ GNR and 2+ GPC, will repeat and follow
   cultures.
   - Has blood cultures pending
   - Continue respiratory support. Alternate CPAP with mask
   - Tolerating CPAP currently, but low threshold for intubation given the
   underlying insult is pneumonia and not likely to be easily reversible.
   Family agrees to repeat intubation if necessary.
   - Suctioning/chest PT as tolerated
   - Follow ABG.
   - Currently, BP stable and not tachycardic (on beta blocker).
   - Follow UOP and bolus fluid as needed.
   2. Hemorrhagic CVA: per neuro step-down team, concern for worsening
   neurologic status over last 24 hours--but ? toxic-metabolic in the
   setting of worsening infection. On current exam, not awaking to name or
   following commands, but is moving right limbs. Pupils are equal and
   reactive. [**Month (only) 60**] require repeat CT head--hold off for now.  BP control
   with metoprolol, currently SBP 140s.
   3. ECG changes with recurrent hypoxia: Hypoxia much more likely related
   to pulmonary disease, however, ischemia is possible given change in
   axis and R-wave progression.
   - CEs negative
   - may require echocardiogram if does not improve with above pulmonary
   interventions. Continue beta blocker, statin.
   4. Psych: continue donepezil, lexapro. hold clonazepam given worsening
   mental status.
   5. Thrombocytopenia: improving, even though on heparin.
   6. Pulastile mass on the head at the site of CSF shunt:
   - Neurosurgery following. Will image brain and consider accessing site
   and culturing.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hemorrhagic stroke who is now presenting with pneumonia, fever, and hypoxia. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on respiratory support, alternating between CPAP and a shovel mask with FiO2 60%. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 153/63 mmHg and a heart rate of 66 bpm. His oxygen saturation is 97% on the shovel mask. The patient has not been assessed for peripheral vascular status, skin, neurologic function, or tone. 

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 6.8, Hct of 39.4, Plt of 119,000/mm3, and a troponin T level of 0.01. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 129 and 154 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated CK and CKMB levels, prolonged PT/PTT/INR, and low potassium and magnesium levels.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is being treated for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with antibiotics including vancomycin, Zosyn, and Cipro. The family has agreed to repeat intubation if necessary. The patient will continue with respiratory support and suctioning as tolerated. ABG results are being monitored, and fluid balance is being followed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with ongoing concerns and complications. The patient's head CT shows no significant interval change, indicating no new or worsening neurological issues.

The patient has restarted tube feeds at half rate, which suggests that they may have been previously on tube feeding but at a reduced amount due to their condition. There is also a concern for drying of secretions, and the patient was given 500 mL of normal saline (NS) as a bolus to address this.

The patient's respiratory status has been concerning, with episodes of tachypnea and decreased responsiveness. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show some fluctuations in oxygen levels and pH, indicating potential respiratory distress or compensation.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 153/63 mmHg, heart rate of 66 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated blood glucose levels. The electrolytes are within normal ranges, except for a slightly low potassium level.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with alternating BIPAP and a shovel mask with FiO2 set at 60%. This indicates that the patient requires respiratory support to maintain adequate oxygenation.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 81 year old male s/p hemorrhagic stroke now with pneumonia, fever,
   hypoxia.
   1. Pneumonia: Retrocardiac opacity--HAP vs. VAP vs. aspiration. Cover
   for VAP for now given the progression of his opacity after extubation.
   Likely has recurrent aspiration with poor cough response [**2-23**] CVA.
   - D/C
d Vanc and Zosyn. Cte Cipro for Serratia positive sputum.
   - Has blood cultures pending
   - Continue respiratory support.  Will try to wean off CPAP today.
   - Tolerating CPAP currently, but low threshold for intubation given the
   underlying insult is pneumonia and not likely to be easily reversible.
   Family agrees to repeat intubation if necessary. Will have family
   meeting today to further discuss their options for his care.
   - Suctioning/chest PT as tolerated
   - Follow ABG.
   - Currently, BP stable and not tachycardic (on beta blocker).
   - Follow UOP and bolus fluid as needed.
   2. Hemorrhagic CVA: per neuro step-down team, concern for worsening
   neurologic status over last 24 hours--but ? toxic-metabolic in the
   setting of worsening infection. On current exam, not awaking to name or
   following commands, but is moving right limbs. Pupils are equal and
   reactive. [**Month (only) 60**] require repeat CT head--hold off for now.  BP control
   with metoprolol, currently SBP 140s.
   3. ECG changes with recurrent hypoxia: Hypoxia much more likely related
   to pulmonary disease, however, ischemia is possible given change in
   axis and R-wave progression.
   - CEs negative
   - may require echocardiogram if does not improve with above pulmonary
   interventions. Continue beta blocker, statin.
   4. Psych: continue donepezil, lexapro. hold clonazepam given worsening
   mental status.
   5. Thrombocytopenia: improving, even though on heparin.
   6. Pulastile mass on the head at the site of CSF shunt:
   - Neurosurgery following. Will image brain and consider accessing site
   and culturing.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male who has undergone a hemorrhagic stroke and now presents with pneumonia, fever, and hypoxia. The pneumonia appears to be either hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a history of recurrent aspiration due to poor cough response following his cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Blood cultures are pending.

The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing tachypnea and desaturation episodes. He requires respiratory support with CPAP and has shown improvement in tolerating it. However, there is a low threshold for intubation given the underlying insult of pneumonia. The family is aware of this possibility and agrees to repeat intubation if necessary.

The patient's neurologic status has worsened over the past 24 hours, but this could be due to toxic-metabolic factors in the setting of worsening infection. His pupils are equal and reactive, and he is moving his right limbs. A repeat CT head is required, but for now, it will be held off.

There are ECG changes with recurrent hypoxia, which could be related to pulmonary disease or ischemia. An echocardiogram may be necessary if the patient does not improve with pulmonary interventions. The patient is on beta-blockers and statins.

Psychiatrically, the patient is showing worsening mental status, so clonazepam has been held. Done"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male who had a hemorrhagic stroke and is now presenting with pneumonia, fever, and hypoxia. He has a history of recurrent aspiration due to poor cough response secondary to a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient's condition has been unstable, and he requires respiratory support. There have been attempts to wean him off CPAP, but he remains dependent on it. The family is aware of the possibility of re-intubation if necessary.

Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient likely has pneumonia, which is causing his fever and hypoxia. The opacity seen on imaging is consistent with this diagnosis. The patient has been started on antibiotics to cover for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), given the progression of his symptoms after extubation.

2. Hemorrhagic CVA: The patient's neurologic status has worsened over the past 24 hours, raising concerns for a worsening hemorrhagic stroke. However, it is also possible that the worsening neurologic status is due to toxic-metabolic causes in the setting of worsening infection. Repeat imaging, such as a CT head, is recommended to assess for any changes in the size or location of the hemorrhage. Blood pressure control is crucial in managing this condition.

3. ECG changes: The patient's ECG has shown changes consistent with ischemia, although hypoxia related to pulmonary disease is a more likely explanation."

   - Follow UOP and bolus fluid as needed.
   2. Hemorrhagic CVA: per neuro step-down team, concern for worsening
   neurologic status over last 24 hours--but ? toxic-metabolic in the
   setting of worsening infection. On current exam, not awaking to name or
   following commands, but is moving right limbs. Pupils are equal and
   reactive. [**Month (only) 60**] require repeat CT head--hold off for now.  BP control

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hemorrhagic stroke, now presenting with pneumonia, fever, and hypoxia. He has been intubated and is currently on CPAP support. The family has agreed to repeat intubation if necessary. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he has growth of GNR and yeast in sputum. He is being treated for suspected VAP. His vital signs are generally stable, but there are concerns about worsening neurologic status, ECG changes, thrombocytopenia, and a palpable mass on the head at the site of a CSF shunt.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient already has pneumonia, which is a serious infection of the lungs. It can lead to respiratory failure if not properly treated.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This is a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are on ventilators.
3. Worsening neurologic status: The patient's neurologic condition seems to be deteriorating, which can indicate a potential complication such as a stroke or increased intracranial pressure.
4. ECG changes: The patient's ECG shows changes that may suggest ischemia or other cardiac issues. This requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.

","The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs have been unstable, with fluctuations in blood pressure. The patient has been on bipap support but is unable to wean off due to thick secretions and weak cough reflex. There have been episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and the patient's magnesium level was repleted.

The patient's sputum culture revealed growth of gram-negative rods and yeast, with sensitivities pending. The patient has no known drug allergies. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory symptoms.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 0 mL of fluids since 12 AM. The respiratory support includes ABG values of pH 7.49, PCO2 44 mmHg, and PO2 86 mmHg. The patient's peripheral pulses and skin were not assessed, and the neurologic examination was also not performed.

The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, and troponin-T levels. The creatinine level is within normal range. The electrolyte levels are within normal limits except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a respiratory alkalosis.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 81-year-old male who has undergone a hemorrhagic stroke and now presents with pneumonia, fever, and hypoxia.
- He has a history of a hemorrhagic CVA (cerebrovascular accident) and is showing improvement in awareness, speaking, and responding to questions.
- The patient's ECG changes with recurrent hypoxia could be related to pulmonary disease or ischemia.
- He is experiencing agitation but responds well to low-dose olanzapine.
- The patient had thrombocytopenia, which has since resolved.
- There is a pulsatile mass on the head at the site of CSF shunt, and neurosurgery has been scheduled.
- The patient is on prophylactic medications including PPI (proton pump inhibitor) and heparin.
- He has a 20g access line in place.
- The family agrees to repeat intubation if necessary and will have a family meeting today to discuss options for his care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. He is already on antibiotics for Serratia-positive sputum. Close monitoring of vital signs, respiratory status, and response to antibiotics is necessary. Complications such as sepsis or worsening respiratory failure may occur if the infection spreads or progresses.

2. Hemorrhagic CVA: Although the patient's level of awareness, speaking, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male admitted to the ICU for a hemorrhagic stroke with likely aspiration pneumonia. He has been experiencing increased respiratory effort and fever, which has resolved. The patient has been on various antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and zosyn, due to a Serratia positive sputum culture. Blood cultures are pending. The patient continues to require respiratory support, and the family has agreed to continue full code status. There is a planned EEG today, and a discussion regarding the patient's prognosis and the family's wishes is needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia is likely caused by Serratia bacteria. If not properly treated, this infection can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially spread to other parts of the body.
2. Hemorrhagic CVA: The patient's prognosis for the hemorrhagic stroke is unclear. This condition can result in neurological deficits and may require further interventions.
3. Psychiatric Issues: The patient is experiencing agitation and has been prescribed Donepezil, escitalopram, and Zyprexa. Poor management of these psychiatric issues can lead to increased agitation and potential self-harm or harm to others.
4. Pulastile Mass: A mass has been identified on the patient's head at the site of a CSF shunt. If this mass grows or causes complications, it may require neurosurgical intervention.
5. ECG Changes: Although the ECG changes have resolved, they initially indicated potential cardiac issues. Ongoing monitoring is necessary to ensure no recurrence of these changes.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been low, increasing the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are essential to maintain adequate platelet levels.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylactic medications such as a PPI, heparin, and insulin to prevent stress ulcers, blood clots, and hyperglycemia, respectively. Discontinuation of these medications may increase the risk of associated complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a hemorrhagic stroke with likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation (Nasal BiPAP) and has shown fever, increased respiratory effort, and agitation. Blood cultures are pending. The patient's family is considering a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient's code status is currently full code, pending family decision. The patient has been on Donepezil, escitalopram, and Zyprexa for psychiatric issues and has shown improvement with low-dose olanzapine. There is a pulsatile mass on the patient's head at the site of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt, but neurosurgery does not anticipate intervention. ECG changes have resolved, and thrombocytopenia has also resolved. The patient is receiving prophylactic proton pump inhibitor (PPI), heparin, and is replete with fiber tube feeds. There are no plans for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke and likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fever resolved and continued increased respiratory effort. The patient requires nasal bipap, but oxygen saturation remains in the 70s without it. The family has discussed the possibility of a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement, but a final decision has not been made. The patient's neurologic recommendations are still pending, and an EEG from yesterday is still awaiting review. Access for medication administration has been an issue, with only a single peripheral IV line available. A new right upper lobe infiltrate was noted on today's chest X-ray, and the white blood cell count is slowly rising. It is being considered whether to restart antibiotics other than ciprofloxacin. At noon, the patient experienced difficulty breathing due to upper airway inflammation and secretions, requiring intubation. The patient has no known drug allergies. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient likely has aspiration pneumonia secondary to a hemorrhagic stroke. This condition may worsen if proper airway management is not maintained.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation remains low even with nasal bipap, indicating potential respiratory failure. Continued respiratory support and possible intubation may be necessary.
3. Infection: The new right upper"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male who has experienced a hemorrhagic stroke and likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes fever (resolved), increased respiratory effort, and the need for respiratory support. The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and a new right upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. There are also concerns about thrombocytopenia, potential neurological complications, and the need for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, infection (due to aspiration pneumonia and new infiltrate), sepsis, further neurological decline, and possible bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia. It is important to monitor the patient closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these complications and improve the patient's overall condition."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 81-year-old male who has had a hemorrhagic stroke and likely aspiration pneumonia. The pneumonia is positive for Serratia and the patient was previously on Vanc and Zosyn but these medications were discontinued on 9/9. Cipro has been continued for the Serratia positive sputum culture from 9/6. The patient also has H. flu and yeast in the sputum from 9/7. Blood cultures are pending.
- The patient requires respiratory support and is currently full code pending a family decision. The family is discussing the possibility of tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for feeding.
- The patient's mental state includes being agitated, but is responding well to PRN low dose olanzapine.
- There is a pulsatile mass on the patient's head at the site of CSF shunt, but neurosurgery does not anticipate the need for intervention.
- The patient had ECG changes that have resolved, and CEs are negative. Beta blockers and statins should be continued.
- The patient previously had thrombocytopenia but it has resolved.
- Prophylactic measures include a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and heparin.
- The patient's feeding status is uncertain, as there is repletion with fiber tube feeds but"

","The patient is an 81-year-old male who is currently in the ICU for a hemorrhagic stroke and likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient's recent medical history includes a fever that has resolved, increased respiratory effort, and positive Serratia in sputum culture. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 100.0 rectal, heart rate of 78, blood pressure of 135/77, respiratory rate of 26, and oxygen saturation in the 70s without nasal bipap.

The patient requires ongoing respiratory support and is currently on nasal bipap. The family is considering a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient's neurological examination reveals unresponsiveness to pain, reactive pupils, and panhyporeflexia. Laboratory results indicate a WBC count of 12.1 K/uL, Hgb of 13.5 g/dL, and a platelet count of 339 K/uL. Blood gases show a pH of 7.51, pCO2 of 44, and pO2 of 77.

The patient has several medical complications, including aspiration pneumonia, hemorrhagic CVA, psychosocial issues related to agitation and code status, a palpable mass on the head at the site of CSF shunt, resolved ECG changes, thrombocytopenia, and potential access issues with a single peripheral line.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male who has experienced a hemorrhagic stroke with likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been febrile but the fever has resolved. The patient continues to have increased respiratory effort and is now intubated. The patient has a positive sputum culture for Serratia and Haemophillus, and is being treated with Cipro for the Serratia infection. The patient's family has decided to make him a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) and plans to remove the feeding tube on Saturday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's increased respiratory effort and positive sputum culture for Serratia and Haemophillus indicate a possible aspiration pneumonia. This condition can worsen if the patient is not properly ventilated or if the infection spreads.

2. Hemorrhagic CVA: The patient's hemorrhagic stroke has an unclear prognosis, which means that there may be ongoing neurological complications or potential deterioration.

3. Psychiatric issues: The patient is on multiple medications for psychiatric symptoms, including agitation. The use of olanzapine has provided good effect, but there is a risk of side effects or medication interactions.

4. Pulastile mass on the head: There is a mass on the patient's head at the site of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt, which may require further evaluation by neurosurgery. This could"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a hemorrhagic stroke and likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and is currently on respiratory support. The patient's family decided to be DNR/DNI and plans to remove the tube on Saturday. The patient has multiple medical conditions including pneumonia, a hemorrhagic CVA, psych issues, a palpable mass on the head at the site of CSF shunt, ECG changes, thrombocytopenia, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia caused by Serratia and Haemophillus. This can lead to further respiratory distress and sepsis.
2. Hemorrhagic CVA: The prognosis for this condition is unclear, and it can result in neurological deficits or even death.
3. Psych Issues: The patient is agitated and on multiple psychiatric medications. Agitation can increase the risk of injury or complications.
4. Palpable Mass on the Head: This mass may indicate a neurological issue and could potentially worsen or become infected.
5. ECG Changes: Although resolved, the patient had ECG changes which can be indicative of cardiac issues and may recur.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient had low platelet count but it has resolved. If platelet count drops again, it can lead to bleeding complications.

The patient's family decided to make the patient DNR/DNI and will be pulling the tube on Saturday once all family members are together at the bedside. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 133/67 mmHg. The patient is receiving various medications in the ICU and has received infusions. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's lab results show elevated levels of potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-), as well as decreased levels of hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), and platelets (Plt). The patient's creatinine (Cr) and blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values indicate abnormalities in liver enzymes (ALT/AST), electrolytes (Ca++, Mg++, PO4), and cardiac markers (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T). The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) and lactic acid levels are also abnormal. The patient is not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or respiratory status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to potential pulmonary issues indicated by abnormal ABG results.
2. Kidney dysfunction indicated by increased creatinine levels.
3. Electrolyte imbalance indicated by abnormal potassium, sodium, chloride"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 81 year old male s/p hemorrhagic stroke with likely aspiration
   pneumonia, fever-resolved, and continued increased respiratory effort.
   Intubated for hypoxia and hypercarbia plus increasing work of
   breathing. Family meeting held and decided to go to CMO today
   1. Pneumonia: likely aspiration, Serratia and Haemophillus positive
   sputum.  Now intubated
   - D/C

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male who has had a hemorrhagic stroke with likely aspiration pneumonia. He was intubated for hypoxia and hypercarbia, as well as increasing work of breathing. The family decided to escalate care to the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) today. The patient's fever has resolved, and he is now sedated with fentanyl. Suctioning is being held to spare the patient pain. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. The patient's platelet count and creatinine levels are within normal range. The patient's glucose levels have been high, but have been brought under control. The patient has several other medical issues including a pulmonary mass, ECG changes that have resolved, thrombocytopenia that has resolved, and a prophylactic antibiotic regimen. The patient's code status and disposition are pending discussion with the family.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has likely aspiration pneumonia caused by Serratia and Haemophilus bacteria. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially sepsis if not properly treated.
2. Hemorrhagic CVA: The patient's prognosis for his hemorrhagic stroke is unclear. Complications such as increased intracranial pressure, seizures, or further neurological decline could occur.
3. Psychiatric issues: The patient is agitated and on several psychiatric medications. If these medications are not properly managed"
