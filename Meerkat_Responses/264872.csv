   61M, little known of PMH, found minimally responsive and with altered
   mental status now admitted with severe sepsis, renal failure,
   coagulopathy, atrial flutter.  With findings of thrombocytopenia and
   coagulopathy DIC is cearly of concern.  With the [**Year (4 digits) **] findings noted
   there is substantial concern for both TSS and Meningococcemia with TSS
   perhaps more likely of the two.  He has severe organ dysfunction and

   of infection may be gallbladder or skin source as most likely with

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with no known medical history who was found confused and lethargic in his home. He was brought to the hospital and diagnosed with septic shock, multiple lab abnormalities, including ARF, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and hyperglycemia. The patient has a history of potential chronic diseases such as diabetes and coronary artery disease. He also has purpuric lesions on his abdomen and chest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing symptoms suggest severe sepsis due to a suspected source of infection, possibly in the gallbladder or skin.
2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia indicate the possibility of DIC, which can occur secondary to sepsis.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and low urine output suggest acute kidney injury (ATN), potentially due to hypovolemia or sepsis.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. Imaging shows volume overload, but oxygenation is well maintained.
5. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient has atrial flutter and evidence of cardiac dysfunction, possibly contributing to his hypotension.
6. Chronic Liver Disease: The patient's low albumin levels, coagulopathy, and throm"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with no known medical history who was found to be in septic shock with multiple lab abnormalities. He has been intubated and admitted to the ICU. The patient has severe organ dysfunction, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia, which are concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). There is also a concern for toxic shock syndrome (TSS) or meningococcemia as potential sources of infection. The source of infection may be the gallbladder or skin. The patient has hypotension and is receiving fluids and vasopressors for support. He is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There are concerns about chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and possible cardiac issues. Other complications include respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, vascular problems, coagulopathy, hyperglycemia, atrial flutter, hepatic failure, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention.
2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia are suggestive of DIC, a condition characterized by widespread activation of the clotting cascade, leading to both thrombosis and bleeding.
3. Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS): TSS is a possibility due to the presence of pur"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of septic shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. He was found confused and lethargic in his home and brought to the hospital where he was diagnosed with septic shock and multiple lab abnormalities. The patient has a history of little known medical history but is suspected to have untreated chronic medical conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). He has been critically ill since admission and his prognosis for recovery is poor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient appears to have severe organ dysfunction and shock, which seems most likely to be septic in nature. There may also be hypovolemic and cardiogenic components. The patient's blood pressure is low, and he has leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and bandemia (presence of immature white blood cells). He is currently being treated with vasopressors to maintain blood pressure and will continue to be monitored closely.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation support due to respiratory failure. His lungs sound clear, but imaging shows volume overload. He is oxygenating well with minimal PEEP/FiO2 settings. The plan is to continue ventilatory support and consider trials of pressure support ventilation (PSV) or assist-control ventilation (ACV).

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, and it is unclear whether this"

   61M, little known of PMH, presents with shock and MODS.
   He has severe organ dysfunction and shock appears to be septic,
   hypovolemic and cardiogenic (elevated CVP).  He has staph bacteremia
   and potential sources of infection include skin/necrotic foot, osteo,
   less likely pna given cxr appearance and oxygenation, GB less likely
   given organism, urinary tract, no obvious joint inflammation.  Suspect
   the pt has longstanding untreated chronic medical conditions, T2DM,
   putting him at high risk. He is critically ill and prognosis for
   recovery is poor.

   61 yo M with no known PMHx, presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2117-12-27**]
   via EMS after being found down, lethargic, and minimally responsive on
   floor of his home.  Now with septic and cardiogenic shock.
   #. SHOCK, SEPTIC AND CARDIOGENIC:  Patient appears to be fluid
   resuscitated at this point, with CVP of 15, and hourly urine output
   ranging from 40-100.  Still on Levophed support to maintain MAPs of
   60.  Septic shock from staph aureus bacteremia and cardiogenic shock
   (EF of 15%).  Still unclear source of bloodstream infection, though
   most likely portal of entry through feet.  We obtained OSH micro data
   (including MICs) overnight.
   - TEE to assess cardiac function today
   - Continue vanco/meropenem, today day 4 of antibiotics (including OSH)
   - Wean levophed as tolerated with a goal MAP>60
   - Continue to trend lactates (trending down to 1.9 this morning)
   - f/u cultures in house, repeat culture if spikes
   - obtain bacterial plates from OSH microbiology lab as per our ID team
   - daily CXR to monitor fluid overload
   - check vanco trough tomorrow to assess adequate dosing
   #. Elevated LFTs:
   Bilirubin up to 8.3 today with direct bili up to 6.7 from 0.6.  Other
   LFTs high but stable, with increasing LDH and AST.  Still concerning
   for cholestatic picture or shock liver (though would expect higher
   LFTs).  Ultrasound yesterday consistent with sludge and ascites.
   Hepatitis serologies negative.
   - Continue to trend bilirubin
   #. Respiratory failure:
   ABG stable with continued acidemia.  Patient is requiring relatively
   minimal vent settings and was likely intubated for stability on
   transfer.  He will need several studies today including TEE.
   - We will hold off on weaning until we have a better idea of mental
   status and procedures are over with.
   - Daily CXR
s while status changing.
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia:
   Patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] with INR of 5 and platelets down
   to 69. Possible that this was indicative of DIC is setting of sepsis;
   however, INR quickly reversed, though it has not normalized.  Does not
   appear to have a consumptive process. Also possible that the changes
   reflect a more chronic process, such as chronic liver disease.  Coags
   continue to normalize today.
   - Follow coags and monitor for signs of bleeding
   #. Foot ulcers:
   Patient with unknown chronicity of his bilateral foot ulcers, though
   currently with weak femoral pulses bilaterally and incomplete pulses in
   his lower extremities.  Vascular surgery does not believe that foot
   ulcers are contributing to current septic picture.
   - Appreciate vascular recommendations (contact today is [**Name (NI) 472**]
   [**Name (NI) 10671**])
   - Vascular surgery recs.  If he has an acute clot, could require an
   embolectomy.
   - Wound care consult deferred care to vascular surgery
   # Hyperglycemia:  Hgb A1C of 11.  Glucose trending down to 130s with
   insulin sliding scale.
   - Insulin sliding scale for now
   - [**Month (only) 8**] require long-acting insulin
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Patient with unknown baseline Cr, though with Cr 1.4 on admission.  Cr.
   now trending down to 1.2 today with fluid resuscitation-  Most likely
   pre-renal azotemia
   - Continue to trend cr.
   - Spin urine for signs of intrinsic renal pathology
   #. Altered mental status:
   Patient was found down with unclear baseline status or cause of altered
   status.  Acuity raises likely infectious cause or ingestion.
   - urine/serum tox negative here; try to obtain toxicology results from
   OSH
   - attempt to wean sedation for better idea of mental status
   #. Atrial flutter:
   Has several reasons to have increased sympathetic drive here.  Will
   treat underlying issues first, tolerating a certain degree of
   tachycardia for now.  Less likely caused by ischemic as appears to have
   had a minor troponin leak.
   - Continue to monitor
   #. Skin rash:
   Unclear what the source is of the macules on his stomach.
   - Appreciate dermatology recommendations and biopsy
   - Follow-up wound cultures
   #. HIV status:  Unknown past medical history, now with life-threatening
   systemic infection
   - Await reply from [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 884**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]

   resuscitated at this point, with CVP of 15, and hourly urine output
   ranging from 40-100.  Still on Levophed support to maintain MAPs of
   60.  Septic shock from staph aureus bacteremia and cardiogenic shock
   (EF of 15%).  Still unclear source of bloodstream infection, though
   most likely portal of entry through feet.  We obtained OSH micro data
   (including MICs) overnight.
   - TEE to assess cardiac function today

   Bilirubin up to 8.3 today with direct bili up to 6.7 from 0.6.  Other
   LFTs high but stable, with increasing LDH and AST.  Still concerning
   for cholestatic picture.  Ultrasound yesterday consistent with sludge
   and ascites.  Hepatitis serologies negative.
   - Continue to trend bilirubin
   #. Respiratory failure:
   ABG stable with continued acidemia.  Patient is requiring relatively
   minimal vent settings and was likely intubated for stability on

   Patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] with INR of 5 and platelets down

   however, INR quickly reversed, though it has not normalized.  Does not
   appear to have a consumptive process. Also possible that the changes
   reflect a more chronic process, such as chronic liver disease.  Coags
   continue to normalize today.
   - Follow coags and monitor for signs of bleeding
   #. Foot ulcers:
   Patient with unknown chronicity of his bilateral foot ulcers, though
   currently with weak femoral pulses bilaterally and incomplete pulses in

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with no known prior medical history who presented to the hospital on [**2117-12-27**] via EMS after being found down, lethargic, and minimally responsive on the floor of his home. The patient is currently experiencing septic and cardiogenic shock. He has a history of staph aureus bacteremia, with the source of infection likely being through his feet. The patient's cardiac function will be assessed using a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) today. He is still on Levophed support to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) of 60. The patient's lactate levels are trending down, indicating improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which can be a result of septic and cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid resuscitation will be necessary to maintain adequate perfusion.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, but it is not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The ABG values indicate continued acidemia, and the patient requires minimal ventilatory support. Daily chest X-rays will be conducted to monitor fluid overload.
3. Alteration in Tissue Perfusion: Due to the presence of septic and cardiogenic shock, there may be alterations in tissue perfusion. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and urine output will help assess the adequacy of perf"

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with no known past medical history who presented to the hospital on 12/27/2117 after being found down, lethargic, and minimally responsive. He is currently in the ICU with septic and cardiogenic shock. The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension, respiratory failure, alteration in tissue perfusion, acute renal failure, atrial flutter, elevated liver function tests, coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia, foot ulcers, hyperglycemia, altered mental status, and skin rash. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is caused by staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. It is still unclear where the bloodstream infection originated, but it is most likely through the feet. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem antibiotics.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient also has cardiogenic shock with an ejection fraction of 15%. This indicates impaired heart function, leading to decreased blood flow and tissue perfusion.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation support due to acute respiratory failure. He is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set respiratory rate of 14, tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values show acidemia, indicating inadequate ventilation or respiratory distress.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to pre-renal azotemia caused by hypotension and inadequate renal perfusion. His serum creatinine level is trending down from 1.4 to 1.2 mg/dL with fluid resuscitation.

5. Atrial flutter: The patient has atrial flutter with a heart rate of 122 bpm. This tachyarrhythmia may be related to increased sympathetic drive secondary to septic shock and cardiogenic shock.

6. Elevated liver function tests: The patient's liver enzymes and bilirubin levels are elevated, indicating liver dysfunction. An ultrasound showed evidence of liver sludge and ascites. Hepatitis serologies were negative.

7. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: The patient presented with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and low platelet count. This could be indicative of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in the setting of sepsis, although the INR has quickly reversed.

8. Foot ulcers: The patient has bilateral foot ulcers with weak femoral pulses bilaterally and incomplete pulses in his lower extremities. Vascular surgery does not believe that the foot ulcers are contributing to the current septic picture. However, an embolectomy may be required if there is an acute"

","The patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of septic shock and cardiogenic shock. They have been receiving multiple doses of antibiotics, including meropenem, vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. The patient is on several infusions, including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and norepinephrine.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/80 to 108/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The FiO2 is set at 40% and PEEP at 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.8 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 16.1 g/dL, normal sodium and potassium levels, elevated glucose level of 19 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.9 mmol/L. Other lab values such as creatinine, troponin T, and liver enzymes are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals atrial flutter and the peripheral pulses are not assessed. The patient is unable to respond to commands and there"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M, little known of PMH, presents with shock and MODS.
   Shock appears to be primarily septic/ hypovolemic w/ possible
   cardiogenic component.  His EF on TTE is 15% likely from myocardial
   hibernation. He has staph bacteremia, most likely from his necrotic LE,
   though we continue to discuss alternative infectious etiologies and
   sources given continued fevers including SBE.  Suspect the pt has
   longstanding untreated chronic medical conditions, T2DM, putting him at
   high risk. He is critically ill and prognosis for recovery is poor
   though some parameters are improving slowly. After discussion with pts
   family, we will not pursue amputation as family feels that is not in
   line with pts wishes.
   Primary issues include:
   # Shock---
   --hypotension
   --Fevers
   --Leukocytosis
   -- primarily septic with staph bacteremia, likely from gangrenous feet
       Appears adequately fluid resus based on CVP and urine outpt,

   Addendum
   Met with pt
s family.  Updated them to his condition and answered all
   questions.  Family is in full agreement that pt would not want  le
   amputations.  For now we continue with current level of aggressive
   care, noting some improvement in pressor requirements,  but family
   discussing potentially moving focus toward comfort, as quality of life
   and ability to be independent and  to walk is felt to be a priority for
   this pt.

   arrest, pt is DNR.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient has severe organ dysfunction and shock appears to be septic, hypovolemic, and cardiogenic. He has staph bacteremia and potential sources of infection include skin/necrotic foot, osteomyelitis, less likely pneumonia given chest X-ray appearance and oxygenation, gallbladder, and urinary tract. The patient is critically ill with a poor prognosis for recovery. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 95/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is unresponsive and has mottled skin, right lower extremity edema, and a necrotic left foot. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.8 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 19 mmol/L, and elevated troponin T level of 0.08 ng/mL. Imaging reveals effusions in the lungs, some improved aeration, and no vegetations seen on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). 

The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, norepinephrine, famotidine, and meropenem.

   61 yo M with no known PMHx, presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2117-12-27**]
   via EMS after being found down, lethargic, and minimally responsive on
   floor of his home.  Now with septic and cardiogenic shock.
   #. SHOCK, SEPTIC AND CARDIOGENIC:  Patient appears to be fluid
   resuscitated at this point, with CVP of 15, and hourly urine output
   ranging from 40-100.  Still on Levophed support to maintain MAPs of
   60.  Septic shock from staph aureus bacteremia and cardiogenic shock
   (EF of 15%).  Still unclear source of bloodstream infection, though
   most likely portal of entry through feet.  We obtained OSH micro data
   (including MICs) overnight.
   - Confirmed that staph is [**Year (4 digits) 1684**] so changed to nafcillin
   - TEE negative for vegetations
   - Continue nafcillin/meropenem/cefepime, today day 5 of antibiotics
   (including OSH)
   - Wean levophed as tolerated with a goal MAP>60
   - Continue to trend lactates, one pending for this morning
   - Serial blood cultures
   - daily CXR to monitor fluid overload
   - check vanco trough tomorrow to assess adequate dosing
   #. Tachycardia:
   Has several reasons to have increased sympathetic drive here.  Will
   treat underlying issues first, tolerating a certain degree of
   tachycardia for now.  Less likely caused by ischemic as appears to have
   had a minor troponin leak.
   - IV metoprolol for HR >130 as BP allows
   - Continue to monitor
   #. Elevated LFTs:
   Bilirubin up to 9.8 today with direct bili up to 7.8.  Other LFTs high
   but stable.  Still concerning for cholestatic picture or shock liver.
   Ultrasound yesterday consistent with sludge and ascites.  Hepatitis
   serologies negative.
   - Continue to trend bilirubin
   #. Respiratory failure:
   ABG stable with continued acidemia.  Consider weaning sedation today.
   - We will hold off on weaning until we have a better idea of mental
   status.
   - Daily CXR
s while status changing.
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia:
   Patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] with INR of 5 and platelets down
   to 69.  INR here is slowly creeping up to 2.4 today with PT/PTT
   rising.  Does not appear to have a consumptive process. Also possible
   that the changes reflect a more chronic process, such as chronic liver
   disease.
   - Follow coags and monitor for signs of bleeding
   #. Foot ulcers:
   Patient with unknown chronicity of his bilateral foot ulcers, though
   currently with weak femoral pulses bilaterally and incomplete pulses in
   his lower extremities.  Vascular surgery does not believe that foot
   ulcers are contributing to current septic picture.
   - Appreciate vascular recommendations
   - Wound care consult deferred care to vascular surgery
   # Hyperglycemia:  Hgb A1C of 11.  Glucose trending down to 130s with
   insulin sliding scale.
   - Insulin sliding scale for now
   - [**Month (only) 8**] require long-acting insulin
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Patient with unknown baseline Cr, though with Cr 1.4 on admission.  Cr.
   now trending up to 1.5 today.  Most likely ATN from distributive shock
   and/or pre-renal azotemia.
   - Continue to trend cr.
   - Spin urine for signs of intrinsic renal pathology
   #. Altered mental status:
   Patient was found down with unclear baseline status or cause of altered
   status.  Acuity raises likely infectious cause or ingestion.
   - urine/serum tox negative here; try to obtain toxicology results from
   OSH
   - attempt to wean sedation for better idea of mental status
   #. Skin rash:
   Unclear what the source is of the macules on his stomach.
   - Appreciate dermatology recommendations and biopsy
   - Follow-up wound cultures
   #. HIV status:  Unknown past medical history, now with life-threatening
   systemic infection

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with no known past medical history who presented to the hospital with septic and cardiogenic shock. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, respiratory failure (not ARDS), alteration in tissue perfusion, acute renal failure, atrial flutter, and several other medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Septic shock: The patient has a confirmed staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, which is causing septic shock. It is essential to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor the patient's response to treatment.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has an ejection fraction of 15%, indicating reduced heart function. This can lead to cardiogenic shock, which requires careful management of fluid balance and cardiac support.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and weaning off sedation cautiously will be necessary.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's serum creatinine levels are rising, indicating potential acute renal failure. Monitoring kidney function and managing fluid balance are crucial.

5. Atrial flutter: The patient is experiencing atrial flutter, which may require rate control medication and further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.

6. Foot ulcers: The patient has bilateral foot ulcers with weak femoral pulses and incomplete lower extremity"

   61 yo M with no known PMHx, presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2117-12-27**]
   via EMS after being found down, lethargic, and minimally responsive on
   floor of his home.  Now with septic and cardiogenic shock.
   #. SHOCK, SEPTIC AND CARDIOGENIC:  Patient appears to be fluid
   resuscitated at this point, with CVP of 12, though urine output
   continues to decline.  Still on Levophed support to maintain MAPs of
   60.  Septic shock from [**Year (4 digits) 1684**] bacteremia and cardiogenic shock (EF of
   15%).  Still unclear source of bloodstream infection, though most
   likely portal of entry through feet.
   - Confirmed that staph is [**Year (4 digits) 1684**] so changed to nafcillin
   - TEE negative for vegetations
   - Continue cefepime/flagyl/nafcillin
   - Wean levophed as tolerated with a goal MAP>60
   - Continue to trend lactates
   - Serial blood cultures
   - daily CXR to monitor fluid overload
   #. Tachycardia, aflutter:
   Has severeal reasons for increased sympathetic drive, and HR increasing
   to maintain cardiac output.  Patient most likely volume resuscitated
   with CVPs >12.  Will slow HR to maintain adequate cardiac filling time.
   - Metoprolol 5mg IV for HR>130 as BP allows
   - Can consider amiodarone to slow HR if BP doesn
t tolearte metoprolol
   - Continue to monitor
   #. Elevated LFTs:
   Bilirubin up to 9.8 today with direct bili up to 7.8.  Other LFTs high
   but stable.  Concerning for continuing liver damage.
   - Continue to trend bilirubin
   #. Respiratory failure:
   ABG stable with continued acidemia.  Will hold off extubation until
   patient is more stable.
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia:
   Patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] with INR of 5 and platelets down
   to 69.  INR here is slowly creeping up to 2.4 today with PT/PTT
   rising.  Does not appear to have a consumptive process. Also possible
   that the changes reflect a more chronic process, such as chronic liver
   disease.
   - Follow coags and monitor for signs of bleeding
   - D/C heparin drip
   #. Foot ulcers:
   Patient with unknown chronicity of his bilateral foot ulcers, though
   currently with weak femoral pulses bilaterally and incomplete pulses in
   his lower extremities.  Vascular surgery does not believe that foot
   ulcers are contributing to current septic picture.
   - Appreciate vascular recommendations
   - Wound care consult deferred care to vascular surgery
   - D/C heparin drip, as unlikely to make a difference in overall outcome
   (originally for concern over embolic event in feet) and patient is
   coagulopathic
   # Hyperglycemia:  Hgb A1C of 11.  Glucose trending down to 130s with
   insulin sliding scale.
   - Insulin sliding scale for now, and will hold off on long-acting

   #. [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Patient with unknown baseline Cr, though with Cr 1.4 on admission.  Cr.
   now trending up to 1.5 today.  Most likely ATN from distributive shock
   and/or pre-renal azotemia.
   - Continue to trend cr.
   #. Altered mental status:
   Patient was found down with unclear baseline status or cause of altered

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male who presented with septic shock and cardiogenic shock. The patient has been in the ICU for several days, and the medical team has been working to stabilize their condition. The patient's temperature has been elevated, and they have shown signs of discomfort when weaned from sedation. The patient's heart rate has been fluctuating between 130-140 beats per minute, which is concerning. The patient's blood pressure is low, and they require vasopressor support. The patient's respiratory rate is also elevated. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and their oxygen saturation is maintained at 98%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by severe infection and systemic inflammation. It can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient also has cardiogenic shock, which occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This can be due to conditions like heart attack, heart failure, or valve disorders.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to septic or cardiogenic shock and may require ongoing vasopressor support to maintain adequate perfusion.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is high, ranging from 102-145 beats per minute."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with MSSA shock and a suspected gangrenous foot. The patient's condition is critical, and several potential medical complications can arise.

1. Septic and cardiogenic shock: The patient is currently on nafcillin, cefipime/flagyl for MSSA gangrenous foot and levophed to maintain MAP>60. This indicates ongoing efforts to manage the patient's shock. Complications such as organ dysfunction, including renal failure and respiratory failure, may occur due to inadequate tissue perfusion.

2. Tachycardia: The patient has been tachycardic overnight and received 5 mg IV metoprolol twice. This suggests an attempt to control the heart rate. If the tachycardia persists or worsens, it can lead to arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, and further deterioration of the patient's condition.

3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient remains on CPAP/PSV and appears comfortable. However, the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration. Failure to improve or worsening respiratory failure may necessitate more aggressive interventions, such as invasive mechanical ventilation.

4. Elevated liver function tests (LFT): The patient has elevated LFTs, which are more reflective of underlying sepsis/poor cardiac function. Monitoring for signs of hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy is important.

   #. [**Year (4 digits) **], SEPTIC AND CARDIOGENIC:  Patient appears to be fluid
   resuscitated at this point, with CVP of 13, however, urine output and
   BP continue to decline.  Patient has been maintained on leveophed to
   maintain acceptable MAPs.  Septic [**Year (4 digits) **] from MSSA bacteremia and
   cardiogenic [**Year (4 digits) **] (EF of 15%).  Still unclear source of bloodstream
   infection, though most likely portal of entry through feet.
   - Continue nafcillin/cefepime/flagyl
   - Continue levophed as tolerated with a goal MAP>60
   - Continue to trend lactates
   - Serial blood cultures
   - Daily CXR to monitor fluid overload
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   #. Tachycardia, aflutter:
   Has severeal reasons for increased sympathetic drive, and HR increasing
   to maintain cardiac output.
   - Metoprolol 5mg IV for HR>130 as BP allows
   - Can consider amiodarone to slow HR if BP doesn
t tolearte metoprolol
   - Continue to monitor
   #. ARF:
   Patient with unknown baseline Cr, though with Cr 1.4 on admission.  Cr.
   now trending up to 2.8 today.  Most likely ATN from distributive [**Year (4 digits) **].
   - Continue to monitor urine output.
   - Continue to trend cr.
   #. Elevated LFTs:
   Bilirubin up to 10.6 today with other LFTs increasing as well.
   Concerning for continuing liver damage, and signaling that liver may be
shutting down.
  Root of this problem is [**Name2 (NI) **], as described above.
   - Continue to trend bilirubin
   #. Respiratory failure:
   ABG stable with continued acidemia.  Will hold off extubation until
   patient is more stable.
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia:
   Patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] with INR of 5 and platelets down
   to 69.  INR here is down to 2.1 today with PT/PTT rising.  Does not
   appear to have a consumptive process. Also possible that the changes
   reflect a more chronic process, such as chronic liver disease.
   - Follow coags and monitor for signs of bleeding
   - D/C heparin drip
   #. Foot ulcers:
   Patient with unknown chronicity of his bilateral foot ulcers, though
   currently with weak femoral pulses bilaterally and incomplete pulses in
   his lower extremities.  Vascular surgery does not believe that foot
   ulcers are contributing to current septic picture.
   - Appreciate vascular recommendations
   - Wound care consult deferred care to vascular surgery
   - D/C heparin drip, as unlikely to make a difference in overall outcome
   (originally for concern over embolic event in feet) and patient is
   coagulopathic
   # Hyperglycemia:  Hgb A1C of 11.  Glucose trending down to 130s with
   insulin sliding scale.
   - Insulin sliding scale for now, and will hold off on long-acting

1. Hypotension: The patient continues to have hypotension, despite fluid resuscitation. The blood pressure is in the 60s/50s with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 50s. This indicates poor tissue perfusion.

2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. The arterial blood gas (ABG) is stable, but there is continued acidemia. Extubation will be held off until the patient is more stable.

3. Alteration in tissue perfusion: The patient's extremities are cool and mottled, indicating poor peripheral circulation. The patient also has weak femoral pulses bilaterally and incomplete pulses in the lower extremities, suggesting possible peripheral arterial disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 95 kg male admitted to the ICU with septic shock and cardiogenic shock. The patient's condition continues to deteriorate, with ongoing hypotension and tachycardia. The patient has a history of multiple infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infection, urinary tract infection, and wound infection. The patient is currently on multiple vasopressors and intubated for respiratory failure. The patient also has acute renal failure and atrial flutter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued hypotension and shock: The patient's low blood pressure and the presence of septic and cardiogenic shock indicate a high risk for further hypotension and shock. Close monitoring and aggressive management of fluid and vasopressor therapy are crucial to maintain adequate organ perfusion.

2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation may progress to ARDS, which is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can lead to significant hypoxemia and difficulty weaning off the ventilator.

3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to sepsis-induced kidney injury. This condition can lead to the accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances, requiring careful monitoring and management.

4. Arrhythmias: The presence of atrial flutter increases the risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring of the patient's heart rhythm and prompt intervention if necessary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 61-year-old male with no known previous medical history, presented to the hospital on [**2117-12-27**] after being found unresponsive. He has since developed septic and cardiogenic shock. Despite maximal medical efforts, the patient's condition continues to deteriorate. The family has agreed to withdraw care, understanding that the patient would not want to live in this state and recognizing that he will soon pass away.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 60s/50s with MAPs in the 50s, indicating severe low blood pressure. This could lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. However, there is no mention of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). It is important to monitor for signs of worsening respiratory function and consider alternative respiratory support if needed.
3. Alteration in Tissue Perfusion: The patient's extremities are cool and mottled, and the coloring is pale, suggesting poor tissue perfusion. This can be attributed to the hypotension and may result in further organ dysfunction if not managed promptly.
4. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF): The patient's urine output is low at 323 mL over 24 hours, indicating potential acute kidney injury"

   would
not want to live like this,
 and understood that he would soon
   pass despite maximal medical effort.  Family was in agreement that we
   should stop pressors and focus our efforts on making the patient
   comfortable.

   Code status: DNR
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old male with no known previous medical history who presented to the hospital on [**2117-12-27**] after being found down, lethargic, and minimally responsive on the floor of his home. He is currently experiencing septic and cardiogenic shock. The patient's condition continues to deteriorate, with low blood pressure, increased heart rate, and decreased urine output. His extremities are cool and mottled, and he has a pale coloring. The patient has multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line, and is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, and vasopressors.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Blood cultures are pending, and previous cultures of the catheter tip and urine did not show any significant growth.

The patient's family has been informed about his critical condition and has agreed to withdraw care, focusing on making the patient comfortable rather than attempting to improve his current situation. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and he is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening hypotension, respiratory failure, alteration in tissue perfusion, acute renal failure, and atrial flutter."
