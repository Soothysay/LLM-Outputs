","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with bradycardia and long QT. They have been monitored on telemetry and received dopamine for 20 minutes, which caused hypertension. The patient has allergies to Levaquin and has been taking Acyclovir. They are currently on multiple infusions of ICU medications. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 39 bpm, blood pressure of 124/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving respiratory support with SpO2 at 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,149 mL and output of 1,475 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's blood products and urine output are within normal limits. The patient's ABG results are pending. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient's eyes are PERRL, head, ears, nose, and throat are normocephalic, and cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. Peripheral pulses are not assessed. The patient's respiratory system is clear, abdomen is soft and non-tender, extremities are absent, and skin is not assessed. Neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately, but further assessment could not be performed due to absent peripheral pulses.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 year old gentleman with diffuse large B cell lymphoma represents
   mini-MUDS (day 0= [**2168-5-3**]) admitted with asymptomatic bradycardia.
   Bradycardia/Prolonged QTC: unclear etiology at this time, although
   patient was recently on beta-blockade and nifedipine, last dose given
   one day prior to admission.  HR 70-80 on day prior to transfer and
   30-40 on day of transfer.  Metoprolol & Nifedipine cleared hepatically
   and patient has normal hepatic function.  Cyclosporine not known to
   cause increased Qtc and bradycardia. Etoposide known to cause
   hypotension, but not QTc prolongation or bradycardia. Mets to heart?
   Was on cefepime and vanco prior.
   1.        Will search for drug-drug interaction, fluconazole has been
   reported to cause prolonged QTc & torsades but not bradycardia.  Will
   replace with Caspo.
   2.        Ruled out for ischemia
   3.        Replete K and Mg aggressively
   4.        f/u EP recs
   5.        ECHO ordered
   CAD: no known hx of CAD.  Unlikely to be ACS without chest pain or EKG
   changes.  Cycle enzymes for confirmation.
   HTN: He developed moderate hypertension in his last admission which was
   felt to be due to cyclosporine. He was started on nifedipine and
   metoprolol  decreased nifedipine to 60mg as may contribute to pedal
   edema, d/c'd completely [**6-10**]. Monitor
   RHYTHM: bradycardic, will remain on telemetry
   ARF: Baseline Cr is 1.0, currently 1.3.  FENA 9.1, likely CSA toxicit
   1.        Monitor Cr
   Hypernatremia- D5

   Lymphoma: Please refer to BMT note for all details
   1.        BMT Service to follow, siwthc to caspo ppx given diflucan may
   cause long qt
   2.        NPO given concern GVHD for diarrhea

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma admitted to the ICU for asymptomatic bradycardia. He has a history of recent beta-blockade and nifedipine use, both cleared hepatically, and normal hepatic function. His current medications include cefepime, vancomycin, etoposide, and cyclosporine. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 39 bpm, blood pressure of 124/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's temperature is slightly low at 35.6°C. Laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate dehydrogenase. The patient is currently on telemetry for rhythm monitoring and has been ruled out for ischemia. There are concerns about possible drug-drug interactions, particularly with fluconazole causing prolonged QTc and torsades, and plans to replace it with caspofungin. Repletion of potassium and magnesium is also recommended. An echocardiogram has been ordered, and the patient will be monitored for bradycardia. The patient's condition is being managed by the BMT service, and prophylactic measures include boots for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prevention. The patient's code status is full, and he is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma who presented to the ICU with asymptomatic bradycardia. He has a history of beta-blockade and nifedipine use, both of which have been cleared hepatically as the patient has normal hepatic function. The cause of the bradycardia and prolonged QTc interval is unclear. The patient was recently on cefepime and vancomycin prior to admission. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.6 C (96 F), blood pressure ranging from 124/67 to 190/79 mmHg, heart rate of 39 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of bradycardia. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,149 mL and output of 1,475 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 326 mL. 

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 5.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, platelet count of 13 K/uL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, and potassium levels within normal range. Other lab values are also provided. 

The patient's physical examination reveals sinus bradycardia, normal breath sounds, and soft non"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma who underwent mini-muds on day 0. He is currently experiencing asymptomatic bradycardia and prolonged QTc. The patient has a history of allergies to levaquin and rash. He is currently receiving cefepime for febrile neutropenia. His vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/85 mmHg to 190/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. He has been receiving various medications including cefepime, doxycycline, dopamine, hypertensive medications, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is low, which may lead to inadequate cardiac output and organ perfusion.
2. Prolonged QTc: The patient's QT interval on the ECG is prolonged, which increases the risk of torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high, which can lead to end-organ damage if not controlled.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. This can lead to fluid overload"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 year old gentleman with diffuse large B cell lymphoma represents
   mini-MUDS (day 0= [**2168-5-3**]) admitted with asymptomatic bradycardia and
   prolonged Qtc.
   # Bradycardia
   # Prolonged QTC: unclear etiology at this time, likely med effect of
   ijnteraction
   risk for torsades now with very short runs
   although patient was recently on beta-blockade and nifedipine, last
   dose given one day prior to admission.  HR 70-80 on day prior to
   transfer and 30-40 on day of transfer.  Metoprolol & Nifedipine cleared
   hepatically and patient has normal hepatic function.  Cyclosporine not
   known to cause increased Qtc and bradycardia. Etoposide known to cause
   hypotension, but not QTc prolongation or bradycardia. Mets to heart?
   1.        Will search for drug-drug interaction, fluconazole has been
   reported to cause prolonged QTc & torsades but not bradycardia.  Will
   replace with Caspo.
   2.        Cycle cardiac enzymes--ruled out
   3.        Replete lytes as needed
   Dopamine --> hypertension but if increased runs of torasades  will need
   HR increasing meds
   isoproterinol
   will start Q 6 albuterol-->  montipoing lytes closely
   OOB as it's only increased his BP and hasn't changed his HR
   if runs of  torsades
   ECHO ordered today
   daily ecg  safe for floor transfer once qtc < 550
   ep appreciated
   standing mg, aggressive K repalcement
   CAD: no known hx of CAD.  Unlikely to be ACS without chest pain or EKG
   changes.  Cycle enzymes for confirmation.
   HTN: He developed moderate hypertension in his last admission which was
   felt to be due to cyclosporine. He was started on nifedipine and
   metoprolol  decreased nifedipine to 60mg as may contribute to pedal
   edema, d/c'd completely [**6-10**]. continue metoprolol, monitor BP
   RHYTHM: bradycardic, will remain on telemetry

   # Fever: culture negative as per last admission.
   Fluconazole known to cause case reports of QTc, but not bradycardia.
   Will switch Fluconazole to Caspofungin
   As per BMT note:
   The patient had been febrile when neutropenic during his last admission
   and had been treated with cefepime (d/c'd [**5-19**]), flagyl, caspo, and
   Vanco (DC'd [**5-20**]), all of which were weaned as he defervesced. Imaging,
   cultures and screens for c. diff were unrevealing and he had been
   transitioned to fluconazole, acyclovir and bactrim for prophylaxis. On
   admission he had no localizing symptoms, but did have a line which was
   a potential infectious source. He had one day of loose stools but this
   was in the context of taking stool softeners for constipation, on
   admission he felt constipated. Suspected line infection v. fungal
   pulmonary infection v. disease recurrence v. hemophagocytic syndrome.
   More likely disease recurrence as cultures NGTD, CXR neg, no evidence
   of infection on CT, fever persisted despite antibiotics and taking out
   the PICC, and there is evidence for disease recurrence on CT, but have
   to rule out certain infections such as TB. ID consulted.
   - d/c'd vanc and cefepime on [**6-1**] (started [**5-30**] for possible line
   infection and being functionally neutropenic). continued to spike.
   restarted vanc [**6-2**], continued to spike. d/c'd line [**6-3**] and d/c'd vanc
   on [**6-5**] as cath tip culture was negative and he continued to spike.
   restarted cefepime [**6-8**] due to AMS w/spikes, stopped [**6-10**] as no
   difference
   - f/u surveillance blood and mycolytic cultures from peripheral and
   line- NGTD, CMV neg, b-glucan/galactommanan negative
   - checked CMV neg, EBV neg, parvovirus (neg) and herpes 6 viral loads
   (POSITIVE) given BM findings to r/o infection, check urine/stool TB,
   check toxoplasma antibodies (neg), Measles (neg), HHV-8 (neg), adeno
   viral PCRs (neg), Salmonella studies on stool (neg)
   -unfortunately BM material was not sent for TB cultures. there is some
   question of him having had TB in his youth and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 831**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 810**] had
   recommended starting him on anti-TB meds after day +30
   - considering biopsy if liver lesions to r/o infection v lymphoma
   - ID consult appreciated
   - **LP [**6-8**] to r/o infections and/or leptomeningeal disease, sent for
   toxo, JP, enterovirus

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma admitted to the ICU for asymptomatic bradycardia and prolonged QTc. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding potential medical complications.

1. Bradycardia and prolonged QTc: The etiology of these conditions is unclear at this time, but they are likely due to a medication interaction. The patient was recently on beta-blocker and nifedipine, which have been cleared from his system due to normal hepatic function. Cyclosporine and etoposide are not known to cause increased QTc and bradycardia. Fluconazole has been reported to cause prolonged QTc but not bradycardia. Therefore, it will be switched to Caspofungin.

2. Hypotension: Etoposide is known to cause hypotension, but not QTc prolongation or bradycardia.

3. Drug-drug interaction: The healthcare provider will search for any drug-drug interactions and ensure appropriate medication management.

4. Cardiac enzymes: The healthcare provider will cycle cardiac enzymes to rule out myocardial infarction.

5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolytes need to be closely monitored and repleted as needed.

6. Fever: The patient has a history of fever during his last admission while neutropenic. Cultures have been negative, and the healthcare provider suspects disease"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B cell lymphoma who is currently in the ICU. He has been admitted for asymptomatic bradycardia and prolonged QT interval, which could be due to an underlying condition or medication side effect. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 132/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His physical examination reveals no acute distress, anxious appearance, normal heart sounds, and clear breath sounds. Laboratory results show elevated levels of potassium, low platelet count, and normal liver function tests. The patient has a history of hypertension, which was managed with nifedipine and metoprolol. He is currently on fluconazole, caspofungin, and other medications. The assessment plan includes ruling out ischemia, repleting potassium and magnesium, monitoring for cardiac rhythm changes, managing hypertension, and addressing lymphoma treatment. The patient is also being treated for HHV-6 and is scheduled for a PICC placement for electrolyte repletion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is low (53 bpm), indicating bradycardia. This can lead to decreased cardiac output and inadequate tissue perfusion.
2. Prolonged QT interval: The patient's QT"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old gentleman with diffuse large B cell lymphoma who underwent mini-mud transplantation and is currently in the ICU. The patient presents with asymptomatic bradycardia and prolonged QT interval of 650msec. The etiology of the bradycardia and prolonged QT interval is unclear, but it is unlikely to be caused by cyclosporine or etoposide. Fluconazole is suspected as the culprit for the prolonged QT interval and has been switched to caspofungin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 132/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's physical examination reveals sinus bradycardia and no acute distress.

Laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. The creatinine level is elevated at 1.2 mg/dL. The troponin-T level is below 0.01 ng/mL, indicating no evidence of myocardial injury. Other lab results, including electrolytes and liver function tests, are within normal limits.

The patient's echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of 45%. The electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrates a corrected QT interval of 426 msec."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma who underwent mini-matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation (mini-MUDS) on day 0. The patient has asymptomatic bradycardia and prolonged QTc, which is suspected to be due to medication effect. The patient's main issues include bradycardia, prolonged QTc, hypertension, acute renal failure (ARF), diarrhea, lymphoma, thrombocytopenia, and fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient has asymptomatic bradycardia, which may require further evaluation and management to prevent potential complications such as hypotension, decreased cardiac output, and syncope.
2. Prolonged QTc: The prolonged QTc interval increases the risk of developing life-threatening arrhythmias like torsades de pointes. Close monitoring of the ECG and electrolyte levels is necessary to prevent arrhythmias.
3. Hypertension: The patient developed moderate hypertension, which should be managed to prevent complications like heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, which may lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the accumulation of waste products in the body. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are crucial to prevent further complications.
5. Diarrhea: Diarrhea can"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma who underwent mini-matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation (mini-MUDS) on day 0. The patient presents with asymptomatic bradycardia and prolonged QTc. Electrolytes were aggressively repleted, and isoproterenol was started transiently. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 45%. The patient is scheduled for percutaneous central catheter (PICC) placement today after platelet transfusions. The patient has allergies to Levofloxacin and has been on various medications including Acyclovir and Lorazepam. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

24-hour events include the initiation of aggressive electrolyte repletion, temporary use of isoproterenol, TTE with EF of 45%, scheduled PICC placement, and no treatment for HHV6 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/80 mmHg to 119/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is in sinus rhythm.

The patient has received a total of 2,792 mL of intravenous fluids and has had a balance of 592 mL. Respiratory support is not required, and the patient is maintaining adequate oxygenation with a SpO2 of 99%. The patient's general appearance is well-nourished, and the cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurologic exams are unremarkable.

Lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but the patient has elevated liver enzymes and a prolonged QTc interval on the ECG. Other labs such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, LDH, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with bradycardia, prolonged QTc, hypertension, acute kidney injury (ARF), diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and fever. The patient's lymphoma is being monitored, and recommendations for bone marrow transplantation (BMT) have been made. The patient's fever is suspected to be due to disease recurrence, and extensive evaluations have been conducted to rule out infections.

Plan:
1. Bradycardia: The bradycardia is suspected to be a medication effect, although it was present at baseline. Holding antiarrhythmic blockers and aggressive repletion of potassium and magnesium have been initiated. The patient's QTc remains in the 400 range since yesterday,"
