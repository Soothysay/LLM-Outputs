","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving treatment for an unspecified condition. The patient has a tunneled (Hickman) line, sheath, and catheter inserted via the right chest. Heparin is infusing through the sheath, and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) is infusing through the catheter. The patient has allergies to cefepime and has received vancomycin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 136 bpm, blood pressure of 108/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, while their creatinine level is within normal range. The patient's blood glucose level is 139 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes and renal function tests are within normal limits. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The presence of a tunneled (Hickman) line and sheath increases the risk of infection, particularly if proper sterile techniques are not followed during insertion or maintenance.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is at risk of developing a PE due to immobilization and underlying medical condition. Anticoagulation therapy"

   months following his matched unrelated allogeneic transplant with
   complications of BOOP and recent RSV infection, now p/w SVC syndrome.
   .
   # SVC syndrome: likely due to hypercoagulability in the context of
   cancer and foreign body in SVC. No evidence of respiratory compromise.
   - SVC clot on CT, TPA started by IR
   - follow IR recs overnight, will go back at 9AM
   - monitor for bleeding, guaiac
   - Vancomycin for possible line infection at least one more day
   - hold antihypertensives for now
   - HCT q4h
   - type and cross

   # Pleural Effusions - new, with small pericardial effusion, unclear
   etiology possible thoracic duct obstruction, will monitor closely
   - check pulsus and EKG for alternans to r/o tamponade
   - ECHO to look at diastolic filling
   .
   # AML: recent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2116-12-14**] revealed no
   evidence for leukemia and he is [**Age over 90 **]% donor by a cytogenetics.
   - follow counts
   .
   # Pulmonary. Recent RSV pneumonia also concern for BOOP in the past.
   No O2 requirement.
   - atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis and Voriconazole for fungal coverage
   along with acyclovir for zoster prophylaxis.
   - continue Prednisone for BOOP
   .
   # GVHD. Mr. [**Known lastname 1166**] has no indications for active GVHD at
   this time. He will remain on his current dose of Neoral at 50 mg
   twice per day with a taper as directed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a matched unrelated allogeneic transplant five months ago. He has complications of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and recent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. He presents with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, which is likely due to hypercoagulability in the context of cancer and a foreign body in the SVC. There is evidence of SVC clot on CT, and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) has been started. The patient will be monitored for bleeding, and a guaiac test will be performed. Vancomycin has been prescribed for possible line infection, and antihypertensives have been held. The patient's HCT (hematocrit) will be checked every four hours, and a type and cross will be performed. Pleural effusions and a small pericardial effusion have developed, possibly due to thoracic duct obstruction, and will be closely monitored. An echocardiogram will be done to assess diastolic filling and check for signs of cardiac tamponade. The patient's recent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy revealed no evidence of leukemia, and he is over 90% donor by cytogenetics. His pulmonary function is currently stable, with no oxygen requirement. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has required hemodynamic support. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for new onset of fever and worsening confusion. The patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, have been within normal limits for the most part, although there was a brief episode of hypotension that responded well to fluid resuscitation. The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently elevated, requiring insulin therapy. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging studies reveal no significant abnormalities. The patient has been receiving prophylactic antibiotics for prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular bronchoscopic surveillance cultures should be done to detect any early signs of infection.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT. The patient should be assessed for risk factors, and appropriate prophylactic measures such as early mobil"

He has complications such as Bronchiolitis Obliterate Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP) and recent Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection. He is now presenting with Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome, likely due to hypercoagulability in the context of cancer and foreign body in SVC.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. SVC syndrome: This is likely due to a clot in the SVC, for which tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) has been started by interventional radiology (IR). The plan is to continue efforts to dissolve the clot overnight and reposition the catheter. The patient should be monitored for bleeding.
2. Pleural effusions: The patient has developed new pleural effusions, along with a small pericardial effusion. The etiology is unclear but may be related to SVC syndrome, possibly due to thoracic duct obstruction or pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient will be monitored closely.
3. Sinus tachycardia: The patient is experiencing a stable sinus tachycardia, which is likely intravascularly dry despite receiving several fluid boluses"

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with acute myeloid leukemia post stem cell transplant, who is experiencing complications such as SVC syndrome, thromboembolism, and hypertension. He is currently receiving localized TPA and hepatic anticoagulation therapy. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure of 131/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals full neck lymphatic vessels, absence of pulses in the right arm, and left arm with more pronounced swelling. The patient has crackles at the bases of his lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, and muscle wasting and atrophy in his lower extremities. Neurological examination was not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 326 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, platelet count of 26 K/uL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 15 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated creatinine, slightly low potassium levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's medications include furosemide, TPA, cyclosporin, atovaquone, voriconazole, acyclovir, and prednisone.

The patient's assessment and plan involve ongoing therapy for SVC syndrome, thromboembolism,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with facial swelling. The patient has a history of leukemia and is currently undergoing treatment for thromboembolism. The note mentions that the patient's sheath was placed in IR via right chest Hickman catheter and heparin is infusing through the sheath, while TPA is infusing through the catheter. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/83 mmHg to 146/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 94%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 6,820 mL, output of 3,200 mL, and a positive balance of 3,620 mL.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, scleral edema improving, facial swelling improved, and prominent chin. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds, peripheral pulses not assessed, respiratory chest examination is clear with no crackles or diminished breath sounds on the right side. Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Extremities show absent pulses on both sides, cyanosis, and bilateral upper extremity swelling more pronounced on the left side. Skin examination is warm, and neurologic examination is attentive but with difficulty following simple commands and responding. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal sodium and potassium levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels. The platelet count is within normal range. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, liver enzymes, and electrolytes are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include thromboembolism, acute leukemia, benign hypertension, superior vena cava syndrome (SVC), and other tachycardia. The patient has a history of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the provided information include:
1. Thromboembolism: The patient is currently being treated for thromboembolism, indicating the possibility of blood clots forming in the veins, which can lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
2. Acute leukemia: The patient has a diagnosis of acute leukemia, which can lead to complications such as bone marrow failure, increased risk of infections, bleeding disorders, and organ damage.
3. Superior vena cava syndrome (SVC): The patient's facial swelling and prominent chin suggest possible compression of the superior vena cava, leading to impaired blood flow from the head, neck, and upper extremities back to the heart. This can cause swelling, cyanosis, and other symptoms related to venous congestion.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart"

   # SVC syndrome: likely due to hypercoagulability in the context of
   cancer and foreign body in SVC. No evidence of respiratory compromise.
   - SVC clot on CT, TPA started by IR
   - follow IR recs overnight, will go return for continued efforts to
   dissolve clot and reposition catheter

   # Pleural Effusions - new, with small pericardial effusion, unclear
   etiology likely related to SVC syndrome , possible thoracic duct
   obstruction v PE as well, will monitor closely

   # Sinus tachycardia
 stable, asymptomatic, not hypoxic. likely
   intravascularly dry though fluids net positive for admission, received
   several boluses with limited benefit.  Also, concern for PE in setting
   of SVC clot.  Pt has not had formal CTA for PE at this time but would
   not likely change long-term management as he will likely require
   longterm anticoagulation for SVC syndrome.
   -               touch base with onc and IR about ? of acute systemic
   anticoagulation for possible PE
   -               consider  possibly trying to coordinate with IR for CTA
   of lungs to r/o PE if pt increasingly symptomatic
   -               increased maintenance fluids to 125 cc/hr
   # AML: recent bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2116-12-14**] revealed no
   evidence for leukemia and he is [**Age over 90 **]% donor by a cytogenetics.

   # Pulmonary. Recent RSV pneumonia also concern for BOOP in the past.
   No O2 requirement.
   - atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis and Voriconazole for fungal coverage
   along with acyclovir for zoster prophylaxis.
   - continue Prednisone for BOOP
   .
   # GVHD. Mr. [**Known lastname 1166**] has no indications for active GVHD at

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who recently underwent a matched unrelated allogeneic transplant. The patient's current condition includes superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, which is likely due to hypercoagulability in the context of cancer and foreign body in the SVC. There is no evidence of respiratory compromise.

The patient's recent medical history includes complications of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and a recent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The patient's symptoms include facial swelling, dry mouth, non-productive cough, and nightmares.

The patient's vital signs indicate sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 112 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 139/83 mmHg to 97/68 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is at 94% on nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine level. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Thromboembolism: The patient has an SVC clot and is on TPA (tissue plasminogen activator) to dissolve the clot. There is a risk of bleeding and further thromboembolic events.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a matched unrelated allogeneic transplant five months ago. He presented with facial swelling and was found to have bilateral upper extremity swelling, which resolved after thrombolytic therapy and balloon stenting. The patient has been diagnosed with [**Known lastname 1221**] syndrome, a condition characterized by hypercoagulability, likely due to cancer and foreign body in the Hickman line. He is currently on systemic anticoagulation with heparin and his Hickman line has been removed.

Potential Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's symptoms, including sinus tachycardia and bilateral upper extremity swelling, may suggest the possibility of a pulmonary embolism. The presence of [**Name (NI) 1221**] syndrome increases the risk of clot formation. A formal computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the lungs may be considered to rule out PE if the patient becomes increasingly symptomatic.

2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has developed new pleural effusions, along with a small pericardial effusion. The cause of these effusions is unclear but may be related to [**Name (NI) 1221**] syndrome, possibly due to thoracic duct obstruction or a pulmonary embolism.

3. Hypercoagulable State:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant (SCT) course complicated by a hepatic issue. He has a history of recent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia and is currently experiencing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, likely due to microemboli. The patient had a Hickman catheter that was removed, and thrombolytic therapy (TPA) was stopped with improvement in the clot as seen on direct imaging by interventional radiology (IR). The patient is now receiving systemic heparin drip through a triple lumen R SC.

24-hour events include the discontinuation of the Hickman catheter and TPA, as well as the initiation of systemic hepatic drip. The patient also received an IV bolus of fluids due to mild tachycardia. Blood cultures were obtained at 10:04 PM.

Medical History:
The patient has allergies to cefepime and has experienced rashes with previous antibiotic use. His last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin at 08:00 AM on [**2117-2-3**]. He is currently receiving heparin sodium at a rate of 1,000 units per hour. Other ICU medications and medical history remain unchanged from admission, except as noted above.
