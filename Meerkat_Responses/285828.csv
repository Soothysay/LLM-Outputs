","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). The patient presented with hypotension and severe sepsis, with a likely source of infection in the pulmonary system. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is currently on invasive ventilation and multi-lumen catheterization. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications, including respiratory failure, ESRD on HD, CAD post-myocardial infarction (MI), chronic systolic CHF, atrial tachycardia, DM, depression, and potential issues related to feeding and gastrointestinal (GI) health.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure, and there is a need to evaluate and treat for possible pneumonia (PNA) as mentioned in the assessment and plan. Close monitoring of ABGs and adjustment of FiO2 to maintain sats >90% is necessary.
2. ESRD on HD: The patient has ESRD and is on HD. The plan includes dialysis while in the ICU, holding nephrotoxic agents, renally dosing medications, and continuing cinacalcet.
3. CAD post-MI: The patient has a history of CAD"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of chronic conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). The patient presented with hypotension and severe sepsis, which appears to be of pulmonary origin. 

The patient's current medical plan includes the following:
- Severe Sepsis: Cover potential source with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and pneumonia (PNA) antibiotics (Vancomycin/Zosyn), follow up sputum gram stain, repeat blood cultures, maintain central venous pressure (CVP) at 18 mmHg, titrate vasopressor (Levophed) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 mmHg, keep central saturation of oxygen (SvO2) >70%, consider dobutamine to increase cardiac output but may promote atrial tachycardia, and maintain good glycemic control.
- Respiratory Failure: Evaluate and treat for possible PNA as above, change to pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) without problem, decrease fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to 40%, assess readiness for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) once sedation weaned off, perform arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis as needed, and perform daily weaning attempts.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, DM, and ESRD on HD. He presented with hypotension and sepsis but has improved and is now off pressors and extubated. His mental status appears normal. The most likely source of infection is pulmonary given the CXR findings. The patient's current medications include HAP PNA antibiotics, ASA, statin, amiodarone, RISS, NPH, sertraline, heparin, PPI, bowel regimen, and cinacalcet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary complications: The patient has moderate right and small left pleural effusions, bibasilar atelectasis, and mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. These findings suggest the possibility of respiratory infections or fluid overload. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory status is necessary.

2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of CAD, CHF, and previous MI. He is on multiple cardiovascular medications including ASA, statin, BB, ACE-I, and amiodarone. Monitoring for signs of cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias is important.

3. Renal complications: The patient is on HD for ESRD. It is essential to monitor renal function and adjust medications accordingly. Holding nephrotoxic agents and maintaining tight glycemic control are also important considerations.

4. Diabetic complications: The patient has poor compliance with"

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a complex medical history including coronary artery disease (CAD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He presented with lethargy and apparent septic shock, which has since resolved. However, new findings on a chest X-ray suggest the possibility of pneumonia (PNA) as a potential source of infection. The abdominal CT scan argues against an abdominal source, although the patient reported experiencing diarrhea before admission.

The patient is currently receiving broad empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin and Zosyn until culture results are definitive. Stool cultures have been ordered for today. The patient has been extubated without difficulty and is doing well. However, he shows evidence of pulmonary edema on the CXR today.

The patient's ESRD is being managed with hemodialysis (HD), which he tolerated yesterday. Given the significant pulmonary edema on the CXR today, another HD run is planned today with a negative balance goal.

The patient's CAD includes a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), so he is not on aspirin. His blood pressure medication and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) were held yesterday. If the patient's blood pressure remains stable with ultrafiltration (UF) today, anti-hypertensive medications will be added back.

The patient's access lines include a multi-lumen line, an 18-gauge line, and an arterial line. The arterial line was inserted at 08"

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who presented with lethargy and apparent septic shock. He is currently in the ICU and is showing signs of improvement. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's recent CXR shows low lung volumes and bilateral opacification, suggesting pulmonary edema. This condition can worsen respiratory function and may require additional interventions.

2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has evidence of a right pleural effusion, as indicated by the CXR findings. Thoracentesis may be necessary to optimize breathing reserve and relieve any pressure on the lungs.

3. Diarrhea: The patient reported experiencing diarrhea before admission, which could indicate an underlying gastrointestinal infection or inflammation. Stool cultures should be checked to identify any potential pathogens.

4. Renal Function: The patient's recent lab results show an elevated creatinine level of 5.2, indicating possible impairment in renal function. Close monitoring of kidney function and adjustment of fluid balance and medications may be necessary.

5. Bloodstream Infection: The patient's central venous catheter (CVC) needs to be closely monitored for any signs of infection, as evidenced by the elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid level. Cultures should be obtained to rule out bloodstream infection.

6. Cardiovascular Status: The patient's history"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, DM, and ESRD on HD who presented with hypotension and sepsis. He is now much improved, off pressors, extubated, and has a normal mental status. The patient has multiple medical conditions including sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%, atrial tachycardia, diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperkalemia, depression, and femoral hernia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with hypotension and evidence of hypoperfusion, but improved with fluids. It is unclear about the etiology of sepsis, but it appears to be related to a pulmonary source. The patient is being treated with appropriate antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a long history of GIB, likely due to multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated with thermal ablation. There is no evidence of ongoing bleeding or hemodynamic instability.
3. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on HD: The patient is volume overloaded during this stay"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a complex medical history including coronary artery disease (CAD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He presented with lethargy and apparent shock, which has since resolved. The patient has been delirious at times, and his respiratory failure has improved since being extubated two days ago. He tolerated hemodialysis (HD) yesterday and has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with known diverticulosis and superior mesenteric artery vascular malformations (SB AVMs). The patient's current issues include potential complications related to his medical conditions, such as hypoglycemia, delirium, and possible infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia this morning, with a blood sugar level of 43. It is important to monitor his fasting serum glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as necessary.
2. Delirium: The patient has been delirious at times, and it is necessary to assess and manage this condition promptly. This may involve further investigations, such as checking stool cultures, imaging studies, and monitoring for potential causes like infections or medication side effects.
3. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient has improved since being extubated, he still requires supplemental oxygen. It is essential to continue monitoring his respiratory status and assess any underlying causes for his respiratory failure, such as pulmonary edema or pleural eff"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presented with hypotension and sepsis, which has since improved. He is extubated and showing normal mental status.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis - The patient had hypotension with evidence of initial hypoperfusion, but improved with fluids. The etiology is unclear, but most likely pulmonary. He remains afebrile, and his chest X-ray shows worsening pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. He will continue with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) for an 8-day course. Blood cultures (NGTD) will be followed up, and consideration will be given to tapping pleural effusions or evaluating for loculations with ultrasound.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) - The patient has a long history of GIB with multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) after thermal ablation. No evidence of ongoing bleeding, stable hematocrit levels. Stool Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test has been ordered, and the patient will maintain active stool sample for testing. Access with two large peripherally inserted intravenous (PIV) lines will be maintained, and gastrointestinal evaluation will be done today. Aspirin and subcutaneous heparin will be held, and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) will be continued.
3. ESRD on HD - The patient's dry weight is 66 kg, and he appears more volume overloaded during this stay. He received HD yesterday, tolerated well, but his chest X-ray looks even more overloaded. Another attempt at HD today will be made. Nephrotoxic agents will be held, medications will be renally dosed, and cinacalcet will continue. Nitroglycerin will be used if florid pulmonary edema develops.
4. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AMS)/delirium - Unclear if related to substance withdrawal or worsening hypoxemia from pulmonary edema. Family will be confirmed regarding any substance use prior to admission. CIWA scale will be continued for now, with caution to avoid benzodiazepine intoxication.
5. CAD s/p MI - Continue medical management with statin. If possible today, po labetolol will be added back, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) will be held.
6. Chronic systolic CHF - EF 30%. Unable to diurese given ESRD. Beta-blocker (BB) as above, holding ACE-I.
7. Atrial tachycardia - Not on Coumadin. Continue amiodarone, restart BB as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presents with hypotension and sepsis but has improved and is now off pressors and extubated. The patient has several medical complications including gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), pulmonary edema, hyperkalemia, depression, and diabetes management issues. He also has a history of atrial tachycardia, chronic systolic CHF, and poor dentition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with hypotension and evidence of hypoperfusion, which improved with fluids. He remains afebrile and has worsening pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, suggesting a possible pulmonary source of infection. He will continue with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) antibiotics.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a long history of GIB with multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated with thermal ablation. No evidence of hemodynamic instability or recurrent bleeding is noted. His hematocrit levels are stable.
3. ESRD on HD: The patient appears volume overloaded, as evidenced by his dry weight being 66 kg and the worsening pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. He received hemodialysis but tolerated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He presented with lethargy and signs of shock, which have since resolved. The most likely source of the shock remains left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia. The patient was initially intubated for respiratory failure but was successfully extubated two days ago and has been doing well.

The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) was evaluated through an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which showed no signs of active bleeding. However, he has had some episodes of hypertension that responded to intravenous hydralazine. His blood counts are stable, and he has received broad empiric coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.

The patient's other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus (DM), which is currently managed with sliding scale regular insulin. He also has a right-sided pleural effusion contributing to his oxygen requirement. It is planned to tap the effusion to improve respiratory function.

The patient's delirium has improved, and there is no recent history of alcohol use. His ESRD is being managed with hemodialysis (HD), and he tolerated the session yesterday. The plan is for another HD session on Monday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's large right-sided pleural effusion could continue"
