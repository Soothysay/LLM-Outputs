","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She presents with hypotension, tachypnea, and altered mental status. The patient has an indwelling port (PortaCath) placed on 02/26/2116. Her vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent 36.7°C (98°F), HR 93 bpm (91-108 bpm), BP 116/59 mmHg (73-139/82-89 mmHg), RR 36 breaths per minute (19-36 breaths per minute), SpO2 98%. She is receiving oxygen via a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals warm and well-perfused skin, clear lungs, distended abdomen, and diminished right upper extremity strength. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, leukocytosis, anemia, hypernatremia, and acute kidney injury. Imaging studies show decreased left-sided atelectasis and no evidence of pneumonia or pleural effusions. Microbiology reports indicate the presence of Staphylococcus coagulase-negative and Corynebacterium species in the urine culture. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, leukocytosis, altered mental status, acute renal insufficiency, hypernatremia, anemia, and hypertension.

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She presents with hypotension, tachypnea, and altered mental status. The patient has an indwelling port, which was inserted on [**2116-2-26**] at 08:25 PM. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), a current temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), a heart rate of 93 bpm with a range of 91-108 bpm, a blood pressure of 116/59 mmHg with previous readings ranging from 73/47 mmHg to 139/82 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute with a range of 19-36 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has received Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) as her last dose of antibiotics, administered at 04:00 AM on [**2116-2-27**].

Her lab results show a white blood cell count of 14.4 K/uL, a hematocrit of 26.1%, a platelet count of 122 K/uL, creatinine of 2.3 mg/dL, glucose of 97 mg/dL, sodium of 122 mEq/L, potassium of 17 mEq/L, chloride of 5.2 mEq/L, magnesium of 12 mg/dL, calcium of 7.2 mg/dL, phosphate of 4.6 mg/dL, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5.

Her urine culture shows the presence of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium species, both in high numbers. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including oxacillin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, vancomycin, and tetradecane.

The patient's imaging reveals left-sided atelectasis, but no newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia. There is also no evidence of pleural effusions or an enlarged cardiac silhouette.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is concerning for early sepsis. Given her recent neutropenia and urinary tract infection, the most likely etiology would be bacteremia from the same organism. However, her distended abdomen raises concern for spontaneous perforation masked by steroids. Other possible causes include adrenal insufficiency. The patient is responding to fluid boluses and volume resuscitation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and Zosyn, have been initiated for suspected intra-abdominal source.

 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER:  Diffuse B cell lymphoma with CNS

   hypodense lesion in right frontal lobe.  Waiting for final read.
DELERIUM/UNRESPONSIVENESS:  It remains unclear as to etiology of her
   intermittent alterations in mental status albeit likely
   multifactorial.  Is still supratherapeutic on dilantin.  Also receiving
   keppra with worsening renal function, may be contributing as well.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to narcotics/benzodiazepines given overnight.  Holding
   sedating medications.  Also possible seizures, continuous  EEG
   planned.  Not clear what new hypodensity seen on preliminary read, need
   to review with neuroradiologist.  Doubt CNS infecdtion given recent
   unremarkable LP findings.  Hypernatremia may also contribute.  Decrease
   keppra dose. Continue to hold dilantin and follow levels.  Keep HOB
   elevated at 30 degrees for aspiration precautions, monitor in ICU to be
   sure she is not in status or having intermittent seizures with
   continuous EEG monitoring.
HYPERNATREMIA:  Calculate free water deficit, replace half of deficit
   in next 24 hours, serial electrolytes.
ANEMIA: Hct decreased, may be dilutional as she did receive some
   IVFs.  Will GAS, check repeat Hct in 6 hours. PPI.
RENAL FAILURE:  Cr continues to increase.  Likely in part due to prior
   hypotension and component of ATN.  Volume status not clear.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   prerenal.  Send urine electrolytes, sediment.  Renal US to rule out
   obstructing lesion.  Consult renal.  Check random vanco.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of malignancy, specifically diffuse B-cell lymphoma with central nervous system involvement. They have been admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status, which has been intermittent and likely multifactorial in etiology. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slightly elevated blood pressure and normal heart rate and respiratory rate. They have pinpoint pupils bilaterally, indicating potential opioid or benzodiazepine use. The patient's abdominal exam shows distention, and their neurologic exam reveals minimal responsiveness to sternal rub and no assessed movement or tone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Unresponsiveness: The patient's intermittent alterations in mental status could be due to various factors such as supratherapeutic dilantin levels, worsening renal function, narcotics/benzodiazepines, seizures, hypernatremia, or CNS infection. Continuous EEG monitoring is planned to assess for possible seizures.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may contribute to their altered mental status. Calculating the free water deficit and replacing half of it in the next 24 hours is recommended, along with serial electrolyte monitoring.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has decreased, which could be dilutional due to receiving IV fluids. A complete blood count (CBC) with gas analysis (GAS) should be performed, and the repeat Hct"

   obtundation and altered mental status.
   .
   #. UNRESPONSIVENESS: Given known CNS lymphoma, concerning for
   hemorrhagic event or critical mass effect. These however appear
   unlikely given overall regression on prior imaging and lack of systemic
   anticoagulation. Seizure also likely cause, although no movemet of
   limbs or eyes has been noted. Patient continues on Keppra and is
   therapeutic on Dilantin. Most likely multifactorial with strong
   contribution from low dose IV Ativan and IV Morphine given for
   tachypnea. Would also consider Keppra as contributor as patient was
   receiving 750mg Q12H in spite of worsening renal function and GFR.
   Otherwise pt has been hypernatremic to 150, not responsive of 2L of
   free water. Pt may have Central DI.

 currently 150, Pt received D5W @ 150ml/h about 2L
   worth, w/o any change in Na level, continue to be 150. Pt may be
   starting to have Central DI.
   - renal wants to try DDVAP to check for DI
   - continue fluids at current rate D5W @ 150ml/h
   .
   # CKD: Baseline appears to be 1-1.3 and Cr currently 2.5. FeNa 4%
   likely ATN.- pt transiently hypotensive 36hrs ago, timing of renal
   injury preceeded this event. Urine sediment without EOS.No recent
   contrast dye load. Amyloidosis also possible w/ elevated
   b2-microglobulin, hyperglossia, ARF.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She presents with resolved hypotension, tachypnea, and now has profound obtundation and altered mental status. 

The patient has been on various medications including Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Heparin Sodium, and others. Her vital signs show a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 98/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The physical examination reveals an obtunded African American female with warm and well-perfused skin, no rashes, and no signs of distress. Neurological examination shows negative dolls eye reflex, no withdrawal to pain, and gaze slightly disconjugate with the left eye outwardly deviated. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium levels. The patient's sodium level is 150, which is higher than normal. Other labs show normal or slightly elevated levels of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. 

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications that can arise, such as unresponsiveness, hypernatremia, acute kidney injury (CKD), urinary tract infection/cystitis, syncope"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female with a history of Diffuse B cell lymphoma with CNS
   involvement, with resolved hypotension, tachypnea, now with profound
   obtundation and altered mental status.
   .
   #. UNRESPONSIVENESS: Given known CNS lymphoma, concerning for
   hemorrhagic event or critical mass effect. These however appear
   unlikely given overall regression on prior imaging and lack of systemic
   anticoagulation. Seizure also likely cause, although no movemet of
   limbs or eyes has been noted. Patient continues on Keppra and is
   therapeutic on DilantinMost likely multifactorial with strong
   contribution from low dose IV Ativan and IV Morphine given for
   tachypnea. Would also consider Keppra as contributor as patient was
   receiving 750mg Q12H in spite of worsening renal function and GFR.
   Other considerations include ongoing infection, electrolyte disorders,
   currently not uremic or hypercarbic.
   -- F/U Cultures
   -- F/U Final head CT read
   -- EEG to r/o status epilepticus
   -- Correct hypocalcemia
   -- Would adjust Keppra dose to 500mg
   -- Continue holding dilantin (Dilantin correction = measured level / [
   (0.2 x albumin) + 0.1], currently 25.5)
   .
   # Syncope/Seizure: Continue Keppra, currently holding dilantin given
   supra-therpeutic levels (in setting of hypoalbuminemia)
   -- EEG now
   -- Dilantin on hold as above
   -- Keppra
   .
   # CKD: Baseline appears to be 1-1.3 and Cr currently 2.5. Unlikely to
   be entirely pre-renal given lack of improvement with volume repletion.
   Although patient was transiently hypotensive 36hrs ago, timing of renal
   injury preceeded this event. Urine sediment without EOS.No recent
   contrast dye load
   -- Consider renal ultrasound to evaluate for hydronephrosis, although
   CT scan with small bilateral cysts but no obstruction
   -- Would consider renal consultation
   -- Renally dose medications (Keppra, Abx)
   .
   # UTI/Cystitis: No further positive blood cultures, last specimen coag
   negative staph (pen resistant)
   -- Continue Broad spectrum antibiotics in setting of unexplained
   obtundation, would tighten spectrum if cultures negative in 24hrs.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease.
   .
   # CN Lymphoma/Left Basal Ganglia Mass: Patient is s/p C3D1 Alimenta on
   [**2-13**]. No plans for inpatient treatement at this time

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. The patient's current condition includes profound obtundation and altered mental status. The note details the patient's medical history, medications, allergies, laboratory results, and imaging findings.

The patient has been experiencing unresponsiveness, which could be due to a hemorrhagic event or critical mass effect from the CNS lymphoma. However, these causes appear unlikely given the regression on prior imaging and lack of systemic anticoagulation. Seizures are also a possible cause, but no movement of limbs or eyes has been observed. The patient is currently on Keppra and is therapeutic on Dilantin. Low dose IV Ativan and IV Morphine given for tachypnea may also contribute to the unresponsiveness, considering the patient's worsening renal function and GFR.

Other considerations for the unresponsiveness include ongoing infection, electrolyte disorders, and not being uremic or hypercarbic. The plan is to follow up with cultures, read the final head CT, perform an EEG to rule out status epilepticus, correct hypocalcemia, adjust Keppra dose to 500mg, and continue holding Dilantin due to supra-therapeutic levels in the setting of hypoalbuminemia.

In terms of potential medical complications, the note mentions several areas of concern:

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with altered mental status. The patient has a history of lymphoma, which was recently treated. The patient's mental status has improved since the previous day, but they are still receiving H2O for hypernatremia and undergoing continuous EEG. The patient's allergies are not documented. The patient has received various antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and piperacillin. The patient is currently on heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis and pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal insufficiency/progressing towards failure: The patient's creatinine levels are worsening, indicating potential renal dysfunction. This may require further investigation and management to prevent the progression of renal failure.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, leading to hypernatremia. Correcting this condition is essential to prevent neurological complications.
3. Diabetes Insipidus (DI): There is an interest in treating DI in the patient. The use of desmopressin (ddAVP) is planned to address this condition.
4. Cystitis: The patient is being treated with Zosyn for cystitis. Completing the full course of antibiotics is necessary to effectively treat the infection.
5. Lymphoma: The patient recently underwent treatment for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with altered mental status. The patient's medical history includes lymphoma, recently treated, as well as cystitis, currently being treated with Zosyn for seven days. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/56 to 151/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prevention, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels are worsening, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Continued supportive care is advised.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which needs to be corrected. Continued water administration and the use of ddAVP are planned to address this issue.
3. Cystitis: The patient is being treated with Zosyn for a complete seven days to manage cystitis.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved since the morning, but EEG is still ongoing. Holding Kepra and Dilantin, correcting hypernatremia, and obtaining imaging are part of the management plan.
5. Lymphoma: The patient recently received treatment for lymphoma, but further information"

 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   76 year old female with a history of Diffuse B cell lymphoma with CNS
   involvement, with resolved hypotension, tachypnea, now with profound
   obtundation and altered mental status.
   .
   #. UNRESPONSIVENESS: Given known CNS lymphoma, concerning for
   hemorrhagic event or critical mass effect. These however appear
   unlikely given overall regression on prior imaging and lack of systemic
   anticoagulation. Seizure also likely cause, although no movemet of
   limbs or eyes has been noted. Patient continues on Keppra and is
   therapeutic on Dilantin. Most likely multifactorial with strong
   contribution from low dose IV Ativan and IV Morphine given for
   tachypnea. Would also consider Keppra as contributor as patient was
   receiving 750mg Q12H in spite of worsening renal function and GFR.
   Otherwise pt has been hypernatremic to 150, not responsive of 2L of
   free water. Pt may have Central DI.
   - Keppra decreased dose to 500mg
   - D/c
d Vanco given high random level of 44
   - Yesterday (Dilantin correction = measured level / [ (0.2 x albumin) +
   0.1],  =25.5, will recheck today
   # Hypernatremia
 currently 150, Pt received D5W @ 150ml/h about 2L
   worth, w/o any change in Na level, continue to be 150. Pt may be
   starting to have Central DI.
   - renal wants to try DDVAP to check for DI
   - continue fluids at current rate D5W @ 150ml/h
   .
   # CKD: Baseline appears to be 1-1.3 and Cr currently 2.5. FeNa 4%
   likely ATN.- pt transiently hypotensive 36hrs ago, timing of renal
   injury preceeded this event. Urine sediment without EOS.No recent
   contrast dye load. Amyloidosis also possible w/ elevated
   b2-microglobulin, hyperglossia, ARF.
   - Renal US negative
   - F/u renal recs
   - Renally dose medications (Keppra, Abx)
   # UTI/Cystitis: No further positive blood cultures, last specimen coag
   negative staph (pen resistant)

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She was previously hypotensive and tachypneic, but now presents with profound obtundation and altered mental status. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 120/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Her general appearance is described as obtunded with warm and well-perfused skin. She has conjunctival suffusion, patent nares, and no other remarkable findings. The patient's cardiac examination reveals regular rhythm and no murmurs. Lung examination shows rhonchi and upper airway congestion. Abdominal examination reveals distention and hyperechoic bowel without grimacing on palpation. Neurological examination shows negative dolls eye reflex and no withdrawal to pain. 

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 238 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 24.2%, platelet count of 122 K/uL, creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL, blood glucose of 99 mg/dL, sodium of 150 mEq/L, potassium of 3.0 mEq/L, chloride of 99 mg/dL, bicarbonate of 20 mEq/L, magnesium of 1.7 mg/dL, phosphate of 4.0 mg/dL, BUN of 15 mg/dL, creatinine clearance of 22.0 mL/min, total protein of 7.6 g/dL, albumin of 2.4 g/dL, calcium of 7.4 mg/dL, and magnesium of 1.7 mg/dL. 

The patient is currently on several medications including heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam. She has a history of antibiotic use including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin.

The patient's recent events include the administration of DDAVP to check for diabetes insipidus, a rising white blood cell count, and a falling hematocrit. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Unresponsiveness: The patient's profound obtundation and altered mental status could be due to a hemorrhagic event or critical mass effect. However, these are unlikely given the regression on prior imaging and lack of systemic anticoagulation. Seizure is also a possible cause, although no movement of limbs or eyes has been noted. The patient is already on Keppra and therapeutic on Dilantin. Low dose IV Ativan and IV Morphine given for tachypnea may also contribute to the unresponsiveness. Additionally, Keppra at 750 mg Q12H in the setting of worsening renal function and GFR may also be a contributing factor. Central DI should be considered as the patient has been hypernatremic to 150 without any response to 2L of free water. 
- Decrease Keppra to 500 mg.
- Discontinue Vancomycin due to high random level of 44.
- Recheck Dilantin levels today.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is currently at 150 mEq/L despite receiving D5W at 150 ml/h for 2L. This suggests the possibility of central diabetes insipidus.
- Try DDVAP to check for DI.
- Continue fluids at the current rate of D5W at 150 ml/h.

3. CKD: The patient's baseline creatinine appears to be 1-1.3 and her current creatinine is 2.5. FeNa is 4%, which is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient was transiently hypotensive 36 hours ago, and the timing of renal injury preceded this event. Urine sediment does not show any eosinophils. There is no recent contrast dye load, and amyloidosis is also a possibility with elevated b2-microglobulin, hyperglossia, and acute renal failure.
- Perform renal ultrasound to check for any abnormalities.
- Follow up with renal recommendations.
- Renal dose medications (Keppra, antibiotics).

4. UTI/Cystitis: No further positive blood cultures were found, with the last specimen showing coag negative staph (penicillin resistant).
- Change antibiotics to levofloxacin for 7 days.

5. Syncope/Seizure: Continue Keppra, currently holding Dilantin due to supra-therapeutic levels (in the setting of hypoalbuminemia). Continue continuous EEG monitoring.
- Follow up with EEG results.
- Follow up with neurologic recommendations.

6. Constipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement for days. An enema was attempted on the floor without success. Another enema will be tried today.

7. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia of chronic disease.

8. CN Lymphoma/Left Basal Ganglia Mass: The patient underwent C3D1 alimentation on [2-13]. No plans for inpatient treatment at this time.

9. HTN: Hold all antihypertensives.

10. FEN: NPO for now.

11. PPX: Provide DVT prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin and bowel regimen.

12. ACCESS: The patient has PIV's.

13. CODE STATUS: Full code.

14. EMERGENCY CONTACT: [Name (NI)], [Name (NI) 5276].

15. DISPOSITION: The patient will remain in the ICU for now."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She presented with hypotension and tachypnea, which have resolved, but now she is experiencing profound obtundation and altered mental status. The patient has multiple medical complications including unresponsiveness, hypernatremia, tachypnea, renal failure, leukocytosis, UTI/cystitis, anemia, CN lymphoma/left basal ganglia mass, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unresponsiveness: The patient's profound obtundation and altered mental status may be due to CNS lymphoma or a hemorrhagic event. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels (hypernatremia) likely caused by central diabetes insipidus (DI) due to invasion of the hypothalamus by malignancy. Daily administration of DDAVP and careful monitoring of sodium levels are necessary.
3. Tachypnea: The patient's rapid breathing may be a baseline characteristic or related to central causes. Pulmonary edema and worsening tachypnea should be addressed, and fluid intake needs to be managed carefully.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal failure, possibly secondary to transient hypotension. Renal US results were negative, and medications should be adjusted based on renal function.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple health concerns. They have a history of lymphoma, which has recently been treated. The patient also has altered mental status, with no significant improvement and is currently on Kepra. There are ongoing efforts to correct hypernatremia, and imaging results remain unchanged, with consideration for an MRI. The patient is experiencing renal insufficiency, progressing towards failure, with worsening creatinine levels. The cause of renal insufficiency is unclear, but urine output and sodium levels have improved with the administration of ddAVP. An ultrasound shows reassuring results, and further discussion with a renal specialist is planned. The patient also has cystitis and is currently receiving treatment with Zosyn. Antibiotic therapy has been completed for a duration of 7 days, and follow-up is recommended. Additionally, the patient is experiencing respiratory alkalosis, which appears to be of neurological origin. ICU care includes maintaining the patient's nutrition through NPO status due to mental status, managing glycemic control, and monitoring lines. Prophylaxis measures include boots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer treatment, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B-cell lymphoma and central nervous system involvement. She has been admitted to the ICU due to hypotension, tachypnea, profound obtundation, and altered mental status. 

The patient's current conditions include unresponsiveness, likely due to CNS lymphoma progression or hemorrhagic event/critical mass effect. She has been given IV Ativan and IV Morphine for tachypnea. Her hypernatremia is due to new central diabetes insipidus, with a sodium level of 150. Seizure likelihood is less likely given no EEG findings and therapeutic medication dosages. 

The patient also has leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 17, and is hypotensive and hypothermic. Her line was changed yesterday, and she does not show signs of infection. She will be recultured, and her Vancomycin level will be rechecked. 

Tachypnea is believed to be compensatory to metabolic acidosis, possibly caused by renal failure and starvation ketoacidosis. 

The patient has hypernatremia confirmed central DI, with a sodium level of 145. This is presumed to be due to invasion of malignancy into the hypothalamus. 

Acute renal failure is suspected, with a creatinine level of 2.9. 

The patient has anemia of chronic disease with poor ret"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B-cell lymphoma and central nervous system involvement. She has multiple medical complications and ongoing management of her condition.

1. Central Diabetes Insipidus (DI): The patient has confirmed central DI, likely due to invasion of malignancy into the hypothalamus. She is currently being treated with 4mg DDAVP daily, but her sodium level remains high at 146. Free water administration will be necessary, but careful monitoring is required due to the risk of developing hyponatremia after acute renal failure resolves.

2. Tachypnea: The patient's tachypnea appears to be her baseline and may be related to central causes. It has worsened in the setting of pulmonary edema. The patient has received Lasix to address this issue.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 3.0, indicating acute kidney injury. FeNa is 4%, suggesting ATN (acute tubular necrosis) due to transient hypotension. Renal ultrasound is negative, eosinophils are negative, and there was no recent contrast exposure. Renal dosing of medications will be necessary.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, but she is afebrile, and cultures are negative. She has completed a course of antibiotics for urinary tract"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B cell lymphoma and CNS involvement.
- She presented with hypotension, tachypnea, and now has profound obtundation and altered mental status.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 110/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on 3L NC.
- The patient has received various treatments including antibiotics, blood products, and IV fluids.
- She has been diagnosed with unresponsiveness, likely multifactorial in etiology, possibly due to CNS lymphoma or a critical mass effect.
- Other conditions include leukocytosis, tachypnea, hypernatremia, metabolic acidosis, anemia, and hypertension.
- Imaging shows increased fluid overload on CXR.
- The patient's code status is full.
- She is currently on tube feeds and receiving prophylactic heparin for DVT prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unresponsiveness: The patient's profound obtundation and altered mental status may be due to CNS lymphoma or a critical mass effect. Further evaluation and management are necessary.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count continues to rise, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Cultures have been negative, so alternative causes"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female with a history of Diffuse B cell lymphoma with CNS
   involvement, with resolved hypotension, tachypnea, now with profound
   obtundation and altered mental status.
   .
   #. Hypotension: WBC continue to rise, today 17.9, hypothermic. However
   cultures neg, CXR without infiltrate. Line recently, not erythematous.
   No diarrhea or recent broad antibiotics.  Recently finished course of
   Cipro for UTI.
   - CVL with pressors per CVP >65
   - repanculture
   - Vanc and zosyn started today
   - CT torso to look for source of sepsis
   - endocrine consult to eval cortisol level central vs adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - cortisol replacement once necessary labs are ordered
   #Respiratory distress: Tachypnea likely central, compensatory to
   metabolic acidosis, and fluid overload for DI and hypotension.  Now
   with worsening hypoxia and smaller volume breaths requiring intubation.
   - A line in place, ABGs and adjust vent prn
   - Metabolic acidosis both AG and and non-AG, likely due to renal
   failure and possibly starvation ketoacidosis although ketones trace
   - CXR with improved fluid s/p positive pressure.
   #. UNRESPONSIVENESS: Now sedated. Initially unclear etiology, likely
   multifactorial
   CNS lymphoma, progressing based on new DI, concerning for hemorrhagic
   event or critical mass effect, but not anticoagulated and no new masses
   on imaging.
   IV Ativan and IV Morphine given for tachypnea
   Keppra not adjusted to renal failure
   Hypernatremia to 150 due to new central DI
   Seizure
  less likely given no EEG findings, therapeutic on meds
   - Keppra decreased dose to 500mg per renal failure
   - Dilantin held until corrected level normal, recheck today
   - Vancomycin per levels
   - f/u EEG results, now stopped
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - MRI
   # Hypernatremia
 Confirmed Central DI based on response in Na, osms
   and urine output to DDAVP. Presumed to be due to invasion of malignancy
   into hypothalamus
   - Continue 4mg DDAVP daily with free water repletion given NPO status
   and unclear thirst mechanism
   - will check [**Hospital1 **] Na and urine Osm daily
   - After acute renal failure resolves, will be in danger of becoming
   hyponatremic
 will need to follow carefully and adjust free
   water/DDAVP.
   # [**Doctor First Name **]: Baseline appears to be 1-1.3 and now plateaued at 2.9,
   plateuing. FeNa 4% likely ATN due to transient hypotension.
   - Renal US negative, eos neg, no contrast exposure
   - F/u renal recs
   - Renally dose medications
   # Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease with poor reticulocytosis.
   Responded appropriately to pRBCs
   # CN Lymphoma/Left Basal Ganglia Mass: Patient is s/p C3D1 Alimenta on

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. The patient's current condition includes profound obtundation and altered mental status. 

The patient has experienced several medical complications, including hypotension, tachypnea, hypothermia, hypernatremia, anemia, and respiratory distress. The respiratory distress has progressed to the point where intubation was required. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels, including low potassium and high sodium levels. 

Imaging studies reveal increased fluid overload on the chest X-ray. 

The patient's assessment and plan include addressing hypotension with vasopressors and reculture, starting Vancomycin and Zosyn, obtaining a CT torso to identify the source of sepsis, and consulting endocrinology for cortisol levels to evaluate central vs. adrenal insufficiency. 

For respiratory distress, the patient has been intubated, and ABGs will be monitored with adjustments to the ventilator as needed. Metabolic acidosis is present, likely due to renal failure and possibly starvation ketoacidosis. 

The patient's unresponsiveness is multifactorial, likely due to CNS lymphoma, progressing based on new DI, concerning for hemorrhagic event or critical mass effect. However, no new masses were noted on imaging. 

Hypernatremia was confirmed to be central diabetes insipidus (DI) based on the response to DDAVP and presumed to be due to invasion of malignancy into the hypothalamus. 

Acute renal failure has been identified, and the patient's sodium levels will need to be closely monitored due to the risk of becoming hyponatremic once acute renal failure resolves. 

Anemia is likely anemia of chronic disease with poor reticulocytosis, and the patient responded appropriately to packed red blood cells (pRBCs). 

CN lymphoma/left basal ganglia mass is being monitored without immediate plans for inpatient treatment. 

Hypertension is currently being managed by holding all antihypertensive medications. 

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications."

","The patient is a critically ill individual with altered mental status, requiring intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure and vasopressors due to hypotension. The patient has received various medications including heparin sodium, dextrose 50%, midazolam (versed), fentanyl, ddAVP, and Zosyn. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate within normal range, blood pressure slightly low, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's review of systems is mostly unchanged from admission, except for tachypnea and hypoglycemia. The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, cool skin, and non-tender abdomen. Neurological assessment is not possible due to sedation.

Laboratory results show low hemoglobin levels, elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, low potassium, and low albumin levels. Imaging shows an endotracheal tube in place and no obvious complications. The patient's condition is being managed for respiratory failure, hypotension, and potential infection. They are receiving antibiotics empirically, and a CT scan is pending to evaluate for potential sources of infection. Fluid challenges are being performed to assess best central venous pressure (CVP), and vasopressor weaning is planned.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and catheter"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement.
- She was admitted with hypotension and tachypnea, which have since resolved.
- The patient is now presenting with profound obtundation and altered mental status.
- She requires intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities including adrenal insufficiency and central diabetes insipidus.
- She is receiving various medications and infusions including pressors, antibiotics, and steroids.
- The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, renal failure, and electrolyte imbalances.
- There are concerns regarding potential medical complications such as sepsis, acute tubular necrosis, hypernatremia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, positive blood cultures, and presence of fever suggest the possibility of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential.

2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's rising creatinine levels and low urine output indicate potential renal dysfunction. ATN could be a possible cause, especially considering her recent hypotension and the use of nephrotoxic medications.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to central diabetes insipidus caused"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B cell lymphoma involving the central nervous system (CNS). The patient presented with hypotension, tachypnea, and now has profound obtundation and altered mental status. The patient was intubated for airway protection and started on pressors for hypotension initially on phenylephrine, then levophed. Bradycardia was observed in the 50s while on levophed, but no evidence of heart block was seen on EKG. Stress dose steroids were initiated due to suspected adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 03/03/2116 at 02:30 PM and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 03/04/2116 at 01:09 AM. The patient is currently receiving norepinephrine at 0.03 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications include midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35°C (95°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 129/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's height is 66 inches and central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg. Fluid balance"

   Assessment and Plan 76 year old female with a history of Diffuse B cell
   lymphoma with CNS involvement, with resolved hypotension, tachypnea,
   now with profound obtundation and altered mental status.
   .
   #. Hypotension: WBC continue to rise, today 17.9, hypothermic. However
   cultures neg, CXR without infiltrate. Line recently, not erythematous.
   No diarrhea or recent broad antibiotics.  Recently finished course of
   Cipro for UTI.
   - CVL with pressors per CVP >65
   - repanculture
   - Vanc and zosyn started today
   - CT torso to look for source of sepsis
   - endocrine consult to eval cortisol level central vs adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - cortisol replacement once necessary labs are ordered
   #Respiratory distress: Tachypnea likely central, compensatory to
   metabolic acidosis, and fluid overload for DI and hypotension.  Now
   with worsening hypoxia and smaller volume breaths requiring intubation.
   - A line in place, ABGs and adjust vent prn
   - Metabolic acidosis both AG and and non-AG, likely due to renal
   failure and possibly starvation ketoacidosis although ketones trace
   - CXR with improved fluid s/p positive pressure.
   #. UNRESPONSIVENESS: Now sedated. Initially unclear etiology, likely
   multifactorial
   CNS lymphoma, progressing based on new DI, concerning for hemorrhagic
   event or critical mass effect, but not anticoagulated and no new masses
   on imaging.
   IV Ativan and IV Morphine given for tachypnea
   Keppra not adjusted to renal failure
   Hypernatremia to 150 due to new central DI
   Seizure
  less likely given no EEG findings, therapeutic on meds
   - Keppra decreased dose to 500mg per renal failure
   - Dilantin held until corrected level normal, recheck today
   - Vancomycin per levels
   - f/u EEG results, now stopped
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - MRI
   # Hypernatremia
 Confirmed Central DI based on response in Na, osms
   and urine output to DDAVP. Presumed to be due to invasion of malignancy
   into hypothalamus
   - Continue 4mg DDAVP daily with free water repletion given NPO status
   and unclear thirst mechanism
   - will check [**Hospital1 **] Na and urine Osm daily
   - After acute renal failure resolves, will be in danger of becoming
   hyponatremic
 will need to follow carefully and adjust free
   water/DDAVP.
   # [**Doctor First Name **]: Baseline appears to be 1-1.3 and now plateaued at 2.9,
   plateuing. FeNa 4% likely ATN due to transient hypotension.
   - Renal US negative, eos neg, no contrast exposure
   - F/u renal recs
   - Renally dose medications
   # Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease with poor reticulocytosis.
   Responded appropriately to pRBCs
   # CN Lymphoma/Left Basal Ganglia Mass: Patient is s/p C3D1 Alimenta on
   [**2-13**]. No plans for inpatient treatement at this time
   - discuss prognosis with family and neuroonc attending.
   - consider repeat MRI to eval for change
   .
   # HTN: Holding all antihypertensives.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B cell lymphoma and central nervous system involvement. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

1. Hypotension: The patient initially had hypotension, which has resolved. However, she is now experiencing profound obtundation and altered mental status. This could be due to various factors such as sepsis, central nervous system involvement of lymphoma, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient is receiving vasopressors for hemodynamic support and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient was tachypneic and required intubation due to worsening hypoxia and smaller volume breaths. She is currently on invasive ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. ABGs and ventilation settings need to be closely monitored and adjusted as necessary.

3. Unresponsiveness: The patient is now sedated and unresponsive. Initially, the etiology was unclear, but it is likely multifactorial, including CNS lymphoma progression, hemorrhagic event, or critical mass effect. However, she is not anticoagulated and no new masses are seen on imaging. IV Ativan and IV Morphine have been given for tachypnea, and Keppra dose has been decreased to 500 mg due to renal failure.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 150. This"

   Assessment and Plan 76 year old female with a history of Diffuse B cell
   lymphoma with CNS involvement, with resolved hypotension, tachypnea,
   now with profound obtundation and altered mental status.
   .
   #. Hypotension/ Leukocytosis : WBC continue to rise, today 17.9,
   hypothermic. Line recently, not erythematous. No diarrhea or recent
   broad antibiotics.  Recently finished course of Cipro for UTI. Pt
s CT
   shows infiltrate,  and infection may have been source.  Also pt has
   adrenal insuffiency and hydorcortisone started. Pt may have central
   source causing hypotension [**1-13**] CNS lymphoma.
   - Vanc and zosyn, day # 2
   - continue hydrocortisone 50
   - MAP>65, currently on levophed
   #Respiratory distress: Tachypnea likely central, compensatory to
   metabolic acidosis, and fluid overload for DI and hypotension.
   Metabolic acidosis both AG and and non-AG, likely due to renal failure
   and possibly starvation ketoacidosis although ketones trace.
   - continue  pressor support
 will try to wean as tolerated
   - check ABG and adjust setting accordingly
   #. UNRESPONSIVENESS: Now sedated. Initially unclear etiology, likely
   multifactorial.
   CNS lymphoma, progressing based on new DI, concerning for hemorrhagic
   event or critical mass effect, but not anticoagulated and no new masses
   on imaging. IV Ativan and IV Morphine given for tachypnea. Keppra not
   adjusted to renal failure. Hypernatremia to 150 due to new central DI .
   Seizure
  less likely given no EEG findings, therapeutic on meds
   - Keppra decreased dose to 500mg per renal failure
   - Will restart dilatin
   - Vancomycin per levels
   - f/u EEG results, now stopped
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   #  Bradycardia
 pt has bradycardia while on b-agonist. Unclear cause,
   may also be [**1-13**] central causes.
 avoid BB currently
   # Hypernatremia
 Confirmed Central DI based on response in Na, osms
   and urine output to DDAVP. Presumed to be due to invasion of malignancy
   into hypothalamus
   - Continue 4mg DDAVP daily with free water repletion given NPO status
   and unclear thirst mechanism
   - will check [**Hospital1 **] Na and urine Osm daily
   - After acute renal failure resolves, will be in danger of becoming
   hyponatremic
 will need to follow carefully and adjust free
   water/DDAVP.
   # [**Doctor First Name **]: Baseline appears to be 1-1.3 and now 3.2 from 2.9 FeNa
   previously 4% likely ATN due to transient hypotension, and may have had
   worsening w/ new hypotensive episode
   - Renally dose medications
   - continue to moniter
   # Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease with poor reticulocytosis.
   Responded appropriately to pRBCs
   # CN Lymphoma/Left Basal Ganglia Mass: Patient is s/p C3D1 Alimenta on
   [**2-13**]. No plans for inpatient treatement at this time
   - discuss prognosis with family and neuroonc attending.
   - consider repeat MRI to eval for change
   .
   # HTN: Holding all antihypertensives.

- She was admitted with hypotension, tachypnea, and now presents with profound obtundation and altered mental status.
- The patient has been intubated for airway protection and started on pressors for hypotension, initially on phenylephrine, then levophed.
- She is currently on norepinephrine at 0.03 mcg/kg/min and midazolam for sedation.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35°C (95°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/86 to 106/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm.
- The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency, for which hydrocortisone has been started.
- She has an increased white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection.
- The patient's blood glucose levels are low, ranging from 32 to 184 mg/dL.
- Her electrolyte levels show hypernatremia (150 mEq/L), likely due to central diabetes insipidus caused by malignancy involvement in the hypothalamus.
- The patient has anemia of chronic disease, which responded appropriately to packed red blood cells transfusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B cell lymphoma involving the CNS. She presented with hypotension and tachypnea, which have since resolved. However, she now has profound obtundation and altered mental status. She is currently in the ICU receiving mechanical ventilation and has multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, indicating an infection. She is also receiving antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn), suggesting an ongoing infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There are moderate dependent bibasilar consolidations in the lungs, which are consistent with pneumonia, possibly related to aspiration.
3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has hypernatremia, confirmed central diabetes insipidus (DI) due to basal ganglia lymphoma. She also has acute renal failure.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level and a decreased urine output, indicating acute renal failure. It may be secondary to transient hypotension and subsequent worsening.
5. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm): The patient has a history of diffuse B cell lymphoma with CNS involvement.
6. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia of chronic disease with poor reticulocytosis, responding appropriately to packed red blood cells (pRBCs).

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of Diffuse B cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and tachypnea, and now presents with profound obtundation and altered mental status. The patient has several medical complications that require attention.

1. Sepsis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection. The CT scan shows moderate dependent bibasilar consolidations in the lungs, suggesting pneumonia. The patient may also have a central source of infection causing hypotension, possibly due to CNS lymphoma.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and low respiratory system compliance. The cause of respiratory failure could be related to her underlying condition, such as the pneumonia mentioned above.

3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance, specifically hypernatremia (high sodium levels), which is likely due to central diabetes insipidus caused by the invasion of malignancy into the hypothalamus. This requires careful management to prevent further complications.

4. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output. The cause of renal failure may be multifactorial, including hypotension, sepsis, and potential transient hypotensive episodes.

5. Cancer (Malignant Neopl"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, altered mental status, and diffuse B-cell CNS lymphoma. The patient's hypotension has been managed with stress dose steroids and weaning off pressors. Renal failure is present, with relatively stable creatinine levels. The patient has a history of cancer, specifically diffuse B-cell CNS lymphoma, and is not a candidate for brain XRT at this point. The family has been updated on a daily basis regarding the patient's condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure with probable aspiration due to altered mental status and an inability to protect their airway. Efforts are being made to reduce sedation and place the patient on pressure support ventilation (PSV) if tolerated.
2. Obstructive Bowel Disease: The patient's diarrhea persists, and it is suspected to be secondary to tube feeds. The addition of banana flakes to the nutrition has been ordered, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is being sent for testing.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) is planned when the hematocrit (Hct) falls below 24.
4. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension and central catheterization. Creatinine levels have been relatively stable.
5. Cancer Progression: The patient has diffuse"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B-cell lymphoma involving the CNS. The patient's current condition includes resolved hypotension, tachypnea, profound obtundation, and altered mental status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. There are negative blood cultures since admission, indicating no current infection. However, it is important to monitor for any signs of infection or sepsis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, not ARDS. The patient is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 10/5 well. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance, specifically hypernatremia. This is confirmed to be due to central diabetes insipidus (DI) secondary to basal ganglia lymphoma. The patient's sodium levels and urine osmolarity should be closely monitored.

4. Renal failure: The patient is diagnosed with acute renal failure (ARF), which may be related to transient hypotension and a recent hypotensive episode. Renal dose medications should be adjusted, and renal function should be closely monitored.

5. Cancer (malignant neoplasm): The patient has a history of diffuse B"

   Assessment and Plan
    76 year old female with a history of Diffuse B cell lymphoma with CNS
   involvement, with resolved hypotension, tachypnea, now with profound
   obtundation and altered mental status.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   - Vanc and zosyn, day # 3
   - continue stress dose steroids, now tapering to hydrocort 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   - off levophed x 48h
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Suspected to be secondary to obtundation from CNS lymphoma.
   - Continue PSV for now
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
   - Hypernatremia resolved, likely transient DI in the setting of
   hypothalamic lesion, DDAVP now off, sodium continues to be in 140
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   # Altered mental status: Now sedated. Likely related to primary CNS
   lymphoma.
   - Keppra decreased dose to 500mg per renal failure
   - Restarted dilatin, now IV per neuro onc and nutrition recs
   - Vancomycin per levels
   - f/u EEG results, MRI
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   # Hypernatremia
 Confirmed Central DI based on response in Na, osms
   and urine output to DDAVP. Presumed to be secondary to basal ganglia
   lymphoma.
   - Stopped DDAVP
   - will check [**Hospital1 **] Na and urine Osm daily
   - After acute renal failure resolves, will be in danger of becoming
   hyponatremic
 will need to follow carefully and adjust free
   water/DDAVP.
   # [**Doctor First Name **]: Baseline appears to be 1-1.3 and now 3.2 from 2.9 FeNa
   previously 4% likely ATN due to transient hypotension, and may have had
   worsening w/ new hypotensive episode
   - Renally dose medications
   - continue to moniter
   # Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease with poor reticulocytosis.
   Responded appropriately to pRBCs
   # CN Lymphoma in Left Basal Ganglia: Patient is s/p C3D1 Alimta on [**2-13**].
   No plans for inpatient treatement at this time
   - discuss prognosis with family and neuroonc attending.
   - f/u repeat MRI to eval for change

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She presents with resolved hypotension and tachypnea, but now has profound obtundation and altered mental status. The patient's MRI shows an increase in the size of hypothalamic and right frontal periventricular lesions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (97%), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 126/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,604 mL, with outputs including 1,389 mL of blood products, 464 mL of urine, and 925 mL of NG drainage. She is receiving IV fluids at a rate of 1,232 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her blood glucose level is within normal range. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute renal failure, and central diabetes insipidus. She has also been found to have hypernatremia, which has resolved. Additionally, the patient has anemia, likely due to anemia of chronic disease.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She presented with hypotension, tachypnea, and now has profound obtundation and altered mental status. The patient's corrected dilantin level is 15.9, and there is an increase in size of hypothalamic and right frontal periventricular lesions on MRI. The patient's family has decided to change her goals of care to comfort if there is no improvement over the weekend.

The patient has been on multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and dilantin. Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.1 C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/76 to 149/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 632 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%, and a respiratory system compliance of 63. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.18 and a ventilation efficiency of 13.6 L/min.

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 18.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure secondary to an inability to protect their airway. They have altered mental status and require intubation. The patient has a history of diffuse B-cell lymphoma and is currently receiving treatment in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already present and requires mechanical ventilation support. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not addressed.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status increases the risk of aspiration, leading to aspiration pneumonia. This condition can further compromise respiratory function and lead to additional complications.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient is on stress dose steroids for adrenal insufficiency. If the dosage is not appropriately adjusted, it can result in inadequate treatment or exacerbate the condition.

4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance, particularly with potassium levels. Monitoring and managing electrolyte levels are crucial to prevent complications such as cardiac arrhythmias.

5. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, indicated by an increase in creatinine levels. Acute kidney injury (AKI) can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and increased risk of infections.

6. Cancer Progression: Although the patient has a history of diffuse B-cell lymphoma, their overall fragile state has prevented further therapy. There is a risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She presented with hypotension and tachypnea, which have since resolved. However, she is now experiencing profound obtundation and altered mental status. The patient has been treated with various medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), pantoprazole (Protonix), dilantin, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and heparin sodium. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient has been treated with antibiotics (vancomycin and Zosyn) for suspected sepsis. Her vancomycin level is 28.7, which is within therapeutic range.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is suspected to have acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to obtundation from CNS lymphoma. She is currently on CPAP/PSV mode in the ventilator.
3. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient had hypernatremia, which has since resolved. She also had a transient DI in the setting of hypothalamic lesion and was given DDAVP, but it is now off as her sodium levels are in the normal range.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1-1.3 and now 3.1."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female with a history of Diffuse B cell lymphoma with CNS
   involvement, with resolved hypotension, tachypnea, now with profound
   obtundation and altered mental status.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 Was hypotensive,
   tachycardic, hypothermic and in respiratory failure: likely due to
   aspiration event in setting of unprotected airway and AMS
   - Vanc and zosyn, day # 5 (Vanco level 28.7
 held today)
   - continue stress dose steroids, now tapering to hydrocort 50 [**Hospital1 **],
   likely etiology of persistent leukocytosis.
   - off levophed for several days
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**]) - Suspected to be secondary
   to obtundation from CNS lymphoma.
   - doing well on pressure support, with rate in teens, improved from
   prior central tachypnea
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER - Hypernatremia resolved, likely
   transient DI in the setting of hypothalamic lesion, DDAVP now off,
   sodium continues to be in 140
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Baseline appears to be 1-1.3 and now 3.1. Likely ATN given high FeNa,
   repeated hypotensive episodes.
   - Renally dose medications
   - continue to moniter
   # Altered mental status: Likely related to primary CNS lymphoma.
   Currently able to nod to questions, open eyes on command. Otherwise
   does not follow commands.
   - Keppra decreased dose to 500mg per renal failure
   - Dilantin dosing per albumin corrected levels (9.6 uncorrected, 17.1
   corrected)
 holding today
   - Vancomycin per levels
 high today
   - EEG without seizures
   - MRI with frontal and hypothalamic lesion.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   # Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease with poor reticulocytosis.
   Responded appropriately to pRBCs
   # CN Lymphoma in Left Basal Ganglia: Patient is s/p C3D1 Alimta on [**2-13**].
   No plans for inpatient treatement at this time
   - discuss prognosis with family and neuroonc attending.
   - MRI with incr in size of hypothalamic and R frontal periventricular
   lesions.
   # HTN: Holding all antihypertensives.
   # Goals of care: although has some positive signs of improvement (DI
   resolved, rest rate decreased, slightly more awake), still has no
   therapy options, including radiation as increased intracranial edema
   would be detrimental. Also, even after treatment of aspiration, will
   not have corrected poor protection of airway and will likely have
   recurrence of aspiration.
   - family plans to consider CMO if no neuro improvement over the
   weekend.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She was previously hypotensive, tachypneic, and now presents with profound obtundation and altered mental status. The patient's condition is complicated by severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute renal failure, and altered mental status due to primary CNS lymphoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient is at risk for further complications related to sepsis, including organ dysfunction or failure.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate if she does not respond to current treatment, leading to further respiratory failure.

3. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has experienced hypernatremia, which has since resolved. Close monitoring is required to prevent any future electrolyte imbalances.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels have increased, indicating possible acute renal failure. Ongoing monitoring and adjustment of medications are necessary to ensure proper renal function.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may persist or worsen due to the primary CNS lymphoma. Continuous neurologic evaluation and management are essential.

6. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease, which may require ongoing monitoring and management.

7. CN Lymphoma in Left Basal Ganglia:"

   24 Hour Events:
   - more interactive today, appropriately answering questions with nods.
   Tachypnea and DI have spontaneously resolved!!!
   - family meeting: asked them to start thinking about what to do if
   extubated regarding reintubation. Unsure if they want trach/peg in that
   situation. Options, extubate (monday) and flies vs extubate and fail.
   If fails can become CMO or reintubate and trach. Seem to understand,
   goal to make decision by monday, after watching for more improvement.

   likely etiology of persistent leukocytosis.
   - off levophed for several days
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**]) - Suspected to be secondary
   to obtundation from CNS lymphoma.
   - doing well on pressure support, with rate in teens, improved from
   prior central tachypnea

   transient DI in the setting of hypothalamic lesion, DDAVP now off,
   sodium continues to be in 140

   # Goals of care: although has some positive signs of improvement (DI
   resolved, rest rate decreased, slightly more awake), still has no
   therapy options, including radiation as increased intracranial edema
   would be detrimental. Also, even after treatment of aspiration, will
   not have corrected poor protection of airway and will likely have
   recurrence of aspiration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She presented with hypotension, tachypnea, and profound obtundation, which have since resolved. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support. Her respiratory support has been gradually reduced. She is also receiving IV fluids and has been weaned off vasopressor support.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated platelet count, normal hemoglobin levels, and normal liver function tests. Electrolyte levels are within normal range except for a slightly elevated potassium level. Renal function tests indicate acute kidney injury with an elevated serum creatinine level.

The patient's current medical conditions include severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and acute renal failure. The likely etiology of these conditions is aspiration due to unprotected airway and altered mental status caused by primary CNS lymphoma.

The patient's altered mental status has improved slightly, as she is now able to nod to questions and open her eyes on command. However, she does not follow commands otherwise. An MRI scan revealed frontal and hypothalamic lesions consistent with CNS lymphoma.

The patient's anemia is likely anemia of chronic disease, which responded appropriately to packed red blood cell transfusion. She has a history of hypertension but is currently holding all antihypertensive medications.

   24 Hour Events:
   - more interactive today, appropriately answering questions with nods.
   Tachypnea and DI have spontaneously resolved!!!
   - family meeting: asked them to start thinking about what to do if
   extubated regarding reintubation. Unsure if they want trach/peg in that
   situation. Options, extubate (monday) and flies vs extubate and fail.
   If fails can become CMO or reintubate and trach. Seem to understand,
   goal to make decision by monday, after watching for more improvement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B cell lymphoma involving the CNS. She presented with hypotension, tachypnea, and now has profound obtundation and altered mental status. The patient's respiratory support has improved, and she is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with an FiO2 of 40%. Her vital signs are stable, but she still requires mechanical ventilation. The patient has had several medical complications including sepsis, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and anemia. She also has CN lymphoma in the left basal ganglia and hypertension. The patient's prognosis is poor, and the family is considering options such as continuous mental status monitoring or tracheostomy/peg tube if extubation fails.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient had a severe episode of sepsis with organ dysfunction, which has since resolved. However, she remains at risk for recurrent infections due to her compromised immune system.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient experienced acute renal failure, likely due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis from multiple episodes of hypotension. She required hemodialysis support but is currently stable with a serum creatinine level of 3.[**4-11**].

   # Altered mental status: multifactorial
 related to CNS lymphoma and
   toxic metabolic.  Current improvement from no longer being
   supratherapeutic on anti-convsulants, and improved electrolytes. MRI
   showed incr size of lesions, but NeuroOnc does not think is the cause
   of her AMS. EEG showed no sz. Overall pt not able to get XRT to brain,
   and therefore prognosis poor. Pt stable from yesterday, no longer
   tahcypneic.  Patient is opening eyes, but is not following commands.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B-cell lymphoma and central nervous system involvement. She has had several medical complications and events during her stay in the ICU.

1. Altered mental status: The patient's profound obtundation and altered mental status are multifactorial, related to CNS lymphoma and toxic metabolic causes. Improvement is seen by no longer being supratherapeutic on anticonvulsants and improved electrolytes.

2. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure but has improved now on pressure support and is being considered for extubation. However, prior to extubation, it is important to clarify with the family that the patient will not be reintubated and that either tracheostomy or tracheoesophageal fistula should be considered.

3. Sepsis, severe: The patient had severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which is now resolved. She was hypotensive, tachycardic, hypothermic, and in respiratory failure. The likely cause of sepsis was an aspiration event in the setting of an unprotected airway and altered mental status.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia, which is now resolved. This could have been caused by central diabetes insipidus and was likely helped by mental status improvement.

   Assessment and Plan
   Altered mental status, CNS lymphoma
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**]) -- persistent;
   multifacatorial.  Pneumonia, altered mental status.  Concern for
   ability to protect airway if extubated.  Need to establish plans for
   extubation (need to establish whether reintubation is desired or
   whether comfort would be goal).
   ALTERED  MENTAL STATUS -- unclear etiology, but concerns include CNS
   lymphoma, seizures (post-ictal).  Toxic metabolic causes being
   addressed and reversed.  [**Month (only) 8**] be component of pneumonia (aspiration).
   Monitor.
   SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION) -- pneumonia.  Continue current
   therapy.
   SEIZURES -- now on cepra and dilantin.  Follow dilantin levels.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE  -- resolving, but slow.  Monitor
   CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LYMPHOMA -- s/p XRT.  No further treatment
   options.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, altered mental status, and a history of malignancy (CNS lymphoma). They are intubated and mechanically ventilated.
- The patient has been diagnosed with severe pneumonia and sepsis, with ongoing treatment.
- The patient has had seizures and is being monitored for dilantin levels.
- There is evidence of acute renal failure, which is slowly resolving.
- The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).
- The patient's vital signs and laboratory results are provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
- Barotrauma from mechanical ventilation
- Aspiration pneumonia

2. Infection-related Complications:
- Sepsis leading to organ dysfunction
- Bacteremia or fungemia
- Catheter-related bloodstream infections

3. Neurological Complications:
- Increased intracranial pressure due to CNS lymphoma
- Post-ictal state after seizures
- Delirium or altered mental status

4. Renal Complications:
- Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis or nephrotoxic drugs
- Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression

5. Malignancy-related Complications:
- CNS lymphoma progression or recurrence
- Metastatic spread to other organs
- Secondary infections due to immunosuppression"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, but is poorly responsive. There is an indwelling port (portacath) mentioned, but the specific purpose or significance of it is not clear.

The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, with a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 120/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's cardiovascular system appears to be functioning normally, with no murmurs or irregularities noted. The respiratory system shows clear breath sounds bilaterally.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values appear to be within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes cancer (lymphoma) treated with radiation therapy, and there is a concern for CNS involvement as well. The patient's altered mental status is attributed to various factors such as CNS lymphoma, pneumonia, and potential toxic metabolic causes. Seizures have also been a concern, but are being managed with medication.

The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature and not related to ARDS. There is concern about the ability to protect the airway if extubation occurs. The plan is to proceed with extubation, focusing on comfort care,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU.
- The patient is poorly responsive and has a history of encephalopathy and mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has a Port-a-cath inserted for chemotherapy administration.
- The patient has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate).
- The patient is critically ill with multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure, altered mental status, sepsis with organ dysfunction, renal failure, and malignancy (lymphoma).
- The patient is on several medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and antiepileptic drugs.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, but the respiratory status is concerning.
- The patient's laboratory results indicate some abnormalities, such as elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and barotrauma.
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, indicating a systemic inflammatory response. There is a risk of further deterioration in organ function, including renal failure.
3. Renal Complications: The patient has acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic renal failure if not properly managed.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various causes"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female with a history of Diffuse B cell lymphoma with CNS
   involvement, with resolved hypotension, tachypnea, now with profound
   obtundation and altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status: multifactorial
 related to CNS lymphoma and
   toxic metabolic.  Current improvement from no longer being
   supratherapeutic on anti-convsulants, and improved electrolytes. MRI
   showed incr size of lesions, but NeuroOnc does not think is the cause
   of her AMS. EEG showed no sz. Overall pt not able to get XRT to brain,
   and therefore prognosis poor. Pt stable from yesterday, no longer
   tahcypneic.  Patient is opening eyes, but is not following commands.
   Dilantin level was 5.7 this AM.
   - Dilantin 100mg IV x 1, recheck level in AM
   - f/u NeuroOnc recs
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 Improved now on [**4-14**] of
   pressure support, and optimal time to try extubation.  AMS main
   contributor of keeping pt on vent.  Prior to extubation must clarify w/
   family that will not reintubate
 either trach vs. CMO.
   - Meet with family today
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 now resolved- off levophed
   for several days. Was hypotensive, tachycardic, hypothermic and in
   respiratory failure (alternate explanation [**1-13**] hypothermic /
   hypotensive [**1-13**] brain mets). Previously tx cystitis on this admission,
   this time likely due to aspiration event in setting of unprotected
   airway and AMS
   - Vanc and zosyn, day # 8 (Vanco level 20.8
 held today )
   - check AM vanco trough
   - continue stress dose steroids, cont hydrocortisone
   #  Hypernatremia
 now resolved. Pt had Central DI, now off DDVAP.
   Likely helped mental status.
 continue to moniter
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- FeNA supported not
   prerenal. Due to ischemic ATN, multiple epsiodes of hypotension. Pt
   Cr now stable at 3.[**4-11**] be new baseline
 will moniter
   # Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease with poor reticulocytosis.
   Responded appropriately to pRBCs
   # CN Lymphoma in Left Basal Ganglia: Patient is s/p C3D1 Alimta on [**2-13**].
   No plans for inpatient treatement at this time. Discussing prognosis
   with family and neuroonc attending. MRI with incr in size of
   hypothalamic and R frontal periventricular lesions.
   - not able to get XRT brain currently
   # HTN: Holding all antihypertensives.
   # Goals of care: although has some positive signs of improvement (DI
   resolved, rest rate decreased, slightly more awake), still has no
   therapy options, including radiation as increased intracranial edema
   would be detrimental. Also, even after treatment of aspiration, will
   not have corrected poor protection of airway and will likely have
   recurrence of aspiration.
   - family plans to consider CMO if no neuro improvement over the weekend
 now reconsidering since slight improvement
 will emphasize overall
   prognosis still poor

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She has had several medical complications during her ICU stay. 

1. Altered mental status: The patient's profound obtundation and altered mental status have been multifactorial, related to CNS lymphoma and toxic metabolic causes. The improvement observed is due to no longer being supratherapeutic on anticonvulsants and improved electrolytes.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure but has now improved on pressure support. It is optimal to attempt extubation, but prior to extubation, it is important to clarify with the family that the patient will not be reintubated.

3. Sepsis: The patient had severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which has now been resolved. She was previously on levophed and had hypotension, tachycardia, hypothermia, and respiratory failure. This may have been caused by aspiration due to an unprotected airway and altered mental status.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia, which is now resolved. This was likely due to central diabetes insipidus and off DDVAP. It helped improve mental status, and monitoring should continue.

5. Renal failure: The patient experienced acute renal failure, which was supported by FeNA due to ischemic ATN. The creatinine level is now stable at 3.[**4"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-inch tall, 94.7 kg overweight/obese male with altered mental status. He has a history of CNS lymphoma, pneumonia, seizure, hypernatremia, sepsis, renal failure, and cancer. The patient is currently extubated and on supplemental oxygen. He is being monitored for altered mental status, hypernatremia, sepsis, seizures, renal failure, and comfort care for cancer. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8 C (98.3 F), blood pressure ranging from 148/83 to 161/98 mmHg, heart rate between 77-92 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to the history of pneumonia and recent extubation. There is a risk of reintubation if respiratory distress occurs.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status requires close neurological monitoring. Seizures and CNS lymphoma are potential causes that need to be addressed.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels indicate hypernatremia. Close monitoring of serum sodium levels and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Sepsis: The patient has a history of severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of"

- The patient experienced respiratory failure after extubation due to pneumonia and is now on supplemental oxygen.
- The patient has hypernatremia, initially attributed to diabetes insipidus but now possibly related to reduced PO intake. Free water repletion is being done, and sodium levels are being monitored with a goal of <150.
- The patient had severe sepsis with organ dysfunction due to pneumonia. Current therapy is being continued.
- Seizures are being treated with cefepime and dilantin, and dilantin levels are being followed.
- Acute renal failure is resolving but slowly, and the patient is being monitored.
- The patient has a history of cancer (malignant lymphoma) and has undergone XRT. No further treatment options are available, and comfort care is being provided.
- ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (including an indwelling port), prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and elevation of the head of bed to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure due to pneumonia and may experience further complications if not adequately managed.
2. Seizures: The patient has had seizures in the past and is currently on antiepileptic medication. There"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Altered mental status: multifactorial
 related to CNS lymphoma and
   toxic metabolic.  Current improvement from no longer being
   supratherapeutic on anti-convsulants, and improved electrolytes. MRI
   showed incr size of lesions, but NeuroOnc does not think is the cause
   of her AMS. EEG showed no sz. Overall pt not able to get XRT to brain,
   and therefore prognosis poor. Patient is opening eyes, but is not
   following commands.   Dilantin level was 5.8 this AM
   - Redose dilantin at 75 [**Hospital1 **] with daily checks that is trending up and
   not too high.  Would not expect it to be therapeutic until Thursday.
   Continue keppra.
   .
   Respiratory failure: Pt was successfully extubated on [**2116-3-9**].  A
   family meeting was done prior to extubation and the decision was made
   not to reintubate should she decompensate.
   -complete 7 day course of vancomycin and zosyn on [**2116-3-10**]. d/c
   antibiotic tomorrow
   ..
   Hypernatremia: The patient had central DI supported by urine osms and
   lytes which required DDVAP and later resolved.  She then became
   hypernatremic again on [**2116-3-10**] . The etiology is thought to be
   malignancy invading hypothalamus.
   -1L of D5, recheck afternoon Na
    -UOP should be followed, she is currently has UOP in the normal range.
   .
   Severe sepsis: The pt was hypotensive, tachycardic, hypothermic, and in
   respiratory therapy.  She required levophed to maintain her BP.  Her
   urine cx, blood cx, and c diff all came back negative.  She had
   cystitis tx earlier in this admission.
   - complete a 7 day course of vanco and zosyn on [**2116-3-10**].
   -on stress dose steroids which can be decreased to prednisone 15mg PO
   on [**2116-3-11**] and per endocrine recs should be decreased by 5mg weekly but
   ultimately she should remain on prednisone 5mg daily given that she
   does have secondary adrenal insufficiency.
   .
   # CKD: The pt has a baseline creatinine of [**12-12**].3.  Her FENA supported
   that this was not prerenal.  She likely had ischemic ATN due to
   multiple episodes of hypotension. Her medications were renally dosed.
   She continues to have renal failure with creatinine of 3.5.
   -follow daily creatinine, no plan for dialysis
   .
   # Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease.  She required transfusion
   while in the ICU. HCT stable.
   -check daily HCT
   .
   # CN Lymphoma/Left Basal Ganglia Mass: Patient is s/p C3D1 Alimenta on
   [**2-13**]. No plans for inpatient treatement at this time.
   -Her oncology spoke to family about possibility of whole brain
   radiation today.
   -No pallative care consult as oncology attending would like to handle
   herself
   .
   # HTN: Holding all antihypertensives.
   -consider restarting BP meds tomorrow
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now
   -Oncology attending spoke to family about possibility of peg
   .
   # PPX:  DVT ppx with SQ Heparin  and a bowel regimen.
   .
   ACCESS: Portacath
   .
   CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI.  Family meeting occured prior to extubation and
   decision was made to move to CMO if pt acutely decompensated after
   exxtubation.  Oncology attending spoke at length with family today in
   family meeting and went over current options: 1) CMO on medicine floor
   2) management with medication but DNR/DNI and no dialysis 3) full
   code.  At this point pt still DNR/DNI and family will further discuss.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diffuse B cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. The patient was previously hypotensive, tachypneic, and now presents with profound obtundation and altered mental status. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 156/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's weight is 94.7 kg, and her height is 66 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 859 mL and total output of 2,895 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,036 mL.

The patient has been extubated and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 479 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH level of 7.23, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 40 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 28.5 mEq/L.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 18.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.3 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 300 K/uL, serum creatinine of 3.5 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 51 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 148 mEq/L, potassium (K+) level of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) level of 103 mEq/L, glucose (Glucose) level of 91 mg/dL, calcium (Ca++) level of 8.6 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) level of 2.0 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) level of 3.1 mg/dL.
