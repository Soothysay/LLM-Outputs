   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, systolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient presents with acute decompensated heart failure, left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, and infection of a wound in the distal forefoot. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has significant volume overload and a positive heart failure review of systems. The B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated at 8569, indicating worsening heart failure. 

2. LLE ulcers and cellulitis: Plain films show concerns for osteomyelitis. The patient is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics, and vascular consultation is pending. Poor options for revascularization of the left LE may lead to further complications.

3. Pulmonary opacity: A retrocardiac opacity on CXR is concerning for pneumonia. However, the patient has no fevers or leukocytosis, and this will likely be covered by the current antibiotic regimen.

4. CAD: The patient had a CABG surgery in the past, and troponin levels are trending down, making acute ischemia unlikely.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is currently well controlled, but they are not"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), systolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He presents with acute decompensated heart failure, left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, and infection of a wound in the distal forefoot. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient has acute decompensated heart failure with significant volume overload. It is important to continue with IV lasix boluses and oral lasix to achieve negative fluid balance.

2. Osteomyelitis: The presence of LLE ulcers and cellulitis raises concern for osteomyelitis. Vascular consultation has been obtained, and debridement is being considered. Follow-up with foot MRI for further evaluation and follow vascular recommendations.

3. Pulmonary infection: The retrocardiac opacity on CXR is concerning for pneumonia. Although the patient does not have fever or leukocytosis, the current antibiotic regimen should cover it well. Monitor for any signs of productive cough or fever.

4. Acute ischemia: Although the patient's troponin levels are decreasing, there is still a possibility of acute ischemia. Monitor for any new ischemic changes on EKG.

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, systolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. He presents with acute decompensated heart failure, left lower extremity cellulitis, and infection of a wound in the distal forefoot. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he has significant volume overload, positive heart failure review of systems (ROS), and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's symptoms, such as volume overload and elevated BNP, indicate worsening heart failure. Close monitoring and aggressive diuresis are required to manage this condition.
2. Left lower extremity (LLE) ulcers and cellulitis: The patient's LLE wounds are concerning for osteomyelitis, especially given the presence of dark hematoma, gangrenous skin, and blister. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and consideration for debridement should be continued. Vascular consultation is also necessary due to poor options for revascularization of his left lower extremity.
3. Pulmonary opacity: The retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray raises concern for pneumonia. However, the patient's symptoms of nonproductive cough without fevers or leukocytosis suggest that this may not be a primary infection. Monitoring temperature, white blood cell count, and"

   presents with acute decompensated HF with LLE cellulitis and infection
   of wound in distal forefoot.
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic HF, EF 20-30%: Patient has significant
   volume overload on exam and has a positive heart failure ROS. BNP
   elevated to 8569. Unclear precipitant, but possible etiologies include
   Na intake, hypertension, ischemia, or worsening valvular dysfunction.
   Had similar episode in [**12-6**], which responded well to IV diuresis.
   Although has had difficulty with diuresis in past requiring CVVH and
   milrinone.
   - Continue with IV lasix boluses and lasix gtt.  Goal negative 2-3L
   daily, as tolerated by BP.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. He presents with acute decompensated heart failure, left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, and infection of the wound in the distal forefoot. 

The patient has significant volume overload, positive heart failure review of systems (ROS), and elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 8569. The cause of the acute decompensation is unclear but could be due to sodium intake, hypertension, ischemia, or worsening valvular dysfunction. 

The patient had a similar episode in the past that responded well to intravenous (IV) diuretics. However, he has had difficulty with diuresis in the past requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and milrinone. 

The plan is to continue with IV lasix boluses and lasix gtt. The goal is negative 2-3 liters daily as tolerated by blood pressure. Metolazone will be continued orally. Electrolytes will be monitored while aggressively diuresing. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be done to assess for possible precipitants such as changes in valve function or new wall motion abnormalities (WMA). The patient's medications, including lisinopril"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. He presents with acute decompensated heart failure, left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, and infection of the wound in the distal forefoot.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient continues to be overloaded and has been diuresing well on lasix drip with metolazone. Possible etiologies include sodium intake, hypertension, ischemia, or worsening valvular dysfunction. The patient had a similar episode in the past which responded well to IV diuresis.
2. LLE ulcers and cellulitis: Plain films are concerning for osteomyelitis. Given Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam in the emergency department. Vascular consulted and will consider debridement. The patient has poor options for revascularization of his left LE.
3. Pulmonary opacity: Retrocardiac opacity on CXR concerning for pneumonia and with increased sputum production. This will be well covered with his current antibiotic regimen.
4. CAD: The patient had previous CABG. Troponin-T currently at 0.23 -> 0.21 (baseline troponin 0.16-0.23). MB negative. These labs make acute ischemia unlikely.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic heart failure (HF), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He presents with acute decompensated HF, left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, and infection of a wound in the distal forefoot. The patient has been diuresing well on lasix drip with metolazone for acute on chronic systolic HF. Other medical conditions include COPD, chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), anemia, hypercholesterolemia, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic HF: The patient continues to be overloaded and may require further diuresis. Possible etiologies include sodium intake, hypertension, ischemia, or worsening valvular dysfunction.
2. LLE ulcers and cellulitis: There is concern for osteomyelitis. Vascular surgery has been consulted, and debridement may be considered. Poor options for revascularization of the left LE exist.
3. Pulmonary opacity: A retrocardiac opacity on CXR is concerning for pneumonia (PNA). Increased sputum production is also noted. The current antibiotic regimen should cover this well.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). He presents with acute decompensated heart failure, left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, and infection of the wound in the distal forefoot. The patient has significant volume overload, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and an elevated troponin T level. He is currently receiving intravenous (IV) diuretics, including lasix, and oral metolazone for diuresis. His medications include lisinopril, carvedilol, rosuvastatin, glargine, humalog insulin, erythropoietin, and a cardiac diabetic diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's significant volume overload and elevated BNP suggest acute decompensated heart failure. It is important to continue IV diuretics and monitor fluid balance closely.
2. LLE ulcers and cellulitis: Plain films are concerning for osteomyelitis. The patient is receiving empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, but further evaluation with an MRI is needed. Wet-to-dry dressing on the toe and adaptive on bullae should be continued.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), systolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. He presents with acute decompensated heart failure, left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, and infection of the wound in the distal forefoot. The patient's current condition is characterized by acute on chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-30%. He is experiencing bibasilar crackles on pulmonary examination and has bilateral edema in his lower extremities. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/33mmHg to 127/73mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient is currently receiving intravenous diuretics, antibiotics, and other cardiac medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient continues to be overloaded and requires aggressive diuresis. This condition can lead to further fluid accumulation, worsening edema, and respiratory distress.
2. LLE ulcers and cellulitis: There is a concern for osteomyelitis due to plain"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo male with a hx of CAD s/p CABG, systolic HF, and PVD presents
   with acute decompensated HF with LLE cellulitis and infection of wound
   in distal forefoot.
   1. Acute on chronic systolic HF, EF 20-30%:
   Patient continues to be overloaded and has been diuresing well on lasix
   drip with metolazone. Unclear precipitant, but possible etiologies
   include Na intake, hypertension, ischemia, or worsening valvular
   dysfunction.
   - Continue lasix gtt with PO metolazone.  Goal negative 2L as tolerated
   by BP.
   - Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes while aggressively diuresing- Cont lisinopril and
   carvedilol with careful observation of BPs. Would avoid stopping
   B-blocker abruptly to prevent catecholamine rebound.
   - consider starting spironolactone given his severe CHF
   2. Hypotension
   Etiology of his relatively low blood pressures this morning is likely
   related to RV dysfunction, systolic dysfunction, and aggressive
   diuresis.
   - continue diuresis and monitor BP closely
   3. LLE ulcers and celllulitis:
   Per vascular surgery, patient has poor options for revascularation of
   his left LE.
   - appreciate vascular recs
   - F/u blood cultures
   - Continue empiric vanco and pip-tazo
   - Wet-to-dry dressing on toe, adaptic on bullae
   .
   4. Pulmonary opacity:
   Retrocardiac opacity on CXR concerning for PNA and with increased
   sputum production. This will be well covered with his current abx
   regimen.
   - Cont abx as above
   - F/u blood cx
   - Send sputum cx if cough becomes productive
   - Monitor temp, WBC count
   .
   5. CAD: S/p CABG [**10-5**]. Trop-T currently .23 -> .21 (baseline troponin
   .16-.23). MB negative. These labs make acute ischemia unlikely.
   Furthermore, no new ischemic changes noted on EKG.
   - Cont ASA, rosuvastatin, carvedilol, and ACEI
   .
   5. Atrial Fibrillation: Rate currently well controlled. Patient not on
   warfarin anticoagulation.
   - Cont carvedilol and ASA.
   - Monitor rhythm on telemetry.
   - will follow-up with PCP regarding need for anticoagulation
   .
   6. COPD: Good O2 sats, mild wheezes on exam.
   - Cont fluticasone-salmeterol
   .
   7. CKD:   (baseline 1.5-2.5).
   - Trend creatinine given diuresis and monitor urine output
   .
   8. Hypercholesterolemia:
   - Cont rosuvastatin
   .
   9. DMII: Last HbA1C 5.8 ([**12-5**]).
   - Continue glargine and humalog ISS.  Titrate up as tolerated.
   .
   10. Anemia: Hct 26, with baseline mid 20s.
   - Continue erythopoeitin
   - Daily hcts

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He presents with acute decompensated heart failure, left lower extremity cellulitis, and infection of the wound in the distal forefoot. The patient has a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20-30%. He is currently being treated with diuretics, including lasix and metolazone, for fluid overload. His blood pressure is relatively low, which may be related to right ventricular dysfunction, systolic dysfunction, and aggressive diuresis. The patient has multiple comorbidities including COPD, chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and anemia. He is also on various medications including ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins, and erythropoietin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's symptoms and findings suggest worsening of his chronic systolic heart failure. Close monitoring and management of fluid status, electrolytes, and hemodynamics are necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's relatively low blood pressures may be due to right ventricular dysfunction, systolic dysfunction, and aggressive diuresis. Careful observation of blood pressures and appropriate management"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), systolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. He presents with acute decompensated heart failure, left lower extremity cellulitis, and infection of the wound in the distal forefoot. 

The patient continues to be overloaded and has been diuresing well on lasix drip with metolazone. The possible etiologies for acute decompensated heart failure include sodium intake, hypertension, ischemia, or worsening valvular dysfunction. 

For the left lower extremity ulcers and cellulitis, plain films are concerning for osteomyelitis. The patient has been started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Vascular surgery has been consulted, and debridement may be considered. 

The patient also has a pulmonary opacity on chest X-ray, which is concerning for pneumonia. This will be well covered with his current antibiotic regimen. 

For the patient's coronary artery disease, post-CABG, troponin-T levels are within normal range, making acute ischemia unlikely. 

The patient is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is well controlled. 

In terms of comorbidities, the patient has chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, anemia, hypercholesterolemia, and COPD.

The patient's family meeting with palliative care resulted in a decision to no longer pursue hospice at home. The patient is being diuresed with UOP 150-200cc per hour on lasix gtt at 12.5-20. They are continuing with Vanc/Zosyn antibiotics. The vascular team is considering a PICC line due to potential antibiotic resistance, and ACE wraps have been applied to the left lower extremity with a multipodus boot on the right lower extremity. There is a possibility of debridement of the wound, and Adaptic dressings have been applied to leg ulcers. Wet-to-dry dressings will be used on the distal wound.

An echocardiogram was performed, revealing left atrial and ventricular dilation, normal right atrial size, moderately dilated right ventricular cavity with mild free wall hypokinesis, mildly dilated ascending aorta, mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets with trace aortic regurgitation, mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets with mild mitral regurgitation, and moderately thickened tricuspid valve leaflets with moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo male with a hx of CAD s/p CABG, systolic HF, and PVD presents
   with acute decompensated HF with LLE cellulitis and infection of wound
   in distal forefoot.
   1. Acute on chronic systolic HF, EF 20-30%:
   Patient continues to be overloaded and has been diuresing well on lasix
   drip with metolazone. Unclear precipitant, but possible etiologies
   include Na intake, hypertension, ischemia, or worsening valvular
   dysfunction.
   - Continue lasix gtt with PO metolazone.  Goal negative 2L as tolerated
   by BP.
   - Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes while aggressively diuresing- Cont lisinopril and
   carvedilol with careful observation of BPs. Would avoid stopping
   B-blocker abruptly to prevent catecholamine rebound.
   - consider starting spironolactone given his severe CHF
   2. Hypotension
   Etiology of his relatively low blood pressures this morning is likely
   related to RV dysfunction, systolic dysfunction, and aggressive
   diuresis.
   - continue diuresis and monitor BP closely
   3. LLE ulcers and celllulitis:
   Per vascular surgery, patient has poor options for revascularation of
   his left LE.
   - appreciate vascular recs
   - F/u blood cultures
   - Continue empiric vanco and pip-tazo
   - Wet-to-dry dressing on toe, adaptic on bullae
   .
   4. Pulmonary opacity:
   Retrocardiac opacity on CXR concerning for PNA and with increased
   sputum production. This will be well covered with his current abx
   regimen.
   - Cont abx as above
   - F/u blood cx
   - Send sputum cx if cough becomes productive
   - Monitor temp, WBC count
   .
   5. CAD: S/p CABG [**10-5**]. Trop-T currently .23 -> .21 (baseline troponin
   .16-.23). MB negative. These labs make acute ischemia unlikely.
   Furthermore, no new ischemic changes noted on EKG.
   - Cont ASA, rosuvastatin, carvedilol, and ACEI
   .
   5. Atrial Fibrillation: Rate currently well controlled. Patient not on
   warfarin anticoagulation.
   - Cont carvedilol and ASA.
   - Monitor rhythm on telemetry.
   - will follow-up with PCP regarding need for anticoagulation
   .
   6. COPD: Good O2 sats, mild wheezes on exam.
   - Cont fluticasone-salmeterol
   .
   7. CKD:   (baseline 1.5-2.5).
   - Trend creatinine given diuresis and monitor urine output
   .
   8. Hypercholesterolemia:
   - Cont rosuvastatin
   .
   9. DMII: Last HbA1C 5.8 ([**12-5**]).
   - Continue glargine and humalog ISS.  Titrate up as tolerated.
   .
   10. Anemia: Hct 26, with baseline mid 20s.
   - Continue erythopoeitin
   - Daily hcts

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD).
- He presented with acute decompensated heart failure, left lower extremity cellulitis, and infection of the wound in the distal forefoot.
- The patient has been diuresing well on lasix drip with metolazone.
- His blood pressures have been relatively low, which may be related to right ventricular dysfunction, systolic dysfunction, and aggressive diuresis.
- The patient has poor options for revascularization of his left lower extremity.
- He has a pulmonary opacity on chest X-ray, which is concerning for pneumonia and increased sputum production.
- His current antibiotic regimen covers well for PNA.
- The patient's troponin T levels are within normal limits, indicating that acute ischemia is unlikely.
- The patient's rhythm is well controlled, but he is not on warfarin anticoagulation.
- He has chronic kidney disease, COPD, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and anemia.
- The patient will continue to be monitored closely for any changes in his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient may continue to experience symptoms of fluid overload, such as shortness of breath and ed"

   .
   TTE The left and right atrium are moderately dilated. Left ventricular
   wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is mildly
   dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with inferior and inferolateral thinning/akinesis and hypokinesis of
   the anterior septum and anterior wall. The apex and remaining segments
   contract well (LVEF = 25%).The right ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated with mild free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
   no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with cavity dilation
   and extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD.
   Moderate pulmonary arteyr systolic hypertension. Moderate tricuspid
   regurgitation. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-11-17**], the left
   ventricular cavity is slighly larger and anterior and anteroseptal
   dysfunction is new c/w interim ischemia.Overall systolic function is
   more depressed.

   presents with acute decompensated HF with LLE cellulitis and infection
   of wound in distal forefoot.
   .
   1. Acute on chronic systolic HF, EF 20-30%: Patient continues to be
   overloaded and has been diuresing well on lasix drip with metolazone.
   Unclear precipitant, but possible etiologies include Na intake,
   hypertension, ischemia, or worsening valvular dysfunction. Had similar
   episode in [**12-6**], which responded well to IV diuresis.
   - Continue lasix gtt with PO metolazone.  Goal negative 3L daily, as
   tolerated by BP.
   - Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes while aggressively diuresing
   - follow-up TTE
   - Cont lisinopril and carvedilol with careful observation of BPs. Would
   avoid stopping B-blocker abruptly to prevent catecholamine rebound.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. He presents with acute decompensated heart failure, left lower extremity cellulitis, and infection in the distal forefoot.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF 20-30%): The patient is experiencing diuresis but requires aggressive diuresis with Lasix gtt and metolazone. Careful observation of blood pressures is necessary, and the patient should continue taking lisinopril and carvedilol. Avoid stopping the beta-blocker abruptly to prevent catecholamine rebound. Regular monitoring of electrolytes while aggressively diuresing is recommended, and considering starting spironolactone due to severe CHF.

2. Hypotension: This may be due to aggressive diuresis and baseline right ventricular dysfunction. Continuing diuresis and closely monitoring blood pressure is advised.

3. Left lower extremity ulcers and cellulitis: The patient has poor options for revascularization of his left lower extremity. Following vascular surgery recommendations, obtaining blood cultures, continuing empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for 7 days, and wet-to-dry dressing on the toe with adaptive on bullae are recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), systolic heart failure (HF), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He presents with acute decompensated HF, left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, and infection in the distal forefoot. The patient continues to be overloaded and is diuresing well on Lasix drip with metolazone. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute on chronic systolic HF: The patient's systolic function is compromised with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-30%. This puts him at risk for further fluid overload and worsening heart failure symptoms.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is relatively low, likely due to right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, systolic dysfunction, and aggressive diuresis. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to prevent hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. LLE ulcers and cellulitis: The patient has poor options for revascularization of his left lower extremity. If infection spreads or if there is no improvement with current treatment, there is a risk of worsening cellulitis, possible amputation, and systemic infection.
4. Pulmonary opacity: The retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray is concerning for pneumonia (PNA). If left untreated, this could lead to respiratory complications and systemic infection"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), systolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD).
- The patient presents with acute decompensated heart failure, left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, and infection of the wound in the distal forefoot.
- The patient has been diuresing well on Lasix drip with metolazone, indicating fluid overload.
- The patient's blood pressure is relatively low due to right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, systolic dysfunction, and aggressive diuresis.
- The patient has LLE ulcers and cellulitis, with poor options for revascularization.
- There is a concern for pulmonary opacity, which may indicate pneumonia (PNA), covered by the current antibiotic regimen.
- The patient has a history of CAD and is post CABG. Troponin levels are stable, making acute ischemia unlikely.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation (AF) that is currently well-controlled but is not on warfarin anticoagulation.
- The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with good oxygen saturation.
- The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD), and creatinine levels are being monitored.
- The patient has hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), systolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. He presents with acute decompensated heart failure, left lower extremity (LE) cellulitis, and infection of the wound in the distal forefoot. The patient has a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 20-30%. He is currently on diuretic therapy with Lasix and has hypotension possibly due to aggressive diuresis and baseline right ventricular dysfunction. The patient also has left LE ulcers and cellulitis, pulmonary opacity concerning for pneumonia, a history of CABG, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type II, anemia, and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's condition may worsen if his heart failure is not properly managed with aggressive diuresis and careful monitoring of blood pressures.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential organ damage if not carefully managed.
3. Left lower extremity ulcers and cellulitis: The infection in the patient's LE could progress and potentially spread to the bloodstream, leading to seps"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. He presents with acute decompensated heart failure, left lower extremity cellulitis, and infection of the wound in the distal forefoot.

The patient has several medical conditions that need to be managed:

1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-30%: The patient is already receiving Lasix gtt for diuresis. Aggressive diuresis with Lasix gtt and metolazone may be considered, along with continuing lisinopril and carvedilol. It is important to monitor blood pressure closely and check electrolytes while aggressively diuresing. Starting spironolactone may also be considered due to severe heart failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure might be related to aggressive diuresis and baseline right ventricular dysfunction. Continuing diuresis and closely monitoring blood pressure are recommended.

3. Left lower extremity ulcers and cellulitis: The patient has poor options for revascularization of the left lower extremity. It is advised to follow vascular surgery recommendations, obtain blood cultures, continue empiric vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for 7 days"
