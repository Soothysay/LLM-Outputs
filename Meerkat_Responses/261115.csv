   # Hypotension: :Likely from combination of rapid atrial fibrillation +
   sepsis. See above for treatment of infection.
   - Rate control as below
   - Conservative fluid management as pt urinating & mentating.
   .
   # Pleural effusions: most likely related to CHF from atril
   fibrillation.
   - attempt to control a fib with rate or rhythm control
   - echo in morning

","The patient is a 90-year-old woman who recently underwent surgery for a perforated ulcer and now presents with fevers, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has a history of COPD and a perforated ulcer. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, vanc for GPC, and PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 8.7 K/uL and elevated troponin T levels at 0.12 ng/mL. 

The assessment and plan include treating the patient's fever, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation. The potential medical complications that can arise are urosepsis, pneumonia, viral syndrome, recurrent C. diff colitis, pleural effusions related to CHF from atrial fibrillation, demand ischemia, and atrial fibrillation. The plan involves continuing vanc for GPC, discontinuing cipro and zosyn, following up with sputum culture and DFA for viral antigen, following up with a final CT chest, considering thoracentesis, ruling out recurrent C. diff colitis due to"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of [complaint]. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple pressors. An echocardiogram was performed, which showed normal systolic function but moderate-severe tricuspid regurgitation, mild aortic stenosis, moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/66 to 125/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and requires respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device. The patient has been receiving various medications including piperacillin, vancomycin, Zosyn, heparin sodium, phenylephrine, and metoprolol. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal troponin levels. The patient's blood cultures and trans thoracic echo have been sent. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube placed. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypoxemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, myocardial infarction, fever, atrial fibrillation, pleural effusion, and acute kidney injury. The patient's code status is full code, and the current disposition is unknown.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient has moderate-severe tricuspid regurgitation, mild aortic stenosis, and moderate mitral regurgitation, which can lead to further cardiac dysfunction and potentially worsen the myocardial infarction.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
3. Infection complications: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, and there is a risk of developing septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
4. Renal complications: The patient has acute kidney injury, which can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient is on anticoagulants (heparin sodium), increasing the risk of bleeding.
6. Thrombotic complications: The patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheters.

Please note that these are potential complications and the actual course of the patient's condition may vary."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypoxemia, and an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has been requiring pressors and attempts have been made to place an arterial line, but unsuccessful. The patient's tricuspid regurgitation is moderate-severe, with mild aortic stenosis, moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. The patient is currently on Zosyn, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is recommended, and an MR spine if unrevealing. If these tests are unremarkable, para/[Female First Name (un)] may be considered. The patient has no known drug allergies. She received her last doses of piperacillin and vancomycin on 06-07-2101 at 08:00 AM and 02:00 PM, respectively. She started on piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) at 04:00 AM on 06-08-2101. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium at 1,000 units/hour and phenylephrine at 0.5 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include metoprolol, which she started at 03:34 AM on 06-08-2101. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for atrial fibrillation, which was noted on 06-07-2101 at 09:25 PM, 03:38 AM, 09:10 AM, and 05:22 PM. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.1 C (96.9 F) with a maximum temperature of 35.6 C (96 F), heart rate of 97 bpm with a range of 91-124 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/66 mmHg to 125/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute with a range of 16-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has decreased breath sounds bilaterally, tachycardia, and irregular heart rhythm. She also has edema in both extremities, which she reports as stable. Neurological examination reveals A+OX3. The patient's labs show leukocyte count of 335 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, platelet count of 299 K/uL, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, troponin-T levels within normal range, glucose levels between 91-95 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman who underwent surgery for a perforated ulcer, complicated by perihepatic abscess and Clostridium difficile colitis. She presented with fevers, hypotension, and a fever with rash. The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation, decreased breath sounds bilaterally, edema in the extremities, and altered mental status. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. She has been on multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and Zosyn.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of fevers, hypotension, and a fever with rash suggests the possibility of sepsis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing rapid and irregular heart rhythm, known as atrial fibrillation. This condition increases the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.
3. Pleural Effusions: The patient's decreased breath sounds bilaterally and edema in the extremities may indicate pleural effusions, which are accumulations of fluid around the lungs. This can lead to difficulty in breathing and decreased oxygenation.
4. Perihepatic Abscess: The patient had a perihepatic abscess following her surgical"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman who underwent surgery for a perforated ulcer. She now presents with fevers, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has a history of recent surgery, complicated by perihepatic abscess and Clostridium difficile colitis. She has bacteremia with growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs/clusters, possibly Enterococcus species, and a urine culture showing >100,000 colony-forming units of Enterococcus. There are concerns about endocarditis, spine infection, and empyema. Other potential sources of infection include lines, peritonitis, and influenza.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, hypotension, and positive blood cultures indicate a systemic infection, which may lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Endocarditis: The presence of bacteremia and atrial fibrillation raises concern for endocarditis, especially considering the negative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) result.
3. Spine infection: Given the tenderness and weakness, there is a possibility of a spine infection.
4. Empyema: The large pleural effusions suggest empyema, which is a collection of infected fluid in the lungs.
5. Line-related infection: Since the patient has multiple lines, there is a risk of a line-related infection, especially considering the high colony"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman who recently underwent surgery for a perforated ulcer, complicated by a perihepatic abscess and Clostridium difficile colitis. She presents with fevers, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Blood cultures show growth of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and her urine culture is positive for Enterococcus. The patient has a history of COPD, COPD exacerbation, and a potential line source infection or peritonitis. She also has moderate-severe tricuspid regurgitation, mild aortic stenosis, moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension on echocardiogram. The patient requires pressors for hypotension and has been receiving IV fluids. She is currently on piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for empiric coverage, vancomycin for Enterococcus, and metoprolol for rate control of atrial fibrillation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include endocarditis, spine infection, empyema, line source infection, peritonitis, influenza, and demand ischemia. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and further investigations such as TEE for endocarditis, MRI spine, thoracentesis, and viral respiratory culture. Treatment includes antibiotics for the identified infections, rate control of atrial fibrillation, and management of hypotension."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with recent surgery for a perforated ulcer, complicated by perihepatic abscess and Clostridium difficile colitis. She presents with fevers, hypotension, and a fever with rash (FWR). Blood cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and urine cultures grew vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE). The patient underwent an MRI of the spine, which revealed multilevel degenerative changes in the lumbar spine with severe multifactorial spinal canal stenosis. Other findings include inadequate samples for DFA, no known drug allergies, and ongoing antibiotic therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has multiple infections including MRSA bacteremia, VRE bacteremia, and possible endocarditis. Additionally, there is concern for a spine infection and empyema due to large pleural effusions.
2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, likely from the combination of rapid atrial fibrillation and sepsis. This requires close monitoring and treatment of the underlying infection.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has rapid atrial fibrillation, which may require rate control measures such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or amiodarone.
4. Pleural effusions: The patient has large pleural effusions, which could be due to fluid overload or empy"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman who underwent surgery for a perforated ulcer. She developed a perihepatic abscess and Clostridium difficile colitis. On admission, she presented with fevers, hypotension, and a fever with rash. Blood cultures grew MRSA, and urine cultures grew Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). An MRI of the spine showed no epidural abscess but revealed multilevel degenerative changes in the lumbar spine with severe spinal canal stenosis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 139/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. She is still on pressors but has been weaned off them intermittently. Her fluids balance shows a total input of 3,093 mL, with an output of 1,420 mL through urine and 1,673 mL through other routes.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 8.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dL, platelet count of 299 K/uL, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 103 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range. Imaging studies show no evidence of an abscess, but there"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old woman with recent surgery for a perforated ulcer, complicated by perihepatic abscess and C. difficile colitis.
- She presents with fevers, hypotension, and a fib with RVR.
- Blood cultures grew MRSA and urine cultures grew VRE, so vancomycin was changed to linezolid.
- MRI of the spine showed no epidural abscess but revealed multilevel degenerative changes in the lumbar spine with severe multifactorial spinal canal stenosis.
- The patient had hypothermia and tachycardia overnight but no elevation of WBC.

- The patient is on multiple medications, including piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, linezolid, metoprolol, amiodarone, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA bacteremia and VRE UTI: The patient has an active infection with MRSA bacteremia and VRE urinary tract infection. This increases the risk of sepsis and potential organ failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and potentially shock.
