   Assessment and Plan
 BRADYCARDIA
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   74 yo man with h/o HTN, DM, CVA, schizoaffective disorder presenting
   s/p fall, admitted to MICU over concern for anemia, renal failure, and
   hyperkalemia.
   S/p fall: Occurred in setting of dizziness, poor historian but
   description suggestive of vertigo. Chronic recurrent episodes
   suggestive of Meniere's given reported time course of minutes up to [**1-27**]
   hour and associated tinnitis. BPPV also possible. [**Month (only) 11**] have been
   exacerbated by bradycardia or precipitated by arrrhythmia. Description
   less consistent with lightheadedness but orthostasis possible. Not
   hypoglycemic. No evidence of acute bleed on CT head with intact neuro
   exam but may be complication of old PCA stroke or new TIA given risk
   with left vertebral artery atherosclerosis on past MRI. Seizure
   possible given reported urinary incontinence although no h/o seizure
   d/o and negative EEG in [**2-1**]. [**Month (only) 11**] also have contribution from
   polypharmacy possible although no recent med changes.
   - Will need to clarify events surrounding fall with nursing home staff
   in AM
   - Cont home meclizine
   - Consider [**Last Name (un) 7317**]-Hallpike or Epley maneuvers
   - F/u final CT head
   - Consider MRI head if persists
   - Monitor on tele, EKG in AM
   - Orthostatic vitals in AM
   Anemia: Pt with h/o chronic anemia but Hct 23 below baseline of 27 in
   [**2-1**]. Microcytic anemia suggests iron deficiency anemia. No current
   evidence of bleed with guaiac neg stool, CT head, abd/pelvis, and
   stable Hct since presentation. Occult malignancy a possibility.
   Thalessemia less likely given ethnicity. Given associated worsened
   renal failure and age, would want to r/o multiple myeloma. Lower on
   differential for anemia includes B12/folate deficiency, hemolysis (nl
   bili, LDH). Received 1 unit PRBC in ED.
   - Trend Hct
   - Check iron panel, SPEP/UPEP, B12, folate, hemolysis labs, retic count
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Cont home H2 blocker
   - PIV x 2, active T&S, transfuse for Hct <21
   Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 1.1 in [**7-4**], now 2.4. [**Month (only) 11**] be
   prerenal. ATN possible in setting of hypotension on presentation. AIN
   less likely as not on any new meds. Multiple myeloma and post-renal
   etiology also on differential. Received 3L IVF in ED.
   - IV fluids overnight
   - Trend Cr, monitor UOP with goal >30 cc/h
   - Send urine lytes and eos
   - F/u urine cx
   - SPEP/UPEP as above
   - Holding citalopram, lisinopril, and oral hypoglycemics for now; avoid
   nephrotoxic agents
   - Voiding trial in AM
   - Consider renal ultrasound if ARF not improving
   Hyperkalemia: K 8.3 likely in setting of acute renal failure. No EKG
   changes. Improved to 6.9 after calcium gluconate and kayexalate in ED.
   - Trend lytes
   - Repeat EKG in AM.
   Type 2 DM: FSG elevated >400 on arrival, better controlled now on
   insulin gtt. No anion gap or evidence of ketosis. [**7-4**] A1c 7.7 suggests
   suboptimal glycemic control at baseline.
   - D/c insulin gtt
   - Monitor FSG qid with ISS, will likely need standing dose insulin
   - Holding oral hypoglycemics for now
   Hypotension: Holding home meds for now given lower running BP on
   admission, now normotensive to mildly hypertensive s/p atropine.
   Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 11**] have been in setting of bradycardia to 40s. No
   fever or leukocytosis to suggest sepsis. Cardiogenic unlikely in
   absence of chest pain, first set enzymes negative, EKG without ischemic
   changes.
   - Trend lactate
   - Goal MAP >65, UOP >30 cc/h
   - Holding home lisinopril for now
   - Complete ROMI
   Sinus bradycardia: HR in 50s. [**Month (only) 11**] be chronic as noted to have sinus
   bradycardia in 50s at time of EEG in [**3-4**], although HR recorded in 70s
   on subsequent notes. [**Month (only) 11**] have sick sinus syndrome given possible nodal
   dysfunction on EKG, ddx includes hypothyroidism.
   - Monitor on tele, EKG in AM
   - Check TSH
   Hyperlipidemia: Cont home welchol.
   H/o CVA: CT head without acute bleed.
   - Cont ASA
   Schizoaffective disorder:
   - Holding citalopram for now given ARF
   - Cont home seroquel
   Insomnia: Trazodone prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and schizoaffective disorder. He presented to the MICU with concerns for anemia, renal failure, and hyperkalemia after experiencing a fall. The patient has several comorbidities and is on multiple medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient has a chronic history of anemia with a hemoglobin level of 23.9 g/dL, which is below his baseline of 27. Microcytic anemia suggests iron deficiency anemia. Further investigation is needed to rule out occult malignancy, B12/folate deficiency, hemolysis, or multiple myeloma.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.1 on 07/04 to 2.4, indicating acute renal failure. Prerenal causes such as hypotension on presentation and ATN should be considered. Post-renal etiology and multiple myeloma are also on the differential. Monitoring urine output and electrolytes is important.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels (K+ 8.3) due to acute renal failure. No EKG changes were observed, but the potassium level improved after treatment with calcium gluconate and kayexalate. Close monitoring of electrolytes and repeat EKG"

   2. Irregularity of the distal left vertebral artery consistent with
   atherosclerotic disease. While the images from the MRA of the neck
   dated [**2110-7-10**] are not available for direct comparison, the report
   describes a ""hypoplastic left vertebral artery with a questionable
   slight focal narrowing at the distal left vertebral artery.""
   3. Possible narrowing of the left vertebral artery at its origin.
   .
   [**3-4**] EEG:
   Abnormal routine EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to
   the presence of lower voltage activity and theta frequency seen in the
   right posterior quadrant, consistent with a remote history of occipital
   stroke. If clinical suspicion for epilepsy is high, prolonged EEG
   monitoring would be beneficial for further diagnosis. Slowing was seen
   in the left temporal and central regions suggest subcortical
   dysfunction in the left hemisphere.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, chronic kidney disease, and previous cardiovascular disease. He was admitted for unwitnessed fall, hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, and bradycardia. The patient does not have any significant persistent neurological deficits. His current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 128/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving various medications including Kayexalate, heparin, fish oil, vitamin C, Lipitor, Colace, risperidone, Wellchol, meclizine, ranitidine, senna, and RISS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fall: The patient has a history of longstanding dizziness, which may have contributed to the fall. It is important to evaluate and manage the patient's orthostatics and syncope, especially considering the presence of bradycardia.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may be exacerbated by hyperkalemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the bradycardia, including cardiac enzyme levels, telemonitoring, hyperkalemia management, echocardiogram, and thyroid function tests.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and multiple cardiovascular risk factors. He was admitted after an unwitnessed fall and presented with hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, and bradycardia. The patient does not have any significant persistent neurological deficits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fall - The patient has longstanding dizziness, which could be related to hypovolemia or orthostatic hypotension versus syncope. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
2. Bradycardia - This is likely exacerbated by hyperkalemia. The patient has multiple CAD risk factors but no evidence of acute coronary syndrome. Cardiac enzymes are pending, and tele monitoring will be implemented.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure - The patient likely has a prerenal picture with a low fractional excretion of sodium (FENa). Poor oral intake in the context of psychiatric disease may contribute to this condition.
4. Hyperkalemia - This is related to renal failure and has resolved.
5. Anemia - The patient has iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease, likely due to renal disease. Hct trends will be monitored, and IV iron therapy and erythropoietin will be considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Further evaluation of the fall is necessary to determine the underlying cause and prevent future falls.

   74 yo man with h/o HTN, DM, CVA, schizoaffective disorder presenting
   s/p fall, admitted to MICU over concern for anemia, renal failure, and
   hyperkalemia.
   S/p fall: Occurred in setting of dizziness, poor historian but
   description suggestive of vertigo. Chronic recurrent episodes
   suggestive of Meniere's given reported time course of minutes up to [**1-27**]
   hour and associated tinnitis. BPPV also possible. [**Month (only) 11**] have been
   exacerbated by bradycardia or precipitated by arrrhythmia secondary to
   his hyperkalemia, as he did have ventricular response brady in the ED.
   Head CT in ED negative.
   - stable now
   - continue to monitor on tele, ordered echo for syncope workup
   - consider MRI to rule ou posterior circulation ischemia as cause of
   fall
   Ventricular Escape: had arrhythmia in ED secondary to hyperkalemia
   which responded to calcium gluconate.  Has been in NSR throughout
   night, continue to monitor on telemetry, trend K+.
   Anemia: Pt with h/o chronic anemia but Hct 23 below baseline of 27 in
   [**2-1**]. Microcytic anemia suggests iron deficiency anemia. No current
   evidence of bleed with guaiac neg stool, CT head, abd/pelvis, and
   stable Hct since presentation. Occult malignancy a possibility. Is
   severely iron deficient.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), schizoaffective disorder, and a recent fall. He was admitted to the MICU due to concerns about anemia, renal failure, and hyperkalemia. 

The patient's overnight events were unremarkable, but he continues to experience dizziness. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 150/57 mmHg, heart rate of 74 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. 

The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, a superficial laceration on his left forehead, clear lungs, regular and bradycardic heart sounds, a distended abdomen, and warm and well-perfused extremities. Neurological examination reveals a perseverative thought process, intact cranial nerves II-XII, strength 5/5, no pronator drift or tremor, symmetric patellar reflexes, toes downgoing on Babinski, and an uncooperative attitude during finger-to-nose testing or the Hallpike maneuver.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (228 K/uL), low hemoglobin level (7.2 g/dL), elevated potassium level (6.9), increased creatinine level (2.1 mg/dL), elevated blood glucose level (158 mg/dL), and abnormal liver function tests.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with h/o HTN, DM, CVA, schizoaffective disorder presenting
   s/p fall, admitted to MICU over concern for anemia, renal failure, and
   hyperkalemia.
   Intermittent Respiratory Distress:
   S/p fall: Occurred in setting of dizziness, poor historian but
   description suggestive of vertigo. Chronic recurrent episodes
   suggestive of Meniere's given reported time course of minutes up to [**1-27**]
   hour and associated tinnitis. BPPV also possible. [**Month (only) 11**] have been
   exacerbated by bradycardia or precipitated by arrrhythmia secondary to
   his hyperkalemia, as he did have ventricular response brady in the ED.
   Head CT in ED negative.
   - stable now
   - continue to monitor on tele, ordered echo for syncope workup
   - consider MRI to rule ou posterior circulation ischemia as cause of
   fall
   Ventricular Escape: had arrhythmia in ED secondary to hyperkalemia
   which responded to calcium gluconate.  Has been in NSR throughout
   night, continue to monitor on telemetry, trend K+.
   Anemia: Pt with h/o chronic anemia but Hct 23 below baseline of 27 in
   [**2-1**]. Microcytic anemia suggests iron deficiency anemia. No current
   evidence of bleed with guaiac neg stool, CT head, abd/pelvis, and
   stable Hct since presentation. Occult malignancy a possibility. Is
   severely iron deficient.
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]

   Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 1.1 in [**7-4**], now 2.4. Likely
   prerenal. Received 3L IVF in ED.
   - IV fluids during day today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and schizoaffective disorder. He was admitted to the MICU due to concern for anemia, renal failure, and hyperkalemia. 

The patient experienced intermittent respiratory distress following a fall, which occurred while he was experiencing dizziness and poor historian. The description of his symptoms suggests vertigo and chronic recurrent episodes that could be indicative of Meniere's disease or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). 

Additionally, the patient had a ventricular escape rhythm in the emergency department secondary to hyperkalemia, which responded to calcium gluconate. He has been in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) throughout the night and will continue to be monitored on telemetry. 

The patient also has a history of chronic anemia but with a hemoglobin concentration (Hct) below his baseline of 27. Microcytic anemia suggests iron deficiency anemia. No current evidence of bleed was found with negative guaiac stool, CT head, abdomen/pelvis, and stable Hct since presentation. Occult malignancy is a possibility, and he is severely iron deficient. 

Furthermore, the patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.1 in the past, now elevated to 2.4. This is likely prerenal and"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with h/o HTN, DM, CVA, schizoaffective disorder presenting
   s/p fall, admitted to MICU over concern for anemia, renal failure, and
   hyperkalemia.
   Intermittent Respiratory Distress: likely flash pulm edema based on his
   response to BP control with labetolol and lasix.  Also better control
   when his anxiety was relieved with haldol.  Echo done yesterday showing
   no abnormality but slightly enlarge atrium, probably has some diastolic
   dysfunction
   - will restart lisinopril for better control
   - consider low dose daily lasix to keep slightly negative
   - better control of anxiety with increase dose of risperidone
   S/p fall: Occurred in setting of dizziness, poor historian but
   description suggestive of vertigo. Chronic recurrent episodes
   suggestive of Meniere's given reported time course of minutes up to [**1-27**]
   hour and associated tinnitis. BPPV also possible. [**Month (only) 11**] have been
   exacerbated by bradycardia or precipitated by arrrhythmia secondary to
   his hyperkalemia, as he did have ventricular response brady in the ED.
   Head CT in ED negative.
   - stable now
   - continue to monitor on tele, ordered echo for syncope workup
   - consider MRI to rule ou posterior circulation ischemia as cause of
   fall
   Ventricular Escape: had arrhythmia in ED secondary to hyperkalemia
   which responded to calcium gluconate.  Has been in NSR throughout
   night, continue to monitor on telemetry, trend K+.
   Anemia: Pt with h/o chronic anemia but Hct 23 below baseline of 27 in
   [**2-1**]. Microcytic anemia suggests iron deficiency anemia. No current
   evidence of bleed with guaiac neg stool, CT head, abd/pelvis, and
   stable Hct since presentation. Occult malignancy a possibility. Is
   severely iron deficient.
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - will give IV iron and one shot of epo today
   - transfuse 1 u PRBCs
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Cont home H2 blocker
   - PIV x 2, active T&S, transfuse for Hct <21
   - f/u SPEP/UPEP
   Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 1.1 in [**7-4**], now 2.4. Likely
   prerenal. Received 3L IVF in ED.
   - IV fluids during day today
   - Trend Cr, monitor UOP with goal >30 cc/h
   - F/u urine cx - NGTD
   - SPEP/UPEP as above
   - Holding citalopram, lisinopril, and oral hypoglycemics for now; avoid
   nephrotoxic agents
   - Consider renal ultrasound if ARF not improving
   Hyperkalemia: K 8.3 likely in setting of acute renal failure. No EKG
   changes. Improved to 6.9 after calcium gluconate and kayexalate in ED.
   Was 4.8 this morning.
   - Trend lytes
   - Repeat EKG in AM.
   Type 2 DM: FSG elevated >400 on arrival, better controlled now on
   insulin gtt. No anion gap or evidence of ketosis. [**7-4**] A1c 7.7 suggests
   suboptimal glycemic control at baseline.
   - now on insulin SC
   Hypotension: Holding home meds for now given lower running BP on
   admission, now normotensive to mildly hypertensive s/p atropine.
   Unclear etiology, probably secondary to bradycardic arrhythmia.
   - restart home HTN meds over course of day
   Hyperlipidemia: Cont home welchol.
   H/o CVA: CT head without acute bleed.
   - Cont ASA
   Schizoaffective disorder:
   - Holding citalopram for now given ARF
   - Cont home seroquel and risperidone
   - talked with nursing home, has baseline aggitation and sometimes
   doesn

","The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident, and schizoaffective disorder who presented to the hospital with a fall. He was admitted to the MICU for concern of anemia, renal failure, and hyperkalemia. 

The patient experienced intermittent respiratory distress, which was likely flash pulmonary edema based on his response to blood pressure control with labetalol and lasix. He also improved when his anxiety was relieved with haloperidol. An echocardiogram done yesterday showed no abnormalities but did show slightly enlarged atria, possibly indicating some diastolic dysfunction.

The patient had a syncope episode during his fall, which may be related to vertigo or Meniere's disease. Brain CT in the ED was negative, and an echo for syncope workup was ordered. An MRI was also considered to rule out posterior circulation ischemia as a cause of the fall.

The patient had ventricular escape and experienced arrhythmia in the ED secondary to hyperkalemia, which responded to calcium gluconate. He has been in normal sinus rhythm throughout the night, and his potassium level is being monitored.

The patient has chronic anemia, with a hematocrit of 23, below his baseline of 27. This suggests iron deficiency anemia. No current evidence of bleeding was found with negative guaiac stool, CT head, abdomen, and pelvis. Occult malignancy is"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with h/o HTN, DM, CVA, schizoaffective disorder presenting
   s/p fall, admitted to MICU over concern for anemia, renal failure, and
   hyperkalemia.
   Intermittent Respiratory Distress: likely flash pulm edema based on his
   response to BP control with labetolol and lasix.  Also better control
   when his anxiety was relieved with haldol.  Echo done yesterday showing
   no abnormality but slightly enlarge atrium, probably has some diastolic
   dysfunction
   - will restart lisinopril for better control
   - consider low dose daily lasix to keep slightly negative
   - better control of anxiety with increase dose of risperidone
   Anxiety: contributing to his episodes, on risperidone, trazadone and
   citalopram at home, will continue all and increase risperidone from [**Hospital1 **]
   to tid dosing.
   S/p fall: Occurred in setting of dizziness, poor historian but
   description suggestive of vertigo. Chronic recurrent episodes
   suggestive of Meniere's given reported time course of minutes up to [**1-27**]
   hour and associated tinnitis. BPPV also possible. [**Month (only) 11**] have been
   exacerbated by bradycardia or precipitated by arrrhythmia secondary to
   his hyperkalemia, as he did have ventricular response brady in the ED.
   Head CT in ED negative.
   - stable now
   - possibly secondary to intermittent hypertension and hypoxia, as he
   does say this happens frequently, unclear how much to believe in
   patient
s history
   - consider MRI to rule ou posterior circulation ischemia as cause of
   fall
   Ventricular Escape: had arrhythmia in ED secondary to hyperkalemia
   which responded to calcium gluconate.  Has been in NSR throughout
   night, continue to monitor on telemetry, trend K+.
   Anemia: Pt with h/o chronic anemia but Hct 23 below baseline of 27 in
   [**2-1**]. Microcytic anemia suggests iron deficiency anemia. No current
   evidence of bleed with guaiac neg stool, CT head, abd/pelvis, and
   stable Hct since presentation. Occult malignancy a possibility. Is
   severely iron deficient.
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - s/p IV iron and one dose epo tomorrow
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Cont home H2 blocker
   - PIV x 2, active T&S, transfuse for Hct <21
   - f/u SPEP/UPEP
 SPEP negative
   Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 1.4 from 2.5 over last two days,
   better with lasix.
   - continue to trend
   - consider low dose lasix to keep slightly negative in setting of
   presumed diastolic heart failure and flashing
   Hyperkalemia: K 8.3 likely in setting of acute renal failure. No EKG
   changes. Improved to 6.9 after calcium gluconate and kayexalate in ED.
   Was 4.8 this morning.
   - Trend lytes
   - Repeat EKG in AM.
   Type 2 DM: FSG elevated >300 last night, controlled well with more
   aggressive sliding scale.
   Hypotension: Holding home meds for now given lower running BP on
   admission, now normotensive to mildly hypertensive s/p atropine.
   Unclear etiology, probably secondary to bradycardic arrhythmia.
   - restart home lisinopril
   Hyperlipidemia: Cont home welchol.
   H/o CVA: CT head without acute bleed.

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident, and schizoaffective disorder. He presented to the hospital after a fall and was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to concerns about anemia, renal failure, and hyperkalemia. The patient has been experiencing intermittent respiratory distress, which is believed to be flash pulmonary edema based on his response to blood pressure control with labetalol and lasix. The patient also has anxiety that contributes to his episodes and is currently being treated with risperidone, trazodone, and citalopram.

The patient's fall occurred in the setting of dizziness, poor historian, but the description suggests vertigo. Chronic recurrent episodes are suggestive of Ménière's disease given the reported time course of minutes up to one hour and associated tinnitus. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is also possible. The patient's episodes have been exacerbated by bradycardia or precipitated by arrhythmia secondary to hyperkalemia, as he did have ventricular response bradycardia in the emergency department (ED).

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with h/o HTN, DM, CVA, schizoaffective disorder presenting
   s/p fall, admitted to MICU over concern for anemia, renal failure, and
   hyperkalemia.
   S/p fall: Occurred in setting of dizziness, poor historian but
   description suggestive of vertigo. Chronic recurrent episodes
   suggestive of Meniere's given reported time course of minutes up to [**1-27**]
   hour and associated tinnitis. BPPV also possible. [**Month (only) 11**] have been
   exacerbated by bradycardia or precipitated by arrrhythmia secondary to
   his hyperkalemia, as he did have ventricular response brady in the ED.
   Head CT in ED negative.
   - stable now
   - continue to monitor on tele, ordered echo for syncope workup
   - consider MRI to rule ou posterior circulation ischemia as cause of
   fall
   Ventricular Escape: had arrhythmia in ED secondary to hyperkalemia
   which responded to calcium gluconate.  Has been in NSR throughout
   night, continue to monitor on telemetry, trend K+.
   Anemia: Pt with h/o chronic anemia but Hct 23 below baseline of 27 in
   [**2-1**]. Microcytic anemia suggests iron deficiency anemia. No current
   evidence of bleed with guaiac neg stool, CT head, abd/pelvis, and
   stable Hct since presentation. Occult malignancy a possibility. Is
   severely iron deficient.
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - will give IV iron and one shot of epo today
   - transfuse 1 u PRBCs
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Cont home H2 blocker
   - PIV x 2, active T&S, transfuse for Hct <21
   - f/u SPEP/UPEP
   Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 1.1 in [**7-4**], now 2.4. Likely
   prerenal. Received 3L IVF in ED.
   - IV fluids during day today
   - Trend Cr, monitor UOP with goal >30 cc/h
   - F/u urine cx - NGTD
   - SPEP/UPEP as above
   - Holding citalopram, lisinopril, and oral hypoglycemics for now; avoid
   nephrotoxic agents
   - Consider renal ultrasound if ARF not improving
   Hyperkalemia: K 8.3 likely in setting of acute renal failure. No EKG
   changes. Improved to 6.9 after calcium gluconate and kayexalate in ED.
   Was 4.8 this morning.
   - Trend lytes
   - Repeat EKG in AM.
   Type 2 DM: FSG elevated >400 on arrival, better controlled now on
   insulin gtt. No anion gap or evidence of ketosis. [**7-4**] A1c 7.7 suggests
   suboptimal glycemic control at baseline.
   - now on insulin SC
   Hypotension: Holding home meds for now given lower running BP on
   admission, now normotensive to mildly hypertensive s/p atropine.
   Unclear etiology, probably secondary to bradycardic arrhythmia.
   - restart home HTN meds over course of day
   Hyperlipidemia: Cont home welchol.
   H/o CVA: CT head without acute bleed.
   - Cont ASA
   Schizoaffective disorder:
   - Holding citalopram for now given ARF
   - Cont home seroquel and risperidone
   - talked with nursing home, has baseline aggitation and sometimes

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident, and schizoaffective disorder. He presented to the ICU for suspected anemia, renal failure, and hyperkalemia after experiencing a fall. The patient has been receiving treatment for various conditions, including iron deficiency anemia, acute on chronic renal failure, hyperkalemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypotension, hyperlipidemia, previous cerebrovascular accident, and schizoaffective disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient is severely iron deficient, and further treatment is required to address this condition. If left untreated, it may lead to worsening anemia, fatigue, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.1 to 2.4, indicating worsening renal function. Close monitoring of urine output, fluid balance, electrolytes, and renal function parameters is crucial to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels were initially elevated at 8.3 but have been brought down to 4.8 with appropriate interventions. Continued monitoring of electrolytes and close observation for any signs of arrhythmias or cardiac complications are essential.

4. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient's blood glucose levels were initially elevated, but better control has been"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with h/o HTN, DM, CVA, schizoaffective disorder presenting
   s/p fall, admitted to MICU over concern for anemia, renal failure, and
   hyperkalemia.
   S/p fall: Occurred in setting of dizziness, poor historian but
   description suggestive of vertigo. Chronic recurrent episodes
   suggestive of Meniere's given reported time course of minutes up to [**1-27**]
   hour and associated tinnitis. BPPV also possible. [**Month (only) 11**] have been
   exacerbated by bradycardia or precipitated by arrrhythmia secondary to
   his hyperkalemia, as he did have ventricular response brady in the ED.
   Head CT in ED negative.
   - stable now
   - continue to monitor on tele, ordered echo for syncope workup
   - consider MRI to rule ou posterior circulation ischemia as cause of
   fall
   Ventricular Escape: had arrhythmia in ED secondary to hyperkalemia
   which responded to calcium gluconate.  Has been in NSR throughout
   night, continue to monitor on telemetry, trend K+.
   Anemia: Pt with h/o chronic anemia but Hct 23 below baseline of 27 in
   [**2-1**]. Microcytic anemia suggests iron deficiency anemia. No current
   evidence of bleed with guaiac neg stool, CT head, abd/pelvis, and
   stable Hct since presentation. Occult malignancy a possibility. Is
   severely iron deficient.
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - will give IV iron and one shot of epo today
   - transfuse 1 u PRBCs
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Cont home H2 blocker
   - PIV x 2, active T&S, transfuse for Hct <21
   - f/u SPEP/UPEP
   Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 1.1 in [**7-4**], now 2.4. Likely
   prerenal. Received 3L IVF in ED.
   - IV fluids during day today
   - Trend Cr, monitor UOP with goal >30 cc/h
   - F/u urine cx - NGTD
   - SPEP/UPEP as above
   - Holding citalopram, lisinopril, and oral hypoglycemics for now; avoid
   nephrotoxic agents
   - Consider renal ultrasound if ARF not improving
   Hyperkalemia: K 8.3 likely in setting of acute renal failure. No EKG
   changes. Improved to 6.9 after calcium gluconate and kayexalate in ED.
   Was 4.8 this morning.
   - Trend lytes
   - Repeat EKG in AM.
   Type 2 DM: FSG elevated >400 on arrival, better controlled now on
   insulin gtt. No anion gap or evidence of ketosis. [**7-4**] A1c 7.7 suggests
   suboptimal glycemic control at baseline.
   - now on insulin SC
   Hypotension: Holding home meds for now given lower running BP on
   admission, now normotensive to mildly hypertensive s/p atropine.
   Unclear etiology, probably secondary to bradycardic arrhythmia.
   - restart home HTN meds over course of day
   Hyperlipidemia: Cont home welchol.
   H/o CVA: CT head without acute bleed.
   - Cont ASA
   Schizoaffective disorder:
   - Holding citalopram for now given ARF
   - Cont home seroquel and risperidone
   - talked with nursing home, has baseline aggitation and sometimes
   doesn
t follow commands
   Insomnia: Trazodone prn
   GERD: Cont home ranitidine

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident, and schizoaffective disorder. He presented to the MICU due to a fall and was found to have anemia, renal failure, and hyperkalemia. The patient's current condition is stable, but he has experienced several episodes of agitation and hypertension, which may be related to his underlying conditions such as hyperkalemia and bradycardia. The patient is also being treated for iron deficiency anemia and acute on chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's fall and subsequent immobilization can increase the risk of pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.
2. Delirium: The patient's agitation and perseverative thought process may indicate delirium, which can be common in older adults with acute illnesses or in the ICU setting.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of hypertension, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia puts him at risk for cardiac arrhythmias or even myocardial infarction.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Given the patient's history of chronic anemia and possible occult malignancy, there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility due to the fall and hospitalization increases the risk of developing DVT.

   failure and bradycardia.  Hypoxemic resp distress episodes yest.
   Hypoxemic resp distress: may have been multifactorial, related to
   agitation/ anxiety, possible aspiration, component of flash edema is
   possible though echo and CXR don't really fit
   -increase risperidone dosing to control agitation
   -head of bed up/ aspiration precautions
   -resume home antihypertensives
   -empiric aspiration coverage for now, would narrow to po ABX coverage
   or possibly limit course given only mild hypoxemia as symptom, could
   just be a pneumonitis
   Fall- longstanding dizziness for which pt is on meclizine, poss
   hypovolemia and orthostasis vs poss syncope given bradycardia in ED
   -bradycardia w/u and eval as below
   -check orthostatics
   -local wound care for L temporal abrasion
   -would probably check MRI/A brain given prior vert artery disease and
   possibility of a post circulation problem

   I was physically present with the MICU housestaff  team on this date
   for discussion of the above history, exam and assessment and plan with
   which I agree.  I independently examined the patient and would add the
   following comments:
   74 yo male with schizoaffective disorder, renal insufficiency admitted
   initially with acute on chronic renal failure, hyperkalemia, and
   bradycardia. Yesterday, he had an episode of acute respiratory distress
   with worsening hypercarbia in the context of uncontrolled hypertension
   (agitation + holding BP meds for renal failure), aspiration, and
   possible flash pulmonary edema- required NIPPV briefly and was treated
   with diuresis, abx, resumption of BP meds, adjustments in psychiatric

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, dementia, chronic kidney disease, who was admitted after an unwitnessed fall. He presented with hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, and bradycardia. The patient experienced episodes of hypoxemic respiratory distress yesterday, which were treated with BiPAP, diuresis, broad antibiotics, and haloperidol. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/35-131/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula and receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation. Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, no murmurs, and no crackles. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal troponin T levels. Imaging studies include an echocardiogram showing normal ejection fraction and left atrial enlargement, as well as chest X-rays showing right-sided infiltrate on admission and no change on subsequent imaging. The patient's assessment and plan include controlling agitation, implementing aspiration precautions, resuming home antihypertensives, providing empiric aspiration coverage, evaluating bradycardia, checking orthostatics, and conducting further diagnostic tests such as"

   Hypoxemic resp distress: may have been multifactorial, related to
   agitation/ anxiety, possible aspiration, component of flash edema is
   possible though echo and CXR don't really fit
   -increase risperidone dosing to control agitation
   -head of bed up/ aspiration precautions
   -resume home antihypertensives
   -empiric aspiration coverage for now, would narrow to po ABX coverage
   or possibly limit course given only mild hypoxemia as symptom, could
   just be a pneumonitis
   Fall- longstanding dizziness for which pt is on meclizine, poss
   hypovolemia and orthostasis vs poss syncope given bradycardia in ED
   -bradycardia w/u and eval as below
   -check orthostatics
   -local wound care for L temporal abrasion
   -would probably check MRI/A brain given prior vert artery disease and
   possibility of a post circulation problem
   [**Name (NI) 7364**] probably related to hyperkalemia, now resolved

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with h/o HTN, DM, CVA, schizoaffective disorder presenting
   s/p fall, admitted to MICU over concern for anemia, renal failure, and
   hyperkalemia.
   Intermittent Respiratory Distress: likely flash pulm edema based on his
   response to BP control with labetolol and lasix.  Also better control
   when his anxiety was relieved with haldol.  Echo done yesterday showing
   no abnormality but slightly enlarge atrium, probably has some diastolic
   dysfunction
   - will restart lisinopril for better control
   - consider low dose daily lasix to keep slightly negative
   - better control of anxiety with increase dose of risperidone
   Anxiety: contributing to his episodes, on risperidone, trazadone and
   citalopram at home, will continue all and increase risperidone from [**Hospital1 **]
   to tid dosing.
   S/p fall: Occurred in setting of dizziness, poor historian but
   description suggestive of vertigo. Chronic recurrent episodes
   suggestive of Meniere's given reported time course of minutes up to [**1-27**]
   hour and associated tinnitis. BPPV also possible. [**Month (only) 11**] have been
   exacerbated by bradycardia or precipitated by arrrhythmia secondary to
   his hyperkalemia, as he did have ventricular response brady in the ED.
   Head CT in ED negative.
   - stable now
   - possibly secondary to intermittent hypertension and hypoxia, as he
   does say this happens frequently, unclear how much to believe in
   patient
s history
   - consider MRI to rule ou posterior circulation ischemia as cause of
   fall
   Ventricular Escape: had arrhythmia in ED secondary to hyperkalemia
   which responded to calcium gluconate.  Has been in NSR throughout
   night, continue to monitor on telemetry, trend K+.
   Anemia: Pt with h/o chronic anemia but Hct 23 below baseline of 27 in
   [**2-1**]. Microcytic anemia suggests iron deficiency anemia. No current
   evidence of bleed with guaiac neg stool, CT head, abd/pelvis, and
   stable Hct since presentation. Occult malignancy a possibility. Is
   severely iron deficient.
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - s/p IV iron and one dose epo tomorrow

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and schizoaffective disorder. He presented to the MICU with concerns for anemia, renal failure, and hyperkalemia. The patient has intermittent respiratory distress, which is likely flash pulmonary edema based on his response to blood pressure control with labetalol and lasix. His anxiety was relieved with haloperidol. An echocardiogram showed no abnormalities but revealed slightly enlarged atrium, possibly indicating diastolic dysfunction. The patient's anxiety is contributing to his episodes, and he is currently on risperidone, trazodone, and citalopram at home. The dose of risperidone will be increased from [Hospital1] to tid dosing. 

The patient had a fall in the setting of dizziness and poor historian, but the description suggests vertigo. Chronic recurrent episodes are suggestive of Meniere's disease given the reported time course of minutes up to 1 hour and associated tinnitus. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is also possible. The patient's vertigo episodes have been exacerbated by bradycardia or precipitated by arrhythmia secondary to hyperkalemia, as he did have a ventricular response bradycardia in the ED. A head CT in the ED was negative.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with h/o HTN, DM, CVA, schizoaffective disorder presenting
   s/p fall, admitted to MICU over concern for anemia, renal failure, and
   hyperkalemia.
   Fever: had fever overnight, no new localizing symptoms.  CXR improved
   from yesterday.  Pancultured overnight.
   - follow up cultures
   - cont levoquin for possible aspiration pneumonia
   Intermittent Respiratory Distress: likely flash pulm edema based on his
   response to BP control with labetolol and lasix.  Also better control
   when his anxiety was relieved with haldol.  Echo done showing no
   abnormality but slightly enlarge atrium, probably has some diastolic
   dysfunction
   - no more episodes since yesterday, cont lisionpril/anxiety control
   Anxiety: contributing to his episodes, on risperidone, trazadone and
   citalopram at home, will continue increased risperidone dosing.
   S/p fall: Occurred in setting of dizziness, poor historian but
   description suggestive of vertigo. Chronic recurrent episodes
   suggestive of Meniere's given reported time course of minutes up to [**1-27**]
   hour and associated tinnitis. BPPV also possible. [**Month (only) 11**] have been
   exacerbated by bradycardia or precipitated by arrrhythmia secondary to
   his hyperkalemia, as he did have ventricular response brady in the ED.
   Head CT in ED negative.
   - stable now
   - likely due to arrhthymia secondary to hyperkalemia
   - consider MRI to rule ou posterior circulation ischemia as cause of
   fall
   Ventricular Escape: had arrhythmia in ED secondary to hyperkalemia
   which responded to calcium gluconate.  Has been in NSR throughout
   night, continue to monitor on telemetry, trend K+.
   Anemia: Pt with h/o chronic anemia but Hct 23 below baseline of 27 in
   [**2-1**]. Microcytic anemia suggests iron deficiency anemia. No current
   evidence of bleed with guaiac neg stool, CT head, abd/pelvis, and
   stable Hct since presentation. Occult malignancy a possibility. Is
   severely iron deficient.
   - Trend Hct daily
   - s/p IV iron and one dose epo tomorrow
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Cont home H2 blocker
   - PIV x 2, active T&S, transfuse for Hct <21
   - f/u SPEP/UPEP
 SPEP negative
   Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 1.2 from 2.5 over last three days.
   - continue to trend cr
   - now at baseline
   Hyperkalemia: K 8.3 likely in setting of acute renal failure. Improved
   to 6.9 after calcium gluconate and kayexalate in ED. Has been normals
   since then.
   - Trend lytes
   Type 2 DM: FSG elevated >300 yesterday, controlled well with more
   aggressive sliding scale.
   - on glyburide and metformin at home, likely does not get good control,
   consider outpatient [**Last Name (un) 294**] referral
   Hyperlipidemia: Cont home welchol.
   H/o CVA: CT head without acute bleed.

","The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident, and schizoaffective disorder who presented to the MICU with concerns for anemia, renal failure, and hyperkalemia. He has been experiencing intermittent respiratory distress, which was initially thought to be flash pulmonary edema but has since improved with blood pressure control and relief of anxiety. An echocardiogram showed no abnormalities but did reveal a slightly enlarged atrium and some diastolic dysfunction.

The patient's anxiety has been contributing to his episodes, and he is currently on risperidone, trazodone, and citalopram at home. His medication regimen will be continued, with an increased dosing of risperidone.

The patient also had a fall in the setting of dizziness and poor historian, but the description suggests vertigo. Chronic recurrent episodes are suggestive of Meniere's disease given the reported time course of minutes up to one hour and associated tinnitus. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is also a possibility. He has had exacerbated episodes of dizziness and vertigo in the past month, which may have been exacerbated by bradycardia or precipitated by arrhythmia secondary to hyperkalemia. A head CT in the emergency department was negative.

The patient had ventricular escape rhythm in the ED secondary to hyperkalemia, which responded to calcium gluconate"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with h/o HTN, DM, CVA, schizoaffective disorder presenting
   s/p fall, admitted to MICU over concern for anemia, renal failure, and
   hyperkalemia.
   Intermittent Respiratory Distress: likely flash pulm edema based on his
   response to BP control with labetolol and lasix.  Also better control
   when his anxiety was relieved with haldol.  Echo done yesterday showing
   no abnormality but slightly enlarge atrium, probably has some diastolic
   dysfunction
   - will restart lisinopril for better control
   - consider low dose daily lasix to keep slightly negative
   - better control of anxiety with increase dose of risperidone
   Anxiety: contributing to his episodes, on risperidone, trazadone and
   citalopram at home, will continue all and increase risperidone from [**Hospital1 **]
   to tid dosing.
   S/p fall: Occurred in setting of dizziness, poor historian but
   description suggestive of vertigo. Chronic recurrent episodes
   suggestive of Meniere's given reported time course of minutes up to [**1-27**]
   hour and associated tinnitis. BPPV also possible. [**Month (only) 11**] have been
   exacerbated by bradycardia or precipitated by arrrhythmia secondary to
   his hyperkalemia, as he did have ventricular response brady in the ED.
   Head CT in ED negative.
   - stable now
   - possibly secondary to intermittent hypertension and hypoxia, as he
   does say this happens frequently, unclear how much to believe in
   patient
s history
   - consider MRI to rule ou posterior circulation ischemia as cause of
   fall
   Ventricular Escape: had arrhythmia in ED secondary to hyperkalemia
   which responded to calcium gluconate.  Has been in NSR throughout
   night, continue to monitor on telemetry, trend K+.
   Anemia: Pt with h/o chronic anemia but Hct 23 below baseline of 27 in
   [**2-1**]. Microcytic anemia suggests iron deficiency anemia. No current
   evidence of bleed with guaiac neg stool, CT head, abd/pelvis, and
   stable Hct since presentation. Occult malignancy a possibility. Is
   severely iron deficient.
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - s/p IV iron and one dose epo tomorrow
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Cont home H2 blocker
   - PIV x 2, active T&S, transfuse for Hct <21
   - f/u SPEP/UPEP
 SPEP negative
   Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 1.4 from 2.5 over last two days,
   better with lasix.
   - continue to trend
   - consider low dose lasix to keep slightly negative in setting of
   presumed diastolic heart failure and flashing
   Hyperkalemia: K 8.3 likely in setting of acute renal failure. No EKG
   changes. Improved to 6.9 after calcium gluconate and kayexalate in ED.
   Was 4.8 this morning.
   - Trend lytes
   - Repeat EKG in AM.
   Type 2 DM: FSG elevated >300 last night, controlled well with more
   aggressive sliding scale.
   Hypotension: Holding home meds for now given lower running BP on
   admission, now normotensive to mildly hypertensive s/p atropine.
   Unclear etiology, probably secondary to bradycardic arrhythmia.
   - restart home lisinopril
   Hyperlipidemia: Cont home welchol.
   H/o CVA: CT head without acute bleed.
   - Cont ASA
   Schizoaffective disorder:
   - restarting citalopram
   - Cont home seroquel and risperidone
   - talked with nursing home, has baseline aggitation and sometimes
   doesn
t follow commands
   Insomnia: Trazodone qHS
   GERD: Cont home ranitidine

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident, and schizoaffective disorder. He presented to the MICU with concerns for anemia, renal failure, and hyperkalemia after experiencing a fall. 

Since admission, the patient has shown improvement in respiratory distress, which was initially thought to be flash pulmonary edema. His blood pressure has been better controlled with labetalol and lasix. Anxiety has also improved with an increased dose of risperidone.

The patient's episodes of dizziness and vertigo, leading to falls, are suggestive of Meniere's disease or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). An MRI is recommended to rule out posterior circulation ischemia as a cause of the fall.

The patient experienced ventricular escape rhythm in the emergency department secondary to hyperkalemia, but has been in normal sinus rhythm since then. Monitoring on telemetry and trending potassium levels will continue.

The patient has chronic anemia with a hemoglobin level below baseline, indicating iron deficiency anemia. Occult malignancy is a possibility, so monitoring the hemoglobin trend and conducting further investigations like stool guaiac, serum iron studies, and erythropoietin levels is advised.

Renal function has improved from a baseline creatinine level of 2.5 to 1.4 over the last two days, likely due to the administration of lasix."
