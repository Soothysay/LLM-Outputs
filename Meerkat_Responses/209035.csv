   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (A-fib), and neurosarcoidosis. She presented with dyspnea and hypotension. The patient has been admitted multiple times before, including for pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF), and was discharged home not requiring supplemental oxygen.

In the emergency department, the patient was placed on nonrebreather (NRB) and received a 250cc bolus due to low blood pressure. Her lactate level is elevated at 4.6. She was given antibiotics for right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA) and received a total of 1.5 liters of fluid in the ED.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) dropped to the 40s mmHg, but her INR was within normal range at 0.9. She received a total of 2.5 liters of fluid, with the last bolus given at 1 AM, which increased her blood pressure.

The patient's allergies include sulfa (sulfonamides) and isoniazid. She has been receiving various medications, including piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and pantoprazole (Protonix).

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (A-fib), and neurosarcoidosis. She was admitted with dyspnea and hypotension. Her medical history includes chronic low-dose corticosteroid use and chronic indwelling Foley catheter. The patient's current condition is critical, and she requires intensive care unit (ICU) care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and hypotension could be due to pneumonia. The presence of rhonchi on chest examination supports this possibility. Antibiotics have been initiated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's history of CAD, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and poor forward flow on echocardiogram raise the suspicion of CHF. Diuretics like Lasix have been given, but the patient's blood pressure dropped further, indicating ongoing volume overload or possible septic shock.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate level, tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but the source of infection needs to be identified and treated appropriately.
4. Neurosarcoidosis exacerbation"

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation (Afib) who presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and leukocytosis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure of 93/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including esmolol, lopressor, lasix, metoprolol, zofran, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient also has allergies to sulfa and isoniazid.

The patient's cardiac enzymes peaked and are trending down, indicating improvement in myocardial injury. However, the patient remains hypotensive with a MAP of 56, which may be due to volume overload exacerbating systolic dysfunction or infection. The patient's leukocytosis is likely secondary to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, possibly from recent levofloxacin use.

The patient's chest CT scan is pending for further evaluation of pneumonia versus cardiac causes of SOB. The patient's blood culture and urine culture are also pending. 

The patient's management plan includes holding off on lasix due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation (Afib) who was readmitted to the ICU with shortness of breath (SOB) and leukocytosis. The patient received esmolol, lopressor, and lasix for her symptoms, but her blood pressure dropped to 56/65 mmHg and her heart rate increased. Metoprolol was administered three times, with a decrease in blood pressure to 56 mmHg. Lasix was held, and the patient's cardiac enzymes peaked and are now trending down. The patient also received Zofran for nausea and had a chest CT pending. Allergies include sulfa and isoniazid. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 93/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,466 mL and output of 893 mL. 

Laboratory results include white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, sodium of 144 mg/dL, potassium of 3.4 mEq/L, creatinine of 1."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and leukocytosis. She did not tolerate esmolol (hypotensive) but showed improvement with lopressor. She was given a Lasix drip overnight but it was stopped due to low mean arterial pressure (MAP). The patient also tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) toxicity and had an improved respiratory status. The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamides) and isoniazid, and has been on various antibiotics including piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin. She is currently on several medications such as protonix, ISS, aspirin, hydrocortisone, metoprolol, and vitamin D.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and rapid ventricular rate suggest a possible cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.
2. C. diff colitis: The patient tested positive for C. diff toxicity, indicating a bacterial infection caused by Clostridium difficile. This infection can lead to severe diarrhea and colitis if left untreated.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient has a large right pleural effusion, which is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space around the lungs. This can impair lung"

   69 y.o.f. with CAD, neuro-sarcoidosis, CHF, who presents with SOB,
   Sepsis found to have c.diff and now with afib with RVR difficult to
   control HR
   # SOB
  CHF vs PNA most likely etiology.  CXR without definitive
   answer.  CT scan done but read is pending
   -          Lasix gtt stopped.  Will hold off for now given  BP on the
   low side, though MAP >65
   -          Stop vanco/zosyn since CT doesn
t show consolidation or
   evidence of PNA.
   # Leukocytosis
 C.diff positive- likely from recent levofloxacin use.
   Likely clear source of leukocytosis.
   -          Blood/Urine cx NGTD.
   -          C.diff positive.  Will start PO vanco given ICU status,
   sepsis at admission, and WBC >15K.  .
   # Hypotension
  MAPs maintaing >60.
   -          Likely patient has decreased forward flow secondary to
   volume overload further exacerbating systolic dysfunction although
   could also be from infection
   -          Needs maximal LV fill time; start digoxin load and
   maintenance for improved HR control since patient
s BP not tolerating
   BBlocker
   -          PO vanco for infection
   -          Decrease stress dose steroids to hydrocort 25 mg IV Q12
   # Cardiac
   ISCHEMIA
 Symptoms and EKG not c/w ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of hypotension.
   -          ASA
   -          Trop peak at 0.41; patient may need cath after stabilization
   to evaluate coronary anatomy given h/o MI and no PCI
   -          hold BB for now given hypotension.
   -          Statin
   RHYTHM
 Afib with RVR, likely in the setting of hypotension and
   sepsis.
   -          Telemetry
   -          Start digoxin for rate control; hold on bblocker
   -          Hold coumadin as supratherapeutic
   PUMP
 EF 20-30
s from prior MI
   -          Cont diuresis with lasix gtt to improve forward flow in the

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), neuro-sarcoidosis, congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presents with shortness of breath (SOB) and is found to have Clostridium difficile (c.diff) infection. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), which is difficult to control. 

24-hour events include the following:
- The patient was started on oral vancomycin for c.diff infection.
- Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) IV was discontinued.
- Digoxin was loaded for heart rate control due to persistent tachycardia despite low blood pressure.
- Hydrocortisone dosage was decreased to 25 mg IV Q12 due to improvement in the patient's condition.
- Lasix gtt was held due to low blood pressure.
- No acute thoracentesis was performed because the patient's INR was high and there was chronic pleural effusion.
- No definitive answer was obtained from the chest X-ray (CXR) or computed tomography (CT) scan.

Assessment and plan include the following:
- The patient's SOB is likely due to CHF or pneumonia (PNA). A CT scan is pending to evaluate for PNA.
- Leukocytosis is present, and the patient has a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), neuro-sarcoidosis, congestive heart failure (CHF), who presents with shortness of breath (SOB) and sepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). The patient is currently in the ICU and requires intensive care management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's SOB and AFib with RVR may lead to acute respiratory failure due to decreased forward flow and pulmonary edema.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's history of CHF and decreased forward flow may result in cardiogenic shock, which can be life-threatening.
3. Sepsis: The patient has already developed sepsis, which can worsen if not appropriately managed. C. diff infection increases the risk of recurrent or more severe infections.
4. Stroke: Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of clot formation, which can lead to a stroke if a clot dislodges and travels to the brain.
5. Worsening Heart Failure: The patient's underlying CHF may worsen due to the increased strain on the heart caused by sepsis, C. diff infection, and other factors.
6. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's low blood pressure and use of diuretics may lead"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), neuro-sarcoidosis, congestive heart failure (CHF), who presents with shortness of breath (SOB). The patient was found to have Clostridium difficile (c.diff) infection and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), which is difficult to control. The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 111 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 100/56 mmHg to 102/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.
- Physical examination: General appearance of being well-nourished, obese, and able to speak in complete sentences with dyspnea. Cardiovascular examination reveals tachycardia and irregular pulse with a JVP of 10-12cm. Lung examination shows bronchial breath sounds at the bases without crackles or wheezes. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Extremities show trace to 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurological examination is normal.
- Laboratory results: White blood cell count of 11.6 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, sodium of 129 mg/dL, potassium of 0.9 mg/dL, chloride of 16 mg/dL, magnesium of 1.9 mg/dL, and phosphate of 2.4 mg/dL. Creatinine level is elevated at 1.0 mg/dL, troponin T is at 0.41 ng/mL, and lactic acid level is 3.1 mmol/L. Other lab results are within normal limits.
- Imaging: Chest X-ray is pending, and a CT scan has been done but the results are still pending.
- Plan: Hold off on lasix due to low blood pressure, continue with rate control as the primary goal. Treat c.diff with vancomycin for a full 14-day course. Evaluate for ischemia and consider a cardiac catheterization after stabilization. Hold beta-blockers for now due to hypotension. Start statin therapy. Monitor rhythm and consider digoxin or diltiazem for rate control. Hold warfarin as the INR is supratherapeutic. Restart prednisone at 10 mg daily for sarcoidosis. Continue ICU care until MAP is maintained above 60 and HR control is achieved."

   1. Right moderate pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion with
   adjacent bibasilar atelectasis.
   2. Localized area of left upper lobe ground-glass opacity that could
   represent residual edema and/or infection. Followup examination in six
   months
   is necessary to exclude any neoplastic process.
   3. Probable tracheomalacia. If there is a clinical concern then a
   dedicated
   CT trachea should be performed.
   4. Cardiomegaly and extensive coronary artery atherosclerotic
   calcification.
   5. Post-laminectomy changes at the cervicothoracic junction.Spinal
   calcification most likely epidural in location. A cervical spine CT
   and/or
   MRI examination is recommended considering the fact that the patient
   has
   history of neurosarcoidosis of the spine.
   Assessment and Plan
   69 y.o.f. with CAD, neuro-sarcoidosis, CHF, who presents with SOB,
   Sepsis found to have c.diff and now with afib with RVR difficult to
   control HR
   #AF with RVR:  Known long standing AF, went into RVR likley in setting
   of infection/dehydration.  Has been difficult to control thus far,
   limited by hypotension.  Have dig loaded pt, probably a good choice for
   her for rate control in the long term given her CAD and low EF as well
   as her sedentary lifestyle in setting of neurosarcoid.  Unlikley to
   have much effect in short term especially due to sympathetic drive from
   active infection.
   -continue dig, follow levels, may need to decrease as on high dose
   -Off dilt gtt, initially responded and was switched back to PO BB.
   -small IVF boluses, follow UOP and HR for response.
   -continue telemetry
   -Had held coumadin for supratherapeutic INR, now 2.2, restart at home
   dose 4mg, monitor closely as pt now on dig and may need to be
   re-dosed.
    # SOB
Current theory is that pt developed c. diff, became dehydrated
   and went into AF with RVR exacerbating CHF.  No evidence for PNA.
   Currently pt appears less dyspneic after lasix gtt, total picture now
   is actually that she is likely volume down given diarrhea, hypotension
   and low UOP.  Pt has pleural effusions but after investigating OSH
   records these appear to be chronic, less appearance of pulmonary edema
   on CXR.
   -          Will hold off on lasix gtt for now given  BP on the low side
   and pt likely dry.  Will try small IVF boluses.
   -          O2 status stable.

 C.diff positive- likely from recent levofloxacin use.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), neuro-sarcoidosis, congestive heart failure (CHF), who presents with shortness of breath (SOB) and sepsis. She has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), which is difficult to control.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/64 mmHg to 116/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula. The patient is intubated and sedated but rousable with turning.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to sulfa and isoniazid, and previous antibiotic use. She has been receiving various medications including digoxin, metoprolol, pantoprazole, prednisone, simvastatin, vancomycin, and others.

Physical examination findings include general obesity, no abnormal findings in the cardiovascular system, bronchial breath sounds at the bases with no crackles or wheezes, trace to 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema, and normal neurologic examination.

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y.o.f. with CAD, neuro-sarcoidosis, CHF, who presents with SOB,
   Sepsis found to have c.diff and now with afib with RVR difficult to
   control HR
    # SOB
  CHF vs PNA most likely etiology.  CXR without definitive
   answer.  CT scan done but read is pending
   -          Will hold off on lasix gtt for now given  BP on the low
   side, though MAP >65
   -          O2 status continues to improve.  Satting 92-95% on RA.
   Doesn
t appear completely volume overloaded and primary goal will be
   rate control
   # Leukocytosis
 C.diff positive- likely from recent levofloxacin use.
   -          Blood/Urine cx NGTD.
   -          C.diff positive.  Cont PO vanco for full 14 day course.
   # Cardiac
   ISCHEMIA
 Symptoms and EKG not c/w ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of hypotension.
   -          ASA
   -          Trop peak at 0.41; patient may need cath after stabilization
   to evaluate coronary anatomy given h/o MI and no PCI
   -          hold BB for now given hypotension.
   -          Statin
   RHYTHM
 Afib with RVR, likely in the setting of hypotension and
   sepsis.
   -          Telemetry
   -          Digoxin loaded, but not a great effect; likely because RVR
   [**2-9**] sympathetic overdrive.  Will try diltiazem gtt and see if that
   controls HR better without dropping BP as much as metoprolol
   -          would eventually need to switch back to bblocker since
   patient has a reduced EF; though will hold off until BP improves and
   can tolerate
   -          Hold coumadin as supratherapeutic
   PUMP
 EF 20-30
s from prior MI
   -          hold diuresis while trying rate control.  Goal even to
   slightly net negative.
   -          Cont ASA, statin.  Once BP [**Last Name (LF) 2167**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] need ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**] and
   maybe need to consider restarting bblocker
   # Hypotension
  MAPs maintaing >60.
   -          Likely patient has decreased forward flow secondary to
   volume overload further exacerbating systolic dysfunction although
   could also be from infection
   -          Needs maximal LV fill time; rate control as above
   -          PO vanco for infection
   -          stop stress dose steroids.  Re-start prednisone 10 mg daily
   # DM
   -          HISS
   -          Diabetic diet
   # Sarcoidosis
 Chronic.  neurosarcoid.
   -          restart prednisone 10 mg daily
   -          CT scan read pending to evaluate for pulmonary sarcoid;
   although no document h/o pulmonary sarcoid

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), neuro-sarcoidosis, congestive heart failure (CHF), who presents with shortness of breath (SOB). The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (c.diff) infection and is experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), which is difficult to control.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F) and a current temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), indicating a decrease in body temperature. Her heart rate is elevated at 113 beats per minute, with a blood pressure reading of 97/64 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal range at 21 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-dressed, obese female who is able to speak in complete sentences but experiences dyspnea. She has a tachycardic and irregular pulse, along with a slightly elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 10-12 cm. No crackles or wheezes are appreciated in her lungs, and she has trace to 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16."
