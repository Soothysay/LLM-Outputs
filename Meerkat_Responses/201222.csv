   Assessment and Plan
   # Chest Pain/CAD: Given the history, this pattern of chest pain fits
   unstable angina, though this could either be from plaque rupture vs
   increased cardiac demand in excess of known poor supply.
   - Appreciate cardiology recs
   - cont  IV heparin gtt
   - trend cardiac biomarkers ; so far no e/o acute infarct
   - ultrafiltration to improve CHF aim for 1.5L negative on CVVHD
   - would ideally try nitro gtt for cp, though he presently is requiring
   a small amount of vasopressors for BP support for ultrafiltration, and
   nitro gtt can lower bp further. as such, will try morphine for ain
   control.
   - will increase statin, lfts added on
   - f/u echo
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF
   - ultrafiltration via CVVH
   - holding lisinopril for now given hypotension; can try to add back
   captopril in morning for afterload reduction
   # Hypotension: likely cardiogenic in nature
   - norepinephrine for map >55-60 as needed for fluid
   # Hyperkalemia:
   - CVVH against K bath of 0 to bring K down; once K reaches <6 will
   change to K bath of 2.
   - cont calcium
   # Diabetes
   - reduce glargine in half to 13 given NPO status last night
   -with added diet may require extra insulin
   #Abd pain: nonspecific,? bowel edema, LFTS wnl
   -monitor lactate later to monitor for ischemic bowel
   # ESRD on HD: history of renal transplant
   - cont prednisone 5mg daily
   - cvvh in icu for now; appreciate renal following
   # h/o Stroke
   - warfarin on hold given potential for cardiac intervention; will
   bridge with heparin.
   # Recurrent UTIs
   - no current symptoms or signs; defer w/u to outpatient
   # h/o UGIB
   - no recent bleeding; will carefully titrate heparin, watch for plavix
   effect. continue PPIs.
   # Back Pain: presently inactive
   # Gout: allopurinol 100mg PO daily
   # FEN: NPO / CVVH / regular diet

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old overweight male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes, and multiple other medical comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU for CVVH due to acute decompensated heart failure and hyperkalemia. 

On admission, the patient's vital signs were stable with a temperature of 35.8Â°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 97/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. His physical examination revealed crackles in the right lower lung field and peripheral edema in both lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets. His kidney function tests indicated elevated creatinine levels, while troponin-T was within normal range. Other lab results showed elevated potassium levels, slightly low calcium levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's current medications include heparin, norepinephrine, morphine, dextrose, lisinopril, and prednisone. 

The patient's medical plan includes ultrafiltration via CVVH for acute on chronic systolic CHF, holding lisinopril for hypotension, using norepinephrine for blood pressure support, CVVH against K bath of 0 to manage hyperkalemia, reducing glargine dose due to NPO status, and continuing prednisone for ESRD on HD.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include worsening heart failure, further electrolyte imbalances, infection due to prolonged ICU stay, and potential bleeding events given the use of anticoagulation therapy."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and currently experiencing chest pain, heart failure, and shock. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.2Â°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 93/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including norepinephrine, morphine sulfate, dextrose, pantoprazole, heparin, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient's chest pain and low blood pressure may indicate worsening heart failure or a cardiac event such as a myocardial infarction. Management should include diuretics to remove excess fluid, continued heparin therapy, follow-up with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and cardiology recommendations.
2. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient requires ongoing hemodialysis to manage his renal failure. Monitoring of electrolyte levels and adjustment of treatment accordingly is necessary.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium level should be addressed through further hemodialysis sessions and careful monitoring of electrolyte levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for chest pain, likely an exacerbation of CHF or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), abdominal pain, previous cerebrovascular accident (cva), recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), prior upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding, and gout. He is receiving various medications including heparin, morphine, pantoprazole, lantus, and allopurinol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Exacerbation of CHF or ACS: The patient's chest pain may be due to worsening heart failure or an acute cardiac event. Close monitoring and appropriate medical management, including fluid removal through HD and pain control with morphine, are necessary.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium level needs to be addressed through appropriate interventions, possibly including hemodialysis.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's elevated glucose levels should be managed to prevent DKA.

   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname 10403**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5651**] and the ICU team,
   whose notes reflect my input.  Since admission, CVVHD begun without
   incident.  Continues to require norepinephrine at 0.03.  Seen by
   cardiology.  On exam, he now has 2/10 chest pain.  He is alert and
   interactive.  Abdomen is soft and nontender, though he has some
   discomfort.  Amputations.  EKG, labs, meds, and imaging reviewed.
   Assessment and Plan
   53-year-old man with probable acute coronary syndrome, congestive heart
   failure, ESRD on HD, and [**Last Name (STitle) 1054**].  We will continue to discuss his case
   with cardiology, continue heparin, continue ASA, continue statin, and
   check echo.  For [**Last Name (LF) 1054**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue levophed; hopefully decrease in
   volume and improvement in electrolytes will augment forward flow. There
   is no evidence for infection at the present time. Will consider stress
   dose steroids if not improved later today. For end-stage renal disease,
   he is on CVVHD; potassium is improving.
   He is critically ill: 35 minutes

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and currently admitted with chest pain, heart failure, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient is critically ill and requires intensive care unit (ICU) management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chest pain: The patient's chest pain is likely due to an exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) or ACS. Medical management will be required, including hemodialysis to remove fluid, continuous heparin infusion, follow-up with cardiac imaging, cardiology recommendations, and pain control with morphine.
2. ESRD: The patient has ESRD and is currently on HD. Close monitoring of electrolytes and fluid balance is necessary.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels are improving, but ongoing monitoring and adjustment of electrolytes during HD will be required.

   HPI:  For full H&P please see MICU Green initial note. In summary, this
   is a 53 y/oM with h/o of ESRD on HD h/o MI and CABG, DM who presented
   with chest pain. Over the 10-14 days he noticed increased swelling,
   abdominal girth, DOE, fatigue, and developed orthopnea.
   .
   He has also developed chest pain that is similar to prior angina;
   initially this occured with exertion only, but more recently has been
   occurring at rest.  CP associated wtih dyspnea and diaphoresis,
   relieved by SL nitro. The morning of admission, pain occurred at rest,
   and the patient called EMS and came to the [**Hospital1 54**] ED for further
   evaluation.
   .
   In the ED, initial VS: HR 84 BP 80/p. He was hypoxic to the mid 80s on
   room air. He was given IVF for hypotension, but only about 600-700cc
   given his EF of 25%.
   .
   His troponin was elevated to 0.72 above his baseline of 0.4, and ECG
   showed widened QRS and PR prolongation felt to be c/w hyperkalemia. He
   also had slight worsening of ST depressions laterally. He was given
   calcium, insulin, and glucose, and admitted to the MICU for CVVH.
   .
   In the MICU, the patient was started on CVVH for CHF. TTE showed severe
   biventricular global hypokinesis.  The patient was on levophed during
   MICU stay, which was just titrated off on transfer to CCU.   Cardiology
   was consulted on admission to MICU. They initially recommended treating
   for possible ACS given chest pain. He was treated with ASA, plavix,
   heparin gtt, atorvastatin, morphine, metoprolol 12.5po [**Hospital1 **]. Over the
   course of the day trops returned 0.77, with flat CK and MB. Heparin gtt
   was stopped.
   .
   Currently, the patient continues to have low grade substernal chest
   pain. He mentions that he feels short of breath, though he appears to
   be resting comfortably. No other pain or discomfort.

   Imaging: ECHO [**8-25**]:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is
   severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15 %). Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
   consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. The
   right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free
   wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild
   (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a
   restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. There
   is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Severe biventricular global hypokinesis. Biventricular
   cavity dilation. Severe diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling
   pressures. Moderate mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-3-4**], left
   ventricular function has declined. Severe diastolic dysfunction with
   elevated cardiac filling pressures is now apparent. Estimated pulmonary
   artery pressures are higher. The severity of mitral regurgitation is
   slightly decreased.
   .
   EKG:  NSR. Peaked T waves on initial presentation. ST depressions in
   V4-V6. No TWI.
   .
   CXR:  Pulmonary congestion with bilateral pleural effusions.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On  [**8-26**]/9 I saw, examined and was physically present with the resident
   / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with
   the above note of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4403**], dated 9/29/9 and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] of [**8-26**]/9
   I would add the following remarks:
   Total time spent on patient care: 35 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Critically ill due to acute on chronic systolic and diastolic CHF,
   renal failure, unstable angina, cardiogenic shock.
   Date/time of service 9/30/9 at 10am.

   on:[**2139-8-26**] 10:37 ------
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI), diabetes mellitus (DM), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with bilateral below-knee amputations. He presented with chest pain and symptoms consistent with acute on chronic systolic heart failure. The patient has severe biventricular global hypokinesis, biventricular cavity dilation, severe diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures, moderate mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. His renal function is impaired, and he is currently on hemodialysis (HD). Other comorbidities include impaired skin integrity, hypotension, hyperkalemia, diabetes, and a history of stroke.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of CAD, MI, and severe biventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15% puts him at high risk for cardiogenic shock. His current presentation with hypotension and chest pain suggests ongoing ischemia or worsening heart failure.
2. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation: The patient's symptoms and echocardiogram findings indicate an exacerbation of his chronic systolic heart failure. This could be due to various factors such as infection, arrhythmia,"

   Imaging: ECHO [**8-25**]:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is
   severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15 %). Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
   consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. The
   right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free
   wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild
   (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a
   restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. There
   is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Severe biventricular global hypokinesis. Biventricular
   cavity dilation. Severe diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling
   pressures. Moderate mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. Moderate
   pulmonary hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-3-4**], left
   ventricular function has declined. Severe diastolic dysfunction with
   elevated cardiac filling pressures is now apparent. Estimated pulmonary
   artery pressures are higher. The severity of mitral regurgitation is
   slightly decreased.

   EKG:  NSR. Peaked T waves on initial presentation. ST depressions in
   V4-V6. No TWI.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post below-knee amputations, and chronic systolic heart failure. He presents with chest pain, increased swelling, abdominal girth, dyspnea on exertion (DOE), fatigue, and orthopnea. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, and he has signs of hyperkalemia on the ECG. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for potential acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's history of CAD with CABG and PCI, along with symptoms of unstable angina, raises concern for ACS. Further evaluation and management are needed to rule out or treat this condition.
2. Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's known global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15% and the presence of moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation suggest worsening of his chronic systolic heart failure. The precipitant of the acute exacerbation is unclear, but it is not due to an ischemic et"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), post myocardial infarction (MI), chronic moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-the-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and chest pain. The patient is currently experiencing acute on chronic systolic heart failure, hypotension, hyperkalemia, diabetes management, ESRD on HD, history of stroke, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), back pain, gout, and fluid electrolyte management.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Chest pain/CAD: The patient's known CAD with past CABG and PCI increases the risk of unstable angina or another MI. Monitoring cardiac enzymes and EKG changes is essential to detect any potential cardiac events.

2. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient's known global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15% puts him at risk for exacerbations of systolic heart failure. Further investigation is needed to determine the precipitant of the acute exacerbation. Treatment options include ultrafiltration via continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVV"

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He presents with chest pain and is experiencing acute on chronic systolic heart failure. The patient also has diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD), and a history of stroke. He is currently on chronic prednisone due to renal transplants in the past.

24-hour events:
- The patient was initially weaned off pressors (levophed) but required restarting due to hypotension after administration of morphine for chest pain.
- There has been a balance between providing chest pain relief with morphine and maintaining appropriate blood pressure with pressors.
- The patient continues to complain of chest pressure relieved by morphine and labored breathing.
- His blood pressure is currently stable, with a reading of 120/69 mmHg.
- His heart rate is within normal limits at 88 bpm.
- Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula, and his oxygen saturation is 91%.
- The patient's renal function is being managed with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
- His potassium levels have improved from 7.4 on admission to 4.5 currently.
- Other laboratory values show some"

   # Chest Pain/CAD: Patient has known CAD with CABG and PCI in past.
   History sounds like unstable angina, however cardiac enzymes have been
   flat (x3), without EKG changes. Initially treated with ASA, plavix,
   heparin gtt. The heparin gtt has been stopped given low suspicion for
   ACS.  Consider cath given continued chest pain.
   -continue ASA, statin

   possible) for CP as BP tolerates

   with EF 15%. Unclear what the precipitant of acute exacerbation was.
   Not believed to be ischemic etiology.
   - ultrafiltration via CVVH

   refute cardiogenic shock.  Was initially weaned off of Levophed, but
   then restarted as BP decreased (in setting of having received morphine
   for CP). Patient is on chronic prednisone given renal transplants in

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and post-infarction cardiomyopathy. The patient also has moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a history of stroke.

The patient presents with chest pain, which is relieved by morphine. The cardiac enzymes are flat, indicating that the chest pain may not be due to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, the patient's chest pain continues, and there are concerns about unstable angina or potential ongoing ischemia.

The patient also has acute on chronic systolic heart failure, with a known ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%. The precipitant of the acute exacerbation is unclear, and it is not believed to be an ischemic etiology. The management plan includes ultrafiltration via continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) and holding lisinopril due to hypotension.

The patient's hypotension is a concern, with a central venous oxygen saturation (CVO2) of 60%. This does not confirm or refute cardiogenic shock. The patient was initially weaned off levophed, but"

   24 Hour Events:
   Patient initially weaned off of pressors (levophed) and blood pressure
   was able to tolerate for a while, but then following administration of
   morphine (for chest pain), blood pressure decreased and pressor was
   restarted. Throughout the rest of the night, a balance between chest
   pain relief with morphine and giving pressors to keep the blood
   pressure appropriate, was worked upon.
   Patient continues to complain of chest pressure, relieved by morphine.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with chest pain, which is relieved by morphine, and labored breathing complaints. The patient also has a background of post-infarction cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%, moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a history of stroke. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37Â°C (98.6Â°F), heart rate of 88 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 120/69 mmHg to 81/14 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's physical examination reveals a systolic ejection murmur and limited extremity examination due to amputations. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 9.3 x 10^9/L, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 40.8%, decreased platelet count (Plt) at 326 x 10^9/L, increased creatinine (Cr) at 5"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient initially weaned off of pressors (levophed) and blood pressure
   was able to tolerate for a while, but then following administration of
   morphine (for chest pain), blood pressure decreased and pressor was
   restarted. Throughout the rest of the night, a balance between chest
   pain relief with morphine and giving pressors to keep the blood
   pressure appropriate, was worked upon.

   53 yo gentleman with CAD s/p CABG, post infarction cardiomyopathy (EF
   20-25%), moderate to severe MR, DM1, PVD s/p B LE amputations, ESRD s/p
   renal Xplant x 2 now on HD with chest pain, and acute on chronic
   systolic heart failure.
   .
   # Chest Pain/CAD: Patient has known CAD with CABG and PCI in past.
   History sounds like unstable angina, however cardiac enzymes have been
   flat (x3), without EKG changes. Initially treated with ASA, plavix,
   heparin gtt. This has been stopped given low suspicion for ACS.
   Consider cath given continued chest pain.
   -continue ASA, statin
   -Continue plavix
   -Continue nitro and morphine 0.5 for CP as BP tolerates
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has known global hypokinesis
   with EF 15%. Unclear what the precipitant of acute exacerbation was.
   Not believed to be ischemic etiology.
   - ultrafiltration via CVVH
   - holding lisinopril for now given hypotension; if BP tolerates, can
   try to add back captopril in morning for afterload reduction
   - Wean Levophed
   .
   # Hypotension:  central venous 02 sat of 60% does not help confirm or
   refute cardiogenic shock.  Was initially weaned off of Levophed, but
   then restarted as BP decreased (in setting of having received morphine
   for CP). Patient is on chronic prednisone given renal transplants in
   the past, and is more susceptible to infection (although afebrile and
   without leukocytosis). This could potentially be the cause of CHF
   exacerbation and hypotension.
   -follow-up blood cultures, UA, urine culture
   -Wean Levophed as tolerated
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 7.4 on admission. Currently 4.5
   - CVVH against K bath of 2 to bring K down
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Diabetes: continue glargine, SSI, qid fingersticks. Diabetic diet.
   .
   # ESRD on HD:
   - CVVH in ICU for now; appreciate renal recs
   - Consider d/c Prednisone
   .
   # h/o Stroke: On coumadin as an outpatient. INR was initially
   subtherapeutic, and patient was on heparin gtt. INR currently 2.2.
   -Heparin gtt stopped.
   -Hold Coumadin
   .
   # Recurrent UTIs
   - no current symptoms or signs
   - obtain UA, Urine culture given hypotension
   .
   # h/o UGIB: No recent bleeding; will carefully monitor HCT given ASA,
   recent heparin, and plavix.
   - continue PPI.
   -active T&S

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Chest pain/CAD: The patient has known coronary artery disease with previous CABG surgery. The current chest pain history sounds like unstable angina, but cardiac enzymes have been flat (x3), without EKG changes. This suggests a low suspicion for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) initially. However, continued chest pain may indicate ongoing ischemia or a possible need for further intervention such as catheterization.

2. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has a history of global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 15%. The precipitant of the acute exacerbation is unclear, but it does not seem to be an ischemic etiology. The management plan includes ultrafiltration via CVVH, holding lisinopril temporarily, and weaning off Levophed.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently low, and there are concerns about cardiogenic shock. The central venous O2 saturation of 60% does not confirm or refute cardiogenic shock. The patient's chronic use of prednisone due to renal transplants makes them more susceptible to infection, which could potentially be the cause of CHF exacerbation and hypotension.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level was initially elevated at 7.4 but has been brought down to 4.5. CVVH against a"

   renal Xplant x 2 now on HD with chest pain, and acute on chronic
   systolic heart failure.
   .
   # Chest Pain/CAD: Patient has known CAD with CABG and PCI in past.
   History sounds like unstable angina, however cardiac enzymes have been
   flat (x3), without EKG changes. Initially treated with ASA, plavix,
   heparin gtt. The heparin gtt has been stopped given low suspicion for
   ACS.
   - cath (right and left) today given continued chest pain
   -continue ASA, statin, plavix
   -Continue nitro and morphine 0.5mgPRN (trying lower morphine dose if
   possible so as to decrease hypotensive episodes) for CP as BP tolerates
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has known global hypokinesis
   with EF 15%. Unclear what the precipitant of acute exacerbation was.
   Not believed to be ischemic etiology.  Weaned off levophed O/N.
   - ultrafiltration via CVVH, will continue for 24 hrs per renal recs
   - holding lisinopril for now given hypotension; if BP tolerates, can
   try to add back captopril for afterload reduction
   .
   # Hypotension:  central venous 02 sat of 60% does not help confirm or
   refute cardiogenic shockPatient is on chronic prednisone given renal
   transplants in the past, and is more susceptible to infection (although
   afebrile and without leukocytosis). This could potentially be the cause
   of CHF exacerbation and hypotension.
   -follow-up blood cultures, UA, urine culture
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 7.4 on admission. Currently 4.5. Unclear etiology
   (per patient and wife, has been going to dialysis three times a week
   regularly).
   - CVVH against K bath of 2 to bring K down
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Diabetes: continue glargine, SSI, qid fingersticks. Diabetic diet.
   .
   # ESRD on HD:
   - CVVH in ICU for now x one more day; appreciate renal recs
   - Will d/c calcium acetate given hypophos
   - Consider d/c Prednisone (why on this medicine? Transplant-related?)
   .
   # h/o Stroke (suspected cardioembolic): On coumadin as an outpatient.
   INR was initially subtherapeutic, and patient was on heparin gtt. INR
   currently 2.2. Heparin gtt stopped.
   -Hold Coumadin, as patient going to cath today
   .
   # Recurrent UTIs: does not appear infected clinically.  Most likely he
   is chronically colonized.  Will hold on abx tx for now, consider
   starting if pt symptomatic.
   .
   # h/o UGIB: No recent bleeding; will carefully monitor HCT given ASA,
   recent heparin, and plavix.
   -continue PPI.
   -active T&S
   .
   # Back Pain: slight soreness reported; heating pad prn
   .
   # Gout: allopurinol 100mg PO daily

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and post-infarction cardiomyopathy. He also has moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and chest pain. The patient is currently experiencing acute on chronic systolic heart failure and has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20-25%.

The patient presented with intermittent chest pain overnight, which is concerning for unstable angina. However, cardiac enzymes have been flat, and there have been no EKG changes. He is being treated with aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel (plavix), heparin gtt (which has been stopped), and nitroglycerin (nitro) for chest pain. Morphine sulfate is also being given at a low dose for pain relief.

The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is hypotensive. This may be due to acute on chronic systolic heart failure, but other causes such as infection or medication side effects should be considered. His central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) is 60%, which does not confirm or refute cardiogenic shock. The patient is on chronic prednisone due to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and post-infarction cardiomyopathy. He also has moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1, peripheral vascular disease with below-knee amputations, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient presented with chest pain, which was initially suspected to be unstable angina but cardiac enzymes have remained flat without any EKG changes. He is currently being treated for acute on chronic systolic heart failure, hypotension, hyperkalemia, diabetes, ESRD on HD, a history of stroke, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), back pain, and gout. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 93/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. Fluid balance shows an intake of 7,202 mL and output of 8,303 mL since midnight. The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 7.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.2 g/dL, hematocrit of 39.4%, platelet count of 215 K/uL, creatinine of 3.7 mg/dL, glucose of 98 mg/dL, potassium of 4.5 mEq/L, sodium of 137 mEq/L, chloride of 98 mEq/L, and magnesium of 1.9 mg/dL. The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, and renal recommendations are pending. The patient's medication regimen includes calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, morphine sulfate, statin, aspirin, clopidogrel, nitroglycerin, and prednisone. The patient is currently undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and is expected to undergo cardiac catheterization soon."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and post-infarction cardiomyopathy. He also has moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and chest pain. The patient presents with acute on chronic systolic heart failure, hypotension, hyperkalemia, diabetes management, ESRD on HD, history of stroke, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), back pain, gout, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chest Pain/CAD: The patient's known CAD with a history of CABG and post-infarction cardiomyopathy may lead to unstable angina or myocardial infarction.
2. Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient's global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15% increases the risk of acute exacerbations of systolic heart failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to cardiogenic shock or infection, potentially exacerbated by chronic prednisone use for renal transplants.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels require close monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and has post-infarction cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. He also has moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and chronic chest pain.

The patient presented with intermittent chest pain overnight. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/62 mmHg to 122/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with a sense of humor.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including chest pain related to CAD, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, hypotension, hyperkalemia, diabetes mellitus, ESRD on HD, h/o stroke (suspected cardioembolic), recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), h/o upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), back pain, and gout.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and post-infarction cardiomyopathy. He also has moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a history of stroke.

The patient is currently experiencing intermittent chest pain, shortness of breath, and has a past medical history of unstable angina. His cardiac enzymes are flat, without EKG changes, and he has undergone catheterization (right and left) due to continued chest pain. He is being treated with aspirin (ASA), statin, and clopidogrel (plavix).

The patient also has acute on chronic systolic heart failure, global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%. The cause of the exacerbation is unclear, but it is not believed to be ischemic in origin.

   53 yo gentleman with CAD s/p CABG, post infarction cardiomyopathy (EF
   20-25%), moderate to severe MR, DM1, PVD s/p B LE amputations, ESRD s/p
   renal Xplant x 2 now on HD with chest pain, and acute on chronic
   systolic heart failure. S/p cardiac left and right catheterization
   yesterday.
   .
   # Chest Pain/CAD: Patient has known CAD with CABG and PCI in past.
   History sounds like unstable angina, however cardiac enzymes have been
   flat (x3), without EKG changes. Initially treated with ASA, plavix,
   heparin gtt. The heparin gtt has been stopped given low suspicion for
   ACS.
   - s/p cath yesterday ([**8-27**])
   -continue ASA, statin, plavix
   -Continue nitro and morphine 0.5mgPRN (trying lower morphine dose if
   possible so as to decrease hypotensive episodes) for CP as BP tolerates
   .
   # Decreased O2 sats:
   - consider PE versus CHF versus pneumonia?
   - check ABG (attempted this AM)
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has known global hypokinesis
   with EF 15%. Unclear what the precipitant of acute exacerbation was.
   Not believed to be ischemic etiology.
   - ultrafiltration via CVVH, put on hold s/p cath
   - no dialysis today, per renal, d/t lower BP
   - holding lisinopril for now given hypotension; if BP tolerates, can
   try to add back captopril for afterload reduction
   .
   # Hypotension: Concern for cardiac cause given low EF d/t
   cardiomyopathy.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures in case sepsis as component of
   hypotension (although afebrile and without leukocytosis)
   - was previously on levophed and then dopamine, but no longer on
   pressors
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 7.4 on admission. Currently 4.1. Unclear etiology
   (per patient and wife, has been going to dialysis three times a week
   regularly). Resolved.
   - f/u renal recs
   - per renal no dialysis today, so monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Diabetes: continue glargine, SSI, qid fingersticks. Diabetic diet.
   .
   # ESRD on HD:
   - appreciate renal recs
   - Calcium acetate d/c
d given hypophos
   .
   # h/o Stroke (suspected cardioembolic): On coumadin as an outpatient.
   INR was initially subtherapeutic, and patient was on heparin gtt. INR
   currently 1.3. Heparin gtt stopped.
   - restart coumadin?
   .
   # Recurrent UTIs: does not appear infected clinically.  Most likely he
   is chronically colonized.  Will hold on abx tx for now, consider
   starting if pt symptomatic.

   # h/o UGIB: No recent bleeding; will carefully monitor HCT given ASA,
   recent heparin, and plavix.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in the past. The patient also has post-infarction cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and a history of stroke.

The patient presented with chest pain, and cardiac enzymes have been flat on three occasions without EKG changes. Initially, the patient was treated with aspirin, Plavix, and heparin, but the heparin gtt has been stopped due to low suspicion for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient continues to receive aspirin, statin, and Plavix.

The patient's oxygen saturation levels have been decreased, and there is concern for pulmonary embolism (PE), congestive heart failure (CHF), or pneumonia. An arterial blood gas (ABG) test has been attempted but not yet performed.

The patient's condition is also complicated by acute-on-chronic systolic CHF. The cause of the exacerbation is unclear, and it is not believed to be ischemic in origin. The patient's low EF due to cardiomyopathy may contribute to hyp"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and has post-infarction cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%. He also has moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and chest pain. The patient was admitted with acute on chronic systolic heart failure and underwent cardiac catheterization yesterday.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Chest pain/CAD: The patient has known CAD with previous CABG and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). His symptoms sound like unstable angina, but cardiac enzymes have been flat (x3), without EKG changes. He is being treated with aspirin (ASA), statin, and clopidogrel (plavix).
2. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient has known global hypokinesis with an EF of 15%. The precipitant of the acute exacerbation is unclear, and it is not believed to be an ischemic etiology. He was weaned off levophed overnight and will continue ultrafiltration via continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for 24 hours as recommended by renal consultants. Lisinopril is being held due to hypotension, but captopril may be added back for afterload reduction if the patient's blood pressure tolerates it.
3. Hypotension: The patient's central venous oxygen saturation (CVO2) is 60%, which does not confirm or refute cardiogenic shock. He is more susceptible to infection due to chronic prednisone use for renal transplants. Blood cultures, urinalysis (UA), and urine culture should be followed up.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level was 7.4 on admission and is currently 4.5. The etiology is unclear, as the patient regularly undergoes dialysis three times a week. CVVH against a potassium bath of 2 is being used to bring down the potassium level, and follow-up with renal recommendations is advised.
5. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes management includes continuing glargine, sliding scale insulin (SSI), and performing fingersticks every four hours. A diabetic diet should be followed.
6. ESRD on HD: CVVH in the ICU will continue for one more day, and renal recommendations should be appreciated. Calcium acetate should be discontinued due to hypophosphatemia. Considering discontinuing prednisone, which is currently being used for transplant-related reasons.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the past. He also has post-infarction cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20-25%, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and chronic systolic heart failure.

The patient presented with chest pain, which was initially suspected to be unstable angina. However, cardiac enzymes have remained flat, without EKG changes. He has been treated with aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel (plavix), heparin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for chest pain as tolerated.

The patient has decreased oxygen saturation levels, believed to be due to fluid overload from congestive heart failure (CHF). Diuretics are planned to address this issue. The patient also has acute-on-chronic systolic CHF, with an ejection fraction of 15%. He is currently undergoing ultrafiltration via continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) and will resume once the renal team approves. Lisinopril is being held due to hypotension, but may be reintroduced for afterload reduction if blood pressure improves."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the past. He also has post-infarction cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20-25%, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and chronic systolic heart failure. The patient recently underwent cardiac catheterization.

24-hour events include right and left heart catheterization, finding of patent grafts (LIMA-LAD, SVG-diagonal, SVG-PDA) and diffuse disease in native vessels. The patient had low cardiac index and required dopamine, but later came off pressors. A tight lesion in the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was noted, resulting in tachycardia in the 130s, atrial fibrillation, and subsequent administration of metoprolol, which restored sinus rhythm. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) was in the 80s on room air, and he continued to have labored breathing with slight improvement. He complained of mild burning in the chest but no chest pain. The patient had groin soreness on the left side and constipation without abdominal pain"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who has undergone coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and post-infarction cardiomyopathy. He also has diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a suspected cardioembolic stroke. The patient presented with chest pain, which was initially treated as unstable angina but later found to be non-cardiac in origin. He is currently on multiple medications including aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel (plavix), heparin, statin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for chest pain relief. The patient's oxygen saturation has been fluctuating due to fluid overload from congestive heart failure (CHF). He has undergone continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) with fluid removal. His renal function has been monitored, and he is receiving appropriate renal care. The patient's potassium levels have improved from 7.4 to 4.1, indicating resolved hyperkalemia. He is also being managed for diabetes, ESRD on HD, a previous stroke, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), gout, and groin/back pain. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving cardiac, diabetic, and renal diet"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post-infarction cardiomyopathy, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presents with dyspnea/orthopnea overnight, transient hypoxia, and was placed on supplemental oxygen. CVVH was performed with approximately 1 liter fluid removed. The patient complains of abdominal pain and constipation for several days. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Chest Pain/CAD: The patient has known CAD with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The current chest pain history sounds like unstable angina, but cardiac enzymes have been flat (x3), without EKG changes. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization yesterday with stenting of the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery graft. Continue ASA, statin, and clopidogrel.
2. Decreased O2 sats: Believed to be due to fluid overload from congestive heart failure (CHF). Diuretics will be initiated, and follow-up with renal plans for CVVH.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: The"

   ACS.   s/p cardiac cath [**8-27**] with stent to LIMA-LAD graft.
   - Continue ASA, statin, plavix
   - Continue nitro and morphine 0.5mg PRN (trying lower morphine dose if
   possible so as to decrease hypotensive episodes) for CP as BP tolerates
   .
   # Decreased O2 sats:  Believed to be due to fluid overload from CHF;
   perhaps worse last night as given fluid at cath and then without CVVHD

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He also has post-infarction cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and chest pain.

The patient presented with chest pain, which was initially treated as unstable angina. However, cardiac enzymes were flat (x3), without EKG changes. The heparin gtt was stopped due to low suspicion for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization with stent placement in the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery (LIMA-LAD) graft.

The patient's oxygen saturation levels were decreased, believed to be due to fluid overload from congestive heart failure (CHF). Diuretics were initiated to manage this condition.

The patient also experienced acute exacerbation of chronic systolic CHF, with global hypokinesis and EF of 15%. The cause of the exacerbation is unclear. Ultrafiltration via continuous venovenous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) was initially held after cardiac"

   Attending Progress Note
   I have reviewed the daily progress note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] today and I concur
   with the history, physical examination, assessment and treatment plan.
   I was present during the entire physical examination by the CCU team.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10403**] is a 53 year old man with complicated diabetes mellitus
   resulting in advanced peripheral vascular disease and LE and digit
   amputations, end stage kidney disease requiring dialysis and dialysis,
   and coronary artery disease (s/p CABG and recent stenting of the
   LIMA-LAD native vessel disease.  He has a known cardiomyopathy (LVEF =
   20%).   He has not had additional chest pain since his stent procedure.
   An additional 1.5-2.0 L fluid will be removed over the next 24 hours.
   Captopril 6.25 mg and metopolol have been added and tolerated
   hemodynamically.
   We are currently proceeding with continue diuresis and he has tolerated
   afterload reduction with captopril along with his antiplatelet agents.
   We will also focus on rehabilitation once the CVVH has been completed
   and hemodialysis has been re-initiated.
   The treatment plan discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a complex medical history including coronary artery disease (s/p CABG), post-infarction cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%), moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, diabetes mellitus type 1, peripheral vascular disease (s/p below-knee amputations), end-stage renal disease (s/p renal transplant x 2, currently on hemodialysis), and a history of stroke (suspected cardioembolic). 

The patient presented with chest pain, which was initially treated as unstable angina, but cardiac enzymes have been flat (x3), and there were no EKG changes. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and received a stent to the left internal mammary artery-left anterior descending artery graft, and is now chest pain-free. 

The patient also has decreased oxygen saturation levels, believed to be due to fluid overload from chronic heart failure. Fluid removal via continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) has been initiated and is ongoing. 

The patient has acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure with a known ejection fraction of 15%. The precipitant of the exacerbation is unclear, but it is not believed to be an ischemic etiology. 

The patient is hypotensive, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) around 50, and has been intermittently on vasopressors.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo gentleman with CAD s/p CABG, post infarction cardiomyopathy (EF
   20-25%), moderate to severe MR, DM1, PVD s/p B LE amputations, ESRD s/p
   renal Xplant x 2 now on HD with chest pain, and acute on chronic
   systolic heart failure. S/p cardiac left and right catheterization
   yesterday.
   .
   # Chest Pain/CAD: Patient has known CAD with CABG and PCI in past.
   History sounds like unstable angina, however cardiac enzymes have been
   flat (x3), without EKG changes. Initially treated with ASA, plavix,
   heparin gtt. The heparin gtt has been stopped given low suspicion for
   ACS.   s/p cardiac cath [**8-27**] with stent to LIMA-LAD graft now chest
   pain free.
   - Continue ASA, statin, plavix
   - Initiate low dose Captopril and titrate up as tolerated
   - Continue nitro and morphine 0.5mg PRN (trying lower morphine dose if
   possible so as to decrease hypotensive episodes) for CP as BP tolerates
   .
   # Decreased O2 sats:  Believed to be due to fluid overload from CHF;
   perhaps worse last night as given fluid at cath and then without CVVHD
   over the last two days, currently mid-high 90
s on RA.  CVVDH yesterday
   with 1L removed, currently receiving CVVHD with 1L fluid to be removed
   today.
   - Diuresis; f/u with renal re: plans
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has known global hypokinesis
   with EF 15%. Unclear what the precipitant of acute exacerbation was.
   Not believed to be ischemic etiology.
   - Ultrafiltration via CVVH initially on hold s/p cath, ~1L removed
   yesterday; f/u with renal plans for CVVH
   - Initiating Captopril today for afterload reduction; holding
   lisinopril for now
   .
   # Hypotension: Concern for cardiac cause given low EF d/t
   cardiomyopathy.  Tolerating MAP ~50.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures in case sepsis as component of
   hypotension (although afebrile and without leukocytosis, cultures
   negative to date)
   - Previously on levophed and then dopamine, intermittently on pressors,
   now off pressors for several days
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 7.4 on admission. Currently 4.1. Unclear etiology
   (per patient and wife, has been going to dialysis three times a week
   regularly). Resolved.
   .
   # Diabetes: Continue glargine, SSI, qid fingersticks. Diabetic diet.
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  CVVH yesterday with ~1L fluid removal.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Calcium acetate d/c
d given hypophos
   .
   # h/o Stroke (suspected cardioembolic): On coumadin as an outpatient.
   INR was initially subtherapeutic, and patient was on heparin gtt. INR
   currently 1.3. Given patient in & out of afib on [**8-27**]; have goal INR
   [**12-30**], restart patient on home Coumadin dose and start heparin drip until
   INR therapeutic.
   - Continue Coumadin at 5mg po daily
   - Continue heparin gtt until INR therapeutic
   .
   # Recurrent UTIs: Does not appear infected clinically.  Most likely he
   is chronically colonized.  Will hold on abx tx for now, consider

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo gentleman with CAD s/p CABG, post infarction cardiomyopathy (EF
   20-25%), moderate to severe MR, DM1, PVD s/p B LE amputations, ESRD s/p
   renal Xplant x 2 now on HD with chest pain, and acute on chronic
   systolic heart failure. S/p cardiac left and right catheterization
   yesterday.
   .
   # Chest Pain/CAD: Patient has known CAD with CABG and PCI in past.
   History sounds like unstable angina, however cardiac enzymes have been
   flat (x3), without EKG changes. Initially treated with ASA, plavix,
   heparin gtt. The heparin gtt has been stopped given low suspicion for
   ACS.   s/p cardiac cath [**8-27**] with stent to LIMA-LAD graft now chest
   pain free, has not needed nitro or low dose (0.5mg) morphine for chest
   pain.
   - Continue ASA, statin, plavix
   - Initiate Captopril 6.25mg daily and titrate up as tolerated; keep at
   current dose today as BP optimal currently
   .
   # Decreased O2 sats:  Believed to be due to fluid overload from CHF;
   perhaps worse last night as given fluid at cath and then without CVVHD
   over the last two days, currently mid-high 90
s on RA.  CVVDH yesterday
   with 1L removed, currently receiving CVVHD with 1.5L fluid removed so
   far today.
   - Diuresis via CVVH
   - f/u with renal re: plans, particularly re: timeline to initiate HD
   (perhaps Mon?)
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has known global hypokinesis
   with EF 15%. Unclear what the precipitant of acute exacerbation was.
   Not believed to be ischemic etiology.
   - Ultrafiltration via CVVH; f/u with renal plans for CVVH
   - Continue Captopril at current dose for afterload reduction
   - Continue holding lisinopril for now
   .
   # Hypotension: Concern for cardiac cause given low EF d/t
   cardiomyopathy.  Tolerating MAP ~50.  Briefly on levophed and then
   dopamine, intermittently on pressors, now off pressors for several
   days.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures in case sepsis as component of
   hypotension (although afebrile and without leukocytosis, cultures
   negative to date)
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 7.4 on admission, now resolved.. Unclear etiology
   (per patient and wife, has been going to dialysis three times a week
   regularly).
   .
   # Diabetes: Continue glargine, SSI, qid fingersticks. Diabetic diet.
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  CVVH today with continued fluid removal, currently 1.5L
   this morning.  Calcium acetate d/c
d given hypophos.
   - Appreciate renal recs, particularly regarding re-initiation of HD
   .
   # h/o Stroke (suspected cardioembolic): On coumadin as an outpatient.
   INR was initially subtherapeutic, and patient was on heparin gtt. INR
   currently sub-therapeutic. Given patient in & out of afib on [**8-27**]; have
   goal INR [**12-30**], pt restarted on home dose with Heparin bridge until INR
   therapeutic.
   - Continue Coumadin at 5mg po daily
   - Continue heparin gtt until INR therapeutic
   .
   # Recurrent UTIs: Does not appear infected clinically.  Most likely he
   is chronically colonized.  Will hold on abx tx for now, consider
   starting if pt symptomatic.
   .
   # h/o UGIB: No recent bleeding; will carefully monitor HCT given ASA,
   recent heparin, and plavix.
   -continue PPI
   -active T&S (in for [**8-30**])

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He also has post-infarction cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20-25%, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and chest pain.

The patient presented with chest pain, which was initially treated as unstable angina. However, cardiac enzymes were flat, and there were no EKG changes. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and received a stent to the left internal mammary artery-left anterior descending (LIMA-LAD) graft. He is now chest pain-free.

The patient has decreased oxygen saturation (O2 sat) due to fluid overload from congestive heart failure (CHF). Fluid removal through continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) is ongoing.

The patient has acute-on-chronic systolic CHF, possibly precipitated by an unknown factor other than ischemic etiology. Ultrafiltration via CVVH and continued use of captopril for afterload reduction are planned.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension, which is being managed with dopamine and other pressors intermittently. Blood and urine cultures have"

   The HPI includes that findings that Mr. [**Known lastname 10403**] is a 53 year old man
   with complicated diabetes mellitus resulting in advanced peripheral
   vascular disease and LE and digit amputations, end stage kidney disease
   requiring dialysis and dialysis, and coronary artery disease (s/p CABG
   and recent stenting of the LIMA-LAD native vessel disease.  He has a
   known cardiomyopathy (LVEF = 20%).   He has not had additional chest
   pain since his stent procedure.
   There are no changes in the family history or social history.
   An additional 1.5-2.0 L fluid was removed over the past 24 hours.
   Captopril 6.25 mg and metopolol have been added and tolerated
   hemodynamically.
   We are currently proceeding with continue diuresis and he has tolerated
   afterload reduction with captopril along with his antiplatelet agents.

- The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, lower extremity amputations, end-stage kidney disease, and cardiomyopathy.
- He presented with chest pain and was initially treated with aspirin, Plavix, and heparin. Following cardiac catheterization, a stent was placed in the left internal mammary artery-LAD graft, and the patient is now chest pain-free.
- The patient has known moderate to severe mitral regurgitation and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20-25%.
- He has been experiencing acute on chronic systolic heart failure, with global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 15%. The cause of the exacerbation is unclear, but it is not believed to be ischemic in origin.
- The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, but there is currently no recent bleeding. His hematocrit (Hct) is 32, down from 34-35, and he will be monitored for any signs of bleeding.
- He is on hemodialysis (HD) due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). CVVH was performed today, with continued fluid removal.
- The patient has been hypotensive, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of approximately 50"

   # Low Grade Fever:  Tmax 100.1 overnight, no leukocytosis, no clear
   source or evidence of infection.
   - Pull R IJ to eliminate source of infection
   - Blood culture from IJ and HD line
   - CXR
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has known global hypokinesis
   with EF 15%. Unclear what the precipitant of acute exacerbation was.
   Not believed to be ischemic etiology.  Completed CVVH yesterday, did
   not receive HD today as SBP 70
s overnight, will f/u with Renal re:
   re-initiating HD, possibly today.
   - Hold Metoprolol, Captopril
   - f/u with renal again for re-initiation of HD once BP increases; SBP
   during outpt dialysis 90
   .
   # Chest Pain/CAD: Patient has known CAD with CABG and PCI in past.
   History sounds like unstable angina, however cardiac enzymes have been
   flat (x3), without EKG changes. Initially treated with ASA, plavix,
   heparin gtt, s/p cardiac cath [**8-27**] with stent to LIMA-LAD graft now
   chest pain free, has not needed nitro or low dose (0.5mg) morphine for
   chest pain.
   - Continue ASA, statin, plavix
   - Hold Captopril 6.25mg today for HD
   .
   # Decreased O2 sats:  Transiently, believed to be due to fluid overload
   from CHF; now resolved with CVVHD.  Brief episode yesterday while
   transferring to bed with significant exertion, will need PT/rehab
   in-house and following discharge.
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  Calcium acetate d/c
d given hypophos.  CVVH discontinued
   yesterday with 2L removed, net even (-0.2cc), plan to re-initiate HD
   today per Renal.  Elevated Cr today, anticipate improvement with HD.

   # Recurrent UTIs: Does not appear infected clinically.  Most likely he
   is chronically colonized.  Will hold on abx tx for now, consider
   starting if pt symptomatic.  Low grade fever Tmax 99 overnight but UCx
   from [**8-31**] showed fecal contamination (>3 colonies) without dominant
   growth of one colony, suggesting no infection.  Will monitor for signs
   of infection.
   .
   # h/o UGIB: No recent bleeding; will carefully monitor Hct given ASA,
   recent heparin, and Plavix.  Hct 32 today, down from 34-35, stable
   since.  Low clinical suspicion for bleed.

   # h/o Stroke (suspected cardioembolic): On Coumadin as an outpatient.
   INR was initially subtherapeutic, and patient was on heparin gtt. INR
   continues to be sub-therapeutic, slowly increasing following Vit K at
   OSH. Given patient in & out of afib on [**8-27**]; have goal INR [**12-30**], pt
   restarted on home dose with Heparin bridge until INR therapeutic.
   - Continue Coumadin at 5mg po daily

   Attending Progress Note
   I have reviewed the daily progress note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] today and I concur
   with the history, physical examination, assessment and treatment
   plan.   My examination today is consistent with the documented physical
   examination.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10403**] is improving daily with his symptoms and is attempting
   transfer from his bed to a chair with assistance, but he is fatigued
   and needs to regain more strength.
   He was unable to undergo hemodialysis today due to hypotension and we
   will hold his captopril 6.25 mg and metopolol as needed to permit
   hemodialysis.
   The treatment plan discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post-infarction cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, chest pain, and acute on chronic systolic heart failure. He underwent cardiac catheterization yesterday.

The patient experienced low-grade fever overnight, but no leukocytosis or clear source of infection was identified. Blood cultures were obtained, and a chest X-ray is planned to rule out infection.

The patient's acute exacerbation of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) is unclear, but it is not believed to be due to an ischemic etiology. CVVH was completed yesterday, but HD was not performed today due to hypotension. The plan is to re-initiate HD today.

The patient has known CAD with previous CABG and PCI, and he is currently pain-free after stent placement to the LIMA-LAD graft. Medications include ASA, Plavix, and heparin gtt.

The patient had decreased O2 saturations, which resolved with CVVHD. This episode was transient and believed to be due to fluid overload from CHF. He also experienced SOB and desaturation during assisted transfer, requiring increased O2.

ESRD on HD: Calcium acetate was discontinued due to hypophosphatemia, and CVVH was discontinued yesterday"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He also has post-infarction cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and chest pain.

The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic systolic heart failure, decreased oxygen saturation (SO2) levels, ESRD on HD, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypotension, history of stroke, diabetes, hyperkalemia, groin pain, and gout.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8Â°C (100.1Â°F), heart rate (HR) of 86 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 81/39 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, and SO2 levels of 100% on nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals rales in both lung bases and bilateral below-knee amputations.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine (Cr), blood glucose, and troponin-T levels. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's plan includes continuing antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) therapy with captopril, statin therapy, and cardiac rehabilitation. He will also continue to receive hemodialysis and be monitored for any signs of infection or bleeding. His anticoagulation therapy with heparin and warfarin will be continued, and his INR will be monitored to maintain a therapeutic range.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further exacerbation of heart failure, worsening of renal function, recurrent UTIs, UGIB, hypotension, stroke, and uncontrolled diabetes."

 53 yo gentleman with CAD s/p CABG, post infarction cardiomyopathy (EF
   20-25%), moderate to severe MR, DM1, PVD s/p B LE amputations, ESRD s/p
   renal Xplant x 2 now on HD with chest pain, and acute on chronic
   systolic heart failure. S/p cardiac left and right catheterization
   yesterday.
   .
   # Low Grade Fever:  Tmax 100.1 overnight, no leukocytosis, no clear
   source or evidence of infection.
   - Pull R IJ to eliminate source of infection
   - Blood culture from IJ and HD line
   - CXR
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has known global hypokinesis
   with EF 15%. Unclear what the precipitant of acute exacerbation was.
   Not believed to be ischemic etiology.  Completed CVVH yesterday, did
   not receive HD today as SBP 70
s overnight, will f/u with Renal re:
   re-initiating HD, possibly today.
   - Hold Metoprolol, Captopril
   - f/u with renal again for re-initiation of HD once BP increases; SBP
   during outpt dialysis 90
   .
   # Chest Pain/CAD: Patient has known CAD with CABG and PCI in past.
   History sounds like unstable angina, however cardiac enzymes have been
   flat (x3), without EKG changes. Initially treated with ASA, plavix,
   heparin gtt, s/p cardiac cath [**8-27**] with stent to LIMA-LAD graft now
   chest pain free, has not needed nitro or low dose (0.5mg) morphine for
   chest pain.
   - Continue ASA, statin, plavix
   - Hold Captopril 6.25mg today for HD
   .
   # Decreased O2 sats:  Transiently, believed to be due to fluid overload
   from CHF; now resolved with CVVHD.  Brief episode yesterday while
   transferring to bed with significant exertion, will need PT/rehab
   in-house and following discharge.
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  Calcium acetate d/c
d given hypophos.  CVVH discontinued
   yesterday with 2L removed, net even (-0.2cc), plan to re-initiate HD
   today per Renal.  Elevated Cr today, anticipate improvement with HD.
   - Appreciate renal recs re: HD today with holding of anti-hypertensives
   as above
   - Hold anti-hypertensives as above
   .
   # Recurrent UTIs: Does not appear infected clinically.  Most likely he
   is chronically colonized.  Will hold on abx tx for now, consider
   starting if pt symptomatic.  Low grade fever Tmax 99 overnight but UCx
   from [**8-31**] showed fecal contamination (>3 colonies) without dominant
   growth of one colony, suggesting no infection.  Will monitor for signs
   of infection.
   .
   # h/o UGIB: No recent bleeding; will carefully monitor Hct given ASA,
   recent heparin, and Plavix.  Hct 32 today, down from 34-35, stable
   since.  Low clinical suspicion for bleed.
   -continue PPI
   -active T&S (outdates [**9-2**])
   .
   # h/o Stroke (suspected cardioembolic): On Coumadin as an outpatient.
   INR was initially subtherapeutic, and patient was on heparin gtt. INR
   continues to be sub-therapeutic, slowly increasing following Vit K at
   OSH. Given patient in & out of afib on [**8-27**]; have goal INR [**12-30**], pt
   restarted on home dose with Heparin bridge until INR therapeutic.
   - Continue Coumadin at 5mg po daily
   - Continue heparin gtt until INR therapeutic
   .
   # Hypotension: Concern for cardiac cause given low EF d/t
   cardiomyopathy.  Tolerating MAP ~50.  Briefly on levophed and then
   dopamine, briefly on pressors, now off pressors.
   .
   # Diabetes: Continue glargine, SSI, qid fingersticks. Diabetic diet.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 7.4 on admission, now resolved.. Unclear etiology
   (per patient and wife, has been going to dialysis three times a week
   regularly).
   .
   # Groin pain, back pack: On Oxycodone as needed.
   .
   # Gout: Allopurinol 100mg PO daily
   .
   # Tooth abscess:  d/c
ed Penicillin V, as presumed sufficient course.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post-infarction cardiomyopathy, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with bilateral above-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and chest pain. The patient presented with acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chest pain, decreased oxygen saturation (SO2), and low-grade fever. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient has known global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%. The cause of the acute exacerbation is unclear, and it is not believed to be an ischemic etiology. CVVH was completed yesterday, and HD was planned for today but was delayed due to a low systolic blood pressure (SBP) reading. The patient's weight has decreased from 73 kg at admission to 66.6 kg currently.
2. Decreased O2 sats: The patient experienced a transient episode of decreased O2 saturation while transferring to bed with significant exertion. This is believed to be due to fluid overload from CHF. The issue has resolved with CVVHD.
3. ESRD on HD: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he requires ongoing hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post-infarction cardiomyopathy, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and previous renal transplant. The patient presented with acute on chronic systolic heart failure, chest pain, low-grade fever, hypotension, decreased oxygen saturation, and elevated creatinine. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Low-grade fever: The patient has had a temperature spike but no clear source or evidence of infection. No treatment is necessary at this time.
2. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient has known global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%. The precipitant of acute exacerbation is unclear, but it is not believed to be an ischemic etiology. CVVH was completed yesterday, and HD was not performed due to a blood pressure of 70 mmHg overnight. Further evaluation with the renal team is needed regarding re-initiation of HD, possibly today.
3. Chest pain/CAD: The patient has known CAD with previous CABG and PCI. History sounds like unstable angina, but cardiac enzymes have been flat (x3), without EKG changes. Initially treated with aspirin, Plavix, and heparin"

   pleural effusions have decreased in amount, now small in size. Resolved
   pulmonary edema and improved bibasilar atelectasis.
   Right supraclavicular catheter in standard position. Right IJ catheter
   tip in the right brachiocephalic vein. No evident pneumothorax.
   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo gentleman with CAD s/p CABG, post infarction cardiomyopathy (EF
   20-25%), moderate to severe MR, DM1, PVD s/p B LE amputations, ESRD s/p
   renal Xplant x 2 now on HD with chest pain, and acute on chronic
   systolic heart failure. S/p cardiac left and right catheterization.
   .
   # Low Grade Fever:  Tmax 99.5 overnight (no temperature spike), no
   leukocytosis, no clear source or evidence of infection, no evident
   pneumonia on CXR.
   - Pulled R IJ yesterday
   - Blood culture from IJ and HD line, f/u
   - Urine is colonized, so could treat for UTI, but feel no treatment
   necessary for now as asymptomatic, without temp spike or leukocytosis
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has known global hypokinesis
   with EF 15%. Unclear what the precipitant of acute exacerbation was.
   Not believed to be ischemic etiology.  Completed CVVH yesterday, did
   not receive HD yesterday as SBP 70
s overnight, will f/u with Renal re:
   re-initiating HD, possibly today.
   - Hold parameters for Metoprolol, Captopril d/t lower BP
   - f/u with renal regarding re-initiation of HD today; SBP during
   outpatient dialysis noted to be in the 90
   .
   # Chest Pain/CAD: Patient has known CAD with CABG and PCI in past.
   History sounds like unstable angina, however cardiac enzymes have been
   flat (x3), without EKG changes. Initially treated with ASA, plavix,
   heparin gtt, s/p cardiac cath [**8-27**] with stent to LIMA-LAD graft now
   chest pain free; has not needed nitro or low dose (0.5mg) morphine for
   chest pain.
   - Continue ASA, statin, plavix
   .
   # Hypotension: Concern for cardiac cause given low EF d/t
   cardiomyopathy.  Tolerating MAP ~50.  Briefly on levophed and then
   dopamine; now off pressors. Overnight, SBP mostly in the 80s.
   - Hold parameters for metoprolol, captopril
   .
   # Decreased O2 sats:  Transiently, believed to be due to fluid overload
   from CHF; now resolved with CVVHD.  Brief episode two days ago, while
   transferring to bed, will need PT/rehab both as inpatient, and
   following discharge. SpO2 overnight mostly low/mid-90s.
   - Hopefully dialysis today
   - PT f/u
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  CVVH discontinued 2 days ago, hope to re-initiate HD
   today per Renal.  Elevated Cr today, anticipate improvement with HD.
   - Appreciate renal recs re: hopefully HD today
   - hold parameters for anti-hypertensives as above
   .
   # Recurrent UTIs: Does not appear infected clinically.  Most likely he
   is chronically colonized.  Will hold on abx tx for now, consider
   starting if pt symptomatic.  Low grade fever overnight but UCx from
   [**8-31**] showed fecal contamination (>3 colonies). Will monitor for signs
   of infection.
   .
   # h/o UGIB: No recent bleeding; will carefully monitor Hct given ASA,
   recent heparin, and Plavix.  Hct stable-low today. Low clinical
   suspicion for bleed.
   -continue PPI
   -T&S re-ordered this AM ([**9-2**])
   .
   # h/o Stroke (suspected cardioembolic): On Coumadin as an outpatient.
   INR was initially subtherapeutic, and patient was on heparin gtt. INR
   continues to be sub-therapeutic, slowly increasing following Vit K at
   OSH. Given patient in & out of afib on [**8-27**]; have goal INR [**12-30**], pt
   restarted on home dose with Heparin bridge until INR therapeutic (at
   minimal therapeutic level of 2.0 this morning, so will continue heparin
   until really in therapeutic range).
   - Continue Coumadin at 5mg po daily
   - Continue heparin gtt until within INR therapeutic
   .
   # Diabetes: Continue glargine, SSI, qid fingersticks. BS
s in 400s
   yesterday
   - Readjust glargine dose and SSI
   - Diabetic diet
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 7.4 on admission, now resolved. Unclear etiology (per
   patient and wife, has been going to dialysis three times a week
   regularly).
   .
   # Groin pain, back pack: On Oxycodone as needed.
   .
   # Gout: Allopurinol 100mg PO daily
   .
   # Tooth abscess:  d/c
ed Penicillin V, as presumed sufficient course.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), post-infarction cardiomyopathy, moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and chest pain.
- The patient is currently experiencing acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%.
- The patient has known CAD and has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting to the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery (LIMA-LAD) graft.
- The patient is also dealing with hypotension, decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2), chronic colonization of the urine, history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and suspected cardioembolic stroke.
- The patient is on various medications including aspirin (ASA), statin, Plavix, metoprolol, captopril, Coumadin, heparin gtt, glargine, SSI, and allopurinol.
- The patient's recent vital signs include a temperature of 99.5Â°F,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post-infarction cardiomyopathy, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, diabetes mellitus type 1, peripheral vascular disease with below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and chest pain. He presented with acute on chronic systolic heart failure, low-grade fever, chest pain, hypotension, decreased oxygen saturation, and recurrent urinary tract infections. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he tolerated hemodialysis well. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has known global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 15%. It is unclear what precipitated the acute exacerbation, but it is not believed to be an ischemic etiology.
2. Chest pain/CAD: The patient has known coronary artery disease with previous CABG and PCI. His history sounds like unstable angina, but cardiac enzymes have been flat (x3), without EKG changes.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low ejection fraction due to cardiomyopathy raises concern for a cardiac cause of hypotension. He is currently tolerating mean arterial pressure (MAP) around 50, and briefly required levophed and dopamine, but is now off pressors.
4. Decreased oxygen saturation: The patient had a transient episode of decreased oxygen saturation"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who has undergone a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and post-infarction cardiomyopathy. He also has moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with below-knee amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and acute on chronic systolic heart failure. 

The patient's recent medical events include a low-grade fever that resolved without any apparent source or evidence of infection. His blood cultures came back negative, and he is asymptomatic. The patient also experienced chest pain, which was initially treated as unstable angina but turned out to be non-ischemic in origin. His cardiac enzymes remained flat, and he underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting of the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery graft. 

The patient has been hypotensive, requiring the use of vasopressors like levophed and dopamine. He was also experiencing decreased oxygen saturation levels, which improved with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD). 

The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis sessions three times a week. He is also being treated for recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), which appear to be asymptomatic and not actively infected. The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding"

   24 Hour Events:
   Had a full dialysis session yesterday, during which was transfused 1
   unit pRBC. Was given midodrine 5mg yesterday prior to dialysis to help
   with blood pressure control during dialysis.
   Tolerated the HD well.
   Per renal, plan for another dialysis session tomorrow morning, and then
   return to M/W/F regular dialysis session schedule. Hold
   antihypertensives tomorrow morning prior to dialysis session.

   Attending Progress Note
   I have reviewed the daily progress note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10454**] today and I concur
   with the history, physical examination, assessment and treatment
   plan.   My examination today is consistent with the documented physical
   examination by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10454**].
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10403**] is a 53 year old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG and a
   recent stent to the LAD (via the LIMA).  He has a known cardiomyopathy
   (LVEF 20-25%), moderate to severe MR, PVD s/p B LE amputations due to
   diabetic vascular disease, ESRD s/p renal transplant x 2 now on HD.  He
   has undergone a successful transition from CVVH to hemodialysis and has
   tolerated this transition hemodynamically.    He is symptomatically
   much improved and back to his baseline respiratory state.
   He is much improved, able to transfer from bed, feels stronger and base
   to baseline respiratory status, and ready emotionally to go home.  He
   was net positive yesterday but was able to undergo hemodialysis
   yesterday.  A repeat HD session is planned for tomorrow prior to
   discharge.   We will discontinue his Captopril and continue beta
   blockers as we transition to outpatient management.
   The treatment plan discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a complex medical history including coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), post-infarction cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20-25%, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, diabetes mellitus type 1, peripheral vascular disease with bilateral lower extremity amputations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with two renal transplants, and currently on hemodialysis (HD). 

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is being managed for several conditions including acute on chronic systolic heart failure, chest pain possibly due to unstable angina or CAD, hypotension possibly due to cardiac causes, decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2) possibly due to fluid overload from CHF, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and history of stroke. 

The patient has been undergoing CVVH and has tolerated the transition to HD well. His fluid balance is negative by 7 liters, indicating adequate fluid removal during dialysis. His cardiac enzymes have been flat, suggesting no ongoing myocardial ischemia. 

The patient's current medications include glargine (insulin), SSI (likely sliding scale insulin), ASA (aspirin), Plavix (antiplatelet agent), Coumadin (warfarin), heparin gtt (low-dose heparin), allop"

   hours; no leukocytosis, no clear source or evidence of infection,
   pulled R IJ on [**9-1**]
 preliminary micro wound culture read: no growth
   - f/u blood cultures
   - urine is colonized (klebsiella), so could treat for UTI, but feel no
   treatment necessary for now as asymptomatic, without temp spike or
   leukocytosis

   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has known global hypokinesis
   with EF 15%. Unclear what the precipitant of acute exacerbation was.
   Not believed to be ischemic etiology.  Completed CVVH series; had full
   HD yesterday. LOS fluid balance: negative 7 liters
   - Discontinued captopril
   - Hold parameters for Metoprolol d/t lower BP
   - Continue HD M/W/F

   # Chest Pain/CAD: Patient has known CAD with CABG and PCI in past.
   History sounds like unstable angina, however cardiac enzymes have been
   flat (x3), without EKG changes. Initially treated with ASA, plavix,
   heparin gtt, s/p cardiac cath [**8-27**] with stent to LIMA-LAD graft now
   chest pain free since then.
   - Continue ASA, statin, plavix

   # Hypotension: Concern for cardiac cause given low EF d/t
   cardiomyopathy.  Tolerating MAP ~50.  Briefly on levophed and then
   dopamine; now off pressors.
   - Hold parameters for metoprolol
   - Discontinued captopril
   - Hold antihypertensives in the AM prior to dialysis session
   .
   # Decreased O2 sats:  Transiently, believed to be due to fluid overload
   from CHF; now resolved with CVVHD.  Brief episode two days ago, while
   transferring to bed, will need PT/rehab both as inpatient, and
   following discharge. SpO2 overnight mostly mid-90s.

   restarted on home dose coumadin with Heparin bridge until INR
   therapeutic. INR supratherapeutic today.
   - Recheck coags at HD, as labs drawn off heparinized HD line today so
   concern for spurious values
   - Redose coumadin and/or heparin as needed based on coag panel later
   today

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo gentleman with CAD s/p CABG, post infarction cardiomyopathy (EF
   20-25%), moderate to severe MR, DM1, PVD s/p B LE amputations, ESRD s/p
   renal Xplant x 2 now on HD with chest pain, and acute on chronic
   systolic heart failure. S/p cardiac left and right catheterization.
   .
   # Low Grade Fever:  Resolved, without a temperature spike for >48
   hours; no leukocytosis, no clear source or evidence of infection,
   pulled R IJ on [**9-1**]
 preliminary micro wound culture read: no growth
   - f/u blood cultures
   - urine is colonized (klebsiella), so could treat for UTI, but feel no
   treatment necessary for now as asymptomatic, without temp spike or
   leukocytosis
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has known global hypokinesis
   with EF 15%. Unclear what the precipitant of acute exacerbation was.
   Not believed to be ischemic etiology.  Completed CVVH series; had full
   HD yesterday. LOS fluid balance: negative 7 liters
   - Discontinued captopril
   - Hold parameters for Metoprolol d/t lower BP
   - Continue HD M/W/F
   .
   # Chest Pain/CAD: Patient has known CAD with CABG and PCI in past.
   History sounds like unstable angina, however cardiac enzymes have been
   flat (x3), without EKG changes. Initially treated with ASA, plavix,
   heparin gtt, s/p cardiac cath [**8-27**] with stent to LIMA-LAD graft now
   chest pain free since then.
   - Continue ASA, statin, plavix
   .
   # Hypotension: Concern for cardiac cause given low EF d/t
   cardiomyopathy.  Tolerating MAP ~50.  Briefly on levophed and then
   dopamine; now off pressors.
   - Hold parameters for metoprolol
   - Discontinued captopril
   - Hold antihypertensives in the AM prior to dialysis session
   .
   # Decreased O2 sats:  Transiently, believed to be due to fluid overload
   from CHF; now resolved with CVVHD.  Brief episode two days ago, while
   transferring to bed, will need PT/rehab both as inpatient, and
   following discharge. SpO2 overnight mostly mid-90s.
   - Continue dialysis M/W/F
   - PT f/u
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  Had HD yesterday. Cr improved s/p HD.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Resume M/W/F HD sessions
   - Hold antihypertensives in AM prior to HD, per renal
   .
   # Recurrent UTIs: Does not appear infected clinically.  Most likely he
   is chronically colonized.  Will hold on abx tx for now, consider
   starting if pt symptomatic. Low-grade fevers have resolved. Will
   monitor for signs of infection.
   .
   # h/o UGIB: No recent bleeding; will carefully monitor Hct given ASA,
   recent heparin, and Plavix.  Hct stable-low today. Low clinical
   suspicion for bleed.
   -continue PPI
   -T&S last ordered on [**9-2**]
   .
   # h/o Stroke (suspected cardioembolic): On Coumadin as an outpatient.
   INR was initially subtherapeutic, and patient was on heparin gtt. INR
   continues to be sub-therapeutic, slowly increasing following Vit K at
   OSH. Given patient in & out of afib on [**8-27**]; have goal INR [**12-30**], pt
   restarted on home dose coumadin with Heparin bridge until INR
   therapeutic. INR supratherapeutic today.
   - Recheck coags at HD, as labs drawn off heparinized HD line today so
   concern for spurious values
   - Redose coumadin and/or heparin as needed based on coag panel later
   today
   .
   # Diabetes: Continue glargine, SSI, qid fingersticks. Readjusted
   glargine dose and SSI for better glucose control yesterday.
   - Monitor sugars s/p changes to regimen
   - Diabetic diet
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 7.4 on admission, now resolved. Unclear etiology (per
   patient and wife, has been going to dialysis three times a week
   regularly). K improved s/p HD.
   .
   # Groin pain, back pack: On Oxycodone as needed.
   .
   # Gout: Allopurinol 100mg PO daily

   Attending Progress Note
   I have reviewed the daily progress note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10454**] today and I concur
   with the history, physical examination, assessment and treatment
   plan.
   History:  Documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10454**]

   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 10403**] is a 53 year old gentleman
   with CAD s/p CABG and a recent stent to the LAD (via the LIMA).  He has
   a known cardiomyopathy (LVEF 20-25%), moderate to severe MR, PVD s/p B
   LE amputations due to diabetic vascular disease, ESRD s/p renal
   transplant x 2 now on HD.  He has undergone a successful transition
   from CVVH to hemodialysis and has tolerated this transition
   hemodynamically.    He is symptomatically much improved and back to his
   baseline respiratory state.
   HD was performed today and he felt well afterward.
   He will be discharged to home from the CCU today.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and has a recent stent placed in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) via the left internal mammary artery (LIMA). He also has a known cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20-25%, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with bilateral lower extremity amputations due to diabetic vascular disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to renal transplantation.

The patient is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute on chronic systolic heart failure, chest pain, hypotension, decreased oxygen saturation (O2 sat), and elevated potassium levels. He has undergone continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and has tolerated the transition from CVVH to hemodialysis well. The patient's renal function has improved with hemodialysis, as indicated by the resolution of hyperkalemia.

The patient's current medications include glargine (a long-acting insulin analog), statin, aspirin, Plavix, and allopurinol for gout. He is also on prophylactic medications such as Coumadin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a stress"
