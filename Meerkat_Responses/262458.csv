   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure. Unclear etiology of  hypoxia: Patient electively
   intubated for EGD then extubated. Required NRB to maintain sats in 90s.
   Continue tachypnea to the 40s, tired, CO2 increased, then reintubated.
   Initial CXR unremarkable. Concern for progression to ARDS secondary to
   pancreatitis.
   .
   # Hypotension. Differential includes pancreatitis vs infection.
   Required large volume fluid to maintain pressures overnight. Now on
   phenylephrine.
   - Continue pressors for MAPs > 65
   - IVF bolus as needed
   - F/u cultures
   - Consider antibiotics
   .
   #  Pancreatitis: Most likely alcoholic in etiology, with elevated
   lipase to 1600. CT shows ? 30 % necrosis.  Per surgery no antibiotics
   currently.
   - continue aggessive hydration
   - trend lipase
   - f/u am lipid panel
   - f/u surgery recs
   .
   #  Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows
   marked liver echogenicity.
   - f/u viral hepatitis panel
   - c/s GI
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Marked leukocytosis with low grade temperature, lactate
   3.6.. UA with + wbcs in ED, but repeat negative. [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to
   pancreatitis, however cannot rule out infection. Treated in ED with
   ciprofloxacin and flagyl. Urine and blood cultures pending.
   - f/u blood cultures and urine culture
   - sputum fx
   - f/u final CT read
   .
   #  Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. Crit stable.
   -f/u GI recs
   -continue PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Most likely due to volume depletion in the setting of
   inability to tolerate POs.  Patient markedly dry on exam.  [**Month (only) 8**] also
   reflect a more chronic long-term liver disease. Improving 127 from 118.
   - consider sending urine lytes this am
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawl symptoms, but not
   prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presenation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - thiamine, vb12, folate

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). 

The patient was intubated for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and later extubated but required non-rebreather mask (NRB) to maintain oxygen saturation in the 90s. He then developed tachypnea, increased carbon dioxide levels, and was reintubated. The initial chest X-ray was unremarkable, but there is concern for progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to pancreatitis.

The patient required large volumes of fluid to maintain blood pressures overnight and is now on phenylephrine. Pressors are being continued for mean arterial pressures (MAPs) greater than 65, and intravenous fluids (IVF) bolus as needed are being given. Cultures are being followed, and consideration is being given to starting antibiotics.

The patient's pancreatitis is most likely alcoholic in etiology, with elevated lipase levels of 1600. A CT scan shows approximately 30% necrosis, and per surgery, no antibiotics are currently being given. Aggressive hydration is being continued, lipase levels are being trended, an am lipid panel is being followed, and surgical recommendations are being considered.

Acute hepatitis is also present, likely due to alcoholic hepatitis. The CT scan shows fatty infiltration, and no evidence"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He required intubation due to respiratory failure and was treated for a Duodenal bulb variceal bleed, which was caused by a Diuelfoy's lesion. The patient also has significant hypotension and required large-volume fluid resuscitation. He has a history of alcohol withdrawal symptoms but has not had a seizure before. His liver function tests indicate alcoholic hepatitis, and his pancreatitis is likely related to alcohol abuse as well. He is currently on phenylephrine for hypotension, and his lipase levels are elevated, suggesting ongoing pancreatic inflammation. The patient's condition is complicated by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) physiology, and there is a concern for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to pancreatitis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which required intubation. There is a concern for progression to ARDS due to pancreatitis.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis, most likely caused by alcohol abuse. The severity of the pancreatitis is significant, with approximately 30% necrosis observed on CT scan.
3. SIRS Physiology: The patient's condition is complicated by SIRS, likely related to the pancreatitis.
4. Hypotension: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. He has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with acute respiratory failure, pancreatitis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and delirium tremens. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He requires vasopressor support and has received multiple liters of fluids to maintain blood pressure. A duodenal bulb ulcer (Dueloy lesion) was identified during an endoscopy. The patient's condition has been complicated by a 30% necrotic pancreas as seen on CT scan, and he has required reintubation due to tiring and increasing CO2 levels. His blood glucose levels are significantly low, and he is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, liver enzymes, and pancreatic enzymes. There is also evidence of kidney dysfunction and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. ventilator-associated complications due to prolonged intubation
3. further gastrointestinal bleeding
4. sepsis or septic shock secondary to pancreatitis and/or infection
5. worsening pancreatic necrosis and potential development of a pancreatic abscess or pseudocyst
6. hypoglycemia and its associated complications
7. renal dysfunction and acute kidney injury
8. electrolyte imbalances and potential cardiac arrhythmias"

   on this study. There is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation, and the
   common bile duct measures 4 mm. There is normal flow in the portal
   vein.
   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB.
   .
   #  Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   -f/u GI recs
   -continue PPI
   .
   #  Hypoxia: Patient electively intubated for EGD then extubated. Has
   required NRB to maintain sats in 90s. Initial CXR unremarkable. Concern
   for ARDS secondary to pancreatitis.
   .
   #  Pancreatitis: Most likely alcoholic in etiology, with elevated
   lipase to 1600. CT shows ? 30 % necrosis.
   - continue aggessive hydration
   - serial abdominal exams
   - trend lipase
   - f/u am lipid panel
   - f/u surgery recs
   .
   #  Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal obstruction.
   - f/u viral hepatitis panel
   - hepatology following
   - avoid hepatically cleared meds
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Marked leukocytosis with low grade temperature, lactate
   trending down. UA with + wbcs in ED, but repeat negative. [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to pancreatitis, however cannot rule out infection. Urine and
   blood cultures pending.
   - f/u blood cultures and urine culture
   - f/u final CT read
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Most likely due to volume depletion in the setting of
   inability to tolerate POs.  Patient markedly dry on exam.  [**Month (only) 8**] also
   reflect a more chronic long-term liver disease.
   - fluid repletion as given above
   - consider sending urine lytes this am
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawl symptoms, but not
   prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presenation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - thiamine, vb12, folate
   - valium with CIWA > 10

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed a duodenal bulb lesion consistent with Dieulafoy's lesion.

The patient was initially intubated for the EGD and then extubated but required nonrebreather mask (NRB) to maintain oxygen saturation in the 90s. The initial chest X-ray (CXR) was unremarkable, but there is concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to pancreatitis.

The patient most likely has alcoholic pancreatitis, with elevated lipase levels and CT findings showing over 30% necrosis. Aggressive hydration is being continued, along with serial abdominal exams, trending lipase levels, following up with surgery recommendations, and considering further imaging.

Alcoholic hepatitis is also suspected, with CT findings of fatty infiltration and no evidence of distal obstruction. A viral hepatitis panel is pending, and hepatology follow-up is planned. Medications that are hepatatically cleared should be avoided, and liver function tests (LFTs) should be trended.

The patient has leukocytosis with low-grade fever and lactate trending down. Although urine and blood cultures are pending, the leukocytosis may be secondary to pancreatitis or infection. Urine and blood cultures are being monitored"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with
   necrotizing pancreatitis, ARDS, elevated IAP and UGIB.
   # Respiratory Failure. ARDS related to necrotizing pancreatis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and etoh withdrawl.
   - ARDSnet ventilator settings with stable Vt and p02 in 70s
   - Permissible tachypnea is tolerated in setting of AGMA; monitor for
   stacked breaths and if so then paralysis.
    monitor abdominal pressures
   - PEEP of 20 to overcome IAP; elevated peak aw pressures so will check
   ballon pressure to address if this elevated [**2-5**] IAP or thoracic
   pressures.
   -maxed out on fentanyl and versed for sedation
   # Shock/Necrotizing  pancreatitis: EtOH induced. Requiring large volume
   fluid resuscitation as well as maxed neo and low dose levo.
   - continue fluids; if appropriate will use vigileo to determine
   resuscitative capacity. No surgical benefit at this time.
   - wean levo and monitor UOP
   - add meropenem for ppx
   - monitor lactate lipase and AGMA
   # IAP elevation: secondary to third spacing and edema. Bladder
   pressures as high as 31. Will use groin cordis to better measure
   pressure. Surgery recommends no intervention currently. If ventilation
   is impeded by increased IAP, if decrease in UOP, if worsened
   AGMA/lactate will consider surgical release of pressures if surgery
   deems appropriate.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatiis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - f/u viral hepatitis panel, LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT over 30 s/p 2xpRBC
   on [**2131-5-18**]. HCT>30
   # Hyponatremia, hypervolemic: secondary to aggressive resuscitation.
   Improved.
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawl symptoms, but not
   prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presenation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - thiamine, vb12, folate
   - valium with CIWA > 10

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with necrotizing pancreatitis, ARDS, elevated IAP, and UGIB. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to ARDS related to necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient requires large volume fluid resuscitation, maximum norepinephrine, and low-dose levofloxacin. His condition is complicated by hypoxia, tachypnea, anion gap metabolic acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and ethanol withdrawal. The patient has elevated blood pressures and is at risk for complications such as shock, IAP elevation, acute hepatitis, hematemesis, hyponatremia, and alcoholism. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adherence to ARDSnet ventilator settings are necessary to maintain oxygenation and prevent further deterioration.
2. Shock: Due to necrotizing pancreatitis and hypotension, the patient is at risk for shock. Continuous monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and aggressive fluid resuscitation are required.
3. Increased Abdominal Pressure (IAP): Elevated IAP can impede ventilation and increase the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome. Regular monitoring of bladder pressures and consideration of surgical intervention if indicated are necessary.
4. Acute Hepatitis: The patient may be experiencing alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration. Further evaluation"

The patient has hypotension, acute hepatitis, respiratory failure, alcohol withdrawal, alcohol abuse, pancreatitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and low blood pressure. The flow sheet data indicates the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with high levels of oxygen, and their blood gases are abnormal with a low pH and high carbon dioxide levels. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and high lactate levels. The patient has multiple lines and tubes inserted for medical support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypotension leading to shock, further deterioration of liver function, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential worsening of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of these complications to improve their chances of recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure. Unclear etiology of  hypoxia: Patient electively
   intubated for EGD then extubated. Required NRB to maintain sats in 90s.
   Continue tachypnea to the 40s, tired, CO2 increased, then reintubated.
   Initial CXR unremarkable. Concern for progression to [**Doctor Last Name 76**]/ARDS secondary
   to pancreatitis.
   - ARDSnet ventilator settings
   - monitor abdominal pressures
   - fentanyl and versed for sedation
   - wean settings as tolerated
   - repeat ABG this afternoon
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Most likely alcoholic in etiology, lipase peaked at
   1600. CT scan shows probable 30% necrosis. Complicated by SIRS
   physiology. Significant hypotension, required large volume fluid to
   maintain pressures overnight. Now on phenylephrine. Also with
   leukocytosis likely related to pancreatitis but low threshold to treat
   for infection.  Per surgery currently not treating with antibiotics.
   - aggressive IV hydration
   - attempt to wean neo
   - place arterial line for BP monitoring
   - wean propofol
   - strict NPO (no PO meds)
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u final CT read
   - trend lipase
   - f/u am lipid panel
   - f/u surgery recs
   .
   #  Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis. CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows
   marked liver echogenicity.
   - f/u viral hepatitis panel
   - trend LFTs
   - f/u GI recs
   .
   #  Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. Crit stable.
   -f/u GI recs
   -continue PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Most likely due to volume depletion. Patient markedly
   dry on initial exam.  [**Month (only) 8**] also reflect a more chronic long-term liver
   disease. Improving 127 from 118.
   - continue to follow
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawl symptoms, but not
   prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presenation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - thiamine level pending
   - thiamine, vb12, folate
   - valium with CIWA > 10
   - social work consult when medically stable
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism.
- He presented with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).
- The patient was initially intubated for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) but required reintubation due to respiratory failure.
- He has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to pancreatitis.
- The patient's condition is complicated by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and hypotension.
- Laboratory findings show elevated liver enzymes, lipase levels, and markers of liver damage.
- The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet ventilator settings.
- He is receiving aggressive IV hydration, vasopressors, and antibiotics.
- Other issues include hyponatremia, potential thiamine deficiency, and alcoholism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progression to severe ARDS and possible need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) due to sepsis and multi-organ involvement.
3. Further complications from pancreatitis, such as infected pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation.
4. Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis due to ongoing alcohol abuse and acute hepatitis.
5. Thiamine deficiency leading to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome or beriberi.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alchoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.
   - ARDS settings with goal pO2>70 and pH >7.25
   - Permissible tachypnea is tolerated in setting of AGMA.  If patient
   has auto-peep and breath stacking would consider paralysis.
   - Monitor abdominal pressures
   - Recheck esophageal balloon pressure and adjust PEEP
   - Continue fentaynl and midaz for sedation.
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Likely secondary to alchohol
   complicated by SIRS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement and
   volume rescuitation with [**Location 6472**] +50L.
   - Continue empiric meropenem
   - Wean pressors, bolus IVF to maintain MAP>70 and UOP>20 cc/hr.
   - Monitor chemistries.
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine continues to trend up with oliguria,
   likely secondary to SIRS/hypotension and IABP leading to ATN. Also
   concerning for HRS in setting of alc hep.
   - Urine lytes, eos, osm
   - Trend UOP, bolus IVF to maintain goal >20 cc/hr.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatiis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - f/u viral hepatitis panel, LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of SIRS and IABP.
   - Trend chemistries.
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawl symptoms, but not
   prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presenation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and altered liver function tests. The patient requires multiple pressors to maintain hemodynamic stability and fluid resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawal. The main concern is maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation while minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Necrotizing Pancreatitis/SIRS: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis likely secondary to alcohol use, complicated by SIRS. Pressor requirements and ongoing fluid resuscitation are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are trending upwards with oliguria, suggesting acute renal failure. This could be secondary to SIRS/hypotension, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Monitoring urine output, electrolytes, and renal function is crucial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension, respiratory failure, hepatitis, alcohol withdrawal, pancreatitis, and sepsis. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure, increased heart rate, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient is on multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, and phenylephrine for hemodynamic support. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and lactate levels. The patient is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and other supportive care measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated lactate levels indicate possible sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory parameters is crucial.
3. Hepatitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes suggest acute hepatitis. Monitoring liver function tests and assessing for any signs of liver dysfunction is essential.
4. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient may experience severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms such as tremors, seizures, or delirium tremens. Monitoring for these symptoms and providing appropriate medication management is important.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase levels indicate acute pancreatitis. Close monitoring of abdominal pain and assessing for any complications like necrosis or pseudocyst formation is necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alchoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.
   - APRV
   - Permissible tachypnea is tolerated in setting of AGMA.  If patient
   has auto-peep and breath stacking would consider paralysis.  Would
   permit PCO2 of ~70 and pH ~7.1 with goal PaO2>60.
   - Monitor abdominal pressures
   - Recheck esophageal balloon pressure and adjust vent settings as
   indicated
   - Continue fentanyl and midazolam for sedation.
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Likely secondary to alchohol
   complicated by SIRS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement and
   volume rescuitation with [**Location 6472**] >55L.
   - Continue empiric meropenem
   - Wean pressors, bolus IVF to maintain MAP>70 and UOP>20 cc/hr.
   - Monitor chemistries.
   - Continue to hold MIVF
   - Follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine continues to trend up with oliguria,
   likely secondary to SIRS/hypotension and IABP leading to ATN.
   - Urine lytes, eos, osm
   - Trend UOP, bolus IVF to maintain goal >20 cc/hr.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of SIRS and IABP.
   - Trend chemistries.
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10
   FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO. Would consider starting TPN after
   5-7 days
   PPx: SCDs, PPI
   Access: RIJ, right radial art line.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He also has necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS, acute renal failure, IAP elevation, acute hepatitis, hematemesis, hyponatremia, and alcoholism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS may lead to worsening respiratory failure if there is no improvement in oxygenation or if ventilator settings need to be adjusted.
2. Sepsis: The patient's SIRS could progress to sepsis if there is an ongoing infection and inadequate response to antibiotic therapy.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's oliguria and increasing creatinine levels indicate the possibility of acute kidney injury, which may require dialysis.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's acute hepatitis and elevated liver enzymes suggest a potential risk for liver failure. Close monitoring of liver function is necessary.
5. Thiamine Deficiency: Given the patient's history of alcoholism and current symptoms, there is a risk of thiamine deficiency leading to Wernicke's encephalopathy or other neurological complications.
6. Blood Clots: Immobilization and critical illness increase the risk of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.
   - Continue current vent settings for now
   - check intraabdominal pressure
   - consider changing bed rotation parameters so only supine and
   left-sided to minimize pressure on IVC.
   - Begin to wean sedation as tolerated.  Would prefer to wean down
   fentanyl and then midaxolam.
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Likely secondary to alcohol
   complicated by SIRS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement and
   volume resucsitation with [**Location 6472**] >54L.
   - Continue empiric meropenem for now.  Will discuss with surgical team.
   - Wean pressors as able, starting with levophed
   - If hypotensive, consider using albumin 25-50 grams in preference to
   additional IVF boluses to maintain MAP>60 and UOP>20 cc/hr.
   - Monitor chemistries.
   - Continue to hold MIVF
   - Follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine continues to trend up with oliguria,
   likely secondary to SIRS/hypotension and IABP leading to ATN.
   - Urine lytes, eos, osm
   - Trend UOP, bolus IVF to maintain goal >20 cc/hr.
   #Thrombocytopenia:  platelets trending down.  No clear etiology at this
   time.  Recommend checking DIC panel and HIT antibody.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of SIRS and IABP.
   - Trend chemistries.
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10
   FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO. Would consider starting TPN after
   5-7 days.  If patient has no significant change over the next 1-2 days,
   may begin TPN on approximately [**5-23**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU and is experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS, hypoxia, tachypnea, anion gap metabolic acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and ethanol withdrawal. He also has necrotizing pancreatitis, SIRS, and UGIB. The patient's condition is complicated by acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, elevated IAP, acute hepatitis, hematemesis, hyponatremia, and alcoholism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. Complications may include worsening hypoxia, increased work of breathing, and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Necrotizing Pancreatitis/SIRS: The patient's necrotizing pancreatitis is complicated by SIRS. Complications may include septic shock, multi-organ failure, and further deterioration in organ function.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating acute renal failure. Complications may include worsening renal function, fluid overload, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, leading to thrombocytopenia. Complications may include increased risk of bleeding, especially if invasive procedures are performed.
5. Elevated Intra-abdom"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.
   - Continue current vent settings for now
   - intra-abdominal pressures improved
   - consider changing bed rotation parameters so only supine and
   left-sided to minimize pressure on IVC.
   - Begin to wean sedation as tolerated.  Would prefer to wean down
   fentanyl and then midaxolam.
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Likely secondary to alcohol
   complicated by SIRS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement and
   volume resucsitation with [**Location 6472**] >54L.
   - Continue empiric meropenem for now.  Will discuss with surgical team.
   - Wean pressors as able, starting with levophed
   - If hypotensive, consider using albumin 25-50 grams in preference to
   additional IVF boluses to maintain MAP>60 and UOP>20 cc/hr.
   - Monitor chemistries.
   - Continue to hold MIVF
   - Follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine continues to trend up with oliguria,
   likely secondary to SIRS/hypotension and IABP leading to ATN.
   - Urine lytes, eos, osm
   - Trend UOP, bolus IVF to maintain goal >20 cc/hr.
   #Thrombocytopenia:  platelets trending down.  No clear etiology at this
   time.  Recommend checking DIC panel and HIT antibody.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of SIRS and IABP.

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 24 cmH2O. His blood pressure is low, and he requires norepinephrine and phenylephrine infusions. The patient has an elevated D-dimer, high FDPS, and high fibrinogen, indicating a possible coagulopathy.

The patient's WBC count is elevated, indicating an infection or inflammation. His Hct levels are within normal range, but his platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding. The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating renal impairment.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure due to ARDS, necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, IAP elevation, acute hepatitis, hematemesis, hyponatremia, and alcoholism.

The patient is currently receiving meropenem for empiric coverage, along with other medications such as fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and albumin. The patient's sedation is being weaned as tolerated, and efforts are being made to minimize pressure on the IVC.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension, respiratory failure, and acute pancreatitis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, phenylephrine, fentanyl, and midazolam. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/59 to 105/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient has been receiving antibiotics and has elevated D-dimer, high FDPS, and high fibrinogen levels. He also has an elevated white blood cell count of 24 K/uL and a decreased platelet count of 61 K/uL. Other lab results show elevated lactate levels and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's fluid balance has been noted with an input of 2,817 mL and output of 830 mL. The patient's current weight is 156 kg, and his height is 67 inches. The patient's neurological status is not assessed.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and positive blood cultures, there is a potential risk for sepsis.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and low oxygen saturation indicate a possibility of developing AR"

   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  Rising WBC
   could also suggest secondary VAP.  Patient w/ some dysychrony w/
   reduction of sedation.
   - Continue current vent settings for now, recheck ABG
   - intra-abdominal pressures improved
   - Begin to wean sedation as tolerated.  Would prefer to wean down
   fentanyl and then midaxolam.
   - send sputum Cx
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Likely secondary to alcohol
   complicated by SIRS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement,
   with neo +/- levo.  Volume resucsitation with [**Location 6472**] >54L.
   - Continue empiric meropenem for now.
   - Wean pressors as able, starting with levophed
   - no improvement with albumin trial yesterday
   - Monitor chemistries.
   - Continue to hold MIVF, boluses PRN
   - Follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine continues to trend up with oliguria,
   likely secondary to SIRS/hypotension and IABP leading to ATN.  Cr now
   up to 3.0
   - Urine lytes, eos, osm sent yesterday
   - renal c/s, w/ likely need for CVVH in the near future
   - Trend UOP, bolus IVF to maintain goal >20 cc/hr.
   # Leukocytosis: Rise of WBC to 24 from 16 two days prior.  Patient has
   been afebrile, but have concern for a potential blossoming infection
   already on meropeneum.  Will resend cultures and have low threshold to
   started coverage for potential line infection.
   #Thrombocytopenia:  platelets trending down, but pleatued today.  No
   clear etiology at this time.  DIC panel negative, and HIT antibody
   pending.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of SIRS and IABP.
   - Trend chemistries.
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10
   FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO. Would consider starting TPN after
   5-7 days.  If patient has no significant change over the next 1-2 days,
   may begin TPN on approximately [**5-24**].  Getting nutrition recs, and will
   setting if want to do TPN vs. post-jejunum NG.  Feel pt likely too
   unstable to have NG placed in IR.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis.
- He is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS, hypoxia, tachypnea, metabolic acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawal.
- The patient also has necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS, likely secondary to alcohol consumption, and is showing signs of worsening with pressor requirements and volume resuscitation.
- He is also dealing with acute renal failure, indicated by an increase in creatinine levels and oliguria.
- The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 24, which could suggest a secondary ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Thrombocytopenia is present with a platelet count of 61, and no clear etiology has been identified yet.
- The patient has elevated intra-abdominal pressures, possibly due to third spacing and edema.
- He is suspected to have alcoholic hepatitis, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes and fatty infiltration on imaging.
- Hematemesis is also present, with an EGD showing a duodenal ulcer.
- The patient is experiencing hyponatremia, likely due to decreased effective circulating volume in the setting of SIRS and intra-abdominal pressure.
- Alcoholism is a significant factor in the patient's presentation, with a history of withdrawal symptoms and potential thiamine deficiency"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.
   - Continue current vent settings for now
   - check intraabdominal pressure
   - consider changing bed rotation parameters so only supine and
   left-sided to minimize pressure on IVC.
   - Begin to wean sedation as tolerated.  Would prefer to wean down
   fentanyl and then midaxolam.
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Likely secondary to alcohol
   complicated by SIRS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement and
   volume resucsitation with [**Location 6472**] >54L.
   - Continue empiric meropenem for now.  Will discuss with surgical team.
   - Wean pressors as able, starting with levophed
   - If hypotensive, consider using albumin 25-50 grams in preference to
   additional IVF boluses to maintain MAP>60 and UOP>20 cc/hr.
   - Monitor chemistries.
   - Continue to hold MIVF
   - Follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine continues to trend up with oliguria,
   likely secondary to SIRS/hypotension and IABP leading to ATN.
   - Urine lytes, eos, osm
   - Trend UOP, bolus IVF to maintain goal >20 cc/hr.
   #Thrombocytopenia:  platelets trending down.  No clear etiology at this
   time.  Recommend checking DIC panel and HIT antibody.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of SIRS and IABP.
   - Trend chemistries.
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.
   - Continue current vent settings for now
   - check intraabdominal pressure
   - consider changing bed rotation parameters so only supine and
   left-sided to minimize pressure on IVC.
   - Begin to wean sedation as tolerated.  Would prefer to wean down
   fentanyl and then midaxolam.
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Likely secondary to alcohol
   complicated by SIRS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement and
   volume resucsitation with [**Location 6472**] >54L.
   - Continue empiric meropenem for now.  Will discuss with surgical team.
   - Wean pressors as able, starting with levophed
   - If hypotensive, consider using albumin 25-50 grams in preference to
   additional IVF boluses to maintain MAP>60 and UOP>20 cc/hr.
   - Monitor chemistries.
   - Continue to hold MIVF
   - Follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine continues to trend up with oliguria,
   likely secondary to SIRS/hypotension and IABP leading to ATN.
   - Urine lytes, eos, osm
   - Trend UOP, bolus IVF to maintain goal >20 cc/hr.
   #Thrombocytopenia:  platelets trending down.  No clear etiology at this
   time.  Recommend checking DIC panel and HIT antibody.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of SIRS and IABP.
   - Trend chemistries.
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10
   FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO. Would consider starting TPN after
   5-7 days.  If patient has no significant change over the next 1-2 days,
   may begin TPN on approximately [**5-23**].

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. 

The patient has respiratory failure due to ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He is on mechanical ventilation, and his current settings include a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 24 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.29, pCO2 of 38 mmHg, pO2 of 86 mmHg, HCO3 of 19 mEq/L, and base excess of -7. He also has an elevated D-dimer level, high FDPS, and high fibrinogen, indicating a possible coagulopathy.

The patient is also experiencing necrotizing pancreatitis, which is likely secondary to alcohol abuse and has resulted in SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome). He requires pressor support with levophed and has received a significant amount of fluid resuscitation. His WBC count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammation.

The patient has acute renal failure, as evidenced by an increasing creatinine level and oliguria. His urine output needs to be monitored, and he should be given IV fluids to maintain a goal of"

   could also suggest secondary VAP.  Patient w/ some dysychrony w/
   reduction of sedation.
   - Continue current vent settings for now, recheck ABG
   - Continue to monitor IAP
   - Begin to wean sedation as tolerated.  Would prefer to wean down
   fentanyl and then midaz.
   - send sputum Cx
   - Continue vanco and meropenem.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 29 today.  Patient continues to be afebrile.
   Concern for CVL infection, VAP, or necrotizing pancreatitis
   complication including abscess formation.
   - Continue empiric vancomycin and meropenem
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Consider reimaging of abdomen when stable, although patient is not a
   good surgical candidate.
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Likely secondary to alcohol
   complicated by SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor
   requirement, with neo +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resucsitation with
   [**Location 6472**] >56. Patient without improvement with albumin trial, likely
   secondary to SIRS and increased vascular permeability.
   - Continue empiric meropenem for now.
   - Wean pressors as able, starting with levophed
   - Monitor chemistries.
   - Continue to hold MIVF, boluses PRN to maintain UOP>20 cc/hr
   - Follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine continues to trend up to 3.2 with
   oliguria, likely secondary to SIRS/hypotension and IABP leading to
   ATN.  Appreciate renal recs - urine sediment consistent with ATN.
   - Follow-up renal recs, patient likey candidate for CVVH as creatinine,
   lytes, and BUN continue to rise.
   - Trend UOP, bolus IVF to maintain goal >20 cc/hr.
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets trending down over hospital course but
   stable today.  No clear etiology at this time.  DIC panel and HIT PF4
   antibody negative.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 97/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is receiving multiple medications including vancomycin, meropenem, fentanyl, phenylephrine, and midazolam. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 29.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 61, and hyponatremia. The patient has several potential medical complications including respiratory failure due to ARDS, leukocytosis that could suggest secondary ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), necrotizing pancreatitis with possible abscess formation, and acute renal failure likely secondary to sepsis and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Neuro: Patient with dilated pupils on high dose fentaynl gtt.
   Concerning for cerebral edema or other acute process.
   - Non-contrast CTH
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  Rising WBC
   could also be secondary to VAP.
   - Continue current vent settings for now, recheck ABG
   - Continue to monitor IAP
   - Begin to wean sedation as tolerated.  Would prefer to wean down
   fentanyl and then midaz.
   - send sputum Cx
   - Continue vanco and meropenem.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 29 today.  Patient continues to be afebrile.
   Concern for CVL infection, VAP, loculated effusion, or necrotizing
   pancreatitis complication including abscess formation.
   - Continue empiric vancomycin and meropenem, AM vanco level.
   - CT torso with PO contrast to assess for complication of pancreatitis
   including abscess or organization of right-sided pleural effusion.
   - Follow-up culture data
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Likely secondary to alcohol
   complicated by SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor
   requirement, with neo +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resucsitation with
   [**Location 6472**] >56. Patient without improvement with albumin trial, likely
   secondary to SIRS and increased vascular permeability.
   - Continue empiric meropenem for now.
   - Wean pressors as able, starting with levophed
   - Monitor chemistries.
   - Continue to hold MIVF, boluses PRN to maintain UOP>20 cc/hr although
   increase pressors first.
   - Follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
   - CT torso as above.
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine continues to trend up to 3.2 with
   oliguria, likely secondary to SIRS/hypotension and IABP leading to
   ATN.  Appreciate renal recs - urine sediment consistent with ATN.
   - Follow-up renal recs, patient likely candidate for CVVH as
   creatinine, lytes, and BUN continue to rise.
   - Trend UOP, bolus IVF to maintain goal >20 cc/hr.
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets trending down over hospital course but
   stable today.  No clear etiology at this time.  DIC panel and HIT PF4
   antibody negative.
   - Trend plt
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of SIRS and IABP.
   - Trend chemistries.
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB. He is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation and has multiple medical complications, including leukocytosis, necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), acute hepatitis, hematemesis, hyponatremia, and alcoholism. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral edema or acute process: The patient's dilated pupils on high-dose fentanyl may indicate cerebral edema or another acute neurological process. A non-contrast CT head should be done to further evaluate this.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The rising white blood cell count could be secondary to VAP. Sputum culture and continuation of current ventilator settings should be monitored.
3. Central venous line infection: Leukocytosis and concern for CVL infection suggest that the patient may have developed an infection at the central venous line site. Empiric vancomycin and meropenem should be continued, and a CT torso with PO contrast should be performed to assess for complications of pancreatitis including abscess or organization of right-sided pleural effusion.
4. Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: The patient likely has necrotizing pancreatitis secondary to alcohol use, compounded by"

   questionable effacement and possible seizure activity. Neuro and
   neurosurg consulted and patietn received ativan, keppra load, and
   hypertonic saline of hyponatremia.
   - Follow-up with neuro regarding keppra maintenance dose
   - EEG today
   - Follow-up with neurosurg recs and for possible ICP monitor.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.
   - Continue current vent settings
   - Continue to monitor IAP
   - Wean sedation as tolerated.  Would prefer to wean down fentanyl and
   then midaz.
   - send sputum Cx
   - Continue vanco, meropenem, flagyl
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 38.9 today.  Patient continues to be
   afebrile. Concern for CVL infection, VAP, loculated effusion, or
   necrotizing pancreatitis complication including abscess formation.  CT
   chest with multifocal infiltrates that could represent VAP vs ARDS.
   CTAP did not demonstrate any new pancreatic fluid collections.  Patient
   spiked overnight and was started on flagyl.
   - Continue empiric vancomycin, meropenem, and flagyl AM vanco level
   today
   - Follow-up culture data
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Likely secondary to alcohol
   complicated by SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor
   requirement, with neo +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resucsitation with
   [**Location 6472**] >58L. Patient without improvement with albumin trial, likely
   secondary to SIRS and increased vascular permeability.
   - Continue empiric antimicrobials.
   - Wean pressors as able, starting with levophed
   - Monitor chemistries.
   - Continue to hold MIVF, boluses PRN to maintain UOP>20 cc/hr although
   increase pressors first.
   - Follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
   # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient received hypertonic saline overnight
   per neurosurgery. Serum sodium stable this morning.
   - Trend chemistries.
   - Hold on additional hypertonic saline pushes given minimal benefit in
   hyponatremia correction.
   - Follow-up with neurosurgery recs if any.
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine continues to trend up to 3.2 with
   oliguria, likely secondary to SIRS/hypotension and IABP leading to
   ATN.  Appreciate renal recs - urine sediment consistent with ATN.
   - Follow-up renal recs, patient likely candidate for CVVH as
   creatinine, lytes, and BUN continue to rise.
   - Trend UOP, bolus IVF to maintain goal >20 cc/hr.
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets trending down over hospital course but
   stable today.  No clear etiology at this time.  DIC panel and HIT PF4
   antibody negative.
   - Trend plt
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Neuro: Patient with dilated pupils on high dose fentaynl gtt.  CTH
   demonstrated loss of grey white differentiation with questionable
   effacement and possible seizure activity. Neuro and neurosurg consulted
   and patietn received ativan, keppra load, and hypertonic saline of
   hyponatremia.  Patient converted to 3% IVF infusion.
   - Per neuro, keppra IV maintenance dose
   - Convert back to 23% hypertonic saline boluses Q3H with regular serum
   sodium checks.
   - EEG to be completed today
   - Per neurosurg, repeat CTH today
   - Follow-up with neurosurg and neuro recs if any.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 20 and FiO2 to 40%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   - Continue to monitor IAP
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 44.9 today.  Concern for CVL infection, VAP,
   loculated effusion, sinusitis, or pancreatitis complication including
   abscess formation.  CT chest with multifocal infiltrates that could
   represent VAP vs ARDS.  CTAP did not demonstrate any new pancreatic
   fluid collections.  On last differential, past had a predominantly left
   shift, although also with 6% eos.
   - Continue empiric vancomycin, meropenem, and flagyl.  AM vanco level
   today
   - Recheck differential, if elevated would consider drug reaction as
   potential etiology to leukocytosis and likely switch meropenem.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Afrin and nasal saline spray
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >58L. Patient
   without improvement with albumin trial, likely secondary to SIRS and
   increased vascular permeability.
   - Continue empiric antimicrobials.
   - Wean pressors as able, starting with levophed
   - Hypertonic saline as above in order to increase intravascular volume.
   - Monitor chemistries.
   - Follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
   # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient received hypertonic saline overnight
   per neurosurgery. Serum sodium stable this morning.
   - Hypertonic saline as above.
   - Trend chemistries.
   - Follow-up with neurosurgery recs if any.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and CVVH was
   initiated yesterday.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable.  No clear etiology at this time.
   DIC panel and HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10
   FEN: TPN, replete as necessary. Consider dobhoff placement today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological Complications: The patient has dilated pupils, loss of grey-white differentiation on CT head, and possible seizure activity. He has been started on hypertonic saline, ativan, and keppra for these symptoms. An EEG is pending, and the neurosurgeon wants to repeat the CT head today if the patient is stable. The patient's serum sodium levels will be closely monitored, and mannitol may be considered if there is no improvement.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea, anion gap metabolic acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawal. His PEEP has been decreased to 20 and FiO2 to 40%. The goal is to wean FiO2 and PEEP while maintaining a PaO2 of >60-65%.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is up to 44.9, indicating a possible infection. The differential shows a predominantly left shift, although there is also a 6% eosinophil count suggesting a possible drug reaction (meropenem). The patient is on empir"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Neuro: Patient with dilated pupils on high dose fentaynl gtt.  CTH
   demonstrated loss of grey white differentiation with questionable
   effacement and possible seizure activity. Neuro and neurosurg consulted
   and patietn received ativan, keppra load, and hypertonic saline of
   hyponatremia.  Patient converted to 3% IVF infusion.
   - Per neuro, keppra IV maintenance dose
   - Convert back to 23% hypertonic saline boluses Q3H with regular serum
   sodium checks.
   - EEG to be completed today
   - Per neurosurg, repeat CTH today
   - Follow-up with neurosurg and neuro recs if any.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 20 and FiO2 to 40%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   - Continue to monitor IAP
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 44.9 today.  Concern for CVL infection, VAP,
   loculated effusion, sinusitis, or pancreatitis complication including
   abscess formation.  CT chest with multifocal infiltrates that could
   represent VAP vs ARDS.  CTAP did not demonstrate any new pancreatic
   fluid collections.  On last differential, past had a predominantly left
   shift, although also with 6% eos.
   - Continue empiric vancomycin, meropenem, and flagyl.  AM vanco level
   today
   - Recheck differential, if elevated would consider drug reaction as
   potential etiology to leukocytosis and likely switch meropenem.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Afrin and nasal saline spray
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >58L. Patient
   without improvement with albumin trial, likely secondary to SIRS and
   increased vascular permeability.
   - Continue empiric antimicrobials.
   - Wean pressors as able, starting with levophed
   - Hypertonic saline as above in order to increase intravascular volume.
   - Monitor chemistries.
   - Follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
   # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient received hypertonic saline overnight
   per neurosurgery. Serum sodium stable this morning.
   - Hypertonic saline as above.
   - Trend chemistries.
   - Follow-up with neurosurgery recs if any.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and CVVH was
   initiated yesterday.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable.  No clear etiology at this time.
   DIC panel and HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications. These include ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), UGIB (upper gastrointestinal bleeding), leukocytosis, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, elevated intrabdominal pressure, acute hepatitis, and alcoholism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological Complications: The patient has dilated pupils and loss of grey-white differentiation on CT head, suggesting possible seizures. He is receiving hypertonic saline for hyponatremia and an EEG is planned.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea, and anion gap metabolic acidosis. The goal is to wean FiO2 and PEEP while maintaining PaO2 above 60-65%.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could be due to CVL infection, VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), loculated effusion, sinusitis, or pancreatitis complication including abscess formation. CT chest shows multifocal infiltrates that could represent VAP vs ARDS. CTAP did not demonstrate any new pancreatic fluid collections.

   demonstrated loss of grey white differentiation with questionable
   effacement and possible seizure activity. Neuro and neurosurg consulted
   and patient received ativan, keppra load, and hypertonic saline of
   hyponatremia.  Patient converted to 23% saline boluses with improvement
   in serum sodium and osmolility.
   - Per neuro, keppra IV maintenance dose
   - Continue 23% hypertonic saline boluses Q3H with regular serum sodium
   checks.
   - f/u EEG read
   - follow-up with neurology and neurosurg regarding frequency of saline
   boluses, need for repeat head CT given improving osmolality
   - Consider mannitol if serum sodium does not improve.
   - Wean sedation (starting with fentanyl) as possible.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 16 from 20 and FiO2 to 40%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 44.9 on [**2131-5-25**] but now trending down.
   Concern for CVL infection, VAP, loculated effusion, sinusitis, or
   pancreatitis complication including abscess formation.  CT chest with
   multifocal infiltrates that could represent VAP vs ARDS.  CTAP did not
   demonstrate any new pancreatic fluid collections.  On prior
   differential, had a neutrophilic predominance with 6% eosinophils but
   now with falling white count and normal eosinophil differential.  Spoke
   to nurse and confirmed that patient has not been getting saline
   flushes/afrin, suggesting improvement in leukocytosis supports
   diagnosis of c. diff with improvement on flagyl.
   - Continue empiric vancomycin, meropenem, and flagyl.  AM vanco level
   today
   - continue to follow CBC differential, if elevated would consider drug
   reaction as potential etiology to leukocytosis and likely switch
   Meropenem to zosyn.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - f/u ID reccs
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >58L. Patient
   without improvement with albumin trial, likely secondary to SIRS and
   increased vascular permeability.
   - Continue empiric antimicrobials.
   - Wean pressors as able, starting with levophed
   - Hypertonic saline as above in order to increase intravascular volume.
   - Monitor chemistries.
   - Follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient receiving hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium.
   - Hypertonic saline as above.
   - Trend chemistries.
   - Follow-up with neurosurgery recs if any.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and CVVH was
   initiated yesterday.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable.  No clear etiology at this time.
   DIC panel and HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB. The patient has been on multiple medications and interventions, including hypertonic saline, vasopressors, renal replacement therapy, and antibiotics. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing concerns regarding neurologic status, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, IAP elevation, acute hepatitis, hematemesis, and alcoholism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurologic Complications: The patient's neurologic status is a concern due to seizures and possible effacement. Frequent monitoring and follow-up with neurology/neurosurgery are recommended.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. Weaning of FiO2 and PEEP should be done cautiously.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to various causes such as infection (CVL infection, VAP, loculated effusion, sinusitis), pancreatitis complication (abscess formation), or Clostridium difficile infection. Cultures and follow-up CBC differentials are needed.
4. Necrotizing Pancreatitis"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Neuro: Patient with dilated pupils on high dose fentaynl gtt.  CTH
   demonstrated loss of grey white differentiation with questionable
   effacement and possible seizure activity. Neuro and neurosurg consulted
   and patietn received ativan, keppra load, and hypertonic saline of
   hyponatremia.  Patient converted to 3% IVF infusion.
   - Per neuro, keppra IV maintenance dose
   - Convert back to 23% hypertonic saline boluses Q3H with regular serum
   sodium checks.
   - EEG to be completed today
   - Per neurosurg, repeat CTH today if stable
   - Follow-up with neurosurg and neuro recs if any.
   - Consider mannitol if serum sodium does not improve.
   - Wean sedation (starting with fentanyl) as possible.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 20 and FiO2 to 40%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 44.9 today.  Concern for CVL infection, VAP,
   loculated effusion, sinusitis, or pancreatitis complication including
   abscess formation.  CT chest with multifocal infiltrates that could
   represent VAP vs ARDS.  CTAP did not demonstrate any new pancreatic
   fluid collections.  On last differential, past had a predominantly left
   shift, although also with 6% eos suggesting possible drug reaction
   (?meropenem).
   - Continue empiric vancomycin, meropenem, and flagyl.  AM vanco level
   today
   - Recheck differential, if elevated would consider drug reaction as
   potential etiology to leukocytosis and likely switch Meropenem.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Afrin and nasal saline spray
   - ID consult
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >58L. Patient
   without improvement with albumin trial, likely secondary to SIRS and
   increased vascular permeability.
   - Continue empiric antimicrobials.
   - Wean pressors as able, starting with levophed
   - Hypertonic saline as above in order to increase intravascular volume.
   - Monitor chemistries.
   - Follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient received hypertonic saline
   overnight per neurosurgery. Serum sodium stable this morning.
   - Hypertonic saline as above.
   - Trend chemistries.
   - Follow-up with neurosurgery recs if any.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and CVVH was
   initiated yesterday.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable.  No clear etiology at this time.
   DIC panel and HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10
   FEN: TPN, replete as necessary.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 28M EtOH abuse, weakness, fatigue, UGIB c/b
   hematemesis / melena. Has developed massive fluid requirement,
   hypotension, ARDS in the setting of severe pancreatitis, alcoholic
   hepatitis and borderline renal function. Creatinine up o/n, as is WBC.
   Pan cx, started on vanco. Head CT with edema, on 23% NS for induced
   osmorx. Now febrile on [**Last Name (un) **] / vanco / flagyl. TPN started. Ongoing CVVH
   / EEG.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.6 BP 90/50 HR 98 RR 30 with sat 98 on VAC
   400x32/30 0.4 20 7.28/48/89 CVP 25 IAP 25. +TBB 57L. Sedated, min
   responsive, pupils 6 to 4B. Hyperdynamic. Bronchial BS B. RRR s1s2.
   Distended, minimal bowel sounds. Massive edema. Labs notable for WBC
   44K, HCT 29, K+ 4.2, Cr 3.9, lactate 1.6, INR 1.6. CXR with worsening
   ARDS R>L.
   Agree with plan to continue hypertonic (23%) saline q6h with frequent
   monitoring of osm and sodium for early edema - appreciate nsurg and
   neuro input; will attempt CT if CVVH goes down. Goal osm is 320-330,
   will add mannitol if he fails to have osm >320 by this PM. Will also
   continue fluid removal and keppra, early read of EEG without seizures.
   Will manage ARDS with low volume ventilation (400x30); will continue to
   wean PEEP as long as FiO2 <0.5 and PaO2>60. Given falling vent
   requirement, will work hard to get sedation down over the next day
   his volume of distribution is huge and he will autotaper on both benzos
   and narcotics. For [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hold on further fluids and run -200cc/h
   as long as pressor requirement is stable. [**Month (only) 8**] have evolving sepsis
   based upon WBC and fever - continue triple abx and max supportive care
   while following cultures and consulting ID. Will treat sinusitis and
   follow eos - will transition [**Last Name (un) **] to zosyn for possible drug reaction
   if they remain elevated. ARF is progressive and UOP down, continue
   CVVH; will dose vanco to level. Pancreatitis likely due to EtOH, NPO,
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] following. Can't use gut for now; continue TPN with heparin, PPI,
   insulin as needed. Alcoholic hepatitis is stable, though bili is up
   somewhat. UGIB from Dieulafois lesion at GEJ appears stable, will
   monitor serial HCT and continue PPI IV. Above d/w family in detail at
   family mtg. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Neuro: Patient with dilated pupils on high dose fentaynl gtt.  CTH
   demonstrated loss of grey white differentiation with questionable
   effacement and possible seizure activity. Neuro and neurosurg consulted
   and patient received ativan, keppra load, and hypertonic saline of
   hyponatremia.  Patient converted to 23% saline boluses with improvement
   in serum sodium and osmolility.
   - Per neuro, keppra IV maintenance dose
   - Continue 23% hypertonic saline boluses Q3H with regular serum sodium
   checks.
   - f/u EEG read
   - follow-up with neurology and neurosurg regarding frequency of saline
   boluses, need for repeat head CT given improving osmolality
   - Consider mannitol if serum sodium does not improve.
   - Wean sedation (starting with fentanyl) as possible.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 16 from 20 and FiO2 to 40%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 44.9 on [**2131-5-25**] but now trending down.
   Concern for CVL infection, VAP, loculated effusion, sinusitis, or
   pancreatitis complication including abscess formation.  CT chest with
   multifocal infiltrates that could represent VAP vs ARDS.  CTAP did not
   demonstrate any new pancreatic fluid collections.  On prior
   differential, had a neutrophilic predominance with 6% eosinophils but
   now with falling white count and normal eosinophil differential.  Spoke
   to nurse and confirmed that patient has not been getting saline
   flushes/afrin, suggesting improvement in leukocytosis supports
   diagnosis of c. diff with improvement on flagyl.
   - Continue empiric vancomycin, meropenem, and flagyl.  AM vanco level
   today
   - continue to follow CBC differential, if elevated would consider drug
   reaction as potential etiology to leukocytosis and likely switch
   Meropenem to zosyn.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - f/u ID reccs
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >58L. Patient
   without improvement with albumin trial, likely secondary to SIRS and
   increased vascular permeability.
   - Continue empiric antimicrobials.
   - Wean pressors as able, starting with levophed
   - Hypertonic saline as above in order to increase intravascular volume.
   - Monitor chemistries.
   - Follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient receiving hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium.
   - Hypertonic saline as above.
   - Trend chemistries.
   - Follow-up with neurosurgery recs if any.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and CVVH was
   initiated yesterday.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable.  No clear etiology at this time.
   DIC panel and HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10
   FEN: TPN, replete as necessary.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has required pressors for hemodynamic support. He has also received hypertonic saline for cerebral edema and CVVH for acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure due to the underlying condition and the need for continued ventilatory support.

2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a concern for hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central venous line infection.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). There is a risk of bleeding complications if the platelet count further decreases.

4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic hepatitis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy due to liver dysfunction. This can manifest as altered mental status or seizures.

5. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a risk of worsening renal function. Continuous renal replacement therapy"

","The patient is a 67-inch, 140 kg male with a medical history of obesity, presenting with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/57mmHg to 92/50mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 12,114 mL and output of 18,126 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of 6,012 mL. The patient's weight has increased from 113.5 kg at admission to 140 kg currently.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low albumin level, and abnormal electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium, chloride). The patient's blood cultures from [**2131-5-26**] 02:08 AM and 02:28 AM were positive.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical problems including impaired health maintenance, impaired skin integrity, hypotension (not in shock), acute hepatitis, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute pancreatitis, and acute kidney injury. 

The patient is receiving TPN with lipids, insulin for glycemic control, and various medications through arterial and multi-lumen lines. The patient also has a dialysis catheter in place. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and further deterioration of renal function."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Neuro: CTH demonstrated loss of grey white differentiation with
   questionable effacement and possible seizure activity. Neuro and
   neurosurg consulted and patient received ativan, keppra load, and
   hypertonic saline of hyponatremia.  Patient converted to 23% saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium and osmolility. Neuro exam
   improved this am.
   - Per neuro, keppra IV maintenance dose
   - Continue 23% hypertonic saline boluses Q6H with regular serum sodium
   checks. Goal Na 145-150, Osm 310-315
   - f/u EEG read
   - Consider mannitol if serum sodium does not improve.
   - Wean sedation (starting with fentanyl) as possible.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 16 from 20 and FiO2 to 40%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   # Leukocytosis: Stable. Initial concern for infection (new or
   complication of pancreatitis) but normal cx suggest that this may be
   inflammatory reaction. No eos on diff and CT without abscesses
   - Continue empiric vancomycin, meropenem, and flagyl.  AM vanco level
   today
   - Follow-up culture data
   - f/u ID reccs
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >58L. Patient
   without improvement with albumin trial, likely secondary to SIRS and
   increased vascular permeability.
   - Continue empiric antimicrobials.
   - less pressor requirement overnight, neo at 1.7 and levo at 0.02.
   - Hypertonic saline as above in order to increase intravascular volume.
   - Monitor chemistries.
   - Follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient receiving hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium.
   - Hypertonic saline as above.
   - Trend chemistries.
   - Follow-up with neurosurgery recs if any.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and CVVH was
   initiated yesterday.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable.  No clear etiology at this time.
   DIC panel and HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), and UGIB (Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding). 

The patient's current medical conditions include neurologic issues, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, increased intra-abdominal pressure, acute hepatitis, hematemesis, alcoholism, and possible thiamine deficiency. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are as follows:

1. Neurological Complications: The patient has demonstrated loss of grey-white differentiation on CT scan with possible seizure activity. There is also a need to monitor and manage the patient's serum sodium levels due to hyponatremia, and further evaluation with an EEG is recommended.

2. Respiratory Complications: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, which is compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea, and anion gap metabolic acidosis. The goal is to wean FiO2 and PEEP while maintaining adequate oxygenation.

3. Leukocytosis: Although the patient's leukocyte count is elevated, it is not clear whether this is due to infection or an inflammatory reaction. It is important to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Neuro: Patient with dilated pupils on high dose fentaynl gtt.  CTH
   demonstrated loss of grey white differentiation with questionable
   effacement and possible seizure activity. Neuro and neurosurg consulted
   and patient received ativan, keppra load, and hypertonic saline of
   hyponatremia.  Patient converted to 23% saline boluses with improvement
   in serum sodium and osmolility.
   - Per neuro, keppra IV maintenance dose
   - Continue 23% hypertonic saline boluses Q3H with regular serum sodium
   checks.
   - f/u EEG read
   - follow-up with neurology and neurosurg regarding frequency of saline
   boluses, need for repeat head CT given improving osmolality
   - Consider mannitol if serum sodium does not improve.
   - Wean sedation (starting with fentanyl) as possible.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 16 from 20 and FiO2 to 40%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 44.9 on [**2131-5-25**] but now trending down.
   Concern for CVL infection, VAP, loculated effusion, sinusitis, or
   pancreatitis complication including abscess formation.  CT chest with
   multifocal infiltrates that could represent VAP vs ARDS.  CTAP did not
   demonstrate any new pancreatic fluid collections.  On prior
   differential, had a neutrophilic predominance with 6% eosinophils but
   now with falling white count and normal eosinophil differential.  Spoke
   to nurse and confirmed that patient has not been getting saline
   flushes/afrin, suggesting improvement in leukocytosis supports
   diagnosis of c. diff with improvement on flagyl.
   - Continue empiric vancomycin, meropenem, and flagyl.  AM vanco level
   today
   - continue to follow CBC differential, if elevated would consider drug
   reaction as potential etiology to leukocytosis and likely switch
   Meropenem to zosyn.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - f/u ID reccs
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >58L. Patient
   without improvement with albumin trial, likely secondary to SIRS and
   increased vascular permeability.
   - Continue empiric antimicrobials.
   - Wean pressors as able, starting with levophed
   - Hypertonic saline as above in order to increase intravascular volume.
   - Monitor chemistries.
   - Follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs if any
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient receiving hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium.
   - Hypertonic saline as above.
   - Trend chemistries.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, who presented with weakness, fatigue, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to hematemesis and melena. He has developed massive fluid requirements, hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe pancreatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, and borderline renal function. The patient's condition is complicated by cerebral edema, shock, impaired skin integrity, and presumed pancreatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Edema: The patient is at risk for worsening cerebral edema due to severe pancreatitis and the administration of hypertonic saline. Monitoring of osmolarity and sodium levels is necessary to manage this complication effectively.
2. ARDS: The patient has developed ARDS in the setting of severe pancreatitis and requires low-volume ventilation. Weaning of PEEP and FiO2 will be important in managing this condition.
3. Shock: The patient continues to require two pressors, indicating ongoing shock. Progress has been made in weaning off fluids, but careful monitoring is required.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has large areas of skin breakdown in the lower extremities, which may lead to infection or further complications.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's presumed pancreatitis requires close monitoring and management of complications such as necrosis or pseudocyst formation.
6. Ethanol Hepatitis: The patient's alcoholic hepatitis needs to be managed with appropriate supportive care, including"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with weakness, fatigue, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) caused by hematemesis and melena. He has developed massive fluid requirements, hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe pancreatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, and borderline renal function. The patient's condition is complicated by cerebral edema, ARDS, shock, pancreatitis, ethanol hepatitis, UGIB, and impaired skin integrity. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Edema: The patient is being treated with hypertonic saline to manage cerebral edema. Frequent monitoring of serum osmolality and sodium levels is essential to prevent complications related to electrolyte imbalance.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is receiving low-volume ventilation and weaning of PEEP as tolerated. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters is necessary to ensure proper oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Shock: The patient requires two vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. Continuous monitoring of hemodynamic parameters is essential to assess the effectiveness of the pressor therapy and determine if further adjustments are needed.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient has presumed pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse. Close monitoring of pancreatic enzymes and symptoms is necessary to guide management and prevent complications such as infected pancreatic necrosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema.
   Pupils less dilated and more reactive.
   - continuing keppra and 23% hypertonic saline boluses Q3H with regular
   serum sodium checks. Goal Na 145-150, Osm 310-315
   - Consider mannitol if serum sodium does not improve
   - Wean sedation (starting with fentanyl) as possible
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 40%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   # Leukocytosis: Stable. Initial concern for infection but normal cx
   suggests that this may be inflammatory reaction. No eos on diff and CT
   without abscesses
   - dc vancomycin, meropenem, and flagyl since no infection source.
   Monitor closely
   - Follow-up culture data
   - f/u ID reccs
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >53L.
   - Continue empiric antimicrobials.
   - weaning pressors: neo is off and levo at 0.05.
   - Hypertonic saline as above in order to increase intravascular volume.
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient receiving hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium.
   - Hypertonic saline as above.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and CVVH was
   initiated yesterday.
   - CVVH per renal. UF with net neg 300cc/hr
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable.  No clear etiology at this time.
   DIC panel and HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU with multiple complications including ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including hypertonic saline boluses, antibiotics, CVVH, and blood transfusions. His current vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological Complications: The patient initially had dilated pupils and cerebral edema on CT scan. Although the pupils are now less dilated and more reactive, there is still a risk of ongoing neurological complications such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. The goal is to wean FiO2 and PEEP while maintaining adequate oxygenation. If the patient's condition worsens, mechanical ventilation may be required.
3. Infection: Despite no evidence of infection found on CXR, the patient is still receiving empiric antimicrobials due to concerns for potential infections. Close monitoring and follow-up culture data will help guide further management.
4. Sepsis/SIRS: The patient has been diagnosed with SIRS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. Ongoing"

","The patient is a 28-year-old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his multiple medical complications. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 35.9°C (96.7°F)
- Heart rate: 104 bpm
- Blood pressure: 96/55 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 31 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on 40% FiO2

He is on mechanical ventilation in assist-control mode with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 30 breaths per minute, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, and PaO2 of 210 mmHg.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that require attention:
1. Neuro: The patient initially had dilated pupils and cerebral edema on CT scan, but his pupils are now less dilated and more reactive. He is receiving 23% hypertonic saline boluses every 3 hours to manage his serum sodium levels, aiming for a goal of 145-150 mEq/L and osmolarity of 310-315 mOsm/kg. Mannitol may be considered if serum sodium does not"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch, 132 kg male with a history of admission weight of 113.5 kg. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has been receiving various medications, including norepinephrine, fentanyl, calcium gluconate (CRRT), midazolam, and potassium chloride (CRRT). His medical history is significant for hepatitis, acute toxic (including alcoholic), respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), pancreatitis, acute, and impaired health maintenance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and decreased perfusion.
2. Hypotension (Not Shock): The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating potential hypotension. This could be due to sepsis, fluid overload, or medication effects.
3. Hepatitis, Acute Toxic: The patient has a history of acute toxic hepatitis, which could be caused by medication, alcohol, or other factors. Monitoring liver function and adjusting medication accordingly is important.
4. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating acute respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
5. Pancreatitis, Acute: The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis, which requires monitoring of pancreatic enzymes and addressing underlying causes.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema.
   Pupils less dilated and more reactive.
   - continuing keppra and 23% hypertonic saline boluses Q3H with regular
   serum sodium checks. Goal Na 145-150, Osm 310-315
   - Consider mannitol if serum sodium does not improve
   - Wean sedation (starting with fentanyl) as possible
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 40%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   # Leukocytosis: Stable. Initial concern for infection but normal cx
   suggests that this may be inflammatory reaction. No eos on diff and CT
   without abscesses
   - Continue empiric vancomycin, meropenem, and flagyl.  AM vanco level
   today
   - Follow-up culture data
   - f/u ID reccs
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >53L.
   - Continue empiric antimicrobials.
   - weaning pressors: neo is off and levo at 0.05.
   - Hypertonic saline as above in order to increase intravascular volume.
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient receiving hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium.
   - Hypertonic saline as above.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and CVVH was
   initiated yesterday.
   - CVVH per renal. UF with net neg 300cc/hr
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable.  No clear etiology at this time.
   DIC panel and HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Hematemesis:  EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion. HCT stable since 2 units
   PRBC on [**5-18**].
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU for multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including respiratory failure, acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and impaired health maintenance. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, and has a history of decreased FiO2 and PEEP. He is also on norepinephrine infusion for hemodynamic support. The patient has a significant history of comorbidities and recent interventions. His vital signs are unstable, with persistent hypotension and tachycardia. Laboratory results indicate derangements in liver enzymes, electrolytes, and renal function. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
2. Hepatic Complications: Acute hepatitis can progress to fulminant hepatic failure, leading to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and decreased synthetic function.
3. Renal Complications: The deranged renal function tests suggest the possibility of acute kidney injury (AKI), which can worsen renal function and contribute to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's persistent hypotension may indicate septic shock or inadequate fluid resuscitation, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with weakness, fatigue, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to a possible Dieulafoy's lesion at the gastroesophageal junction. The patient has developed massive fluid requirements, hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe pancreatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, and borderline renal function.

The patient's current medical conditions include cerebral edema, ARDS, shock, pancreatitis, impaired skin integrity, and EtOH hepatitis. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with low volume ventilation (400 mL tidal volume at 30 breaths per minute) and is being weaned off pressors.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 103/57 mmHg to 104/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's neurological status is sedated and unresponsive, and there is evidence of improved intracranial pressure with more appropriately constricted pupils.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, potassium, bicarbonate, and liver enzymes. The patient's creatinine and blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, electrolytes, and liver function tests are also provided.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema.
   Pupils less dilated and more reactive.   Overall mental status and
   neuron exam improving.  Holding on hypertonic saline at this point.
   - Continue keppra
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Consider repeat CT
   - Neuro recs if any
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   # Leukocytosis: Stable. Initial concern for infection but normal cx
   suggests that this may be inflammatory reaction. No eos on diff and CT
   without new fluid collection.  Appreciate ID input, no antibiotic
   indication at this time. Flagyl discontinued.
   - Hold meropenem today. Plan to d/c vancomycin tomorrow.
   - Follow-up culture data
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct drop yesterday now s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion and DDAVP.  INR 1.5
   suggesting that synthetic function slowly improving. Platelets <50.
   Elevated d-dimer and low haptoglobin concerning for hemolysis, although
   less likely given persistently elevated split products in setting of
   liver failure. Smear negative for schistocytes.
   - Recheck CBCthis AM, transfuse for hct<21, plt <50.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct check
   - NGL given GIB on presentation
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >50L.
   - Continue empiric antimicrobials.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP >65
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient receiving hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium.
   - Hypertonic saline as above.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and on CVVH.
   - CVVH per renal. UF with net neg 200 cc/hr
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable.  No clear etiology at this time.
   DIC panel and HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # Wound care: Per wound care recs.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB. He is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation and has multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and tachycardia. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated lactate levels, and renal dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis and compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea, anion gap metabolic acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and ethanol withdrawal. Close monitoring and weaning of FiO2 and PEEP are necessary to maintain oxygenation.

2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, but with normal chest X-ray, suggesting an inflammatory reaction rather than an infection. No antibiotics are indicated at this time, but further follow-up culture data is needed.

3. Hemolysis: The patient has elevated d-dimer and low haptoglobin, which are concerning for hemolysis. However, the smear is negative for schistocytes, making this diagnosis less likely. Rechecking CBC and transfusing for Hct <21 and Plt <50 are recommended.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct drop yesterday now s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion and DDAVP with
   inappropriate bump.  INR 1.5, platelets <50. Elevated d-dimer and low
   haptoglobin concerning for hemolysis, although less likely given
   persistently elevated split products in setting of liver failure and
   smear negative for schistocytes.
   - Recheck CBC Q6H, transfuse for hct<21, plt <50.
   - Discuss with surgery, radiology, and renal, but CTAP with PO and IV
   contrast indicated at this time to eval for hemorrhagic pancreatitis or
   ruptured hemorrhagic cyst. Will also discuss with GI regarding need for
   upper endoscopy if CT unremarkable.  Will have family discussion prior
   to CT.
   - NAC pretreatment.
   - Hold heparin in TPN.
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema.
   Pupils less dilated and more reactive.   Overall mental status and
   neuron exam improving.  - Continue keppra
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Consider repeat CTH
   - Neuro recs if any
   - Continue keppra.
   - Hold hypertonic saline.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   # Leukocytosis: Stable. Initial concern for infection but normal cx
   suggests that this may be inflammatory reaction. No eos on diff and CT
   without new fluid collection.  Appreciate ID input, no antibiotic
   indication at this time. Flagyl discontinued.
   - Hold meropenem and vancomycin.
   - Follow-up culture data
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >50L.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP >65
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient has received hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium and osm.
   - Given improvement in neuro exam, hold hypertonic saline.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and on CVVH.  CVVH
   with even TBB pending assessment of hemorrhage.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable.  No clear etiology at this time.
   DIC panel and HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # Wound care: Per wound care recs.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB. He has been experiencing hematemesis and an EGD showed a duodenal ulcer with a possible Dieulafoy's lesion. He has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion but is still anemic with an inappropriate bump. His INR is elevated at 1.5, and platelets are below 50. There are concerns for hemolysis, but it is less likely given the persistently elevated split products in the setting of liver failure and the absence of schistocytes on smear.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, with a decrease in PEEP from 20 to 12 and FiO2 from 80% to 50%. His ABG results show anion gap metabolic acidosis. He continues to require aggressive volume resuscitation with more than 50 liters of fluids.

The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH). His liver enzymes are elevated, consistent with alcoholic hepatitis. He also has acute hepatitis with fatty infiltration and no evidence of distal obstruction. There are concerns for thrombocytopenia, but no clear etiology has been identified.

The patient's mental status has improved, and his pupils are less dilated and more reactive. He is currently on"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct drop yesterday now s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion and DDAVP with
   inappropriate bump.  INR 1.5, platelets <50. Elevated d-dimer and low
   haptoglobin concerning for hemolysis, although less likely given
   persistently elevated split products in setting of liver failure and
   smear negative for schistocytes.  Concerning for ruptured cyst, less
   likely hemorrhagic pancreatitis as hemodynamics would have been
   expected to be significantly worse.
   - Recheck CBC Q6H, transfuse for hct<21, plt <50.
   - Discuss with surgery, radiology, and renal, but CTAP with PO and IV
   contrast indicated at this time to eval for hemorrhagic pancreatitis or
   ruptured hemorrhagic cyst. Will also discuss with GI regarding need for
   upper endoscopy if CT unremarkable.  Will have family discussion prior
   to CT regarding renal prognosis from contrast.
   - NAC pre and post treatment.
   - Hold heparin in TPN.
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema.
   Pupils less dilated and more reactive.   Overall mental status and
   neuron exam improving.  - Continue keppra
   - Wean sedation as possible

   - Hold hypertonic saline.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB. He presented with hematemesis and an EGD showing a duodenal vascular malformation (Duyloaf's lesion). He has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and DDAVP but still has no bowel movement. Surgery suspects a ruptured pancreatic cyst, but there will be no surgical intervention at this time. If intervention is required, it would be an interventional radiology procedure. His haptoglobin is low, mostly due to direct bilirubin, and the smear is negative for schistocytes. The patient's FiO2 was decreased to 0.5.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemolysis: The patient's elevated d-dimer and low haptoglobin are concerning for hemolysis. However, the absence of schistocytes on the smear and the presence of elevated split products suggest that this is less likely, possibly due to liver failure.
2. Ruptured Cyst: Surgery suspects a ruptured pancreatic cyst, which could lead to hemorrhagic pancreatitis. However, the patient's hemodynamics would likely be significantly worse if this were the case.
3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, but his chest X-ray is normal, suggesting that this may be an inflammatory reaction rather than an infection. No antibiotics are currently indicated, and Flag"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema.
   Pupils less dilated and more reactive.   Overall mental status and
   neuron exam improving.  Holding on hypertonic saline at this point.
   - Continue keppra
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Consider repeat CT
   - Neuro recs if any
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   # Leukocytosis: Stable. Initial concern for infection but normal cx
   suggests that this may be inflammatory reaction. No eos on diff and CT
   without new fluid collection.  Appreciate ID input, no antibiotic
   indication at this time. Flagyl discontinued.
   - Hold meropenem today. Plan to d/c vancomycin tomorrow.
   - Follow-up culture data
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct drop yesterday now s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion and DDAVP.  INR 1.5
   suggesting that synthetic function slowly improving. Platelets <50.
   Elevated d-dimer and low haptoglobin concerning for hemolysis, although
   less likely given persistently elevated split products in setting of
   liver failure. Smear negative for schistocytes.
   - Recheck CBCthis AM, transfuse for hct<21, plt <50.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct check
   - NGL given GIB on presentation
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >50L.
   - Continue empiric antimicrobials.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP >65
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient receiving hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium.
   - Hypertonic saline as above.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and on CVVH.
   - CVVH per renal. UF with net neg 200 cc/hr
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable.  No clear etiology at this time.
   DIC panel and HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # Wound care: Per wound care recs.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Neurological Complications:
   - The patient initially had dilated pupils and cerebral edema on CT scan.
   - There is a concern for neurological complications due to the cerebral edema.
   - The pupils are now less dilated and more reactive, and the mental status and neurologic examination are improving.
   - Hypertonic saline has been held for now, but it may be considered again.
   - Repeat CT scan may be necessary to assess the progress of cerebral edema.

2. Respiratory Failure:
   - The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis.
   - There is hypoxia, tachypnea, and anion gap metabolic acidosis.
   - Increased abdominal pressure and EtOH withdrawal may also contribute to respiratory failure.
   - PEEP has been decreased to 12 from 20, and FiO2 has been reduced to 50%.
   - Weaning of FiO2 and PEEP will be done carefully to maintain a goal PaO2 of 60-65%.

3. Leukocytosis:
   - The patient has leukocytosis, which was initially concerning for infection.
   - However, normal chest X-ray suggests that this may"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema.
   Pupils less dilated and more reactive.   Overall mental status and
   neuron exam improving.  Holding on hypertonic saline at this point.
   - Continue keppra
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Consider repeat CT
   - Neuro recs if any
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   # Leukocytosis: Stable. Initial concern for infection but normal cx
   suggests that this may be inflammatory reaction. No eos on diff and CT
   without new fluid collection.  Appreciate ID input, no antibiotic
   indication at this time. Flagyl discontinued.
   - Hold meropenem today. Plan to d/c vancomycin tomorrow.
   - Follow-up culture data
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct drop yesterday now s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion and DDAVP.  INR 1.5
   suggesting that synthetic function slowly improving. Platelets <50.
   Elevated d-dimer and low haptoglobin concerning for hemolysis, although
   less likely given persistently elevated split products in setting of
   liver failure. Smear negative for schistocytes.
   - Recheck CBCthis AM, transfuse for hct<21, plt <50.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct check
   - NGL given GIB on presentation
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >50L.
   - Continue empiric antimicrobials.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP >65
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient receiving hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium.
   - Hypertonic saline as above.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and CVVH was
   initiated yesterday.
   - CVVH per renal. UF with net neg 200 cc/hr
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable.  No clear etiology at this time.
   DIC panel and HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # IAP elevation: Secondary to third spacing and edema. Per surgery, not
   a good surgical candidate at this time.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10
   FEN: TPN, replete as necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with necrotizing pancreatitis, who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's current condition is stable, but there are potential medical complications that can arise. These include impaired health maintenance, impaired skin integrity, hypotension, acute hepatitis, respiratory failure, acute pancreatitis, and gastritis. The patient is receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU, including nutrition through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), glycemic control, and multiple lines for monitoring and medication administration. The patient's vital signs and lab results are within normal limits, except for elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and liver enzymes. Imaging shows no acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction, and there are stable peripancreatic fluid collections. The patient's code status is full code, and no disposition has been mentioned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Health Maintenance: The patient may have difficulty maintaining his overall health due to the severity of his condition and the need for prolonged ICU care.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient may be at risk for impaired skin integrity due to immobility, decreased perfusion, and potential pressure injuries.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but there is a potential risk for hypotension due to ongoing fluid shifts and sepsis.
4. Acute Hepatitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating potential liver"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct continues to trend down (25->24->23), now s/p 1 unit PRBC
   overnight.  CTAP with gastric pseudocyst but per d/w radiology now
   definitive explanation for hct drop. GI to re-eval this morning.
   - Trend CBC Q8H, transfuse for hct<21 or plt<50
   - Follow-up with GI regarding further diagnostic and therapeutic
   interventions
   - CVVH at even to slightly negative balance for now
   - Hemolysis labs
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema. Neuro
   exam now stable. Repeat CTH demonstrates interval improvement.
   - Continue leviteracetam
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Neuro recs if any
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   # Leukocytosis: Trendingd own. Initial concern for infection but normal
   cx suggests that this may be inflammatory reaction. No eos on diff.
   Appreciate ID input, no antibiotic indication at this time.
   Antibiotics now discontinued.
   - Trend fever curve and WBC.
   - Follow-up culture data
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >50L.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP >65
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient has received hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium and osm.
   - Given improvement in neuro exam, hold hypertonic saline.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and on CVVH.  CVVH
   with even TBB pending assessment of hemorrhage.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable.  No clear etiology at this time.
   DIC panel and HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # Wound care: Per wound care recs.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct continues to trend down (25->24->23), now s/p 1 unit PRBC
   overnight.  CTAP with gastric pseudocyst but per d/w radiology now
   definitive explanation for hct drop. GI to re-eval this morning.
   - Trend CBC Q8H, transfuse for hct<21 or plt<50
   - Follow-up with GI regarding futher diagnostic and therapeutic
   interventions
   - CVVH at even balance for now
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema. Neuro
   exam now stable. Repeat CTH demonstrates interval improvement.
   - Continue leviteracetam
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Neuro recs if any
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   # Leukocytosis: Trendingd own. Initial concern for infection but normal
   cx suggests that this may be inflammatory reaction. No eos on diff.
   Appreciate ID input, no antibiotic indication at this time.
   Antibiotics now discontinued.
   - Trend fever curve and WBC.
   - Follow-up culture data
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >50L.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP >65
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient has received hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium and osm.
   - Given improvement in neuro exam, hold hypertonic saline.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and on CVVH.  CVVH
   with even TBB pending assessment of hemorrhage.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable.  No clear etiology at this time.
   DIC panel and HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # Wound care: Per wound care recs.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is experiencing complications such as SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), and UGIB (Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and requires aggressive volume resuscitation. He has received blood transfusions and has been placed on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, but normal chest x-rays suggest that this may be an inflammatory reaction rather than an infection. However, there is a concern for infection given the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of fever.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has been on CVVH (Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration) due to acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte imbalances is necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or other causes. Monitoring of platelet levels and bleeding parameters is important.
4. Hypoxia: The patient has ARDS and requires careful management of oxygenation. Weaning of FiO2 and PEEP should be done cautiously.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has alcoholic hepatitis and may develop hepatic encephalopathy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB. The patient has received various treatments and interventions, including blood transfusion, antibiotics discontinuation, and weaning of sedation. The patient's condition is stable with improvement in the neurologic exam and interval improvement in the CT head. However, the patient continues to have pressor requirement, and there are concerns about anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the need for CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and the presence of elevated creatinine and BUN levels.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreasing, indicating anemia. This could be due to ongoing bleeding or other causes.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has low serum sodium levels, which can lead to neurological symptoms if not corrected.
5. Infection: Although the patient's current white blood cell count is trending down, there is still a risk of infection due to the presence of SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome).
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS ("

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct continues to trend down (25->24->23), now s/p 1 unit PRBC
   overnight.  CTAP with gastric pseudocyst but per d/w radiology now
   definitive explanation for hct drop. GI to re-eval this morning.
   - Trend CBC Q8H, transfuse for hct<21 or plt<50
   - Follow-up with GI regarding further diagnostic and therapeutic
   interventions
   - CVVH at even to slightly negative balance for now
   - Hemolysis labs
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema. Neuro
   exam now stable. Repeat CTH demonstrates interval improvement.
   - Continue leviteracetam
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Neuro recs if any
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawl.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   # Leukocytosis: Trendingd own. Initial concern for infection but normal
   cx suggests that this may be inflammatory reaction. No eos on diff.
   Appreciate ID input, no antibiotic indication at this time.
   antibiotics now discontinued.
   - Trend fever curve and WBC.
   - Follow-up culture data
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >50L.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP >65
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient has received hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium and osm.
   - Given improvement in neuro exam, hold hypertonic saline.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and on CVVH.  CVVH
   with even TBB pending assessment of hemorrhage.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable.  No clear etiology at this time.
   DIC panel and HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # Wound care: Per wound care recs.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10
   FEN: TPN without heparin, replete as necessary.
   PPx: IV PPI. SCD on arm, hold heparin.

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28-year-old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various medical complications. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. He has anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and neurologic impairment. The patient's condition is complex and requires careful management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. This condition is compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawal. The patient's PEEP was decreased to 12 from 20, and FiO2 was reduced to 50%. Weaning of FiO2 and PEEP should be done cautiously, with the goal of maintaining a PaO2 >60-65%. Sedation should also be weaned as tolerated.

2. Anemia: The patient's hematemesis and EGD showed a duodenal ulcer, which may be causing the anemia. However, the CTAP revealed a new pancreatic pseudocyst, but no definitive explanation for the hct drop was found. GI bleeding is a possibility, but further evaluation is needed. Trending CBC every 8 hours and transfusing for hct <21 or plt <50 is recommended. A hemolysis panel should be done to rule out DIC.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, but the cause is unclear. DIC panel and HIT PF4 antibody were negative. Trending platelet counts and transfusing for plt <10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage are advised. Close monitoring is necessary.

4. Neurologic Impairment: Initially, the patient had dilated pupils and CT showed cerebral edema. Now, the neuro exam is stable, but the patient is still sedated. Repeat CT demonstrates interval improvement. Leviteracetam should be continued, sedation should be weaned as possible, and neuro recommendations should be followed.

5. Necrotizing Pancreatitis/SIRS: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis and SIRS, both secondary to alcohol use. Pressor requirements are still present, and aggressive volume resuscitation is necessary. Weaning of pressors with a goal MAP >65 is recommended.

6. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia in the setting of decreased effective circulating volume due to SIRS and IABP. Hypertonic saline boluses have been given, but since the patient's neuro exam has improved, hypertonic saline should be held.

7. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure and is on CVVH. CVVH should be continued per renal guidelines. Chemistries should be trended regularly.

8. Wound Care: Wound care recommendations should be followed to prevent further complications related to skin breakdown.

9. Acute Hepatitis: The patient likely has alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration. RUQ ultrasound shows marked liver echogenicity but no ascites. Trending LFTs is advised.

10. Alcoholism: The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and his last drink was the night before presentation. T"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct continues to trend down (30->25->24), now s/p 3 units since [**5-29**].
   CTAP with new pancreatic pseudocyst but per d/w radiology no definitive
   explanation for hct drop.  NG lavage negative.  GI also doubts
   possibility of significant GI bleed, will not scope for now.  Also on
   differential is DIC given occasional schistocytes seen on smear.
   - Trend CBC Q8H, transfuse for hct<21 or plt<50
   - GI reccs
   - consider heme-onc consult
   - CVVH at even to slightly negative balance for now
   - Hemolysis labs
   - consider heme-onc consult
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawal.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   # Leukocytosis: WBC count trending down but again with eosinophilia on
   [**6-1**] and spiked fever in early a.m.  Has been off meropenem/vanc since
   [**5-30**] and flagyl since [**5-28**].  CT abdomen shows bowel thickening thought
   to likely represent colitis and not bowel wall edema.  Paranasal
   sinuses also opacified.
   - touch base with ID regarding restarting antibiotics
   - HD and CVL line culture
   - f/u culture data
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema. Neuro
   exam now stable. Repeat CTH demonstrates interval improvement.
   - Continue leviteracetam
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Neuro recs if any
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >50L but
   diuresing well.  Also with new pseudocyst (3 cm x 3 cm) on abdominal CT
   on [**5-30**].
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP >65
   - advance OGT and assess for post-pyloric positioning
   - trophic tube feeds once OGT post-pyloric
   - naloxone po to promote bowel motility
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient has received hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium and osm.
   - Given improvement in neuro exam, continue to hold hypertonic saline.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and on CVVH.  CVVH
   with even TBB pending assessment of hemorrhage.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable but have trended down from a
   normal count on admission.  No clear etiology at this time.  DIC panel
   with elevated FDP but normal fibrinogen.  HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # Wound care: Per wound care recs.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10
   FEN: TPN without heparin, replete as necessary.

   pt on [**6-2**] re: ?DIC.
   - hypotensive to SBP in 60s while getting CVVH, went up on pressors and
   stabilized
   - got tachypneic to 50s and we went up on fent/midaz significantly, but
   responded only marginally.  got cxr (unchanged), ekg (unchanged).
   despite high RR did not drop PCO2 significantly so got LENIs to r/o DVT
   b/c of concern for PE, neg study.  ?naloxone reaction.
   - started daptomycin and flagyl to cover for cellulitis and c. diff.
   didn't do vancomycin b/c of ?allergy in setting of eosinophilia.
   - called IP re: trach; will plan to do procedure on monday and family
   preferred not to do it today

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, and UGIB.
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct continues to trend down (30->25->24->26 with transfusion) now s/p 4
   units since [**5-29**].  CTAP with new pancreatic pseudocyst but per d/w
   radiology no definitive explanation for hct drop.  NG lavage negative.
   GI also doubts possibility of significant GI bleed, will not scope for
   now.  Also on differential is DIC given occasional schistocytes seen on
   smear.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct, transfuse for hct<21 (or Hct<25 and falling) or plt<50
   - GI reccs
   - heme-onc consult
   - CVVH for goal of -2L off per day
   - guaiac stools
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawal.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.  Was tachypneic overnight on
   [**6-1**] and sedation increased; CXR stable.  IP consulted regarding trach
   on Monday.  Discussed with family.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - continue naloxone despite some concern that may have systemic
   absorption with resultant tachypnea
   - touch base with neuro re: possible neurologic cause for tachypnea
   - f/u IP reccs regarding trach
   # Leukocytosis: WBC count trending down but again with eosinophilia on
   [**6-1**] and spiked fever in early a.m. on that day.  Has been off
   meropenem/vanc since [**5-30**] and flagyl since [**5-28**].  CT abdomen shows
   bowel thickening thought to likely represent colitis and not bowel wall
   edema.  Paranasal sinuses also opacified.   Restarted daptomycin
   (instead of vanco because of concern for drug reaction; treating
   question line infection vs cellulites) and flagyl on [**6-1**] per ID reccs.
   - continue daptomycin, flagyl per ID
   - check c. diff
   - f/u cx data (HD and CVL line culture pending)
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema. Neuro
   exam now stable. Repeat CTH demonstrates interval improvement.
   - Continue leviteracetam
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Neuro recs if any
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >50L but
   diuresing well.  Also with new pseudocyst (3 cm x 3 cm) on abdominal CT
   on [**5-30**].
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP >65
   - place Duboff for post-pyloric trophic tube feeds
   - naloxone po to promote bowel motility
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient has received hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium and osm.
   - Given improvement in neuro exam, continue to hold hypertonic saline.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and on CVVH.  CVVH
   with even TBB pending assessment of hemorrhage.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable but have trended down from a
   normal count on admission.  No clear etiology at this time.  DIC panel
   with elevated FDP but normal fibrinogen.  HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # Wound care: Per wound care recs.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10
   FEN: TPN without heparin, replete as necessary.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), and UGIB (upper gastrointestinal bleeding). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU (intensive care unit).

The patient's recent events include hypotension and the need for vasopressor support, tachypnea requiring increased sedation, and anemia with a decreasing hematocrit level. The patient has also shown signs of leukocytosis with eosinophilia and a fever. Additionally, the patient has hyponatremia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and acute hepatitis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.7°C, heart rate (HR) of 104 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 100/53 mmHg to 132/75 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient's general appearance is well-nourished but overweight/obese with anasarca. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates a pH of 7.45, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 160 mmHg.

The patient's current treatment plan includes transfusion for anemia, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) for acute renal failure, daptomycin and flagyl for infection, and weaning of sedation as tolerated. The patient's goals include improving oxygenation, weaning from mechanical ventilation, and promoting bowel motility.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of renal failure, development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and further gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS,  ARF and UGIB.
   # Tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension: [**Month (only) 8**] reflect inadequate sedation
   with resulting tachypnea, breathstacking leading to hypotension.
   Alternatively and more concerning, may suggest PE given that patient
   has only been on SCDs given recent hct drop.
   - Upper and lower extremity U/S
   - If U/S negative, will order CTA to r/o PE
   - Titrate sedation.
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct stable >24 hours s/p 4 units since [**5-29**].  CTAP with new pancreatic
   pseudocyst but per d/w radiology no definitive explanation for hct
   drop.  NG lavage negative.  GI also doubts possibility of significant
   GI bleed, defer upper endoscopy for now.  Appreciate hematology recs,
   do not feel that this is DIC.
   - CBC Q12H, transfuse for hct<21, plt<50
   - Follow-up heme and GI recs if any
   - Guaiac stools
   - Per heme, send ADAT
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawal.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.  Was tachypneic overnight on
   [**6-1**] and sedation increased; CXR stable.  IP recommending thoracic
   surgery for trach.   Naloxone held yesterday given concern over
   systemic absorption resulting in tachypnea, although unlikely given
   that patient had episode of tachypnea prior to initiating naloxone.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - Discuss with thoracic surgery
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis worse this AM to 37 from 28 with 15% eos.
   Afebrile in last 24 hours. Per ID, started on dpatomycin and flagyl for
   ? C.diff and possible cellulitis. Negative cultures and C.diff x1 with
   2^nd [**Doctor First Name **] pending.
   - Continue daptomycin, d/c flagyl.
   - Follow-up ID recs if any
   - Follow-up culture data.
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema. Neuro
   exam now stable. Repeat CTH demonstrates interval improvement.
   - Continue leviteracetam
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Neuro recs if any
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >50L but
   diuresing well.  Also with new pseudocyst (3 cm x 3 cm) on abdominal CT
   on [**5-30**].   Naloxone held  yesterday given tachypnea.  KUB unable to
   determine of OG is post-pyloric.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP >65
   - Hold off on trophic feeds for now given uncertainty of OG placement.
   Will consider dobhoff placement in AM.
    # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume
   in setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient has received hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium and osm.
   - Given improvement in neuro exam, continue to hold hypertonic saline.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and on CVVH.  CVVH
   with even TBB pending assessment of hemorrhage.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable but have trended down from a
   normal count on admission.  No clear etiology at this time.  DIC panel
   with elevated FDP but normal fibrinogen.  HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # Wound care: Per wound care recs.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, and UGIB. The patient's current condition includes tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, anemia, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, neurologic changes, necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, wound care, acute hepatitis, alcoholism, and potential thiamine deficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's recent drop in hematocrit and symptoms of tachypnea and hypotension may suggest the possibility of PE. Further evaluation with an ultrasound (U/S) and possibly a computed tomography angiography (CTA) is recommended to rule out PE.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of hematemesis, and upper endoscopy showed a duodenal ulcer, but the exact cause of the bleeding is still uncertain. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been stable for over 24 hours, and NG lavage was negative. It is suggested to continue monitoring and follow-up with hematology recommendations.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Weaning of FiO2 and PEEP should be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, and UGIB. The patient has anemia, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, neurologic issues, necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, wound care needs, acute hepatitis, alcoholism, and potential thiamine deficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient initially presented with hematemesis, and an upper endoscopy showed a duodenal ulcer, which could be the source of bleeding. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the anemia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea, increased abdominal pressure, and ethanol withdrawal. The patient's PEEP was decreased from 20 to 12, and FiO2 was reduced to 50%. The goal is to wean FiO2 and PEEP while maintaining a PaO2 >60-65%.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has worsened, with an eosinophil count of 15%. The patient is being treated with daptomycin and flagyl for possible C. difficile infection"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing respiratory failure and shock. The patient's vital signs indicate tachypnea (rapid breathing), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), hypotension (low blood pressure), and hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation support.

The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure, not ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), acute toxic hepatitis, acute pancreatitis, and cerebral edema with seizure activity. The patient is also experiencing acute kidney injury (ARF) and is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with a hold on volume removal until blood pressure stabilizes.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as abnormal liver function tests, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab abnormalities include elevated D-dimer, LDH, and amylase levels, along with decreased albumin and calcium levels.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening respiratory failure, progression of shock, development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), sepsis, and potential infections due to the patient's immunocompromised state. Additionally, the patient's acute kidney injury may progress if CVVH is not adequately managing fluid balance and renal function.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presents with respiratory failure and shock. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen. Norepinephrine and midazolam infusions are being administered. The patient has a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute pancreatitis, hepatitis, and cerebral edema. The patient is also experiencing acute kidney injury (ARF) and is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 92/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 44 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, eosinophilia, elevated liver enzymes, and renal dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary complications: Given the patient's history of ARDS and current mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of further lung damage and potential development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest ongoing shock, which may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion and potential organ dysfunction.
3. Hepatic complications: Elevated liver enzymes and history of hepatitis suggest ongoing hepatic injury or inflammation. Close monitoring of liver function is necessary.
4. Renal complications: The patient's acute kidney injury requires careful management of fluid balance and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis and severe organ dysfunction. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, midazolam, and pantoprazole. His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 92/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has increased from 113.5 kg on admission to 128 kg currently. His fluid balance shows a negative balance of -3,529 mL over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure due to sepsis. The use of mechanical ventilation is necessary to support his breathing.
2. Organ Dysfunction: Sepsis has led to severe organ dysfunction, which can include dysfunction in the kidneys, liver, heart, and other organs.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low at 92/52 mmHg, indicating hypotension. This may require further evaluation and management to maintain adequate blood pressure and perfusion.
4. Impaired Health Maintenance: The patient's ability to maintain his own health has been impaired due to severe illness and hospitalization.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to immobility and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS,  ARF and UGIB.
   # Tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension: [**Month (only) 8**] reflect inadequate sedation
   with resulting tachypnea, breathstacking leading to hypotension.
   Alternatively and more concerning, may suggest PE given that patient
   has only been on SCDs given recent hct drop.
   - Upper and lower extremity U/S
   - If U/S negative, will order CTA to r/o PE
   - Titrate sedation.
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct stable >24 hours s/p 4 units since [**5-29**].  CTAP with new pancreatic
   pseudocyst but per d/w radiology no definitive explanation for hct
   drop.  NG lavage negative.  GI also doubts possibility of significant
   GI bleed, defer upper endoscopy for now.  Appreciate hematology recs,
   do not feel that this is DIC.
   - CBC Q12H, transfuse for hct<21, plt<50
   - Follow-up heme and GI recs if any
   - Guaiac stools
   - Per heme, send ADAT
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawal.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.  Was tachypneic overnight on
   [**6-1**] and sedation increased; CXR stable.  IP recommending thoracic
   surgery for trach.   Naloxone held yesterday given concern over
   systemic absorption resulting in tachypnea, although unlikely given
   that patient had episode of tachypnea prior to initiating naloxone.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - Discuss with thoracic surgery
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis worse this AM to 37 from 28 with 15% eos.
   Afebrile in last 24 hours. Per ID, started on dpatomycin and flagyl for
   ? C.diff and possible cellulitis. Negative cultures and C.diff x1 with
   2nd [**Doctor First Name **] pending.
   - Continue daptomycin, d/c flagyl.
   - Follow-up ID recs if any
   - Follow-up culture data.
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema. Neuro
   exam now stable. Repeat CTH demonstrates interval improvement.
   - Continue leviteracetam
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Neuro recs if any
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >50L but
   diuresing well.  Also with new pseudocyst (3 cm x 3 cm) on abdominal CT
   on [**5-30**].   Naloxone held  yesterday given tachypnea.  KUB unable to
   determine of OG is post-pyloric.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP >65
   - Hold off on trophic feeds for now given uncertainty of OG placement.
   Will consider dobhoff placement in AM.
   # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient has received hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium and osm.
   - Given improvement in neuro exam, continue to hold hypertonic saline.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and on CVVH.  CVVH
   with even TBB pending assessment of hemorrhage.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS,  ARF and UGIB.
   # Question sepsis/leukocytosis:  Increasing hypotensive, tachycardic,
   and episodically febrile, with rising levophed requirement and rising
   white count.  Multiple possible sources of new infection, including
   line infection, sinusitis, pancreatitis, and cellulitis.  Hypotension
   also concerning for question PE but ruled out with negative CTA.
   Restarted daptomycin on [**6-1**] to cover for MRSA and cellulitis and
   because of concern of drug reaction to vancomycin.  Other antibiotic
   courses include Flagyl [**Date range (1) 6786**], [**Date range (1) 6787**]; Meropenem [**Date range (1) 6788**];
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6789**].  Lines include RIJ (18 days) and left HD line (10
   days).
   - continue daptomycin
   - hold off on restarting flagyl
   - f/u culture data
   - ID reccs
   - trend differential following eosinophilia closely
   - consider sinus CT and sinus drainage per ENT
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawal.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.  Was tachypneic overnight on
   [**6-1**] and sedation increased; CXR stable.  IP recommending thoracic
   surgery for trach.   Naloxone held yesterday given concern over
   systemic absorption resulting in tachypnea, although unlikely given
   that patient had episode of tachypnea prior to initiating naloxone.
   CTA neg for PE.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65, SaO2>90%
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - tracheostomy today with thoracic surgery
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct stable >24 hours s/p 4 units since [**5-29**].  CTAP with new pancreatic
   pseudocyst but per d/w radiology no definitive explanation for hct
   drop.  NG lavage negative.  GI also doubts possibility of significant
   GI bleed, defer upper endoscopy for now.  Appreciate hematology recs,
   do not feel that this is DIC.
   - CBC daily, transfuse for hct<21, plt<50
   - Follow-up heme and GI recs if any
   - Guaiac stools
   - Per heme, send ADAT
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema. Neuro
   exam now stable. Repeat CTH demonstrates interval improvement.
   - Continue leviteracetam
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Neuro recs if any
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >50L but
   diuresing well.  Also with new pseudocyst (3 cm x 3 cm) on abdominal CT
   on [**5-30**].   Naloxone held yesterday given tachypnea.  KUB unable to
   determine of OG is post-pyloric.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP >65
   - Hold off on trophic feeds for now given uncertainty of OG placement.
   Will consider dobhoff placement in AM.
   # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient has received hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium and osm.
   - Given improvement in neuro exam, continue to hold hypertonic saline.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and on CVVH.  CVVH
   with even TBB pending assessment of hemorrhage.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable but have trended down from a
   normal count on admission.  No clear etiology at this time.  DIC panel
   with elevated FDP but normal fibrinogen.  HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # Wound care: Per wound care recs.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS,  ARF and UGIB.
   # Tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension: [**Month (only) 8**] reflect inadequate sedation
   with resulting tachypnea, breathstacking leading to hypotension.
   Alternatively and more concerning, may suggest PE given that patient
   has only been on SCDs given recent hct drop.
   - Upper and lower extremity U/S
   - If U/S negative, will order CTA to r/o PE
   - Titrate sedation.
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct stable >24 hours s/p 4 units since [**5-29**].  CTAP with new pancreatic
   pseudocyst but per d/w radiology no definitive explanation for hct
   drop.  NG lavage negative.  GI also doubts possibility of significant
   GI bleed, defer upper endoscopy for now.  Appreciate hematology recs,
   do not feel that this is DIC.
   - CBC Q12H, transfuse for hct<21, plt<50
   - Follow-up heme and GI recs if any
   - Guaiac stools
   - Per heme, send ADAT
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawal.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.  Was tachypneic overnight on
   [**6-1**] and sedation increased; CXR stable.  IP recommending thoracic
   surgery for trach.   Naloxone held yesterday given concern over
   systemic absorption resulting in tachypnea, although unlikely given
   that patient had episode of tachypnea prior to initiating naloxone.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65%
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - Discuss with thoracic surgery
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis worse this AM to 37 from 28 with 15% eos.
   Afebrile in last 24 hours. Per ID, started on dpatomycin and flagyl for
   ? C.diff and possible cellulitis. Negative cultures and C.diff x1 with
   2nd [**Doctor First Name **] pending.
   - Continue daptomycin, d/c flagyl.
   - Follow-up ID recs if any
   - Follow-up culture data.
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema. Neuro
   exam now stable. Repeat CTH demonstrates interval improvement.
   - Continue leviteracetam
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Neuro recs if any
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >50L but
   diuresing well.  Also with new pseudocyst (3 cm x 3 cm) on abdominal CT
   on [**5-30**].   Naloxone held  yesterday given tachypnea.  KUB unable to
   determine of OG is post-pyloric.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP >65
   - Hold off on trophic feeds for now given uncertainty of OG placement.
   Will consider dobhoff placement in AM.
   # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient has received hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium and osm.
   - Given improvement in neuro exam, continue to hold hypertonic saline.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and on CVVH.  CVVH
   with even TBB pending assessment of hemorrhage.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable but have trended down from a
   normal count on admission.  No clear etiology at this time.  DIC panel
   with elevated FDP but normal fibrinogen.  HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # Wound care: Per wound care recs.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, and UGIB.
- He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 12.
- The patient has tachypnea and tachycardia, with a recent drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) and platelet count (Plt).
- There are concerns of possible pulmonary embolism (PE), for which upper and lower extremity ultrasound (U/S) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) may be ordered if U/S is negative.
- Anemia is suspected due to hematemesis, but further investigation is needed as CT angiography with pancreatic pseudocyst showed no definitive explanation for the Hct drop.
- The patient has respiratory failure due to ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea, and increased abdominal pressure.
- Leukocytosis with eosinophilia is present, with worsening white blood cell (WBC) count from 28 to 37.
- Neurological symptoms include dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema, but the patient's neuro exam is now stable with repeated CT demonstrating interval improvement.
- The patient continues to require pressor support, aggressive volume resuscitation, and CVVH due to acute renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS,  ARF and UGIB.
   # Question sepsis/leukocytosis:  Increasing hypotensive, tachycardic,
   and episodically febrile, with rising levophed requirement and rising
   white count.  Multiple possible sources of new infection, including
   line infection, sinusitis, pancreatitis, and cellulitis.  Hypotension
   also concerning for question PE but ruled out with negative CTA.
   Restarted daptomycin on [**6-1**] to cover for MRSA and cellulitis and
   because of concern of drug reaction to vancomycin.  Other antibiotic
   courses include Flagyl [**Date range (1) 6786**], [**Date range (1) 6787**]; Meropenem [**Date range (1) 6788**];
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6789**].  Lines include RIJ (18 days) and left HD line (10
   days).
   - continue daptomycin
   - hold off on restarting flagyl
   - f/u culture data
   - ID reccs
   - trend differential following eosinophilia closely
   - consider sinus CT and sinus drainage per ENT
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawal.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.  Was tachypneic overnight on

   CTA neg for PE.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65, SaO2>90%
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - tracheostomy later today with thoracic surgery
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct stable >24 hours s/p 4 units since [**5-29**].  CTAP with new pancreatic

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, and UGIB. He is currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient has been febrile, hypotensive, and tachycardic, with rising levophed requirement and a rising white blood cell count. There are multiple possible sources of new infection, including line infection, sinusitis, pancreatitis, and cellulitis. The patient also has a history of alcoholism, and his neurologic exam is stable.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning for ARDS, with decreased PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated. A tracheostomy has been recommended by the intensivist.

The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, with no clear etiology at this time. There is a possibility of DIC, but the hematology recommendations do not support it.

The patient has acute renal failure and is on CVVH with even TBB pending assessment of hemorrhage. His liver function tests are elevated, indicating possible alcoholic hepatitis.

The patient's wound care needs to be addressed per wound care recommendations. He requires continued antibiotic therapy and close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory values.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis/leukocytosis: The patient's increasing hypotension, tachycardia, and episodic fever suggest a possible se"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS,  ARF and UGIB.
   # Question sepsis/leukocytosis:  Increasing hypotensive, tachycardic,
   and episodically febrile, with rising levophed requirement and rising
   white count.  Multiple possible sources of new infection, including
   line infection, sinusitis, pancreatitis, and cellulitis.  Hypotension
   also concerning for question PE but ruled out with negative CTA.
   Restarted daptomycin on [**6-1**] to cover for MRSA and cellulitis and
   because of concern of drug reaction to vancomycin.  Other antibiotic
   courses include Flagyl [**Date range (1) 6786**], [**Date range (1) 6787**]; Meropenem [**Date range (1) 6788**];
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6789**].  Lines include RIJ (18 days) and left HD line (10
   days).
   - continue daptomycin
   - hold off on restarting flagyl
   - f/u culture data
   - ID reccs
   - trend differential following eosinophilia closely
   - consider sinus CT and sinus drainage per ENT
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawal.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.  Was tachypneic overnight on
   [**6-1**] and sedation increased; CXR stable.  IP recommending thoracic
   surgery for trach.   Naloxone held yesterday given concern over
   systemic absorption resulting in tachypnea, although unlikely given
   that patient had episode of tachypnea prior to initiating naloxone.
   CTA neg for PE.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65, SaO2>90%
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - tracheostomy today with thoracic surgery
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct stable >24 hours s/p 4 units since [**5-29**].  CTAP with new pancreatic
   pseudocyst but per d/w radiology no definitive explanation for hct
   drop.  NG lavage negative.  GI also doubts possibility of significant
   GI bleed, defer upper endoscopy for now.  Appreciate hematology recs,
   do not feel that this is DIC.
   - CBC daily, transfuse for hct<21, plt<50
   - Follow-up heme and GI recs if any
   - Guaiac stools
   - Per heme, send ADAT
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema. Neuro
   exam now stable. Repeat CTH demonstrates interval improvement.
   - Continue leviteracetam
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Neuro recs if any
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >50L but
   diuresing well.  Also with new pseudocyst (3 cm x 3 cm) on abdominal CT
   on [**5-30**].   Naloxone held yesterday given tachypnea.  KUB unable to
   determine of OG is post-pyloric.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP >65
   - Hold off on trophic feeds for now given uncertainty of OG placement.
   Will consider dobhoff placement in AM.
   # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient has received hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium and osm.
   - Given improvement in neuro exam, continue to hold hypertonic saline.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and on CVVH.  CVVH
   with even TBB pending assessment of hemorrhage.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable but have trended down from a
   normal count on admission.  No clear etiology at this time.  DIC panel
   with elevated FDP but normal fibrinogen.  HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   # Wound care: Per wound care recs.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10
   FEN: TPN without heparin, replete as necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6420**] is a 28 year old gentleman with alcoholic hepatitis and
   necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS,  ARF and UGIB.
   # Question sepsis/leukocytosis:  Increasing hypotensive, tachycardic,
   and episodically febrile, with rising levophed requirement and rising
   white count.  Multiple possible sources of new infection, including
   line infection, sinusitis, pancreatitis, and cellulitis.  Hypotension
   also concerning for question PE but ruled out with negative CTA.
   Restarted daptomycin on [**6-1**] to cover for MRSA and cellulitis and
   because of concern of drug reaction to vancomycin.  Other antibiotic
   courses include Flagyl [**Date range (1) 6786**], [**Date range (1) 6787**]; Meropenem [**Date range (1) 6788**];
   Vancomycin [**Date range (1) 6789**].  Lines include RIJ (18 days) and left HD line (10
   days).
   - continue daptomycin
   - f/u culture data
   - ID recs
   - trend differential following eosinophilia closely
   - consider sinus CT and sinus drainage per ENT
   - Echo today for ? endocarditis
   - will speak with renal and ID about changing hemodialysis and other
   lines.
   - CT Torso with head and sinus for ? of infectious cause.
   # Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis
   compounded by hypoxia, tachypnea in setting of anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, increased abdominal pressure, and EtOH withdrawal.  PEEP
   decreased to 12 from 20 and FiO2 to 50%.  Was tachypneic overnight on
   [**6-1**] and sedation increased; CXR stable.  IP recommending thoracic
   surgery for trach.   Naloxone held yesterday given concern over
   systemic absorption resulting in tachypnea, although unlikely given
   that patient had episode of tachypnea prior to initiating naloxone.
   CTA neg for PE.
   - Wean FiO2 and PEEP, goal PaO2>60-65, SaO2>90%
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - tracheostomy later today with thoracic surgery
   # Anemia: Initially p/w hematemesis and EGD showed diuelafoy's lesion.
   Hct stable >24 hours s/p 4 units since [**5-29**].  CTAP with new pancreatic
   pseudocyst but per d/w radiology no definitive explanation for hct
   drop.  NG lavage negative.  GI also doubts possibility of significant
   GI bleed, defer upper endoscopy for now.  Appreciate hematology recs,
   do not feel that this is DIC.
   - CBC daily, transfuse for hct<21, plt<50
   - Follow-up heme and GI recs if any
   - Guaiac stools
   # Neuro: Initially dilated pupils with CT showing cerebral edema. Neuro
   exam now stable. Repeat CTH demonstrates interval improvement.
   - Continue leviteracetam
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Neuro recs if any
   # Necrotizing pancreatitis/SIRS: Secondary to alcohol complicated by
   SIRS and ARDS. Patient continues to have pressor requirement, with neo
   +/- levo.  Aggressive volume resuscitation with [**Location 6472**] >50L but
   diuresing well.  Also with new pseudocyst (3 cm x 3 cm) on abdominal CT
   on [**5-30**].   Naloxone held yesterday given tachypnea.  KUB unable to
   determine of OG is post-pyloric.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP >65
   - Hold off on trophic feeds for now given uncertainty of OG placement.
   Will consider dobhoff placement in AM.
   # Hyponatremia: In setting of decreased effective circulating volume in
   setting of SIRS and IABP. Patient has received hypertonic saline
   boluses with improvement in serum sodium and osm.
   - Given improvement in neuro exam, continue to hold hypertonic saline.
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had HD line placed and on CVVH.  CVVH
   with even TBB pending assessment of hemorrhage.
   - CVVH per renal.
   - Trend chemistries
   #Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets stable but have trended down from a
   normal count on admission.  No clear etiology at this time.  DIC panel
   with elevated FDP but normal fibrinogen.  HIT PF4 antibody negative.
   - Trend plt, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of hemorrhage.
   - consider resend HIT antibody.
   # Wound care: Per wound care recs.
   # Acute hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis with fatty infiltration,
   and no evidence of distal obstruction.  RUQ u/s shows marked liver
   echogenicity but no ascites.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine, vb12, folate
   - Valium with CIWA > 10

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, and UGIB. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, tachycardia, and episodic fever. There are multiple possible sources of new infection, including line infection, sinusitis, pancreatitis, and cellulitis. The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with ongoing hypoxia and tachypnea despite adjustments in FiO2 and PEEP. Anemia is present, likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding, but further investigation is needed. The patient's neurologic exam has improved, but he continues to require sedation. The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis with a new pseudocyst, and his renal function is compromised. Thrombocytopenia is also present without a clear etiology. The patient's liver function tests indicate alcoholic hepatitis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Leukocytosis: The patient's increasing hypotension, tachycardia, and episodic fever suggest a possible ongoing infection. Multiple sources of infection need to be ruled out and managed accordingly.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing hypoxia and tachypnea despite adjustments in FiO2 and PEEP indicate that respiratory failure due to ARDS is still present. Continued weaning of FiO2 and PEEP should be done"

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis
   complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers and eosinophilia.
   #. Fever: New for him in the last few days. concerning for sepsis given
   increasing pressor requirement and tachycardia. Possible source is VAP
   as has had cement-like secretions from ETT. CT abd with no change but
   continued colonic thickening consistent with infection. Other source
   could be skin as extensive break down although no sign of infection
   superimposed on breakdown and on broad gram positive coverage.
   - Would add gram negative coverage ?meropenem for pseudomonal coverage
   and VAP
   -Would obtain sputum culture and consider bronch for washings/cultures
   - F/U cultures
   - Consider TEE to r/o vegetations as TTE was not a definitive study
   - Cte dapto for now
   - appreciate ID recs. [**Month (only) 8**] consider vanc po/pr for colonic thickening if
   decompensates further or has diarrhea.
   - Lines changed over wire and HD line pulled last night. All line
   cultures pending.
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis.
   PEEP at 20 currently. Cannot be trached with such a high peep according
   to thoracics so did not get trach last pm. Hypoxic on morning blood
   gas.
   - Would favor inc. FiO2 rather than peep given need to wean peep for
   trach placement but if unable to achieve good O2 sats will need to inc
   peep
   - F/U thoracic recs re: trach as has been intubated many days now
   #. Anemia: Hcts stable and no RP bleed seen on CT.
   - trend hcts
   - f/u heme recs
   - guaiac stools
   #. Eosinophilia: Likely drug reaction (to vanc?) with less likely
   etiology being infection.
   - appreciate heme recs
   - Will [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] stim this am to r/o adrenal insufficiency as cause of
   eosinophilia
   - cte dapto instead of vanc for treatment of GPCs in blood
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Appreciate heme recs. Do not feel this is DIC.
   - Restarted heparin at low dose for dvt ppx
   - Monitor platelets daily and transfuse for plt <10 or <50 if signs of
   bleed
   #. Acute renal Failure:
    - Patient taking CVVH holiday as HD line had to be pulled in setting
   of fever and sepsis so creatinine slowly rising
   - f/u renal recs re:replacing HD line and starting CVVH
   #. Hyperkalemia: Likely in setting of ARF after stopping CVVH.
   - Will give kayexalate
   - Will follow up renal recs re: restarting HD

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient is currently in the ICU due to complications including ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), ARF (Acute Renal Failure), UGIB (Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding), and fevers with eosinophilia.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been experiencing fevers, tachycardia, and increasing pressor requirements. There is concern for sepsis, possibly due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as the patient has had cement-like secretions from the endotracheal tube. The source of infection could also be the skin, given the extensive breakdown. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but considering the presence of colonic thickening on the CT abdomen, additional gram-negative coverage with meropenem may be necessary.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. The current PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure) is at 20, but it needs to be carefully managed. Increasing FiO2 (Fraction of Inspired Oxygen) rather than PEEP may be favored initially. However, if good oxygen saturation cannot be achieved, PEEP may need to be increased. Tracheostomy"

   meatus but did not think draining it would help and did not think
   fevers and eosinophilia from this.
   - CT Abdomen grossly unchanged from prior with thickening of the cecum
   consistent with infection, necrotizing pancreatitis, no abscess
   - Heme recommended Heparin 5000 [**Hospital1 **] and [**Last Name (un) **] stim for am because
   adrenal insufficiency can cause eosinophilia

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers with eosinophilia. He has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with increasing pressor requirements and tachycardia. He has developed a fever, and there is a concern for sepsis. The source of infection could be ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to cement-like secretions from the endotracheal tube. Other potential sources include skin breakdown or colonic thickening seen on CT abdomen. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils, elevated liver enzymes, and kidney dysfunction. He also has thrombocytopenia and eosinophilia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, tachycardia, and increasing pressor requirements, suggest sepsis. The source of infection could be VAP, skin breakdown, or colonic thickening.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Cement-like secretions from the ETT may indicate an infection, which could lead to VAP.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis
   complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers and eosinophilia.
   #. Fever: New for him in the last few days. concerning for sepsis given
   increasing pressor requirement and tachycardia. Possible source is VAP
   as has had cement-like secretions from ETT and increasing O2
   requirement necessitating increasing his peep. Started on aztreonam
   this morning for extended GN coverage. CT abd with no change but
   continued colonic thickening consistent with infection. Other source
   could be skin as extensive break down although no sign of infection
   superimposed on breakdown and on broad gram positive coverage.
   - Cte broad spectrum gram negative coverage with aztreonam for
   pseudomonal coverage and VAP
   -Would obtain bronch for washings/cultures as unable to culture
   secretions from ETT because too thick
   - F/U cultures
   - Consider TEE to r/o vegetations as TTE was not a definitive study if
   bronch negative or continues to spike through dapto/aztreonam
   - Cte dapto for now
   - appreciate ID recs. [**Month (only) 8**] consider vanc po/pr for colonic thickening if
   decompensates further or has diarrhea but for now has other source of
   fevers and Abd CT unchanged so will hold further abx treatment.
   - Lines changed over wire and HD line pulled last night. All line
   cultures pending.
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis.
   PEEP at 20 currently. Cannot be trached with such a high peep according
   to thoracics so did not get trach last pm. Hypoxic on morning blood
   gas.
   - Would favor inc. FiO2 rather than peep given need to wean peep for
   trach placement but if unable to achieve good O2 sats will need to inc
   peep
   - F/U thoracic recs re: trach as has been intubated many days now
   #. Anemia: Hcts stable and no RP bleed seen on CT.
   - trend hcts
   - f/u heme recs
   - guaiac stools
   #. Eosinophilia: Likely drug reaction (to vanc?) with less likely
   etiology being infection.
   - appreciate heme recs
   - Will [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] stim this am to r/o adrenal insufficiency as cause of
   eosinophilia
   - cte dapto instead of vanc for treatment of GPCs in blood
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Appreciate heme recs. Do not feel this is DIC.
   - Restarted heparin at low dose for dvt ppx
   - Monitor platelets daily and transfuse for plt <10 or <50 if signs of
   bleed
   #. Acute renal Failure:
    - Patient taking CVVH holiday as HD line had to be pulled in setting
   of fever and sepsis so creatinine slowly rising
   - f/u renal recs re:replacing HD line and starting CVVH
   #. Hyperkalemia: Likely in setting of ARF after stopping CVVH.
   - Will give kayexalate
   - Will follow up renal recs re: restarting HD
   #. Wounds: Wound care suggested dermatology consult for non-healing
   wounds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis.
- He is currently in the ICU with multiple complications including ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), ARF (Acute Renal Failure), UGIB (Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding), and fevers with eosinophilia.
- The patient has been intubated for several days and is experiencing cement-like secretions from the endotracheal tube, raising concerns for Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP).
- He has a thickened colon on CT abdomen, indicating possible infection.
- The patient has extensive skin breakdown with weeping wounds but no signs of infection.
- His labs show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and signs of kidney dysfunction.
- The patient's vital signs are unstable with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and increasing pressor requirement suggest sepsis, possibly due to VAP or another source of infection.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The presence of cement-like secretions from the ETT, increasing oxygen requirement, and inadequate ventilation may indicate VAP.
3. Abdominal Infection: The thickening of the colon on CT"

   #. Fever: New for him in the last few days. concerning for sepsis given
   increasing pressor requirement and tachycardia. Possible source is VAP
   as has had cement-like secretions from ETT and increasing O2
   requirement necessitating increasing his peep. Started on aztreonam
   this morning for extended GN coverage. CT abd with no change but
   continued colonic thickening consistent with infection. Other source
   could be skin as extensive break down although no sign of infection
   superimposed on breakdown and on broad gram positive coverage.
   - Cte broad spectrum gram negative coverage with aztreonam for
   pseudomonal coverage and dapto for MRSA for presumed VAP
   -Would obtain bronch for washings/cultures as unable to culture
   secretions from ETT because too thick
   - F/U cultures
   - Consider TEE to r/o vegetations as TTE was not a definitive study if
   bronch negative or continues to spike through dapto/aztreonam
   - appreciate ID recs. [**Month (only) 8**] consider vanc po/pr for colonic thickening if
   decompensates further or has diarrhea but for now has other source of
   fevers and Abd CT unchanged so will hold further abx treatment.
   - Lines changed over wire and HD line pulled last night. All line
   cultures pending.
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis.
   PEEP at 20 currently. Cannot be trached with such a high peep according
   to thoracics so did not get trach last pm. Hypoxic on morning blood
   gas.
   - Would favor inc. FiO2 rather than peep given need to wean peep for
   trach placement but if unable to achieve good O2 sats will need to inc
   peep
   - Hold off on trach given new hypoxia and adrenal insufficiency.
   #. Anemia: Hcts stable and no RP bleed seen on CT.
   - trend hcts
   - f/u heme recs
   - guaiac stools
   #. Eosinophilia: Likely drug reaction (to vanc?) with less likely
   etiology being infection.
   - appreciate heme recs
   - [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim positive for adrenal insufficiency. Will treat with
   steroids and hold off on trach as above. Cte to follow eosinophilia to
   see if improves with steroids.
   - cte dapto instead of vanc for treatment of GPCs in blood and
   aztreonam instead of meropenem for GNegs
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Appreciate heme recs. Do not feel this is DIC.
   - Restarted heparin at low dose for dvt ppx
   - Monitor platelets daily and transfuse for plt <10 or <50 if signs of
   bleed
   #. Acute renal Failure:
    - Patient taking CVVH holiday as HD line had to be pulled in setting
   of fever and sepsis so creatinine slowly rising
   - Renal would like HD line placed by IR likely early tomorrow am
   #. Hyperkalemia: Likely in setting of ARF after stopping CVVH.
   - Will follow up renal recs re: restarting HD
   #. Wounds: Wound care suggested dermatology consult for non-healing
   wounds. Will call today.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers with eosinophilia. The patient has been experiencing increasing pressor requirements, tachycardia, and fever, which are concerning for sepsis. There is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as the patient has cement-like secretions from the endotracheal tube and an increasing oxygen requirement. The patient's abdominal CT shows no change, but there is continued colonic thickening consistent with infection. Other potential sources of infection include skin breakdown with extensive wounds, but no signs of infection superimposed on the breakdown.

The patient's respiratory status has worsened, and he is experiencing ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient's PEEP is currently set at 20, and tracheostomy placement is being delayed due to high PEEP levels. The patient's blood gas analysis shows hypoxia.

The patient has anemia with stable hematocrit levels and no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding on the CT scan. Eosinophilia is likely due to a drug reaction, possibly from vancomycin, rather than an infection. Thrombocytopenia is present, but it does not appear to be disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's renal function has declined, and he is currently"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), acute renal failure, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and fever with eosinophilia. He has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which may be due to his underlying conditions or complications such as sepsis or ARDS. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, including dialysis if necessary, will be important.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures suggest the presence of a systemic infection. It is crucial to identify the causative organism and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy promptly to prevent further complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS is a serious complication that can lead to respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters, along with adjustments in ventilator settings as needed, will be necessary to maintain adequate gas exchange.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has extensive wounds with breakdown, which increases the risk of infection. Proper wound care and potential consultation with a dermatologist may be required to promote healing and prevent further complications.
5. Hepatitis: The patient's history of alcoholic hepatitis should be considered, and liver function tests should be monitored closely"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output.

2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, as evidenced by fever, elevated white blood cell count, and signs of infection.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to prolonged bed rest or pressure ulcers.

4. Hepatitis: The patient may have acute toxic hepatitis, indicated by elevated liver enzymes and abnormal liver function tests.

5. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

6. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has electrolyte imbalances, including hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) and hypocalcemia (low calcium levels).

7. Cardiac Issues: The patient had ST elevations on EKG, which could indicate myocardial infarction. However, further evaluation by a cardiologist suggested metabolic changes rather than cardiac issues.

8. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, indicated by low bicarbonate levels and high lactate levels.

9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding.

10. Coagulopathy: The patient has prolonged prothrom"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch tall, 134 kg male with a medical history of renal failure, sepsis, impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.0 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 107/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's recent events include a bronchoscopy, EKGs, dialysis catheter placement, and administration of various antibiotics. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, lactate, and liver enzymes, along with low levels of hemoglobin, platelets, albumin, and potassium. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with an elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide and low bicarbonate level. The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, distended abdomen, edematous extremities with weeping wounds, and crackles bilaterally in the anterior lung fields.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated temperature, heart rate, and white blood cell count suggest a possible ongoing infection or sepsis. Prompt management of sepsis is crucial to prevent further organ dysfunction and mortality."

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis
   complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers and eosinophilia.
   #. Fever: Bronchoscopy [**2131-6-6**] without signs of pneumonia.  GPCs growing
   in peripheral blood cx and dapto was changed to linezolid given concern
   for VRE. He is also on aztreonam for extended GN coverage. CT abd with
   no change but continued colonic thickening consistent with infection.
   Other source could be skin as extensive break down although no sign of
   infection superimposed on breakdown and on broad gram positive
   coverage.
   - Cte broad spectrum  antibiotic  coverage with aztreonam and linezolid
   for MRSA and VRE for bacteremia
   - F/U cultures
   - Consider TEE to r/o vegetations as TTE was not a definitive study and
   now with GPC in blood cx.
   - appreciate ID recs. Added Vanc PO/PR empirically per ID recs given
   increasing leukocytosis and colon inflammation on CT. Will start
   anti-fungal today empirically as bowel wall may be compromised.
   - New IJ placed for emergent CVVH
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis.
   PEEP at 15 currently. Cannot be trached with such a high peep according
   to thoracics so did not get trach yet. Hypoxia slightly better today
   and able to wean down FiO2 after volume taken off with CVVH
   - Hold off on trach given elevated PEEP (goal PEEP
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - Will continue steroids Iv X 5 days (day 2) then change to prednisone
   to taper
   #. Anemia: Hcts stable and no RP bleed seen on CT.
   - trend hcts
   - f/u heme recs
   - guaiac stools
   #. Eosinophilia: Likely drug reaction (to vanc, ppi or dapto?) with
   parasitic or fungal infection also possible etiologies.
   - [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim positive for adrenal insufficiency. Cte steroids.
   - cte linezolid for GPCs in blood and aztreonam GNegs
   - Start fungal coverage as above
   - once has doboff will stop ppi and start sucralfate instead
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Appreciate heme recs. Do not feel this is DIC.
   - Monitor platelets daily and transfuse for plt <10 or <50 if signs of
   bleed
   #. Acute renal Failure:
    - Restarted CVVH for hyperkalemia
   #. Hyperkalemia: Likely in setting of ARF after stopping CVVH.
   - Restarted CVVH for hyperkalemia with ECG changes
   #. Wounds: Wound care suggested dermatology consult for non-healing
   wounds. Derm to staff today.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note are:

1. Infection: The patient has a fever and eosinophilia, indicating a possible infection. He is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics for MRSA and VRE bacteremia, and an anti-fungal treatment has been started empirically due to the compromised bowel wall.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 15 cmH2O. Tracheostomy has not been performed yet due to the high PEEP requirement.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient may have adrenal insufficiency, as indicated by hypotension improving with steroids and improving eosinophilia. Steroids have been prescribed for a 5-day course, followed by a tapering dose of prednisone.

4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, and no blood loss has been seen on the CT scan. Further evaluation by a hematologist is recommended.

5. Eosinophilia: The cause of the eosinophilia is unclear, but it could be due to a drug reaction (to vancomycin, PPI, or dapto), parasitic or fungal infection."

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers, and eosinophilia. The patient has multiple medical complications including renal failure, sepsis, impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, antifungal therapy, and supportive care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. PEEP at 15 is currently being used, and the patient may require tracheostomy for long-term ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. There is a concern for bacteremia, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has extensive breakdown and weeping wounds on the legs. There is a concern for possible infection, and a dermatology consult has been requested.
4. Acute Toxic Hepatitis: The patient has alcoholic hepatitis, but there is also evidence of acute toxic hepatitis. Liver function tests show elevated AST and ALT levels.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) likely secondary to sepsis and hypoperfusion. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has been initiated.

The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving various medications and treatments, including CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), methadone, micafungin, and flagyl. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 65-88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of potassium, creatinine, and liver enzymes, as well as low albumin and fibrinogen levels. The patient's blood cultures have shown positive results for multiple organisms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and dependence on CVVH indicate acute renal failure. This condition can progress to end-stage renal disease if not treated appropriately.

2. Severe Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection, which may lead to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's history of ulcers on the legs and the presence of edema indicate impaired skin"

   Assessment and Plan
   28yo M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis
   complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers and eosinophilia.
   #. Fever:  GPCs growing in peripheral blood are coag negative staph.
   Consider d/c linezolid today.
   - Cte aztreonam for extended GN coverage. CT abd with no change but
   continued colonic thickening consistent with infection.
   - F/U derm biopsy results to see if skin infection already on broad
   spectrum antibiotic coverage inc. skin flora coverage
   - Cte broad spectrum  antibiotic  coverage with aztreonam and linezolid
   for MRSA and VRE for bacteremia
   - F/U cultures
   - Consider TEE to r/o vegetations as TTE was not a definitive study.
   - appreciate ID recs. Added Vanc PO/PR empirically per ID recs given
   increasing leukocytosis and colon inflammation on CT.
   - Cte anti-fungal as potential bowel compromise
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis.
   - Oxygenating well on 10 of PEEP. Goal is to wean down peep so can get
   trach placement as has been intubated many days.
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - Will continue steroids Iv X 5 days (day 3) then change to prednisone
   to taper
   #. Anemia: Hct lower this am. No clear source of bleeding except from
   NGT where had old blood suctioned up last pm. ?small bleed from doboff
   placement
   - trend hcts Q6H
   - 1unit pRBCs now
   - guaiac stools and NGT aspirate
   - Check hemolysis labs
   - If not appropriate bump with blood consider scope to ensure doboff
   did not cause significant bleed
   #. Eosinophilia: Likely drug reaction (to vanc, ppi or dapto?) with
   parasitic or fungal infection also possible etiologies.
   - [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim positive for adrenal insufficiency. Cte steroids.
   - Cte fungal coverage as above
   - Stopped ppi and started sucralfate instead since has doboff now and
   PPIs can cause eosinophilia
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Appreciate heme recs. Do not feel this is DIC.
   - Monitor platelets daily and transfuse for plt <10 or <50 if signs of
   bleed
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs. Will continue CVVH
   #. Wounds: Derm biopsy pending but likely edema caused wounds

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently experiencing multiple medical complications. 

1. Hyperkalemia: The patient had hyperkalemia, which improved with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Renal recommendation is to continue CVVH.

2. Pyloric NG tube placement: The patient had a post-pyloric NG tube placed, and the oral gastric (OG) tube was discontinued. Methadone was started at 5 mg three times a day, and Carafate was started while Pantoprazole was discontinued due to potential PPI-induced eosinophilia.

3. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with coag-negative Staphylococcal bacteremia. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage has been initiated, including aztreonam and linezolid for extended gram-negative and MRSA/VRE coverage, respectively. Cultures are pending, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is being considered to rule out vegetations as the trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was inconclusive.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. Oxygenation is good on 10 cm of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The goal is to wean down"

   - Cte broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with aztreonam for extended GN
   coverage, linezolid for MRSA and VRE for bacteremia, flagyl IV, vanc
   PO/PR empirically per ID recs given increasing leukocytosis and colon
   inflammation on CT, micafungin for antifungal coverage
   - F/u cultures
   - Consider TEE to r/o vegetations as TTE was not a definitive study
   - Consent HIV
   - F/u ID recs; appreciate input
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis.
   - Oxygenating well on 10 of PEEP. Goal is to wean down peep so can get
   trach placement as has been intubated many days.
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - Will continue steroids IV X 5 days (day 3) then change to prednisone

   NGT where had old blood suctioned up last pm. ?small bleed from Doboff
   placement.
   - recheck hemolysis labs
   - trend hcts Q6H, 1unit pRBCs now, guaiac stools and NGT aspirate
   - If not appropriate bump with blood consider scope to ensure doboff
   did not cause significant bleed
   - holding ppx with PPI or sucralfate given issues of eosinophilia and
   ARF

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He has developed multiple complications including ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), ARF (Acute Renal Failure), UGIB (Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding), and fevers. The patient also has eosinophilia and an unclear source of fever. He is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for extended GN coverage, linezolid for MRSA and VRE bacteremia, flagyl IV, and micafungin for antifungal coverage. The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, and he is being weaned off PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure). He has been diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency and is receiving steroids. The patient's anemia is likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding from the NG tube or Dobutamine placement. Eosinophilia may be a drug reaction or due to parasitic/fungal infection. Thrombocytopenia may be related to linezolid use. Acute renal failure is being managed with CVVH (Continuous Venovenous Hemodialysis). Wound care is pending dermatology consultation. Methadone has been added for agitation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS may progress, leading to further respiratory compromise and difficulty we"

The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers, and eosinophilia. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for extended GN coverage, linezolid for MRSA and VRE bacteremia, flagyl IV, vanc PO/PR, and micafungin for antifungal coverage. The patient's respiratory failure is due to ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, and they are oxygenating well on 10 of PEEP. The patient has been intubated for many days, and the goal is to wean down PEEP for tracheostomy placement. The patient is also being treated for adrenal insufficiency with steroids, anemia with transfusion of 1 unit pRBCs, eosinophilia by stopping PPI, and thrombocytopenia by monitoring platelets daily and transfusing if necessary. The patient is experiencing acute renal failure and will continue with CVVH. The patient's wounds are pending dermatology evaluation, and agitation has been managed with the addition of methadone. The patient is on TPN with lipids and has multiple lines, including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, dialysis catheter, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU and presents with multiple medical complications.

1. Fever: The patient has been afebrile for more than two days, but the source of the fever is unclear. There is concern for infection, especially since the patient is now on steroids for possible adrenal insufficiency. The presence of increased bandemia today indicates a potential infection, although leukocytosis has improved. Blood/tissue/BAL cultures have been obtained, and the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics including aztreonam, linezolid, metronidazole, and micafungin.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He underwent tracheostomy placement yesterday and is now on PEEP 8. The plan is to continue weaning as tolerated.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hypotension has improved with steroids, indicating possible adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis. If confirmed, the patient will continue steroids IV for five days and then transition to oral prednisone for tapering.

4. Eosinophilia: The patient's eosinophil count is elevated. Possible etiologies include drug reaction, fungal or parasitic infection, or adrenal insufficiency. Steroids have been continued, and the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He has developed complications such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Sepsis-Induced Hypotension (SIH), Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB), and fever with eosinophilia. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for suspected extended gonococcal infection, MRSA, and bacteremia. He is also receiving antifungal coverage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count with increased bandemia suggests the possibility of an ongoing infection. Blood, tissue, and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures are pending to identify the causative organism. The presence of eosinophilia raises concerns about drug reactions, fungal or parasitic infections.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He underwent tracheostomy placement yesterday and is currently on PEEP 8. Weaning of ventilatory support should be continued as tolerated.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hypotension has improved with steroid administration, indicating possible adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels are stable since receiving one unit of packed red blood cells and one dose of DDAVP after tr"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint and 24-hour events include removal of tracheostomy sutures, decrease in PEEP, initiation of methadone, weaning of fentanyl, low hemoglobin levels, biopsy results showing mixed cells consistent with inflammatory, infectious, or reactive conditions, oozing around the tracheostomy site, uncontrolled sugars, and low calcium levels. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin, Aztreonam, Micafungin, Linezolid, and Metronidazole.

The patient is currently on various infusions including norepinephrine, midazolam, calcium gluconate (CRRT), potassium chloride (CRRT), and fentanyl. Additionally, the patient is receiving other medications such as Carafate and heparin sodium.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. The flow sheet data shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation within normal limits. The patient has a central venous pressure of 13 mmHg, with a total input and output balance showing a negative fluid balance of 1,391 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube with assist-control ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 400 mL,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, who has developed multiple complications including ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), ARF (Acute Renal Failure), UGIB (Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding), fevers, and eosinophilia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal coverage. He is also on steroids for suspected adrenal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has increased bandemia and colon inflammation on CT, indicating a possible bacteremia. He is already on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, including aztreonam, linezolid, metronidazole, and micafungin. It is important to monitor his WBC count and temperature curve, as well as follow up with cultures.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He underwent tracheostomy placement yesterday and is currently on PEEP 8. Weaning from mechanical ventilation should be continued as tolerated, and pressure support should be tried today.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hypotension is improving with steroids, suggesting possible adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation of adrenal function is necessary, and steroids should be continued for "

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers, and eosinophilia. He is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications including renal failure, sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for extended GN coverage, MRSA, VRE bacteremia, and fungal infection. There is concern for ongoing infection, as indicated by increased bandemia and leukocytosis. Cultures and ID recommendations should be followed to guide further management.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He is on mechanical ventilation with PEEP 8 and tracheostomy placement. Weaning of ventilatory support should be continued as tolerated.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hypotension has improved with steroids, but the cause of adrenal insufficiency needs further clarification. Steroids should be continued IV for five days and then changed to oral prednisone for tapering.

4. Eosinophilia: The cause of eosinophilia is unclear. Possible etiologies include drug reactions (e.g., PPI), adrenal insufficiency, fungal or parasitic infections. Steroids should be continued, and fungal coverage should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently experiencing multiple medical complications including acute respiratory failure (ARDS), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and impaired skin integrity. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for suspected infections. His condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory support, fluid management, and careful monitoring of various lab parameters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis is already present. Continuous monitoring and weaning of ventilatory support will be crucial.
2. Sepsis: With severe sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction, the patient is at risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring of vital signs, lab parameters, and ongoing infection control measures are essential.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function needs close monitoring, and CVVH has shown improvement in creatinine levels. Volume depletion management should be done cautiously.
4. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The presence of oozing from the tracheostomy site and blood in the NG tube aspirate indicates ongoing bleeding risk. Continued monitoring of hemodynamic stability and appropriate blood product transfusion as needed are important.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has ulcers/lesions on his legs with bandages and o"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and acute respiratory failure not associated with ARDS.

24-hour events:
- Added heparin and famotidine to total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
- Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage was maintained, considering a possible platelet issue. Eosinophilia was likely due to vancomycin or meropenem. Hematology consultation was considered for the left shift.
- Hematocrit (Hct) was stable in the evening.
- Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was pulling off 200 cc/hour.
- Blood was oozing from the tracheostomy site, so desmopressin (DDAVP) was given once. Hct remained stable.

Medications:
- Fentanyl infusion at 150 mcg/hour
- Potassium chloride (KCl) in continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) at 3 mEq./hour
- Midazolam (Versed) infusion at 12 mg/hour
- Calcium gluconate in CRRT at 2 grams/hour
- Carafate (sucralfate) was given on 06/09/2131 at 10:20 AM

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), acute renal failure (ARF), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and fevers with eosinophilia. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a tracheostomy tube in place. He has multiple comorbidities including impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage has been initiated, including aztreonam for extended gram-negative coverage, linezolid for MRSA and VRE bacteremia, flagyl IV for anaerobic coverage, and micafungin for antifungal coverage. Cultures are pending.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient may have adrenal insufficiency, as evidenced by hypotension and improvement with steroid administration. Further evaluation is needed, including [Last Name (un)] stim test.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely due to linezolid use. Monitoring of platelets is recommended, and transfusion should be considered if platelet count is <10 or <50 with signs of bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, who has developed multiple complications including severe sepsis, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), renal failure, impaired skin integrity, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has shown signs of infection, including fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage has been initiated based on ID recommendations. Cultures are pending, and further evaluation is needed to identify the source of infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. Efforts are being made to wean off mechanical ventilation as tolerated. Fentanyl weaning should also be considered.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hypotension improved with steroid administration, suggesting possible adrenal insufficiency. Steroids will be continued for five days, followed by a tapering dose of prednisone.

4. Eosinophilia: The patient's eosinophilia could be due to drug reaction or infection. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the exact cause.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, but there is ongoing blood loss at the tracheostomy site. Monitoring hemolysis labs, hct trends, and stool and NGT aspirates is important."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multi-organ failure, sepsis, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

24-hour events:
- The patient tolerated continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with good diuresis.
- The infectious disease team recommended continuing with Flagyl, Linezolid, Aztreonam, and Micafungin. They also suggested considering a hematology re-consult for persistently altered differential despite a long course of antibiotics and questioning hemophagocytic syndrome. If there is clinical deterioration, they advised adding Cipro. They also suggested considering changing Linezolid to Dapto if there is worsening tracheostomy site infection.
- Renal consultation recommended continuing CVVH with ultrafiltration of 100 cc/hr as the patient tolerates it.
- The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has remained stable.
- In the evening, the patient became bronchospastic with some oozing at the tracheostomy site. The chest X-ray appeared improved, and the patient was given bronchodilators with good effect.

Allergies:
- The patient is allergic to Meropenem, which caused skin blisters.

Last dose of antibiotics:
- Metronidazole was given at [**2131-6-10**] 10:00 AM.
- Vancomycin was given at [**2131-6-10**] 04:39 PM.

- Linezolid was given at [**2131-6-10**] 10:28 PM.
- Micafungin was given at [**2131-6-11**] 12:04 AM.

Infusions:
- Norepinephrine was infused at a rate of 0.03 mcg/kg/min.
- Fentanyl (Concentrate) was infused at a rate of 100 mcg/hour.
- Midazolam (Versed) was infused at a rate of 10 mg/hour.
- Calcium gluconate (CRRT) was infused at a rate of 1.6 grams/hour.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers and eosinophilia
   #. Fever: Afebrile x>3days - source unclear. Question of fever [**2-5**]
   adrenal insufficiency; now on steroids. Concern for infection with
   increased bandemia today although leukocytosis improved.
   Blood/tissue/BAL cx NGTD, CT abd with persistent inflammation
   concerning for infection. CT sinuses w/ opacification of unclear time
   course.
   - Cte broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with aztreonam for extended GN
   coverage, linezolid for MRSA and VRE for bacteremia, flagyl IV, vanc PO
   empirically per ID recs given increasing leukocytosis and colon
   inflammation on CT, micafungin for antifungal coverage
   - Per ID, add ciprofloxacin if decompensates. Also restart vancomycin
   PR
   - F/u WBC and temp curve
   - F/u derm biopsy results to see if skin infection; already on broad
   spectrum antibiotic coverage inc. skin flora coverage
   - F/u cultures
   - F/u ID recs; question: how to [**Doctor Last Name **] down abx over next few days
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Sutures out on [**6-14**]
   - Decrease sedation (both fentanyl and versed) with goal of trying
   pressure support. Given that patient may have withdrawal from
   benzodiazepenes with weaning of midazolam, start valium standing
   (5-10mg q8 hours)
   - Cont to wean as tolerated
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - Will continue steroids IV X 5 days (day 5) then change to prednisone
   to taper
   #. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Likely related to underlying shock liver and
   ?obstructive etiology from necrotizing pancreatitis. Continue to trend.
   #. Eosinophilia:  Resolved. Adrenal insufficiency v. drug reaction
   (?PPI; vanc & dapto less likely d/t time course). Fungal and parasitic
   infection also possible etiologies.
   - [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim positive for adrenal insufficiency. Cte steroids.
   - Off PPI, vanc, dapto
   - Cte fungal coverage as above
   #. Anemia: Hct stable since 1 unit pRBC and 1 dose DDAVP s/p trach with
   some oozing at site.
   - recheck hemolysis labs
   - trend hcts Q6H, 1unit pRBCs now, guaiac stools and NGT aspirate
   - If not appropriate bump with blood consider scope to ensure doboff
   did not cause significant bleed
   - holding ppx with PPI or sucralfate given issues of eosinophilia and
   ARF
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Appreciate heme recs. Do not feel this is DIC.
   - Monitor platelets daily and transfuse for plt <10 or <50 if signs of
   bleed
   - monitor daily
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs. Cr improved on CVVH. Off
   sucralfate due to concern for electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Cte volume depletion with CVVH as long as pressor requirement does
   not increase
   #. Wounds: Derm biopsy pending - inflammatory, infectious, or reactive.
   F/u recs.
   #. Agitation: Cont methadone given decreased sensitivity to fentanyl;
   titrate prn
   #. Glucose intolerance: In setting of steroids; adjust ISS prn. As
   blood glucose continues to run high, will increase insulin included in
   TPN.

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), acute renal failure (ARF), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and fevers with eosinophilia. 

The patient's recent events include tolerating continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) with good diuresis, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, and being considered for hematology re-consult due to persistently altered differential despite a long course of antibiotics. 

The patient has shown bronchospasm in the evening with some oozing at the tracheostomy site, but responded well to bronchodilators. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and respiratory failure. 

The patient's assessment and plan include renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and respiratory failure. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profiles. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 63-93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature within normal limits.

1. Renal failure: The patient has a history of renal failure, which may be exacerbated by the current conditions such as sepsis and impaired skin integrity leading to renal hypoperfusion.

2. Severe sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension (blood pressure of 92/49 mmHg) and tachycardia (heart rate of 104 bpm), suggesting systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The presence of crackles bilaterally in the lungs and oozing at the tracheostomy site suggest possible infection, potentially contributing to sepsis.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has wounds on the legs with bandages and an ulcer in the groin, which are indicative of impaired skin integrity. These"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications, including acute respiratory failure (ARDS), sepsis with organ dysfunction, renal failure, impaired skin integrity, hepatitis, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has undergone tracheostomy placement. He has a central line, arterial line, dialysis catheter, and has received multiple blood transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis may lead to further respiratory compromise. Weaning off sedation and attempting pressure support ventilation should be considered.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of systemic infection with leukocytosis and bandemia. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage should be continued, and source control measures should be implemented based on culture results.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and close monitoring of renal function is necessary. CVVH may be continued as long as there is no increase in pressor requirement.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, likely due to the underlying critical illness and potential infection. Close monitoring for wound healing and infection is important. A dermatology consult may be considered for further evaluation and management.
5. Hepatitis: The patient has acute toxic hepatitis, which could be related to alcohol abuse or medication use. Monitoring"

   (5-10mg q8 hours)
   - Cont to wean as tolerated
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - Will continue steroids IV X 5 days (day 5) then change to prednisone

   some oozing at site.
   - recheck hemolysis labs
   - trend hcts Q6H, 1unit pRBCs now, guaiac stools and NGT aspirate
   - If not appropriate bump with blood consider scope to ensure doboff
   did not cause significant bleed
   - holding ppx with PPI or sucralfate given issues of eosinophilia and
   ARF
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Appreciate heme recs. Do not feel this is DIC.
   - Monitor platelets daily and transfuse for plt <10 or <50 if signs of
   bleed
   - monitor daily
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs. Cr improved on CVVH. Off
   sucralfate due to concern for electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Cte volume depletion with CVVH as long as pressor requirement does

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently experiencing multiple medical complications, including acute renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and respiratory failure.

The patient's recent events include a respiratory arrest that required a bronchoscopic evaluation, concern for hemophagocytic syndrome (which was later ruled out by heme-onc), and an incident of clotting in the tracheostomy tube that required suctioning and removal of clots.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 35.4°C (95.8°F)
- Heart rate: 80 bpm
- Blood pressure: 118/68 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on supplemental oxygen

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (28.2 K/uL), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (706 IU/L), elevated liver enzymes (ALT: 97, AST: 234), and elevated bilirubin levels (Tbili: 28.7, Dbili: 41).

The patient's culture and sensitivity results show growth of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative, and Enterococcus species. The acid-fast smear was negative, and no fungal or viral agents were"

   - F/u ID recs; question: how to [**Doctor Last Name **] down abx over next few days
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - wean to 75mg IV Q8hr
   #. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Likely related to underlying shock liver and
   ?obstructive etiology from necrotizing pancreatitis. Continue to trend.
   #. Eosinophilia:  Resolved. Adrenal insufficiency v. drug reaction

   infection also possible etiologies.
   - [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim positive for adrenal insufficiency. Cte steroids.
   - Off PPI, vanc, dapto
   - Cte fungal coverage as above
   #. Anemia: Hct slowly trending downwards, likely related to slow ooze
   from trach site
   - Hct [**Hospital1 **], guaiac stools and NGT aspirate
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Appreciate heme recs. Do not feel this is DIC.
   - Monitor platelets daily and transfuse for plt <10 or <50 if signs of
   bleed
   - monitor daily
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs. Cr improved on CVVH. Off
   sucralfate due to concern for electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Cte volume depletion with CVVH as long as pressor requirement does
   not increase
   - Begin thinking about placing tunneled dialysis catheter
   #. Agitation: Cont methadone, valium
   #. Glucose intolerance: In setting of steroids; adjust ISS prn. As
   blood glucose continues to run high, will increase insulin included in
   TPN.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis who is currently in the ICU. The patient has several medical complications that require attention.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He underwent tracheostomy placement on [**2131-6-8**]. The plan is to decrease sedation and try pressure support again today. Valium will be continued to avoid benzodiazepine withdrawal, and weaning will be done as tolerated.

2. Bleeding around tracheostomy site: The patient has been given Amicar to address this issue. It is recommended to follow up with Hematology/Oncology recommendations and complete a 24-hour cycle of Amicar.

3. Infection: The patient has an unclear source of fever for more than three days. There is concern for infection with increased bandemia today, although leukocytosis has improved. Blood/tissue/BAL cultures have been sent, and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage has been initiated per Infectious Disease recommendations. This includes aztreonam for extended GN coverage, linezolid for MRSA and VRE for bacteremia, flagyl IV, vanc PO empirically, and micafungin for antifungal coverage. Ciprofloxacin will be added if the patient decompensates, and vancomycin PR will be restarted.

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, who is currently experiencing multiple medical complications. The patient's current conditions include acute renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and respiratory failure secondary to ARDS.

The patient has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, including aztreonam, linezolid, flagyl IV, vancomycin PO, and micafungin for antifungal coverage. The patient's blood and tissue cultures are pending, and the medical team is awaiting the results to guide further treatment decisions.

The patient's respiratory failure is being managed by decreasing sedation and weaning off midazolam, with the goal of trying pressure support. Valium is being administered to avoid benzodiazepine withdrawal.

Bleeding around the tracheostomy site has been observed, and Amicar has been started to manage this issue. The patient's adrenal insufficiency is being treated with steroids.

The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are also being monitored, and appropriate interventions will be taken based on the results.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems, including renal function, infection, respiratory status, and nutritional support."

   with better hemostasis around trach
   - f/u Heme/Onc recs
   - completed amicar course
   #. ID: Afebrile.. Question of fever [**2-5**] adrenal insufficiency; now on
   steroids. leukocytosis improved. Blood/tissue/BAL cx NGTD,
   - Cte broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with aztreonam for extended GN
   coverage, linezolid for MRSA and VRE for bacteremia, flagyl IV, vanc PO
   empirically per ID recs given increasing leukocytosis and colon
   inflammation on CT.
   - Per ID, add ciprofloxacin if decompensates. Also restart vancomycin
   PR
   - C diff negative, Send c diff, 2^nd sample. If negative d/c vanc po
   and flagyl
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - F/u ID recs; question: how to [**Doctor Last Name **] down abx over next few days
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - weaned on [**2131-6-12**] to 75mg IV Q8hr continue this dose X 1 more day then
   down to 50mg [**6-14**]
   #. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Likely related to underlying shock liver, TPN,
   and ?obstructive etiology from necrotizing pancreatitis. Continue to
   trend.
   #. Anemia: stable
   - Hct QD, guaiac stools and NGT aspirate
   #. Thrombocytopenia: almost resolved
   - Monitor platelets daily and transfuse for plt <10 or <50 if signs of
   bleed
   - monitor daily
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs. Cr improved on CVVH. Off
   sucralfate due to concern for electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Cte volume depletion with CVVH as long as pressor requirement does
   not increase
   - Begin thinking about placing tunneled dialysis catheter

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers, and eosinophilia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. Close monitoring of respiratory status is necessary, and efforts should be made to wean off mechanical ventilation as tolerated.

2. Seizures: The patient experienced twitching of the head and arms with deviation of eyes to the right, which was likely a seizure episode. Further evaluation with an EEG is needed to define if new foci of seizures are present. Restarting midazolam gtt may be beneficial due to suspected benzodiazepine withdrawal.

3. Bleeding around tracheostomy site: The patient had bleeding around the tracheostomy site, which was managed with Amicar. Continued monitoring for hemostasis is required.

4. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and colon inflammation on CT, indicating a possible infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage has been initiated per ID recommendations. cultures should be monitored, and adjustments to the antibiotic regimen may be necessary based on culture data.

5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient may have adrenal insufficiency, especially considering the improvement in hypotension and eosinophilia with steroids."

   Neuro saw him and agreed that these are likely seizures.  CT head
   without intracranial process.
   - Ativan 2mg MR1 if repeat seizure
   - EEG today to define if new focus of seizures

   - Hct [**Hospital1 **], guaiac stools and NGT aspirate
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Appreciate heme recs. Do not feel this is DIC.
   - Monitor platelets daily and transfuse for plt <10 or <50 if signs of
   bleed
   - monitor daily
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs. Cr improved on CVVH. Off
   sucralfate due to concern for electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Cte volume depletion with CVVH as long as pressor requirement does

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers, and eosinophilia. The patient is intubated and sedated. He has a tracheostomy in place and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 136/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's labs show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient has had several medical complications including seizures, bleeding around the tracheostomy site, suspected adrenal insufficiency, and infection. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, steroids for adrenal insufficiency, and other medications for his various conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. There is a plan to decrease PEEP today as tolerated and continue weaning off mechanical ventilation.

2. Seizures: The patient experienced twitching of the head and arms with deviation of eyes to the right, which were likely seizures. He received Ativan and Keppra, and a CT scan of the head showed no intracranial process."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of seizure activity. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has a history of acute renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and respiratory failure.

Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient experienced twitching of the orofacial and bilateral upper extremities. A CT scan of the head was recommended by the neurologist, and an early dose of Keppra was suggested. Ativan was administered IV x 2, but the movements persisted. The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 136/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated serum creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL and a decreased urine output of 162 mL in the past 24 hours. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -5,787 mL since admission.

3. Severe Sepsis: The patient is on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, micafungin, aztreonam, linezolid, and metronidazole. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 28.2 K/uL, indicating an ongoing infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to ARDS, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has been intubated and sedated, and is on mechanical ventilation. He is also receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS may continue to progress, leading to further respiratory compromise and potential need for assisted ventilation.
2. Sepsis: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, there is a risk of ongoing infection and sepsis due to the patient's immunocompromised state and presence of multiple organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to further deterioration in kidney function and potential need for dialysis.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has evidence of impaired skin integrity, including ulcers/lesions on his legs. These wounds are at risk for infection and potential complications.
5. Hepatitis: The patient's alcoholic hepatitis may continue to progress, leading to liver dysfunction and potential coagulopathy.
6. Pancreatitis: The patient's necrotizing pancreatitis may lead to further complications such as infected pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts.

   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers and eosinophilia
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Sutures out on [**6-14**]
   - Cont to wean vent with trach mask trial as tolerated
   - Decrease fentanyl, continue methadone
   # Seizures: Had increased twitching of head and arms yesterday with
   deviation of eyes to R.  Was given Ativan x 2, Keppra dose increased.
   CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital seizures
   which does not correlate with clinical symptoms. [**Month (only) 8**] actually be
   patient waking up, not seizures.
   - F/u neuro recs
   - Wean off midazolam as tolerated with low dose valium to prevent
   withdrawal; monitor vitals
   - Consider d/c drugs that may lower seizure threshold
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Patient has had continuously increasing T Bili
   and alkaline phosphatase. Has alcoholic hepatitis but also on TPN.
   Concerning for cholestasis.
   - Fractionate bilirubin
   - Stop TPN as tube feeds at goal
   - Weaning off benzos
   - Consider RUQ U/S if hyperbilirubinemia persist
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs. Cr improved on CVVH. Off
   sucralfate due to concern for electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Cte volume depletion with CVVH as long as pressor requirement does
   not increase
   - Plan for tunneled dialysis catheter today to transition to HD
   tomorrow; f/u Renal recs
   #. ID: Afebrile. Question of fever [**2-5**] adrenal insufficiency; now on
   steroids. leukocytosis improved. Blood/tissue/BAL cx NGTD,
   - Cte broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with aztreonam for extended GN
   coverage, linezolid for MRSA and VRE for bacteremia with plan to stop
   aztreonam first (Day 1=[**6-6**]. Day #9 today)
   - C diff negative X 2. D/C Flagyl and Vanc PO today.
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - Wean to 50mg Q8H today
   #. Thrombocytopenia: almost resolved
   - Monitor platelets daily and transfuse for plt <10 or <50 if signs of
   bleed
   - monitor daily
   # ?HLH: Elevated ferritin. Check quantitated ferritin to r/o HLH.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He has been diagnosed with ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers, and eosinophilia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, seizures, hyperbilirubinemia, acute renal failure, ID (infectious disease) concerns, adrenal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, and possible HLH (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid buildup in the alveoli. This can lead to respiratory distress and failure.
2. Seizures: The patient has experienced twitching and jerking movements, indicating possible seizures. If left untreated, seizures can lead to brain damage or other complications.
3. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's continuously increasing total bilirubin levels suggest cholestasis or liver dysfunction. This can be a sign of liver damage or failure.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has impaired kidney function, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Acute renal failure can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and toxin accumulation.
5. Infectious Disease (ID) Concerns: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of seizures. The patient has a history of renal failure, sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and acute toxic hepatitis. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 110/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and supportive care. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, liver enzymes, and lactate levels. The patient's renal function is being managed with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and planned transition to hemodialysis (HD) tomorrow. The patient's skin integrity is compromised, and there is evidence of extensive edema, neutrophils, eosinophils, and histiocytes on a biopsy. The patient's condition is stable, but they remain critically ill with multiple comorbidities. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has experienced seizures, and there is a potential for further episodes if anticonvulsant therapy is not effective or if the underlying cause of seizures is not adequately managed.
2. Renal failure progression: The"

   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Sutures out on [**6-14**]
   - Cont to wean PEEP as tolerated
   - continue methadone to decrease fentanyl requirement
   # Seizures: Had increased twitching of head and arms yesterday with
   deviation of eyes to R.  Was given Ativan x 2, Keppra dose increased.
   CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital seizures
   which does not correlate with clinical symptoms. [**Month (only) 8**] actually be
   patient waking up not seizures.
   - F/U neuron recs
   - Cte wean midazolam
   - Consider d/c drugs that may lower seizure threshold
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Patient has had continuously increasing T Bili
   and alkaline phosphatase. Has alcoholic hepatitis but also on TPN.
   Concerning for cholestasis.
   - Fractionate bilirubin
   - Consider RUQ US
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs. Cr improved on CVVH. Off
   sucralfate due to concern for electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Cte volume depletion with CVVH as long as pressor requirement does
   not increase
   - Plan for tunneled dialysis catheter today
   #. ID: Afebrile. Question of fever [**2-5**] adrenal insufficiency; now on
   steroids. leukocytosis improved. Blood/tissue/BAL cx NGTD,
   - Cte broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with aztreonam for extended GN
   coverage, linezolid for MRSA and VRE for bacteremia. (Day 1=[**6-6**]. Day #9
   today)
   - C diff negative X 2. D/C Flagyl and Vanc PO today.
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - Wean to 50mg Q8H today
   #. Thrombocytopenia: almost resolved

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given in the progress note are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. There are plans to continue weaning PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure) as tolerated and continue methadone to decrease fentanyl requirement.

2. Seizures: The patient had increased twitching of head and arms yesterday with deviation of eyes to the right, which was initially thought to be seizures. However, it may actually be the patient waking up. An EEG showed occipital seizures, but the clinical symptoms do not correlate with this finding. The plan is to follow up with a neurologist, wean off midazolam, and consider discontinuing drugs that may lower seizure threshold.

3. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has had continuously increasing total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. This could be due to alcoholic hepatitis or cholestasis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, including fractionating bilirubin and considering a RUQ (Right Upper Quadrant) ultrasound.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and his creatinine level improved with CVV"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of seizures. The patient has been experiencing twitching and upward gaze, indicating possible seizures. EEG showed 2 occipital seizures, but it is unclear if this correlates clinically. The patient was given 2 mg of lorazepam and the midazolam infusion was increased to 3 mg/hour, which showed good effect. The neurologist stated that the EEG findings may not be clinically significant.

The patient has a history of renal failure, sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and acute toxic hepatitis. The patient's respiratory status is stable with the use of CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 110/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (vancomycin, micafungin, aztreonam, linezolid, metronidazole), sedatives (midazolam, lorazepam), pain management (f"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of rising liver function tests, including total bilirubin and direct bilirubin. The patient was previously receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) but it has been discontinued. Midazolam infusion has been weaned off and replaced with Valium. A right-sided peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line and a hemodialysis (HD) tunneled catheter have been placed by interventional radiology (IR).

The patient's temperature has been increasing, reaching 102 degrees Fahrenheit at 8 pm. Heart rate is in the 120s, and blood pressure is in the 90s/50s. Bronchial washings show pulmonary macrophages, bronchial epithelial cells, and inflammatory cells including eosinophils. No malignant cells were found. Fever, tachycardia, and hypotension are concerning for sepsis. Cultures have been sent for blood, urine, and sputum.

The patient's respiratory status has improved as shown by a chest X-ray that revealed no edema or pneumonia. However, there is evidence of gallbladder sludge or thickening, leading to the initiation of Ciprofloxacin therapy and an order for a HIDA scan.

ABG results indicate acidosis, which has worsened in the setting of fever and tachypnea. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), ARF (acute renal failure), UGIB (upper gastrointestinal bleeding), fevers, and eosinophilia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his multiple organ dysfunction.

24-hour events include rising liver function tests, discontinuation of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), weaning off midazolam and placement on standing valium, bronchoscopic lavage showing pulmonary macrophages and inflammatory cells but no malignant cells, placement of right internal jugular central venous catheter and hemodialysis catheter, consultation with a physician for potential thrombosis, change in antibiotic therapy due to pharmacy recommendation, development of fever with tachycardia and hypotension, administration of intravenous fluids, and imaging studies.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. Tracheostomy placement was performed on [**2131-6-8**]. The plan is to continue weaning off mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy mask trials as tolerated. Fentanyl dosage should be decreased, and methadone should be continued.

2. Seizures: The patient experienced increased twitching of the head and arms with deviation of eyes to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers, and eosinophilia. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and recently developed hypotension with a fever. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, kidney dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances. He also has thrombocytopenia, which has resolved. Other findings include hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory failure, seizures, acute renal failure, adrenal insufficiency, and possible HLH (Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis). The patient is currently on various medications and interventions for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to necrotizing pancreatitis and fevers. It is crucial to monitor his response to antibiotics and repeat cultures to ensure effective treatment.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. Weaning off mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy mask trials should be done cautiously, considering his high respiratory rate.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function needs close monitoring. Transitioning to tunneled dialysis catheter and hemodialysis should be planned carefully.
4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient may require continued hydrocortisone therapy to manage potential adrenal insufficiency"

   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers and eosinophilia
   #. ID: Had been afebrile on broad coverage for severe necrotizing
   pancreatitis but spiked fever overnight with decreased BP. RUQ u/s
   concerning for sludge and pt started on cipro.  Of note, had stopped
   flagyl and vanc po yesterday as C. diff neg x 2. Blood/tissue/BAL cx
   NGTD. It is possible that previous fevers had been masked by CVVH,
   which pt did not undergo yesterday
   - Cte broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with linezolid and aztreonam
   (D1 [**6-6**]) and cipro (D1 [**6-14**])->consider d/c cipro today
   - Consider adding back flagyl for anaerobic coverage.
   - D/C CVL today if he has enough access
   - HIDA scan if bilirubin does not improve or hemodynamic instability
   over next few days
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - F/u ID recs
   - Cont steroid taper for possible adrenal insufficiency
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Patient has had continuously increasing T Bili
   and alkaline phosphatase. Has alcoholic hepatitis but also on TPN. Bili
   stable today but increased alk phos and RUQ u/s with sludge concerning
   for cholestasis.
   - Check HIDA scan if bilirubin does not improve or hemodynamically
   unstable
   - TPN stopped yesterday
   - Weaning off benzos
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Sutures out on [**6-14**]. ABG good on PS but
   transition to trach mask limited by respiratory rate.
   - Cont to wean vent with trach mask trial as tolerated
   - Increasing fentanyl patch while decreasing gtt, continue methadone
   - Attempt OOB to chair today to improve respiratory mechanics
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms. [**Month (only) 8**] actually
   be patient waking up, not seizures.
   - Repeat EEG today on higher dose keppra
   - F/u neuro recs
   - Wean off midazolam as tolerated with low dose valium to prevent
   withdrawal; monitor vitals
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs.
   - Currently euvolemic so would favor running him even today. Would
   dialyze for acidosis but likely does not need volume depletion today.
   - Plan for tunneled dialysis catheter today to transition to HD
   tomorrow; f/u Renal recs
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - Cont hydrocortisone 50mg Q8H D [**2-6**]->consider wean down to 25mg

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He has developed multiple complications, including ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), ARF (acute renal failure), UGIB (upper gastrointestinal bleeding), fevers, and eosinophilia. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage but recently spiked a fever with decreased blood pressure. An RUQ ultrasound showed gallbladder sludge, and the patient has been started on ciprofloxacin. Blood, tissue, and BAL cultures have been sent. The patient's bilirubin levels have been increasing, and he is experiencing cholestasis. He is also experiencing respiratory failure secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis and has undergone tracheostomy placement. The patient has had seizures, and an EEG showed occipital seizures. He has acute renal failure and is euvolemic, so continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) is planned today. The patient is being considered for tunneled dialysis catheter placement to transition to hemodialysis tomorrow. There are concerns about possible adrenal insufficiency, and the patient is on hydrocortisone. Elevated ferritin levels raise suspicion for HLH (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), and further evaluation is needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. ID: Febrile now for 2 days, increased WBC, with decreased BP. RUQ
   u/s concerning for sludge and pt started on cipro; changed to flagyl
   yesterday.  Of note, had stopped flagyl and vanc po [**6-14**] as C. diff neg
   x 2. Blood/tissue/BAL cx NGTD. It is possible that previous fevers had
   been masked by CVVH, which he had been held x 2 days although restarted
   today.
   - Cte broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with linezolid and aztreonam
   (D1 [**6-6**]) and flagyl (added back [**6-15**])
   - Consider HIDA scan if bilirubin does not improve or hemodynamic
   instability over next few days.
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - Cont steroid taper for possible adrenal insufficiency
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Patient has had continuously increasing T Bili
   and alkaline phosphatase. Has alcoholic hepatitis but also on TPN. Bili
   stable today but increased alk phos and RUQ u/s with sludge concerning
   for cholestasis. Note that [**2131-5-17**] U/S also showed sludge.
   - Consider asking GI input for HIDA scan v. ERCP
   - TPN stopped [**6-14**]
   - Weaning off benzos
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Sutures out on [**6-14**]. Currently on pressure
   support.
   - Cont to wean vent with trach mask trials v CPAP trials as tolerated
   - Increasing fentanyl patch while decreasing gtt, continue methadone
   - Attempt OOB to chair to improve respiratory mechanics
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. [**Month (only) 8**] actually be
   patient waking up, not seizures.
   - Continue on higher dose keppra
   - F/u neuro recs
   - Wean off midazolam as tolerated with low dose valium to prevent
   withdrawal; monitor vitals
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs.
   - Would dialyze for acidosis but likely does not need volume depletion.
   - Likely transition to HD today; f/u Renal recs
   - Aztreonam increased back to 2000mg q12h as back on CVVH
   - Will change Keppra to 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD if he
   transitions to HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - Weaned Hydrocort to 25mg Q8H today
   # ?HLH: Quantitative ferritin of 2660. Unlikely to have  HLH.
   # Eosinophilia: Resolved on steroids and s/p med changes.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. The patient has been febrile for two days, with increased white blood cell count and decreased blood pressure. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including linezolid, aztreonam, and flagyl. The patient's bilirubin levels have been increasing, and there is concern for cholestasis. He has also experienced respiratory failure secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient has had seizures, but they appear to be under control with a higher dose of keppra. He has acute renal failure and is transitioning to hemodialysis. There is a consideration for adrenal insufficiency, and the patient's eosinophilia has resolved with steroid treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's febrile state, increased WBC count, and ongoing use of broad-spectrum antibiotics suggest a high risk of infection. Possible complications may include sepsis or septic shock.

2. Cholestasis: The patient's continuously increasing total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels indicate a potential issue with bile flow. This could lead to complications such as jaundice or liver damage.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of ARDS and ongoing need for"

   #. ID: Febrile now for 2 days, increased WBC, with decreased BP. RUQ
   u/s concerning for sludge and pt started on cipro, but changed back to
   flagyl yesterday.  Of note, had stopped flagyl and vanc po [**6-14**] as C.
   diff neg x 2. Blood/tissue/BAL cx NGTD. It is possible that previous
   fevers had been masked by CVVH, which pt did not undergo yesterday
   - Cte broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with linezolid and aztreonam
   (D1 [**6-6**]) and flagyl (Added back [**6-15**]).
   - D/C CVL today if he has enough access
   - HIDA scan if bilirubin does not improve or hemodynamic instability
   over next few days
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - F/u ID recs
   - Cont steroid taper for possible adrenal insufficiency
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Patient has had continuously increasing T Bili
   and alkaline phosphatase. Has alcoholic hepatitis but also on TPN. Bili
   stable today but increased alk phos and RUQ u/s with sludge concerning
   for cholestasis.
   - Check HIDA scan if bilirubin does not improve or hemodynamically
   unstable
   - TPN stopped [**6-14**]
   - Weaning off benzos
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Sutures out on [**6-14**]. ABG good on PS but
   transition to trach mask limited by respiratory rate.
   - Cont to wean vent with trach mask trial as tolerated
   - Increasing fentanyl patch while decreasing gtt, continue methadone
   - Attempt OOB to chair today to improve respiratory mechanics
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. [**Month (only) 8**] actually be
   patient waking up, not seizures.
   - Continue on higher dose keppra
   - F/u neuro recs
   - Wean off midazolam as tolerated with low dose valium to prevent
   withdrawal; monitor vitals
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs.
   - Would dialyze for acidosis but likely does not need volume depletion.
   - Likely transition to HD today; f/u Renal recs
   - will change Keppra to 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD if he
   transitions to HD today.
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers, and eosinophilia. He has been febrile for two days, with increased white blood cell count and decreased blood pressure. He has a history of C. difficile infection, and his blood/tissue/BAL cultures are negative for any growth. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with linezolid, aztreonam, and flagyl. He is also receiving CVVH and has had a tracheostomy placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of alcoholic hepatitis, necrotizing pancreatitis, and previous C. difficile infection. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential infections. The presence of fever, increased white blood cell count, and eosinophilia raises concerns for ongoing or recurrent infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. The goal is to wean off the ventilator and transition to tracheostomy mask trials as tolerated.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to his underlying conditions. He has been on CVVH and is expected to transition to hemodialysis (HD) today. Close monitoring of renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU for sepsis with organ dysfunction. They have a history of multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired muscle performance, impaired skin integrity, and impaired cognitive function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT, which can potentially lead to PE.
3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines/catheters increase the risk of nosocomial infections such as bloodstream infections or wound infections.
4. Delirium: The patient's impaired arousal, attention, and cognition may predispose them to delirium, which can worsen overall outcomes.
5. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS): Given the presence of sepsis and organ dysfunction, the patient is at risk of developing MODS, where multiple organ systems fail.
6. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and impaired skin integrity increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has multiple medical problems, including acute renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He is also receiving dialysis and has multiple intravenous lines.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's acute respiratory failure and dependence on mechanical ventilation put him at risk for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Sepsis and Infection: The patient's history of severe sepsis indicates an increased risk of developing new infections or having existing infections worsen. Close monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment are crucial.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not properly managed. This could lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Hepatic Dysfunction: The acute toxic hepatitis could progress to fulminant hepatic failure, leading to hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
5. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient's low blood pressure (hypotension) may indicate underlying cardiovascular dysfunction. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and appropriate interventions are necessary.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's impaired arousal, attention, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been experiencing fever, and cultures have been obtained to identify the cause of the fever. The patient's renal function is compromised, and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been initiated due to low pressures. 

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including linezolid, aztreonam, and metronidazole. There is concern for acute calculus cholecystitis, but medical management is being continued for now. If the patient decompensates, a percutaneous drainage may be necessary.

The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy in place. The vital signs show an elevated temperature, low blood pressure, and a slightly elevated heart rate. The patient has jaundice, and there are ulcers/lesions on the legs with bandages.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function. The blood culture results are pending. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various organ dysfunctions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, respiratory failure, hepatic failure, renal failure, and impaired skin integrity."

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. ID: Febrile now for 2 days, increased WBC, with decreased BP. RUQ
   u/s concerning for sludge and pt started on cipro; changed to flagyl
   yesterday.  Of note, had stopped flagyl and vanc po [**6-14**] as C. diff neg
   x 2. Blood/tissue/BAL cx NGTD. It is possible that previous fevers had
   been masked by CVVH, which he had been held x 2 days although restarted
   today.
   - Cte broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with linezolid and aztreonam
   (D1 [**6-6**]) and flagyl (added back [**6-15**])
   - Consider HIDA scan if bilirubin does not improve or hemodynamic
   instability over next few days.
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - Cont steroid taper for possible adrenal insufficiency
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Patient has had continuously increasing T Bili
   and alkaline phosphatase. Has alcoholic hepatitis but also on TPN. Bili
   stable today but increased alk phos and RUQ u/s with sludge concerning
   for cholestasis. Note that [**2131-5-17**] U/S also showed sludge.
   - Consider asking GI input for HIDA scan v. ERCP
   - TPN stopped [**6-14**]
   - Weaning off benzos
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Sutures out on [**6-14**]. Currently on pressure
   support.
   - Cont to wean vent with trach mask trials v CPAP trials as tolerated
   - Increasing fentanyl patch while decreasing gtt, continue methadone
   - Attempt OOB to chair to improve respiratory mechanics
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. [**Month (only) 8**] actually be
   patient waking up, not seizures.
   - Continue on higher dose keppra
   - F/u neuro recs
   - Wean off midazolam as tolerated with low dose valium to prevent
   withdrawal; monitor vitals
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs.
   - Would dialyze for acidosis but likely does not need volume depletion.
   - Likely transition to HD today; f/u Renal recs
   - Aztreonam increased back to 2000mg q12h as back on CVVH
   - Will change Keppra to 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD if he
   transitions to HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - Weaned Hydrocort to 25mg Q8H today
   # ?HLH: Quantitative ferritin of 2660. Unlikely to have  HLH.
   # Eosinophilia: Resolved on steroids and s/p med changes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He has developed multiple complications including ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), ARF (acute renal failure), UGIB (upper gastrointestinal bleeding), and fevers. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including linezolid, aztreonam, and flagyl. He also has hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory failure, seizures, and adrenal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious Complications:
   - The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures.
   - There is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given his mechanical ventilation.
   - The presence of central lines increases the risk of bloodstream infections.

2. Renal Complications:
   - Acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
   - The patient may require ongoing dialysis support.

3. Respiratory Complications:
   - ARDS can lead to respiratory failure and potentially necessitate prolonged mechanical ventilation.
   - The patient may be susceptible to further lung infections due to impaired lung function.

4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
   - The patient has a history of UGIB, which could recur if not managed appropriately.
   - There is a risk of developing stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding due to critical illness.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU due to complications including ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), ARF (acute renal failure), UGIB (upper gastrointestinal bleeding), and fevers.

The patient has been experiencing fevers for the past two days, with a high of 101.2°F. His white blood cell count is elevated. He also has hypotension with decreased blood pressure. An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant showed sludge, and the patient has been started on Flagyl.

Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage has been initiated with linezolid and aztreonam. The possibility of a HIDA scan is being considered if bilirubin does not improve or if there is hemodynamic instability in the next few days, as a percutaneous drain may be needed. The patient's WBC count, temperature curve, and culture data are being monitored.

Steroid tapering for possible adrenal insufficiency is also being considered. Additionally, the presence of yeast in the urine has prompted a change in the Foley catheter and re-culture. If yeast persists, anti-fungal treatment will be administered.

The patient's hyperbilirubinemia is attributed to alcoholic hepatitis but may also be related to total parenteral nutrition (TPN). An abdominal ultrasound has shown sludge, raising concerns about"

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. ID: No fevers since starting CVVH. RUQ u/s concerning for sludge and
   pt started flagyl.
   - Cte broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with linezolid and aztreonam
   (D1 [**6-6**]) and flagyl (added back [**6-15**])
   - Consider HIDA scan if bilirubin does not improve or hemodynamic
   instability over next few days as may need perc. drain
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - Cont steroid taper for possible adrenal insufficiency
   - Yeast in the urine- changed foley and re-cultured. If still with
   yeast will treat with anti-fungal.
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: T Bili stable. Has alcoholic hepatitis but was
   also on TPN. Bili. RUQ u/s with sludge concerning for cholestasis. Note
   that [**2131-5-17**] U/S also showed sludge.
   - Consider asking GI input for HIDA scan v. ERCP if hemodynamic
   instability
   - TPN stopped [**6-14**]
   - Weaning off benzos
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Sutures out on [**6-14**]. Currently on trach mask
   with good abg
   - Increasing fentanyl patch while decreasing gtt, continue methadone
   - Cte oob to chair daily
   - Consider down-size trach
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements it may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue on higher dose keppra
   - F/u neuro recs
   - Wean off midazolam as tolerated with low dose valium to prevent
   withdrawal; monitor vitals
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs.
   - Would dialyze for acidosis but likely does not need volume depletion
   as pressures borderline.
   - Cte CVVH while pressures low but consider HD when more stable
   tomorrow.
   - Aztreonam increased back to 2000mg q12h as back on CVVH
   - Will change Keppra to 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD if he
   transitions to HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - Weaned Hydrocort to 25mg Q8H (Day [**1-6**])

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is fever, and he has been experiencing several significant health issues including alcoholic hepatitis, necrotizing pancreatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), acute renal failure, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and potential adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F (38.4°C), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/54 mmHg to 124/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a tracheostomy mask. The patient is sedated and unable to speak, but responds purposefully to commands.

The patient's physical examination shows jaundice, distended abdomen, edema in the extremities, ulcers/lesions on legs with bandages, and opening eyes to command. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, bilirubin levels, liver enzymes, lactate, and D-dimer. Other lab results show low albumin, potassium, and magnesium levels.

The patient's medical plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with linezolid and aztreonam, addition of flagyl for possible Clostridium difficile infection, consideration of HIDA scan if bilirubin does not improve or if hemodynamic instability occurs"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of renal failure and is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to low pressures. The patient also has sepsis with organ dysfunction, as indicated by fever and positive blood cultures. Additionally, there is concern for acute calculus cholecystitis, but medical management is being continued for now. The patient's allergies include meropenem, and they are currently receiving multiple antibiotics for infection control. The patient's vital signs show elevated temperature, low blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's impaired arousal, attention, and cognition may be due to the effects of sepsis or other underlying conditions. The impaired balance, motor function, muscle performance, and respiration/gas exchange are likely related to the patient's acute respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient also has acute renal failure, severe sepsis, impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS).

Further evaluation and management should focus on addressing these medical complications, optimizing the patient's respiratory support, managing renal function, treating the underlying infections, and monitoring for any new developments. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical status to guide appropriate interventions."

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. ID: Necrotizing pancreatitis. All abx (linezolid/aztreo D1 [**6-6**] and
   flagyl D1 [**6-15**]) discontinued yesterday as afebrile since restarting
   CVVH and appeared clinically improved. Remains afebrile but worsened
   leukocytosis today. RUQ u/s concerning for sludge since [**5-17**].
   - Restart abx coverage with aztreo and linezolid given necrotizing
   pancreatitis.
   - HIDA scan today for poss cholecystitis; if hemodynamic instability
   over next few days may need percutaneous drain
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - Cont steroid taper for possible adrenal insufficiency
   - Yeast in the urine- changed foley and re-cultured. If still with
   yeast will treat with anti-fungal.
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis but recent increase may be [**2-5**]
   TPN, now discontinued. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge concerning for
   cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s. T Bili and transaminases
   stable today.
   - HIDA scan today
   - TPN stopped [**6-14**]
   - Plan for Weaning off benzos
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Sutures out on [**6-14**]. Currently on trach mask
   with good ABG.
   - Change gtt to PRN fentanyl boluses, continue methadone with wean
   tomorrow
   - goal to chair daily
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra
   - Continue low dose valium to prevent withdrawal; Plan to wean valium
   in next few days.
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs.
   - Touch base with renal about transition to HD
   - Would dialyze for acidosis but likely does not need volume depletion
   as pressures borderline.
   - Cont CVVH while pressures low but would favor HD trial today if
   available
   - Aztreonam 2000mg q12h while on CVVH
   - Will change Keppra to 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD if he
   transitions to HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - Cont weaning hydrocort; D2/3 of 25mg Q8H today.
   # PT and OT eval for placement

   leukocytosis today. RUQ u/s concerning for sludge since [**5-17**].
   - Restart abx coverage with aztreo given necrotizing pancreatitis.
   - Consider HIDA scan of GI c/s for poss ERCP if bilirubin does not
   improve or hemodynamic instability over next few days as may need
   percutaneous drain
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - Cont steroid taper for possible adrenal insufficiency
   - Yeast in the urine- changed foley and re-cultured. If still with
   yeast will treat with anti-fungal.
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis but recent increase may be [**2-5**]
   TPN, now discontinued. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge concerning for
   cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s. T Bili and transaminases
   stable today.
   - Favoring conservative management for now given hemodynamic stability
   but consider asking GI input for HIDA scan v. ERCP if clinical
   situation changes
   - TPN stopped [**6-14**]
   - Weaning off benzos
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Sutures out on [**6-14**]. Currently on trach mask
   with good ABG.
   - Start fentanyl patch while decreasing gtt, continue methadone
   - Cont to chair daily
   - Consider down-size trach
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue on higher dose keppra
   - F/u neuro recs
   - Wean off midazolam as tolerated with low dose valium to prevent
   withdrawal; monitor vitals
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs.
   - Would dialyze for acidosis but likely does not need volume depletion
   as pressures borderline.
   - Cont CVVH while pressures low but would favor HD trial today
   - Aztreonam 2000mg q12h while on CVVH
   - Will change Keppra to 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD if he
   transitions to HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently experiencing complications such as ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions.

Medical Complications:

1. ID: Necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient's abx coverage was discontinued yesterday but restarted today due to worsening leukocytosis. RUQ u/s showed sludge, which may indicate cholestasis. Further evaluation with a HIDA scan or ERCP may be necessary if bilirubin levels do not improve or if there is hemodynamic instability.

2. Elevated LFTs: These are likely due to alcoholic hepatitis but could also be a result of recent changes in medication. Conservative management is being favored at this time, but a HIDA scan or ERCP may be considered if the clinical situation changes.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently on a trach mask with good ABG. Weaning off benzos and considering down-sizing the trach are being planned.

4. Seizures: The patient had seizures initially, but further evaluation with EEG showed no seizures. The patient is now awake and alert, so the seizure diagnosis may have been incorrect. Continuing on a higher dose of keppra is recommended.

5. Acute Renal Failure"

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 113/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy and receiving sedation and analgesia.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's fentanyl and midazolam infusions were decreased, leading to an increase in heart rate. The patient's tracheostomy tube was changed, and they tolerated it well. The patient's allergy is noted as meropenem, and they have been receiving multiple antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, linezolid, aztreonam, and metronidazole.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood cultures were obtained on 06/16/2131 at 06:23 AM, 10:13 PM, and 04:24 AM. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, but there is an elevated BUN level of 33 mg/dL and creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes and abnormal kidney function tests.

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. ID: No fevers since starting CVVH. RUQ u/s concerning for sludge and
   pt started flagyl.
   - Cte broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with linezolid and aztreonam
   (D1 [**6-6**]) and flagyl (added back [**6-15**])
   - Consider HIDA scan if bilirubin does not improve or hemodynamic
   instability over next few days as may need perc. drain
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - Cont steroid taper for possible adrenal insufficiency
   - Yeast in the urine- changed foley and re-cultured. If still with
   yeast will treat with anti-fungal.
   # Elevated LFTs: T Bili and transaminases stable. A/w alcoholic
   hepatitis but recent increase may be [**2-5**] TPN, now discontinued. RUQ u/s
   with sludge concerning for cholestasis. Note that [**2131-5-17**] U/S also
   showed sludge.
   - Consider asking GI input for HIDA scan v. ERCP if hemodynamically
   unstable
   - TPN stopped [**6-14**]
   - Weaning off benzos
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Sutures out on [**6-14**]. Currently on trach mask
   with good ABG.
   - Start fentanyl patch while decreasing gtt, continue methadone
   - Cont to chair daily
   - Consider down-size trach
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently experiencing multiple medical complications, including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), Acute Renal Failure (ARF), Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB), and fevers.

The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments, including tracheostomy placement, continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, administration of antifungal medication, discontinuation of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), weaning off benzodiazepines, and adjustment of sedative medications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening ARDS, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), persistent renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and sepsis.

It is important to monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, renal function, liver enzymes, and infectious parameters. Close attention should be given to the patient's fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and nutritional support. Additionally, regular reassessment of the patient's mental status and neurological function is necessary to evaluate the progress of sedation weaning and seizure management.

In summary, the patient's current condition and potential medical complications require careful monitoring and ongoing management to address his respiratory, renal, hepatic, and infectious issues."

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. ID: No fevers since starting CVVH. RUQ u/s concerning for sludge and
   pt started flagyl.
   - Cte broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with linezolid and aztreonam
   (D1 [**6-6**]) and flagyl (added back [**6-15**])
   - Consider HIDA scan if bilirubin does not improve or hemodynamic
   instability over next few days as may need perc. drain
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - Cont steroid taper for possible adrenal insufficiency
   - Yeast in the urine- changed foley and re-cultured. If still with
   yeast will treat with anti-fungal.
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: T Bili stable. Has alcoholic hepatitis but was
   also on TPN. Bili. RUQ u/s with sludge concerning for cholestasis. Note
   that [**2131-5-17**] U/S also showed sludge.
   - Consider asking GI input for HIDA scan v. ERCP if hemodynamic
   instability
   - TPN stopped [**6-14**]
   - Weaning off benzos
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Sutures out on [**6-14**]. Currently on trach mask
   with good abg
   - Increasing fentanyl patch while decreasing gtt, continue methadone
   - Cte oob to chair daily
   - Consider down-size trach
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements it may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue on higher dose keppra
   - F/u neuro recs
   - Wean off midazolam as tolerated with low dose valium to prevent
   withdrawal; monitor vitals
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs.
   - Would dialyze for acidosis but likely does not need volume depletion
   as pressures borderline.
   - Cte CVVH while pressures low but consider HD when more stable
   tomorrow.
   - Aztreonam increased back to 2000mg q12h as back on CVVH
   - Will change Keppra to 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD if he
   transitions to HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - Weaned Hydrocort to 25mg Q8H (Day [**1-6**])

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis.
- He is currently in the ICU with multiple complications, including ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers.
- The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and is also being treated for possible yeast infection in the urine.
- He has hyperbilirubinemia and concerns for cholestasis, possibly due to alcoholic hepatitis and previous total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
- The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis and is on a tracheostomy with good ABG.
- There were concerns about seizures, but EEG results showed no seizures, and the patient is now being weaned off midazolam.
- The patient has acute renal failure and is being managed with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
- There is also a concern for adrenal insufficiency, but the patient's hypotension is improving with steroid treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and is also being treated for a possible yeast infection in the urine. There is a risk of developing further infections due to the patient's immunocompromised state.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can lead to respiratory failure if not"

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. ID: Necrotizing pancreatitis. All abx (linezolid/aztreo D1 [**6-6**] and
   flagyl D1 [**6-15**]) discontinued [**6-17**] as appeared clinically improved, but
   WBC trended back up. Remains afebrile but worsened leukocytosis today.
   RUQ u/s concerning for sludge since [**5-17**].  HIDA Scan done.
   - Continue abx coverage with aztreo, flagyl, and linezolid given
   necrotizing pancreatitis.
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - Cont steroid taper for possible adrenal insufficiency
   - Yeast in the urine- changed foley and re-cultured. If still with
   yeast will treat with anti-fungal.
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis but recent increase may be [**2-5**]
   TPN, now discontinued. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge concerning for
   cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s. T Bili and transaminases
   stable today.
   - if hemodynamic instability over next few days may need percutaneous
   gall bladder drain
   - TPN stopped [**6-14**]
   - Plan for Weaning off benzos
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Sutures out on [**6-14**]. Currently on trach mask
   with good ABG.
   - Change gtt to PRN fentanyl boluses, continue methadone with wean
   tomorrow
   - goal to chair daily
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra
   - Continue low dose valium to prevent withdrawal; Plan to wean valium
   in next few days.
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs.
   - Touch base with renal about transition to HD
   - Would dialyze for acidosis but likely does not need volume depletion
   as pressures borderline.
   - Cont CVVH while pressures low but would favor HD trial today if
   available
   - Aztreonam 2000mg q12h while on CVVH
   - Will change Keppra to 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD if he
   transitions to HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - Cont weaning hydrocort; D2/3 of 25mg Q8H today.
   # PT and OT eval for placement

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition are:

1. Infection: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and worsening leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection. The presence of yeast in the urine suggests a fungal infection, which requires further evaluation and treatment.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. This condition is characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the alveoli, leading to impaired gas exchange. The patient is currently on a tracheostomy (trach) mask with good arterial blood gases (ABG), indicating some improvement in respiratory function. However, there is still a risk of further deterioration.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine and urea levels. This can be attributed to multiple factors, including dehydration, sepsis, and direct renal injury from the underlying conditions. Appropriate management, including hemodialysis (HD), is necessary to support renal function and remove toxins.

4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypotension and improving eosinophilia suggest a possible case of adrenal insufficiency. Steroid therapy has been initiated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis who is currently in the ICU. He has developed ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. The patient's leukocytosis has worsened despite previous antibiotic treatment, and he has been on CVVH. A HIDA scan showed non-visualization of the GB, indicating cholestasis. The patient's LFTs are elevated, and he has been experiencing respiratory failure secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He has also had seizures, acute renal failure, and possible adrenal insufficiency. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, anticonvulsants, and steroids. He is also receiving TPN, which has been discontinued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's worsening leukocytosis suggests a persistent infection despite antibiotic treatment. Monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjusting the antibiotic regimen accordingly is important.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis puts him at risk for continued respiratory failure. Ensuring adequate oxygenation and weaning off mechanical ventilation gradually will be crucial.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function needs close monitoring. Transitioning to HD tomorrow and managing fluid balance are essential.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's elevated LFTs indicate liver dysfunction. Continued monitoring of liver function and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various interventions including tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient's condition is complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), with signs of respiratory failure, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction. The patient also has a history of sepsis and multi-drug resistant infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. The patient's respiratory symptoms, such as tachypnea and elevated respiratory rate, along with the presence of tracheal suctioning and increased risk of aspiration, put him at higher risk for VAP.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The patient has multiple central lines, including an arterial line, PICC line, and dialysis catheter. These lines increase the risk of bloodstream infections, especially in critically ill patients like the one described.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient is undergoing CRRT due to renal failure. AKI can further complicate the patient's condition and may require additional interventions or changes in the management plan.
4. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's MODS indicates dysfunction in multiple organ systems, including the respiratory, renal, and hepatic systems."

   attenuation of splenic vein; SMA, SMV, PV remain patent; no
   pseudoaneurysm seen. 5. Unchanged diffuse colonic bowel wall thickening
   for which an infectious etiology is not excluded.
   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. ID: Persistent leukocytosis and fevers now that off CVVH. On
   aztreonam, linezolid (since [**6-6**]) and flagyl (since [**6-18**]). [**Month (only) 8**] be [**2-5**]
   pancreatitis.
   - Abd Ct with ?new abscess near pancreas. Will call rads for FR. If
   abscess will cls surgery for percutaneous drain.
   - consider add po vanc for cdiff colitis given persistent colonic
   inflammation on CT and high wbcs
   - UA with mod yeast persistent after multiple foley changes.  Will
   consider anti-fungal but given liver function will likely need very low
   dose
   - Continue abx coverage with aztreo, flagyl, and linezolid given
   necrotizing pancreatitis.
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - diff with neutrophilia but no bands and no eos yesterday
   # Shock: Patient had transient pressor requirement last pm in setting
   of fever. When fever resolved pressor requirement did as well. Likely
   septic shock. Will treat for infection as above. If requires pressors
   without fever consider other etiologies of hypotension including
   cardiogenic.
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge
   concerning for cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s. T Bili and
   transaminases improving today.
   - HIDA neg
   - TPN stopped [**6-14**]
   - weaning off benzos
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**].
   - Cte fentanyl boluses and wean methadone as able today.
   - goal to chair daily
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra (change dosing if changes to HD)
   - Wean valium
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial inc. ATN from hypotension
   - Was supposed to transition to HD today but may not tolerate given
   pressor req overnight during febrile episode. Will f/u renal recs today
   re:HD
   - Aztreonam 2000mg q12h while on CVVH. Change after aztreonam.
   - Will change Keppra to 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD if able to
   tolerate HD today
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and eosinophilia resolved.
   - Cont weaning hydrocort; D2/3 on 12.5mg hydrocort. Taper tomorrow.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently experiencing multiple medical complications including ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), ARF (acute renal failure), UGIB (upper gastrointestinal bleeding), and fevers.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics for his infection, including aztreonam, linezolid, and metronidazole. His vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure ranging from 70/40 mmHg to 123/59 mmHg, heart rate between 89-119 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, icteric sclera, distended abdomen, 2+ edema in the extremities, ulcers/lesions on the legs, twitching mouth, and no purposeful movements. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 34.9 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), high levels of bilirubin, and abnormal kidney function tests.

Imaging studies show bibasilar consolidation likely due to atelectasis, fatty liver with focal sparing along the gallbladder fossa, evolution of areas of necrosis within the pancreas, new fluid collection"

   - Abd Ct with ?new abscess near pancreas. Will call rads for FR. If
   abscess will cls surgery for percutaneous drain.
   - consider add po vanc for cdiff colitis given persistent colonic
   inflammation on CT and high wbcs
   - UA with mod yeast persistent after multiple foley changes.  Will
   consider anti-fungal but given liver function will likely need very low
   dose
   - Continue abx coverage with aztreo, flagyl, and linezolid given
   necrotizing pancreatitis.
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - diff with neutrophilia but no bands and no eos yesterday
   # Shock: Patient had transient pressor requirement last pm in setting

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU due to ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infectious Complications:
   - Persistent leukocytosis and fevers despite being on antibiotics (aztreonam, linezolid, and flagyl).
   - Persistent colonic inflammation on CT, suggesting possible Clostridium difficile colitis.
   - Urinary tract infection with high white blood cell count and presence of yeast.
   - Abscess near the pancreas, which may require further intervention.

2. Respiratory Failure:
   - ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis.
   - Tracheostomy placement on [**2131-6-8**].
   - Goal to wean off mechanical ventilation and progress to chair therapy.

3. Renal Failure:
   - Multifactorial etiology including ATN from hypotension.
   - Transition to hemodialysis (HD) planned, but may not tolerate due to recent hypotensive episode.
   - Monitoring renal function and considering adjustments in medication dosing.

4. Neurological Complications:
   - Occipital seizures seen on EEG, but no correlation with clinical symptoms.
   - Repeat EEG showed no seizures.

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. ID: Persistent leukocytosis and fevers now that off CVVH. On
   aztreonam, linezolid (since [**6-6**]) and flagyl (since [**6-18**]). Likely to
   have continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing pancreatitis.
   - Abd CT with ?new abscess near pancreas. F/u final read but  reviewed
   by Surgery with no role for surgical intervention
   - Given necrotizing pancreatitis and UA with mod yeast persistent after
   multiple foley changes, will restart anti-fungal but given liver
   function will likely need very low dose
   - Continue abx coverage with aztreo, flagyl, and linezolid given
   necrotizing pancreatitis.
   - Consider add po vanc for cdiff colitis given persistent colonic
   inflammation on CT and high wbcs
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - Diff with neutrophilia but no bands and no eos yesterday
   .
   # Shock: Patient had transient pressor requirement last pm in setting
   of fever. When fever resolved pressor requirement did as well. Likely
   septic shock. Will treat for infection as above. If requires pressors
   without fever consider other etiologies of hypotension including
   cardiogenic.
   - Cont weaning steroids
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge
   concerning for cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s. T Bili and
   transaminases improving today.
   - HIDA neg
   - TPN stopped [**6-14**]
   - weaning off benzos
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**].
   - Cte fentanyl boluses and alternatingly wean methadone and valium as
   tolerate.
   - Cte OOB to chair daily
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial inc. ATN from hypotension
   - Was supposed to transition to HD today but pressures not able to
   tolerate. No need for filtration so will reassess tmrw.
   - Aztreonam 2000mg q12h while on CVVH. Change after aztreonam.
   - Will change Keppra to 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD when able to
   tolerate HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and eosinophilia resolved.
   - Cont weaning hydrocort to q12h today
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra (change dosing if changes to HD)
   - Wean valium today

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU due to complications from ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. The patient has been on aztreonam, linezolid, and flagyl for his infections. He also has persistent leukocytosis and fevers, and there is a possibility of a new abscess near the pancreas. The patient's liver function is impaired, so he will need a very low dose of anti-fungal medication. His colonic inflammation on CT suggests the possibility of c.difficile colitis, and he may require vancomycin. 

The patient experienced transient pressor requirement due to septic shock, but it resolved once the fever subsided. His elevated LFTs are likely due to alcoholic hepatitis, and his respiratory failure is secondary to ARDS caused by necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient has acute renal failure with multifactorial causes, including ATN from hypotension. He is currently on CVVH, but his pressures are not able to tolerate hemodialysis (HD) today. 

The patient has been diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency, and his seizures may be related to medication side effects rather than an intracranial process. His ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP."

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU with multiple complications including ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), ARF (acute renal failure), UGIB (upper gastrointestinal bleeding), and fevers. The patient has been on various antibiotics including aztreonam, linezolid, and flagyl. He also has persistent leukocytosis and fevers, indicating ongoing infection. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ID (infection): The patient has persistent leukocytosis and fevers, suggesting an ongoing infection despite being on antibiotics. It is important to continue evaluating the patient's response to the current antibiotic regimen and consider adjusting the treatment if necessary.
2. Shock: The patient had a transient requirement for vasopressors, indicating possible septic shock. Close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status is crucial, and treatment should focus on addressing the underlying infection.
3. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are elevated, which may be indicative of alcoholic hepatitis or complications from the pancreatitis. Monitoring liver enzymes and considering interventions such as HIDA scan and TPN adjustment may be necessary.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. Close monitoring of respiratory status, weaning off sed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of sepsis, acute renal failure, impaired respiration, impaired skin integrity, and acute toxic hepatitis. He is currently on invasive ventilation and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure ranging from 70/40 mmHg to 123/59 mmHg, heart rate between 89-119 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is sedated and tracheostomized, with good airway movement. Physical examination reveals jaundice, distended abdomen, and ulcers on the legs. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased serum creatinine levels, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and respiratory support. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing need for pressors and ventilatory support. Potential complications that can arise include further deterioration of organ function, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, and worsening of sepsis."

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. ID: Persistent leukocytosis. Necrotizing pancreatitis. All abx
   (linezolid/aztreo D1 [**6-6**] and flagyl D1 [**6-15**]) discontinued [**6-17**] as
   appeared clinically improved, but WBC trended back up. Remains afebrile
   (but on CVVH) but worsened leukocytosis today. HIDA neg.
   - F/U fever curve after cvvh d/c
d. If spikes or HD instability abd ct.
   - Continue abx coverage with aztreo, flagyl, and linezolid given
   necrotizing pancreatitis.
   - F/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - taper steroids to 12.5 mg today
   - added on diff to CBC from this am as may have increasing eosinophilia
   as cause of leukocytosis
   - Yeast in the urine- changed foley and re-cultured with persistent
   yeast but oliguric so unclear if true infection.
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis but recent increase may be [**2-5**]
   TPN, now discontinued. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge concerning for
   cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s. T Bili and transaminases
   stable today.
   - HIDA neg
   - TPN stopped [**6-14**]
   - Plan for weaning off benzos
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Sutures out on [**6-14**].
   - worse after HIDA likely from laying flat. Will repeat CXR to ensure
   trach in place.
   - Change gtt to PRN fentanyl boluses, continue methadone with wean
   tomorrow
   - goal to chair daily
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra
   - Continue low dose valium to prevent withdrawal; Plan to wean valium
   today
   #. Acute renal Failure: Appreciate renal recs.
   - Transition to HD tomorrow
   - Would dialyze for acidosis but likely does not need volume depletion
   as pressures borderline.
   - Aztreonam 2000mg q12h while on CVVH
   - Will change Keppra to 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD if he
   transitions to HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and improving eosinophilia
   - Cont weaning hydrocort; D3/3 of 25mg Q8H today. Change to 12.5 today
   # PT and OT eval for placement

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), ARF (Acute Renal Failure), UGIB (Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding), and fevers. 

The patient has been on invasive ventilation since June 19th. He experienced a spike in fever to 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit and became hypotensive to 70/40 mmHg, requiring pressors. Once he defervesced, he was weaned off the pressors. He was put back on the vent for tachypnea and hypoxia with a respiratory support mode of CPAP/PSV, set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 57.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: Max of 38.6 degrees Celsius (101.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and current temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius (98.5 degrees Fahrenheit)
- Heart rate: 89 beats per minute
- Blood pressure: Range of 123/59 to 78/43 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, distended abdomen, firm but unchanged bowel sounds, tracheostomy site without oozing, good airway movement, and 2+ lower extremity edema with ulcers/lesions on legs. The patient is also sedated, with twitching mouth and no purposeful movements.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate, and other abnormalities. The patient's WBC count has been fluctuating, with a high of 38.5 K/uL and a current count of 34.9 K/uL. The patient's Hct has decreased from 24.6% to 22.7%, and the platelet count has decreased from 334 to 282.

Assessment and plan include the following:
1. ID: Persistent leukocytosis. Necrotizing pancreatitis. All abx (linezolid/aztreonam D1 [6-6] and flagyl D1 [6-15]) discontinued [6-17] as appeared clinically improved, but WBC trended back up. Remains afebrile (but on CVVH) but worsened leukocytosis today. HIDA neg.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications. He has a new fluid collection around the pancreas that is unclear if infected. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and will continue to be monitored for infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient had transient pressor requirement due to suspected septic shock. If the patient requires pressors without fever, other etiologies of hypotension such as cardiogenic shock should be considered.
2. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are elevated, likely due to alcoholic hepatitis. Cholestasis is also a concern, but it appears to be improving.

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. ID: Persistent leukocytosis and fevers now that off CVVH. Possible
   that continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing pancreatitis. Also with
   persistent yeast in ucx, persistent colonic inflammation on CT. On
   aztreonam, linezolid (since [**6-6**]) and flagyl (since [**6-18**]). Started
   micafungin and po vanc yesterday.
   - New fluid collection peri-pancreas
 unclear if infected. Per Surgery
   with no role for fluid drainage at this time.
   - Cont broad coverage with linezolid ([**6-6**]-), aztreo ([**6-6**]-), flagyl
   ([**6-18**]-), mica ([**6-20**]-), vanc po ([**6-20**]-).
   - Follow WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   # Shock: Patient had transient pressor requirement last pm in setting
   of fever. When fever resolved pressor requirement did as well. Likely
   septic shock. Will treat for infection as above. If requires pressors
   without fever consider other etiologies of hypotension including
   cardiogenic.
   - Cont weaning steroids
   - ?D/c a-line
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge
   concerning for cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s. T Bili and
   transaminases improving today.
   - HIDA neg
   - TPN stopped [**6-14**]
   - weaning off benzos
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**].
   - Cte fentanyl boluses and alternatingly wean methadone and valium as
   tolerate.
   - Cte OOB to chair daily
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial inc. ATN from hypotension
   - Was supposed to transition to HD today but pressures not able to
   tolerate. No need for filtration so will reassess tmrw.
   - Aztreonam 2000mg q12h while on CVVH. Change after aztreonam.
   - Will change Keppra to 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD when able to
   tolerate HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and eosinophilia resolved.
   - Cont weaning hydrocort to q12h today
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra (change dosing if changes to HD)
   - Wean valium today

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers. He has been on CVVH, and his leukocyte count and temperature are still elevated. He has persistent yeast in UCX and colonic inflammation on CT. He is currently on aztreonam, linezolid, and flagyl, and started micafungin and po vanc yesterday. There is a new fluid collection near the pancreas, but surgery does not recommend draining it at this time. Broad coverage with antibiotics is being continued. The patient had transient pressor requirement last night, which resolved when his fever subsided. His LFTs are improving, and he is being weaned off steroids. He has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis and is on low tidal volume ventilation. He also has acute renal failure, possibly due to ATN from hypotension. His kidney function is being monitored, and he is planned to start HD today, but pressures are not able to tolerate it. He may have adrenal insufficiency, and his hydrocortisone dose is being weaned. He had seizures, but they may have been due to withdrawal rather than intracranial processes. His EEG showed no seizures on higher dose keppra. He is now showing purposeful movements, which may indicate that he is waking up."

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. He has persistent leukocytosis and fevers despite being off CVVH, indicating possible ongoing infection related to necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient also has persistent yeast in the upper gastrointestinal tract and colonic inflammation on CT. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal therapy. The patient has a new fluid collection around the pancreas, which is unclear if infected. He is also showing signs of potential septic shock, with transient pressor requirement during a fever episode. Other medical issues include elevated liver function tests (LFTs) due to alcoholic hepatitis, respiratory failure secondary to ARDS, acute renal failure with multifactorial causes, adrenal insufficiency, and seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ongoing infection: The patient's persistent leukocytosis and fevers suggest that there may still be an ongoing infection, possibly related to necrotizing pancreatitis.
2. Fluid collection around the pancreas: The presence of a new fluid collection around the pancreas raises concerns about the possibility of infection or further complications.
3. Septic shock: The patient's transient pressor requirement during a fever episode indicates a potential episode of septic shock, which needs to be treated promptly.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypot"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. The patient has persistent leukocytosis and fevers despite being off CVVH. He is currently on aztreonam, linezolid, and flagyl. There is a new abscess near the pancreas seen on abdominal CT, but surgery does not recommend any surgical intervention. Given the necrotizing pancreatitis and persistent yeast infection after multiple Foley changes, the patient will restart anti-fungal treatment with a very low dose due to liver function. The patient also has elevated liver function tests, likely due to alcoholic hepatitis. He is experiencing respiratory failure secondary to ARDS and requires tracheal intubation. The patient has acute renal failure, which is multifactorial including ATN from hypotension. He is unable to tolerate hemodialysis at this time. The patient may have adrenal insufficiency, and he is being weaned off steroids. He has had seizures, but they may be related to the patient waking up rather than actual seizures. The patient's current medications include micafungin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, famotidine, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains in the ICU for further management.

   - Follow WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   # Shock: Pressures dropped to 70/40 again in setting of fever. Likely
   septic shock. Will treat for infection as above. If requires pressors
   without fever consider other etiologies of hypotension including
   cardiogenic.
   - Cont weaning steroids

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient is currently in the ICU due to ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), ARF (Acute Renal Failure), UGIB (Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding), and fevers.

The patient has shown persistent leukocytosis (high white blood cell count) and fevers, indicating a possible ongoing infection. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including aztreonam, linezolid, and flagyl. Additionally, antifungal medication, micafungin, has been started, along with oral vancomycin.

The patient's condition has been complicated by the development of a new fluid collection around the pancreas, which may or may not be infected. Surgery has determined that there is no immediate need for fluid drainage at this time.

The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, dropping to 70/40, suggesting septic shock. The treating team has started the patient on ciprofloxacin (Cipro) due to the hypotension and fever. If the patient requires additional pressors without fever, other causes of hypotension, including cardiogenic shock, should be considered.

The patient also has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which are consistent with alcoholic hepatitis. A HIDA scan has shown"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU and has been on invasive ventilation. The patient has been experiencing fevers, leukocytosis, and persistent yeast in urine culture. He also has persistent colonic inflammation on CT scan. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (aztreonam, linezolid, and Flagyl) and antifungal medication (micafungin). The patient's condition is complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and positive yeast in urine culture, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medication are being administered to treat the infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, and he requires invasive ventilation support.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which is multifactorial including hypotension and possible ATN. Hemodialysis (HD) has been considered but the patient's blood pressure is not stable enough for this procedure.
4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient may have adrenal insufficiency, as evidenced by hypotension improving with steroids and eosinophilia resolving. Steroid weaning is ongoing.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been experiencing fever.
- There have been several interventions and changes in medication, including the administration of ciprofloxacin, levophed, and DDAVP due to bleeding from gums.
- The patient has a history of sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, and acute toxic hepatitis.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate in the 100s, blood pressure ranging from 80s/50s to low 100s/60s, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.
- Physical examination reveals icteric sclera, tracheostomy site without oozing, distended abdomen, edema in extremities with ulcers/lesions, and jaundice.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal sodium and potassium levels, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and there is a need for invasive ventilation, indicating potential respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function.

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and a history of invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a blood pressure in the 80s and heart rate in the 110s. The patient has been experiencing fever, and cultures have been sent. The patient is currently receiving multiple IV antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, meropenem, vancomycin, and aztreonam. The patient's respiratory support includes being on invasive ventilation and receiving supplemental oxygen. The patient's neurological status is impaired, with poor arousal, attention, and cognition. The patient also has impaired balance, motor function, muscle performance, and respiration/gas exchange. The patient has a history of seizure disorder but is currently not in status epilepticus. The patient has acute renal failure and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. There are additional problems, including impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU with arterial and peripheral IV lines, as well as a dialysis catheter. Prophylactic measures are in place to prevent deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and the current disposition is in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. ID: Persistent leukocytosis and fevers now that off CVVH. Possible
   that continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing pancreatitis. Also with
   persistent yeast in ucx, persistent colonic inflammation on CT. On
   aztreonam, linezolid (since [**6-6**]) and flagyl (since [**6-18**]). Started
   micafungin and po vanc [**6-20**].  In setting of fevers and hypotension,
   Cipro was started [**6-21**].
   - New fluid collection peri-pancreas but would hold off on fluid
   drainage
   - Check CXR
   - Bronch today
   - Cont broad coverage with linezolid ([**6-6**]-), aztreo ([**6-6**]-), flagyl
   ([**6-18**]-), mica ([**6-20**]-). D/c vanc po ([**6-20**]-), Cipro IV ([**6-21**] -).
   - F/u c diff (neg x2), if neg x3 can d/c po vanc
   - Follow WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - F/u ID recs
   # Shock: Pressures dropped to 70/40 again in setting of fever. Likely
   septic shock. Will treat for infection as above. If requires pressors
   without fever consider other etiologies of hypotension including
   cardiogenic.
   - Cont weaning steroids; change to PO prednisone 5 mg today
   - Keep a-line until off pressors x 24 h
   - Infectious w/u as above
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge
   concerning for cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s.  HIDA neg.
   TPN stopped [**6-14**].  T Bili and transaminases improving today.
   - weaning off benzos - 5 mg valium today
   - continue to trend
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Continues to have blood/clots suctioned from
   trach
   - DDAVP if acute bleeding (max few doses). Had required amicar shortly
   after trach for continued bleeding but complicated by seizure shortly
   after starting this.
   - Cte fentanyl boluses
   - Wean methadone and valium as tolerated
   - Cte OOB to chair daily
   - Trach
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial inc. ATN from hypotension
   - Was supposed to transition to HD today but pressures not able to
   tolerate. No need for filtration so will reassess tmrw.
   - Aztreonam 2000mg q12h while on CVVH.
   - continue Keppra at 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and eosinophilia resolved.
   - transition to PO prednisone 5 mg daily today
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra at HD dosing
   # Altered Mental Status:
   - Titrate down sedating meds; decrease methadone to [**Hospital1 **] today and qd
   tomorrow

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU due to ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. The patient has been experiencing persistent leukocytosis and fevers, which may be related to necrotizing pancreatitis. He also has persistent yeast in his urine culture and colonic inflammation on CT scan. He is being treated with aztreonam, linezolid, and flagyl. Micafungin and po vanc were started on [**6-20**]. Cipro was initiated due to hypotension and fevers. 

The patient has several medical complications, including shock (pressures dropped to 70/40), elevated liver function tests (indicative of alcoholic hepatitis), respiratory failure (ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis), acute renal failure (multifactorial including ATN from hypotension), adrenal insufficiency (unclear with unclear adrenal insufficiency), seizures (possibly due to metabolic disturbances), and altered mental status (likely due to sedating medications). 

The patient's current medications include norepinephrine, famotidine, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and various other medications. He is receiving IV nutrition and his lines include an arterial line, PICC line, and dialysis catheter. Prophylactic measures include DVT, stress ulcer"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently admitted to the ICU for ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's pressures dropped to 70/40 again in the setting of fever, indicating a possible septic shock. Treatment for infection is being administered, and other etiologies of hypotension, including cardiogenic, should be considered if the patient requires pressors without fever.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He continues to have blood/clots suctioned from the tracheostomy site. Tracheostomy care and weaning off sedating medications are ongoing.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has multifactorial renal failure, including ATN from hypotension. Hemodialysis (HD) was planned but not tolerated due to low pressures. CVVH is ongoing, and medications for renal function are being adjusted.

4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hypotension improved with steroids, and eosinophilia resolved, suggesting possible adrenal insufficiency. Transition to oral prednisone is planned.

5. Seizures: The patient had seizures, but repeat EEG on a higher dose of Ke"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient is currently experiencing several complications including ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), ARF (acute renal failure), UGIB (upper gastrointestinal bleeding), and fevers.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including aztreonam, linezolid, and ciprofloxacin for suspected infections. He also received micafungin and oral vancomycin. The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, and Clostridium difficile toxin A & B tests are pending. The patient's yeast infection in the urine culture was found to be positive, and he has persistent colonic inflammation on CT scan.

The patient's recent fluid collection near the pancreas is unclear if infected, and no role for fluid drainage has been identified by the surgical team. The patient's blood pressure dropped to 70/40 again in setting of fever, likely indicating septic shock. He is being treated for infection with the antibiotics mentioned earlier.

The patient's elevated liver function tests are associated with alcoholic hepatitis. He was also experiencing cholestasis but has shown improvement in T Bili and transaminases. The patient's tracheostomy placement on 06/08/2131 continues to have blood/clots suctioned from it. He received DDAVP for acute bleeding and had required amic"

   - Follow WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   # Shock: Pressures dropped to 70/40 again in setting of fever. Likely
   septic shock. Will treat for infection as above. If requires pressors
   without fever consider other etiologies of hypotension including
   cardiogenic.
   - Cont weaning steroids

   - wean methadone and valium as tolerate.
   - Cte OOB to chair daily
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial inc. ATN from hypotension
   - Was supposed to transition to HD today but pressures not able to
   tolerate. No need for filtration so will reassess tmrw.
   - Aztreonam 2000mg q12h while on CVVH.
   - continue Keppra at 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and eosinophilia resolved.
   - Cont weaning hydrocort to q12h today
   - transition to PO prednisone 5 mg daily in AM of [**6-22**]
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra at HD dosing
   - Wean valium today

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. He has persistent leukocytosis and fevers despite being off CVVH. Possible causes include continued fevers related to necrotizing pancreatitis and persistent yeast in the urine culture. He is being treated with multiple antibiotics, including aztreonam, linezolid, and flagyl, as well as antifungal medication micafungin and oral vancomycin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and positive yeast in urine culture, indicating a possible ongoing infection. The cultures are pending, so it is difficult to determine the exact cause. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal treatment.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's blood pressure dropped to 70/40 in the setting of fever, suggesting septic shock. He is being treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He is on invasive ventilation and is being weaned off sedatives.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has multifactorial renal failure, including ATN from hypotension. He is on CVVH but not toler"

   of fevers and hypotension, Cipro was started [**6-21**], but d/c
ed. Surgery
   was consulted for new fluid collection peri-pancreas but they feel they
   are not infected (no gas on CT) and would hold off on fluid drainage.
   CMV positive, but likely not contributing to current illness per ID.
   - Cont broad coverage with linezolid ([**6-6**]-), aztreo ([**6-6**]-), mica
   ([**6-20**]-). D/c vanc po ([**Date range (1) 7192**]). D/C flagyl ([**Date range (1) 7193**]),
   - C diff neg x3 -> d/c po vanc and iv flagyl today.
   - Consider drug fever and attempt to wean off abx over next few days if
   WBCs continue to decrease (also may have fevers from pancreatitis as
   well). Next abx to wean would be linezolid.
   - Recheck CMV VL on [**2131-6-27**]
   - Follow WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - F/u ID recs
   - D/W IR if fluid collection in abd is drainable in case we want to
   drain it later. Currently do not want to operate on abdomen with
   pancreatitis changes.
   # Shock: Pressures dropped again in setting of fever. Will treat for
   infection as above. If requires pressors without fever consider other
   etiologies of hypotension including cardiogenic. Consider IVF today if
   BPs drop to see if fluid responsive prior to starting levophed again.
   - Cont weaning steroids; change to PO prednisone 5 mg today
   - Keep a-line until off pressors x 24 h
   - Infectious w/u as above
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge
   concerning for cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s.  HIDA neg.
   TPN stopped [**6-14**].  T Bili and transaminases improving today.
   - weaning off benzos - 5 mg valium today

   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Bronch without obvious source of bleeding
   and with only thin secretions throughout.
   - DDAVP if acute bleeding (max few doses). Had required amicar shortly
   after trach for continued bleeding but complicated by seizure shortly
   after starting this.
   - Cte fentanyl boluses
   - Wean methadone and valium as tolerated
   - Cte OOB to chair daily
   - Trach care
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial inc. ATN from hypotension

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. He has a history of multiple medical conditions and is on various medications. The patient's current vital signs show a fever of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit, increased heart rate, and slightly low blood pressure. He is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy mask and has a SpO2 level of 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive intake of 2,903 mL and output of 253 mL over the past 24 hours. His laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient has been diagnosed with impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, as well as impaired motor function and respiration/gas exchange. He is also experiencing acute renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated fever, increased heart rate, and low blood pressure may indicate an infection causing systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). If not properly managed, sepsis can progress to septic shock, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's impaired respiration/gas exchange and acute respiratory failure may be indicative of ARDS. ARDS is a life-threatening condition that occurs due to lung injury, leading"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. The patient has been experiencing persistent leukocytosis and fevers despite being off CVVH. There is a possibility of ongoing infection related to necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient also has persistent yeast in UCX, colonic inflammation on CT, and pancreatic fluid collections. The patient has been on aztreonam, linezolid, and flagyl since [**6-6**], and recently started micafungin and PO vanc on [**6-20**]. Surgery was consulted for new fluid collection peri-pancreas but felt they are not infected and would hold off on fluid drainage.

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including linezolid, aztreonam, and flagyl, as well as antifungal treatment with micafungin. The patient's CMV viral load is positive, but it is likely not contributing to the current illness. The plan is to recheck the CMV viral load on [**2131-6-27**].

The patient continues to have episodes of hypotension, which may be related to infection or cardiogenic causes. The patient's elevated liver function tests are consistent with alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to ARDS due to nec"

   - Was supposed to transition to HD today but pressures not able to
   tolerate. No need for filtration so will reassess tmrw.
   - Aztreonam 2000mg q12h while on CVVH.
   - continue Keppra at 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and eosinophilia resolved.
   - transition to PO prednisone 5 mg daily today
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra at HD dosing
   # Altered Mental Status:
   - Titrate down sedating meds; decrease methadone to [**Hospital1 **] today and qd

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been in the ICU for several weeks. The patient has multiple comorbidities including adrenal insufficiency, acute renal failure, seizures, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. He has been treated with various medications including broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent leukocytosis and fevers, indicating a possible ongoing infection. The sputum culture shows growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to ciprofloxacin but sensitive to other antibiotics such as gentamicin, meropenem, and tobramycin. The patient is already on aztreonam, linezolid, and flagyl.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis with pancreatic fluid collections. Surgery was consulted but felt that the fluid collections are not infected and would not perform drainage.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He is on tracheal suctioning and mechanical ventilation.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has multifactorial acute renal failure, possibly due to hypotension and ATN.
5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. ID: Persistent leukocytosis and fevers now that off CVVH. Possible
   that continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing pancreatitis. Also with
   persistent yeast in ucx, persistent colonic inflammation on CT. On
   aztreonam, linezolid (since [**6-6**]) and flagyl (since [**6-18**]). Started
   micafungin and po vanc [**6-20**].  In setting of fevers and hypotension,
   Cipro was started [**6-21**].
   - New fluid collection peri-pancreas but would hold off on fluid
   drainage
   - Check CXR
   - Bronch today
   - Cont broad coverage with linezolid ([**6-6**]-), aztreo ([**6-6**]-), flagyl
   ([**6-18**]-), mica ([**6-20**]-). D/c vanc po ([**6-20**]-), Cipro IV ([**6-21**] -).
   - F/u c diff (neg x2), if neg x3 can d/c po vanc
   - Follow WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - F/u ID recs
   # Shock: Pressures dropped to 70/40 again in setting of fever. Likely
   septic shock. Will treat for infection as above. If requires pressors
   without fever consider other etiologies of hypotension including
   cardiogenic.
   - Cont weaning steroids; change to PO prednisone 5 mg today
   - Keep a-line until off pressors x 24 h
   - Infectious w/u as above
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge
   concerning for cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s.  HIDA neg.
   TPN stopped [**6-14**].  T Bili and transaminases improving today.
   - weaning off benzos - 5 mg valium today
   - continue to trend
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Continues to have blood/clots suctioned from
   trach
   - DDAVP if acute bleeding (max few doses). Had required amicar shortly
   after trach for continued bleeding but complicated by seizure shortly
   after starting this.
   - Cte fentanyl boluses
   - Wean methadone and valium as tolerated
   - Cte OOB to chair daily
   - Trach
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial inc. ATN from hypotension
   - Was supposed to transition to HD today but pressures not able to
   tolerate. No need for filtration so will reassess tmrw.
   - Aztreonam 2000mg q12h while on CVVH.
   - continue Keppra at 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and eosinophilia resolved.
   - transition to PO prednisone 5 mg daily today
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra at HD dosing
   # Altered Mental Status:
   - Titrate down sedating meds; decrease methadone to [**Hospital1 **] today and qd
   tomorrow

   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. ID: Persistent leukocytosis and fevers now that off CVVH. Possible
   that continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing pancreatitis. Also with
   persistent yeast in ucx, persistent colonic inflammation on CT, and
   pancreatic fluid collections. On aztreonam, linezolid (since [**6-6**]) and
   flagyl (since [**6-18**]). Started micafungin and po vanc [**6-20**].  In setting
   of fevers and hypotension, Cipro was started [**6-21**], but d/c
ed. Surgery
   was consulted for new fluid collection peri-pancreas but they feel they
   are not infected (no gas on CT) and would hold off on fluid drainage.
   CMV positive, but likely not contributing to current illness per ID.
   - Cont broad coverage with linezolid ([**6-6**]-), aztreo ([**6-6**]-), flagyl
   ([**6-18**]-), mica ([**6-20**]-). D/c vanc po ([**6-20**]-).
   - C diff neg x3 -> likely d/c po vanc
   - Recheck CMV VL on [**2131-6-27**]
   - Follow WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - F/u ID recs
   # Shock: Pressures dropped again in setting of fever. Will treat for
   infection as above. If requires pressors without fever consider other
   etiologies of hypotension including cardiogenic.
   - Cont weaning steroids; change to PO prednisone 5 mg today
   - Keep a-line until off pressors x 24 h
   - Infectious w/u as above
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge
   concerning for cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s.  HIDA neg.
   TPN stopped [**6-14**].  T Bili and transaminases improving today.
   - weaning off benzos - 5 mg valium today
   - continue to trend
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Bronch without obvious source of bleeding
   and with only thin secretions throughout.
   - DDAVP if acute bleeding (max few doses). Had required amicar shortly
   after trach for continued bleeding but complicated by seizure shortly
   after starting this.
   - Cte fentanyl boluses
   - Wean methadone and valium as tolerated
   - Cte OOB to chair daily
   - Trach care
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial inc. ATN from hypotension
   - Was supposed to transition to HD today but pressures not able to
   tolerate. No need for filtration so will reassess tmrw.
   - Aztreonam 2000mg q12h while on CVVH.
   - continue Keppra at 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and eosinophilia resolved.
   - transition to PO prednisone 5 mg daily today
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra at HD dosing
   # Altered Mental Status:
   - Titrate down sedating meds; decrease methadone to [**Hospital1 **] today and qd
   tomorrow

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. He has been treated with various medications including aztreonam, linezolid, and flagyl. The patient's current condition includes persistent leukocytosis and fevers, possible continued fevers related to necrotizing pancreatitis, persistent yeast in the upper gastrointestinal tract, persistent colonic inflammation on CT, and pancreatic fluid collections. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers and leukocytosis, indicating a possible ongoing infection. This could be due to the necrotizing pancreatitis or other sources.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's history of necrotizing pancreatitis increases the risk of complications related to this condition, such as pancreatic fluid collections and ongoing inflammation.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure and the need for ongoing respiratory support.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be multifactorial. There is a need for careful monitoring and management of renal function.
5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypotension improved with steroids, suggesting a possible underlying adrenal insufficiency. This needs to be further evaluated and managed appropriately.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He has been experiencing fevers, hypotension, and respiratory failure secondary to ARDS. The patient also has acute renal failure, adrenal insufficiency, and altered mental status. He has been on multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent leukocytosis and fevers, indicating a possible ongoing infection. The presence of yeast in the UCX and colonic inflammation on CT suggests a possible fungal infection. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medication.

2. Septic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and dropped pressures indicate a possible septic shock, likely due to the infection. The patient is being treated for infection as mentioned above.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, and his respiratory status is being closely monitored. Tracheostomy was placed on [2131-6-8] to assist with ventilation.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has multifactorial renal failure, including ATN from hypotension. The patient is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and will reassess tomorrow.

5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hypotension is improving with steroids, indicating possible adrenal insufficiency. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. ID: Persistent leukocytosis and fevers now that off CVVH. Possible
   that continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing pancreatitis. Also with
   persistent yeast in ucx, persistent colonic inflammation on CT, and
   pancreatic fluid collections. On aztreonam, linezolid (since [**6-6**]) and
   flagyl (since [**6-18**]). Started micafungin and po vanc [**6-20**].  In setting
   of fevers and hypotension, Cipro was started [**6-21**], but d/c
ed. Surgery
   was consulted for new fluid collection peri-pancreas but they feel they
   are not infected (no gas on CT) and would hold off on fluid drainage.
   - Cont broad coverage with linezolid ([**6-6**]-), aztreo ([**6-6**]-), flagyl
   ([**6-18**]-), mica ([**6-20**]-). D/c vanc po ([**6-20**]-), Cipro IV ([**6-21**] -).
   - F/u c diff (neg x2), if neg x3 can d/c po vanc
   - Follow WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - F/u ID recs
   # Shock: Pressures dropped to 70/40 again in setting of fever. Likely
   septic shock. Will treat for infection as above. If requires pressors
   without fever consider other etiologies of hypotension including
   cardiogenic.
   - Cont weaning steroids; change to PO prednisone 5 mg today
   - Keep a-line until off pressors x 24 h
   - Infectious w/u as above
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge
   concerning for cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s.  HIDA neg.
   TPN stopped [**6-14**].  T Bili and transaminases improving today.
   - weaning off benzos - 5 mg valium today
   - continue to trend
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Bronch without obvious source of bleeding
   and with only thin secretions throughout.
   - DDAVP if acute bleeding (max few doses). Had required amicar shortly
   after trach for continued bleeding but complicated by seizure shortly
   after starting this.
   - Cte fentanyl boluses
   - Wean methadone and valium as tolerated
   - Cte OOB to chair daily
   - Trach care
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial inc. ATN from hypotension
   - Was supposed to transition to HD today but pressures not able to
   tolerate. No need for filtration so will reassess tmrw.
   - Aztreonam 2000mg q12h while on CVVH.
   - continue Keppra at 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and eosinophilia resolved.
   - transition to PO prednisone 5 mg daily today
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra at HD dosing
   # Altered Mental Status:
   - Titrate down sedating meds; decrease methadone to [**Hospital1 **] today and qd
   tomorrow

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications.

1. ID (Infection): The patient has persistent leukocytosis (high white blood cell count) and fevers, indicating an ongoing infection. Possible causes include necrotizing pancreatitis, persistent yeast in the upper gastrointestinal tract (ucx), persistent colonic inflammation on CT scan, and pancreatic fluid collections. The patient is on aztreonam, linezolid, and metronidazole for broad-spectrum coverage.

2. Shock: The patient's blood pressures have dropped to 70/40, indicating possible septic shock. The patient is being treated with antibiotics for infection and may require pressors (vasopressor medications) to maintain blood pressure. Other etiologies of hypotension, including cardiogenic shock, should also be considered.

3. Elevated LFTs (Liver Function Tests): The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which are associated with alcoholic hepatitis. There is also evidence of cholestasis (sludge in the gallbladder) on ultrasound, but this has improved with time. TPN (total parenteral nutrition) has been stopped, and the patient is being weaned off benzodiazepines.

   1.       Resp Failure: Agree with plan to manage respiratory failure
   with ongoing TM trials and sedation wean - will get OOB to chair today,
   and will decrease methadone to [**Hospital1 **].
   2.       Given possibility of sz activity, will continue keppra and
   valium at current doses.
   3.       For shock (resolved), will continue to wean steroids (change
   to pred 5 today) and will continue linezolid / aztreonam / flagyl /
   micafungin / cipro / vanco PO while monitoring culture data. LFTs are
   improving off TPN. [**Month (only) 8**] be able to wean ABX if remains stable from WBC
   and fever standpoint. Flagyl off first, Mica would be very last to go.
   Possibel repeat imaiging in a week of pancreas.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and pancreatitis. The patient has undergone several procedures and treatments, including bronchoscopy, blood cultures, and various infusions of medications. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a fever of 102.0°F, tachycardia (heart rate of 112 bpm), and hypotension (blood pressure of 107/63 mmHg). The patient's respiratory support includes being on a tracheal mask with 100% oxygen saturation, and their ABG results show abnormal values. The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis (white blood cell count of 38.5 K/uL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 264 K/uL), elevated creatinine (2.4 mg/dL), and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST at 121/118 U/L). The patient has multiple medical problems, including impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, motor function, and muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, seizure activity, acute renal failure, severe sepsis, impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are further complications or if the current management plan is not effective.
2. Seizure Activity: The patient's seizure activity may recur or progress if not adequately"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include respiratory failure and pancreatitis. The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory results indicate several potential medical complications that could arise.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing impaired respiration and gas exchange, which indicates respiratory failure. The plan is to manage this condition with ongoing trials of mechanical ventilation (TM) and sedation wean. The patient will also be getting out of bed to a chair today and methadone dosage will be decreased.

2. Seizure Activity: The patient has a history of seizure activity, and therefore, will continue to receive keppra and valium at current doses.

3. Shock (resolved): The patient previously experienced shock, which has now been resolved. The plan is to wean off steroids and continue with antibiotics (linezolid, aztreonam, flagyl, micafungin, cipro, and vancomycin) while monitoring culture data. Liver function tests (LFTs) are improving off total parenteral nutrition (TPN). If the patient remains stable from white blood cell (WBC) and fever standpoint, drug fever could be a possibility, and peeling off po Vanco and Flagyl may be considered.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, and the plan is for hemodialysis (HD) per renal team. The patient will also have a repeat"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints are respiratory failure and pancreatitis. The patient's condition has been monitored closely, and various interventions have been implemented.

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever, elevated heart rate, and low blood pressure. The respiratory support includes being on a tracheostomy mask with oxygen delivery, and the ABG results show abnormal values. Physical examination findings include general observations such as the patient lying in bed, having open eyes, and being tachypneic (rapid breathing). There is also mention of edema and neurologic deficits.

Laboratory results reveal several abnormalities including leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated markers of inflammation. Imaging studies are mentioned but not provided in the note.

Assessment and plan:
1. Impaired arousal, attention, and cognition.
2. Impaired balance.
3. Impaired motor function.
4. Impaired muscle performance.
5. Impaired respiration/gas exchange.
6. Seizure activity without status epilepticus.
7. Acute renal failure.
8. Severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.
9. Impaired skin integrity.
10. Acute toxic hepatitis.
11. Acute respiratory failure (not ARDS).

The plan includes managing respiratory failure with ongoing trials of weaning from mechanical ventilation and sedation. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. Fevers/leukocytosis: Fevers off CVVH with stable-improving
   leukocytosis. Possible that continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing
   pancreatitis. Surgery was consulted for fluid collections peri-pancreas
   but felt to not be infected. CMV positive, but likely not contributing
   to current illness per ID. Also with persistent yeast in ucx,
   persistent colonic inflammation on CT with neg C. diff x 3, and concern
   for serotonin syndrome with linezolid and pressors. On aztreonam and
   linezolid (since [**6-6**]) and micafungin (since [**6-20**]). In setting of fevers
   and hypotension, Cipro was started [**6-21**], but d/c
ed [**6-22**]. Flagyl (since
   [**6-18**]) and po vanc (since [**6-20**]) discontinued [**6-23**].
   - Likely linezolid today given concern for serotonin syndrome/drug
   fever
 will d/w ID whether he should be on another abx for gram
   positive coverage
   - Cont aztreonam and micafungin for now
   - D/w IR on Monday if abd fluid collection is drainable in case we want
   to drain it later. Currently hesitant given unclear benefit for a
   procedure that could further complicate his ICU course.
   - Recheck CMV VL on [**2131-6-27**]
   - Follow WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - F/u ID recs
   # Shock: Cont to have hypotension in setting of fevers although only
   intermittent need for pressors and resolved without change in abx
   regimen.
   - If requires pressors without fever, consider other etiologies of
   hypotension including cardiogenic. Consider IVF if BPs drop to see if
   fluid responsive prior to starting levophed again although hypotensive
   events have not occurred in close proximity time-wise to HD sessions
   - Last dose of prednisone taper today (5mg D3/3)
   - Keep a-line until off pressors x 24 h
   - Infectious w/u as above
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge
   concerning for cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s.  HIDA neg.
   TPN stopped [**6-14**].  LFTs downtrending as of yesterday.
   - Weaning off benzos: decrease valium to 5mg [**Hospital1 **] today
   - Continue to trend
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. [**6-22**] bronch without obvious source of
   bleeding and with only thin secretions throughout; no further reports
   of bleeding since.
   - DDAVP if acute bleeding (max few doses). Had required amicar shortly
   after trach for continued bleeding but complicated by seizure shortly
   after starting this.
   - Discontinue methadone today
   - Wean valium to [**Hospital1 **] today
   - Cont fentanyl boluses prn
   - Trach care
   - Cont OOB to chair daily
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial including ATN from hypotension.
   - No HD today
   - F/u Renal recs
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and eosinophilia resolved.
   - Last dose prednisone 5mg today
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra at HD dosing
   # Altered Mental Status: Continue to assess as weaning off sedatives
   - Discontinue methadone today
   - Wean valium to [**Hospital1 **] today

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. The patient has been experiencing intermittent hypotension and requires pressors intermittently. There is a concern for serotonin syndrome with the use of linezolid and pressors. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating possible infection. The patient has been diagnosed with CMV but it is not contributing to the current illness. There is persistent yeast in the UCX and colonic inflammation on CT, which may be a concern for fungal infection. The patient has been on aztreonam and micafungin. Flagyl and po vanc were discontinued due to no improvement in fever. The patient's renal function is impaired, and he requires hemodialysis. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, consistent with alcoholic hepatitis. The patient has a tracheostomy in place and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for adrenal insufficiency, and the patient has been receiving steroids. The patient has had seizures, but they are likely due to sedative medications rather than an intracranial process. The patient's mental status is altered, and sedatives are being weaned off. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Serotonin syndrome due to the interaction between linezolid and pressors.
2. Fungal infection due to persistent yeast in"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing respiratory failure, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and requires vasopressor support. There is a concern for serotonin syndrome due to the interaction between linezolid and pressors. The patient's white blood cell count has been fluctuating, and there is a possibility of fungal infection based on the abdominal cyst. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Serotonin syndrome: The combination of linezolid and pressors may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, which is characterized by altered mental status, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities.
2. Fungal infection: The presence of an abdominal cyst raises the possibility of a fungal infection, which could worsen the patient's overall condition.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, putting them at risk for further kidney damage.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of deterioration despite being on mechanical ventilation.
5. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function is impaired, which can affect drug metabolism and increase the risk of drug toxicity.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and decreased tissue perfusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. ID: Persistent leukocytosis and fevers now that off CVVH. Possible
   that continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing pancreatitis. Also with
   persistent yeast in ucx, persistent colonic inflammation on CT, and
   pancreatic fluid collections. On aztreonam, linezolid (since [**6-6**]) and
   flagyl (since [**6-18**]). Started micafungin and po vanc [**6-20**].  In setting
   of fevers and hypotension, Cipro was started [**6-21**], but d/c
ed. Surgery
   was consulted for new fluid collection peri-pancreas but they feel they
   are not infected (no gas on CT) and would hold off on fluid drainage.
   CMV positive, but likely not contributing to current illness per ID.
   - Cont broad coverage with linezolid ([**6-6**]-), aztreo ([**6-6**]-), mica
   ([**6-20**]-). D/c vanc po ([**Date range (1) 7192**]). D/C flagyl ([**Date range (1) 7193**]),
   - C diff neg x3 -> d/c po vanc and iv flagyl today.
   - Consider drug fever and attempt to wean off abx over next few days if
   WBCs continue to decrease (also may have fevers from pancreatitis as
   well). Next abx to wean would be linezolid.
   - Recheck CMV VL on [**2131-6-27**]
   - Follow WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - F/u ID recs
   - D/W IR if fluid collection in abd is drainable in case we want to
   drain it later. Currently do not want to operate on abdomen with
   pancreatitis changes.
   # Shock: Pressures dropped again in setting of fever. Will treat for
   infection as above. If requires pressors without fever consider other
   etiologies of hypotension including cardiogenic. Consider IVF today if
   BPs drop to see if fluid responsive prior to starting levophed again.
   - Cont weaning steroids; change to PO prednisone 5 mg today
   - Keep a-line until off pressors x 24 h
   - Infectious w/u as above
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge
   concerning for cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s.  HIDA neg.
   TPN stopped [**6-14**].  T Bili and transaminases improving today.
   - weaning off benzos - 5 mg valium today
   - continue to trend
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. Bronch without obvious source of bleeding
   and with only thin secretions throughout.
   - DDAVP if acute bleeding (max few doses). Had required amicar shortly
   after trach for continued bleeding but complicated by seizure shortly
   after starting this.
   - Cte fentanyl boluses
   - Wean methadone and valium as tolerated
   - Cte OOB to chair daily
   - Trach care
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial inc. ATN from hypotension
   - Hd today
   - Aztreonam 2000mg q12h while on CVVH.
   - continue Keppra at 1000mg Q24 with 500 mg after HD
   - F/u Renal recs
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and eosinophilia resolved.
   - transition to PO prednisone 5 mg daily today
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra at HD dosing
   # Altered Mental Status:
   - Titrate down sedating meds; decrease methadone to [**Hospital1 **] today and qd
   tomorrow

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. Fevers/leukocytosis: Fevers off CVVH with stable-improving
   leukocytosis. Possible that continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing
   pancreatitis. Surgery was consulted for fluid collections peri-pancreas
   but felt to not be infected. CMV positive, but likely not contributing
   to current illness per ID. Also with persistent yeast in ucx,
   persistent colonic inflammation on CT with neg C. diff x 3, and concern
   for serotonin syndrome with linezolid and pressors. On aztreonam and
   linezolid (since [**6-6**]) and micafungin (since [**6-20**]). In setting of fevers
   and hypotension, Cipro was started [**6-21**], but d/c
ed [**6-22**]. Flagyl (since
   [**6-18**]) and po vanc (since [**6-20**]) discontinued [**6-23**].
   - D/c linezolid today given concern for serotonin syndrome/drug fever.
   - Cont aztreonam and micafungin for now
   - D/w IR if abd fluid collection is drainable in case we want to drain
   it later. Currently do not want to operate on abdomen with pancreatitis
   changes.
   - Recheck CMV VL on [**2131-6-27**]
   - Follow WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - F/u ID recs
   # Shock: Cont to have hypotension in setting of fevers. Treating for
   infection as above.
   - If requires pressors without fever, consider other etiologies of
   hypotension including cardiogenic. Consider IVF if BPs drop to see if
   fluid responsive prior to starting levophed again.
   - Last dose of prednisone taper today (5mg D3/3)
   - Keep a-line until off pressors x 24 h
   - Infectious w/u as above
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge
   concerning for cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s.  HIDA neg.
   TPN stopped [**6-14**].  LFTs downtrending as of yesterday.
   - Weaning off benzos: decrease valium to 5mg [**Hospital1 **] today
   - Continue to trend
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. [**6-22**] bronch without obvious source of
   bleeding and with only thin secretions throughout; no further reports
   of bleeding since.
   - DDAVP if acute bleeding (max few doses). Had required amicar shortly
   after trach for continued bleeding but complicated by seizure shortly
   after starting this.
   - Discontinue methadone today
   - Wean valium to [**Hospital1 **] today
   - Cont fentanyl boluses prn
   - Trach care
   - Cont OOB to chair daily
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial including ATN from hypotension
   - F/u Renal recs re: HD
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if clear adrenal
   insufficiency but hypotension improving with steroids (lower pressor
   requirement) and eosinophilia resolved.
   - Last dose prednisone 5mg today
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra at HD dosing
   # Altered Mental Status:
   - Discontinue methadone today
   - Wean valium to [**Hospital1 **] today

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers.
- The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever.
- The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and antifungals, but some have been discontinued due to concerns about serotonin syndrome and drug fever.
- The patient's white blood cell count has been elevated, indicating an ongoing infection.
- The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, consistent with alcoholic hepatitis.
- The patient has been on mechanical ventilation support and has had a tracheostomy placed.
- The patient has experienced acute renal failure, seizures, and altered mental status.
- The patient's adrenal insufficiency is unclear, but hypotension has improved with steroid treatment.
- The patient's nutrition has been provided through enteral feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Serotonin syndrome: Due to the combination of linezolid and pressors, there is a risk of developing serotonin syndrome, which can cause symptoms such as agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, dilated pupils, fever, shivering, muscle rigidity, tremor, and in severe cases, seizures, coma, or even death.
2. Infection: The patient's persistent fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have hypotension and pancreatitis as chief complaints. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has experienced fevers, requiring pressors for blood pressure support. Allergies include meropenem, and the patient has received various antibiotics and antifungal medications. Infusions include heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, low blood pressure, and abnormal respiratory rates. Fluid balance shows significant input and output imbalances. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a tracheostomy tube and is on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 set at 40%. Neurological examination reveals that the patient is not following complex commands. Laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and liver function tests. The patient's condition is complicated by fever of unknown origin, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, motor function, and muscle performance. There are also concerns regarding renal failure, severe sepsis, impaired skin integrity, and acute hepatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cyclical fevers requiring vasopressor support: The patient has been experiencing fevers during which they require vasopressor support. Differential diagnoses include SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), line infections, pancreatic necrosis with infection, pneumonia (PNA),"

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. [**6-22**] bronch without obvious source of
   bleeding and with only thin secretions throughout; no further reports
   of bleeding since.  Now off methadone since [**6-24**]. Tachypnea this AM of
   unclear etiology, possible mucous/clot plugging. ?central
   hyperventilation event. Would be transient for PE.
   - Wean off vent to trach mask and recheck ABG
   - F/u CXR final read
   - Sputum cx
   - Wean valium to [**Hospital1 **] (D2/3), decrease to daily on [**6-27**]
   - Cont fentanyl boluses prn (not requiring)
   - Trach care, OOB to chair daily
   - DDAVP if acute bleeding (max few doses). Had required amicar shortly
   after trach for continued bleeding but complicated by seizure shortly
   after starting this.
   #. Fevers/leukocytosis: Fevers off CVVH with stable-improving
   leukocytosis. Possible that continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing
   pancreatitis. Surgery was consulted for fluid collections peri-pancreas
   but felt to not be infected. CMV positive, but likely not contributing
   to current illness per ID. Also with persistent yeast in ucx,
   persistent colonic inflammation on CT with neg C. diff x 3, and concern
   for serotonin syndrome with linezolid and pressors, now discontinued.
   On aztreonam (since [**6-6**]) and micafungin (since [**6-20**]). In setting of
   fevers and hypotension, Cipro was started [**6-21**], but d/c
ed [**6-22**]. Flagyl
   (since [**6-18**]) and po vanc (since [**6-20**]) discontinued [**6-23**].  Linezolid
   started [**6-6**] and stopped [**6-24**].
   - ID would prefer to wean off micafungin last
   - Consider d/c aztreonam today; will f/u with ID
   - Ordered for CMV VL on [**2131-6-27**]
   - D/w IR if abd fluid collection is drainable in case we want to drain
   it later. Currently hesitant given unclear benefit for a procedure that
   could further complicate his ICU course.
   - D/c a-line when able as has been in since [**2131-6-15**]
   - Follow WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - Send bcx from HD line as none yet pending
   # Abd tenderness: Likely secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, now
   able to react as mental status improves. Concern for obstruction given
   emesis this AM but abd xray on our read does not appear c/w this and
   reported to have had BMs. Also has h/o colitis but C. diff neg x 3.
   - F/u abd XR
   - Management of pancreatitis as above
   # Shock: Cont to have hypotension in setting of fevers although only
   intermittent need for pressors and resolved without change in abx
   regimen.
   - If requires pressors without fever, consider other etiologies of
   hypotension including cardiogenic. Consider IVF if BPs drop to see if
   fluid responsive prior to starting levophed again although hypotensive
   events have not occurred in close proximity time-wise to HD sessions
   - Weaned off steroids on [**6-24**]
   - Keep a-line until off pressors x 24 h but d/c when possible
   - Infectious w/u as above
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge
   concerning for cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s.  HIDA neg.
   TPN stopped [**6-14**].  LFTs downtrending as of yesterday.
   - Weaning off benzos: valium 5mg [**Hospital1 **] D [**2-6**]
   - Continue to trend
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial including ATN from hypotension.
   - HD per renal
   - F/u Renal recs
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if adrenally
   insufficient but hypotension initially improved with steroids (lower
   pressor requirement) and eosinophilia resolved.  He has now weaned off
   steroids completely.
   - Last dose prednisone was [**6-24**]
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra at HD dosing
   # Altered Mental Status: Continue to reassess as weaning off sedatives.
   - Off of methadone as of [**6-24**]
   - Cont to wean valium as above
   - Will ask Neuro for input re: prognostication if MS with no further
   improvement by end of week
   # Low ionized calcium: [**Month (only) 8**] be spurious as Ca with Chem 10 nl.
   - Recheck w/ next ABG

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers. The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube.

2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has had persistent fevers and leukocytosis. Possible causes include necrotizing pancreatitis, CMV infection (positive CMV viral load), and persistent yeast in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

3. Shock: The patient continues to have hypotension, requiring intermittent use of vasopressors. This may be due to septic shock secondary to infection or cardiogenic shock.

4. Abdominal tenderness: The patient has tenderness in the abdomen, likely secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. There is concern for intestinal obstruction, but this has been ruled out on abdominal X-ray.

5. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has elevated LFTs, which are consistent with alcoholic hepatitis. Sludge in the gallbladder was seen on ultrasound, but HIDA scan was negative.

6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is multifactorial including ATN from hypotension. He is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been experiencing worsening blood pressure and mental status since tapering off prednisone. He also has a history of TPN, steroids, yeast in urine, and a previous Foley catheter change last week. The patient's fever escalated to 101.5°F and his blood pressure dropped to the low 80s, prompting the initiation of low-dose pressors. The patient became acutely and persistently tachypneic, maintaining oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and remaining afebrile. Respiratory support was provided through PS 5/5 initially but was switched to A/C due to a respiratory rate of 40s. The patient also experienced small emesis and abdominal pain, leading to the order of a chest X-ray and abdominal X-ray. The patient has allergies to meropenem and has received various antibiotics, including metronidazole, linezolid, micafungin, and aztreonam. The patient is currently on norepinephrine infusion, famotidine, and heparin sodium prophylaxis. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. 

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of fever, worsening mental status, and respiratory distress. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown signs of sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient's condition has been complicated by renal failure, impaired skin integrity, and acute toxic hepatitis. The patient's family is concerned about the tapering of prednisone and its potential impact on blood pressure and mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's persistent fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count indicate a possible ongoing infection leading to sepsis. The presence of organ dysfunction further complicates the situation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute onset of tachypnea and subsequent need for increased respiratory support suggest a potential respiratory failure. This may be due to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or another underlying cause.
3. Renal failure: The elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest acute kidney injury or renal failure. This could be secondary to sepsis or other factors.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The presence of skin blisters and wounds may indicate impaired skin integrity, which could be due to pressure ulcers or an underlying infection.
5. Acute toxic hepatitis: The elevated liver enzymes and abnormal bilirubin levels indicate possible liver damage. This could be caused by medications, infections, or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. He has been in the ICU for several weeks and has multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient continues to have fevers and leukocytosis, which may indicate an ongoing infection, possibly related to necrotizing pancreatitis.
2. Shock: The patient has intermittent hypotension and requires pressors. This could be due to septic shock secondary to infection or another etiology such as cardiogenic shock.
3. Elevated LFTs: The patient has elevated liver function tests, which are associated with alcoholic hepatitis. There is also evidence of cholestasis, but TPN has been stopped and LFTs are trending down.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He is on mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy care.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely multifactorial including ATN from hypotension. He is on hemodialysis per renal.
6. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's initial hypotension improved with steroids, but it is unclear if he has adrenal insufficiency. He has weaned off steroids completely.
7. Seizures: The patient had seizures, but"

1. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient has persistent fevers and leukocytosis, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.

2. Hypotension and shock: The patient continues to have episodes of hypotension, requiring pressors. This could be due to septic shock or another cause. It is important to monitor the patient closely and consider other etiologies of hypotension, such as cardiogenic shock.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He requires mechanical ventilation, and tracheostomy placement has been done. Close monitoring of respiratory status is necessary.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient has multifactorial acute renal failure, including ATN from hypotension. He is undergoing hemodialysis. Regular follow-up with renal recommendations is important.

5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypotension initially improved with steroids, suggesting a possible diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. However,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing cyclical fevers, and further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation support, indicating impaired respiration and gas exchange.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output.

4. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis, likely secondary to a suspected infection in the pancreas or other sources. The ongoing use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is appropriate, and the culture results will guide further management.

5. Impaired Arousal, Attention, and Cognition: The patient exhibits impaired mental status, which may be due to various factors such as sepsis, multiorgan dysfunction, or the effects of sedation and paralysis.

6. Impaired Balance and Motor Function: The patient has impaired balance and motor function, which could be related to the central nervous system involvement or muscle weakness.

7. Hepatitis: The patient shows signs of acute toxic hepatitis, possibly due to medication or other factors. Further investigation is necessary to determine the exact cause.

8. Pancreatitis: The patient is suffering from pancreatitis, which may contribute to the overall clinical picture and potential complications.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing cyclical fevers, and no specific source has been identified. This may indicate an underlying infection or systemic inflammatory response.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation support due to impaired respiration and gas exchange. There is a possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other respiratory conditions.

3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This could be due to acute kidney injury or pre-existing chronic kidney disease.

4. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The presence of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggests a systemic infection leading to sepsis.

5. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis, which may be complicated by necrosis and infection. There is a possibility of pancreatic fluid collection or abscess formation that may require drainage.

6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has skin blisters, possibly due to antibiotic-related side effects or pressure ulcers.

7. Hepatitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible liver injury or inflammation.

8. Seizure activity: The patient has had a seizure episode, and antiepileptic medications are being"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pancreatitis and respiratory failure. They have been experiencing cyclical fevers, requiring vasopressor support, and have not shown any new findings on cultures. The patient is currently being managed with aztreonam and micafungin antibiotics while monitoring culture data. Respiratory failure is being managed with ongoing tracheostomy tube trials and sedation wean. The patient is also on keppra and valium for seizure activity, underwent hemodialysis for acute renal failure, and is receiving post-pyloric tube feedings for pancreatitis. There are no plans for drainage of peripancreatic fluid collection at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unknown origin fever (FUO): The patient's persistent fevers without a known source may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory condition. Further investigation is required to identify the cause.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's impaired respiration/gas exchange indicates severe respiratory dysfunction. Close monitoring and management of respiratory support are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has demonstrated signs of acute kidney injury, which can be a result of various factors such as sepsis, hypoperfusion, or direct renal damage. Hemodialysis may be required to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Sepsis: The patient's severe infection and systemic inflammatory response suggest the possibility"

 will continue aztreonam / micafungin

   Possible that continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing pancreatitis. Surgery
   was consulted for peri-pancreatic fluid collections but felt to not be
   infected.   Discussed draining with IR, and felt difficult to access,
   and will not try unless felt necessary by surgery.  CMV positive, but
   likely not contributing to current illness per ID.  Also with
   persistent yeast in ucx, persistent colonic inflammation on CT with neg
   C. diff x 3, and concern for serotonin syndrome with linezolid and
   pressors, now discontinued. On micafungin (since [**6-20**]). In setting of

   [**6-24**].   ID prefers to wean micafungin last.
   - sputum culture with +[**Name (NI) 7260**], unclear if contaminant as respiratory
   function improving, though remains tachypneic.  If true infection,
   would suggest resistance to aztreonam.  Will f/u sensitivities and d/w

   - Management of pancreatitis as above
   #. Respiratory Failure:  initially ARDS secondary to necrotizing
   pancreatitis. s/p trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. [**6-22**] bronch without
   obvious source of bleeding and with only thin secretions throughout; no
   further reports of bleeding since.  Off methadone since [**6-24**]. Tachypnea
   [**6-25**] of unclear etiology, possible mucous/clot plugging vs ?central
   hyperventilation event, though sputum now growing 2+ [**Month/Year (2) 7260**].  Overnight
   weaned back to trach mask, and doing well this AM.
   - f/u sputum cx sensitivities (colonized vs infection), and discuss GN

   - Wean valium to [**Hospital1 **] (D3/3), decrease to daily for tomorrow dose.
   - Cont fentanyl boluses prn (not requiring)
   - Trach care, OOB to chair daily
   - DDAVP if acute bleeding (max few doses). Had required amicar shortly
   after trach for continued bleeding but complicated by seizure shortly
   after starting this.
   # Shock: Patient remained off pressors over last PM and was afebrile.
   - Weaned off steroids on [**6-24**]

   steroids completely.
   - Last dose prednisone was [**6-24**]
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra at HD dosing
   # Altered Mental Status: Continue to reassess as weaning off sedatives.
   - Off of methadone as of [**6-24**]
   - Cont to wean valium as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers, and CMV infection. The patient has been in the ICU since June 15th and is currently intubated on a tracheostomy, receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with periods of improvement and deterioration. 

Medical Complications:
1. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has persistent fevers despite being on CVVH, with improving leukocytosis. It is possible that the continued fevers are related to necrotizing pancreatitis. The ID team is monitoring the situation and has discussed draining the peri-pancreatic fluid collections but felt it would be difficult to access and may not be infected. The patient is on micafungin for fungal infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He underwent tracheostomy placement on June 8th. There was a recent episode of tachypnea of unclear etiology, but the patient has been weaned back to tracheostomy mask and is doing well. The sputum culture is growing 2+ [Month/Year (2) 7260], which may indicate colonization or infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. Fevers/leukocytosis: Fevers off CVVH with stable-improving
   leukocytosis. Possible that continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing
   pancreatitis. Surgery was consulted for fluid collections peri-pancreas
   but felt to not be infected. CMV positive, but likely not contributing
   to current illness per ID. Also with persistent yeast in ucx,
   persistent colonic inflammation on CT with neg C. diff x 3, and concern
   for serotonin syndrome with linezolid and pressors, now discontinued.
   On aztreonam (since [**6-6**]) and micafungin (since [**6-20**]). In setting of
   fevers and hypotension, Cipro was started [**6-21**], but d/c
ed [**6-22**]. Flagyl
   (since [**6-18**]) and po vanc (since [**6-20**]) discontinued [**6-23**].  Linezolid
   started [**6-6**] and stopped [**6-24**].
   - ID would prefer to wean off micafungin last
   - Consider d/c aztreonam today; will f/u with ID
   - Ordered for CMV VL on [**2131-6-27**]
   - D/w IR if abd fluid collection is drainable in case we want to drain
   it later. Currently hesitant given unclear benefit for a procedure that
   could further complicate his ICU course.
   - D/c a-line when able as has been in since [**2131-6-15**]
   - Follow WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - Send bcx from HD line as none yet pending
   # Abd tenderness: Likely secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, now
   able to react as mental status improves. Concern for obstruction given
   emesis this AM but abd xray on our read does not appear c/w this and
   reported to have had BMs. Also has h/o colitis but C. diff neg x 3.
   - F/u abd XR
   - Management of pancreatitis as above
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. [**6-22**] bronch without obvious source of
   bleeding and with only thin secretions throughout; no further reports
   of bleeding since.  Now off methadone since [**6-24**]. Tachypnea this AM of
   unclear etiology, possible mucous/clot plugging. ?central
   hyperventilation event. Would be transient for PE.
   - Wean off vent to trach mask and recheck ABG
   - F/u CXR final read
   - Sputum cx
   - Wean valium to [**Hospital1 **] (D2/3), decrease to daily on [**6-27**]
   - Cont fentanyl boluses prn (not requiring)
   - Trach care, OOB to chair daily
   - DDAVP if acute bleeding (max few doses). Had required amicar shortly
   after trach for continued bleeding but complicated by seizure shortly
   after starting this.
   # Shock: Patient remained off pressors over last PM and was afebrile.
   - Weaned off steroids on [**6-24**]
   - Keep a-line until off pressors x 24 h but d/c when possible
   - Infectious w/u as above
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge
   concerning for cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s.  HIDA neg.
   TPN stopped [**6-14**].  LFTs downtrending as of yesterday.
   - Weaning off benzos: valium 5mg [**Hospital1 **] D [**3-6**]
   - Continue to trend
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial including ATN from hypotension.
   - HD likely today per renal
   - F/u Renal recs
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if adrenally
   insufficient but hypotension initially improved with steroids (lower
   pressor requirement) and eosinophilia resolved.  He has now weaned off
   steroids completely.
   - Last dose prednisone was [**6-24**]
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra at HD dosing
   # Altered Mental Status: Continue to reassess as weaning off sedatives.
   - Off of methadone as of [**6-24**]
   - Cont to wean valium as above
   - Will ask Neuro for input re: prognostication if MS with no further
   improvement by end of week

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU due to ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications. He is also being treated for possible CMV infection and colonic inflammation. The patient's recent progress includes improving leukocytosis and resolution of fever, but he still has tachypnea of unclear etiology. His mental status has improved, allowing him to react to commands. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 94/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the tracheostomy mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. There is concern for mucous/clot plugging causing tachypnea. The plan is to wean off ventilator to tracheostomy mask and recheck ABG.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient had fevers, which have improved but not completely resolved. There is a possibility of ongoing infection, especially considering necrotizing pancreatitis. Surgery was consulted for fluid collections near the pancreas but felt to not"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**6-25**]
   - Sent sputum cx for tachypnea early AM of [**6-25**].
   - Weaned down to trach mask by early afternoon.
   - IR stated it would be very high risk to sample peri-pancreatic fluid
   collection - would likely need to paralyze him as needle would pass
   between dilated splancnic vessels.
   - Renal: plan for HD tomorrow if BP can tolerate it - otherwise may
   need CVVH.
   - ID: recommended d/c'ing aztreonam due to improving fever curve and
   WBC.  Also added galactomanan and beta-glucan.

   - Sent sputum cx for tachypnea early AM of [**6-25**].
   - Weaned down to trach mask by early afternoon.
   - IR stated it would be very high risk to sample peri-pancreatic fluid
   collection - would likely need to paralyze him as needle would pass
   between dilated splancnic vessels.
   - Renal: plan for HD tomorrow if BP can tolerate it - otherwise may
   need CVVH.
   - ID: recommended d/c'ing aztreonam due to improving fever curve and

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis secondary to an unknown infection source. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 C (100.6 F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 94/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy mask. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose levels, liver enzymes, creatinine, and lactate. The arterial blood gas reveals a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. 

The patient's physical examination findings include impaired skin integrity, impaired motor function, and impaired respiratory function. 

The patient's care plan includes antibiotic therapy, fluid resuscitation, renal replacement therapy, and nutritional support. The patient is also on various prophylactic medications to prevent deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, organ dysfunction, renal failure, respiratory failure, and impaired skin integrity."

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. Fevers/leukocytosis: Fevers off CVVH with improving leukocytosis.
   Possible that continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing pancreatitis. Surgery
   was consulted for peri-pancreatic fluid collections but felt to not be
   infected.   Discussed draining with IR, and felt difficult to access,
   and will not try unless felt necessary by surgery.  CMV positive, but
   likely not contributing to current illness per ID.  Also with
   persistent yeast in ucx, persistent colonic inflammation on CT with neg
   C. diff x 3, and concern for serotonin syndrome with linezolid and
   pressors, now discontinued. On micafungin (since [**6-20**]). In setting of
   fevers and hypotension, Cipro was started [**6-21**], but d/c
ed [**6-22**]. Flagyl
   (since [**6-18**]) and po vanc (since [**6-20**]) discontinued [**6-23**].  Linezolid
   started [**6-6**] and stopped [**6-24**].  Aztreonam started [**6-6**] and stopped
   [**6-24**].   ID prefers to wean micafungin last.
   - sputum culture with +[**Name (NI) 7260**], unclear if contaminant as respiratory
   function improving, though remains tachypneic.  If true infection,
   would suggest resistance to aztreonam.  Will f/u sensitivities and d/w
   ID.
   - f/u CMV VL on [**2131-6-27**]
   - d/c a-line when able as has been in since [**2131-6-15**]
   - f/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - send surveillance blood, urine, stool cultures today.
   # Abd tenderness: Likely secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, now
   able to react as mental status improves. Concern for obstruction given
   emesis this [**6-25**] but abd xray without SBO.  Also has h/o colitis but C.
   diff neg x 3.
   - Management of pancreatitis as above
   #. Respiratory Failure:  initially ARDS secondary to necrotizing
   pancreatitis. s/p trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. [**6-22**] bronch without
   obvious source of bleeding and with only thin secretions throughout; no

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, who is currently in the ICU. He has been experiencing fevers, leukocytosis, hypotension, respiratory failure, abdominal tenderness, elevated liver function tests, acute renal failure, seizures, altered mental status, and shock. The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing respiratory and renal issues. He is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and sedatives. The patient's family has been informed about his condition and code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a concern due to his history of ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. His current symptoms include tachypnea and a positive sputum culture, indicating a possible infection. There is a risk of further respiratory decline and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to acute renal failure. This may require ongoing renal replacement therapy such as hemodialysis (HD) or continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH).
3. Infection: The patient's fevers and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infection. The presence of a positive sputum culture indicates a possible respiratory infection. It is important to identify the causative organism and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.
4. Abdominal Complications: The patient's abdominal tend"

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. Fevers/leukocytosis: Fevers off CVVH with stable-improving
   leukocytosis. Possible that continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing
   pancreatitis. Surgery was consulted for fluid collections peri-pancreas
   but felt to not be infected. CMV positive, but likely not contributing
   to current illness per ID. Also with persistent yeast in ucx,
   persistent colonic inflammation on CT with neg C. diff x 3, and concern
   for serotonin syndrome with linezolid and pressors, now discontinued.
   On aztreonam (since [**6-6**]) and micafungin (since [**6-20**]). In setting of
   fevers and hypotension, Cipro was started [**6-21**], but d/c
ed [**6-22**]. Flagyl
   (since [**6-18**]) and po vanc (since [**6-20**]) discontinued [**6-23**].  Linezolid
   started [**6-6**] and stopped [**6-24**].
   - ID would prefer to wean off micafungin last
   - Consider d/c aztreonam today; will f/u with ID
   - Ordered for CMV VL on [**2131-6-27**]
   - D/w IR if abd fluid collection is drainable in case we want to drain
   it later. Currently hesitant given unclear benefit for a procedure that
   could further complicate his ICU course.
   - D/c a-line when able as has been in since [**2131-6-15**]
   - Follow WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - Send bcx from HD line as none yet pending
   # Abd tenderness: Likely secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, now
   able to react as mental status improves. Concern for obstruction given
   emesis this AM but abd xray on our read does not appear c/w this and
   reported to have had BMs. Also has h/o colitis but C. diff neg x 3.
   - F/u abd XR
   - Management of pancreatitis as above
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. s/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. [**6-22**] bronch without obvious source of
   bleeding and with only thin secretions throughout; no further reports
   of bleeding since.  Off methadone since [**6-24**]. Tachypnea [**6-25**] of unclear
   etiology, possible mucous/clot plugging vs ?central hyperventilation
   event, though sputum now growing 2+ GNRs.  Overnight weaned back to
   trach mask, and doing well this AM.
   - f/u sputum cx sensitivities (colonized vs infection), and discuss GN
   coverage with ID.
   - Wean valium to [**Hospital1 **] (D3/3), decrease to daily for tomorrow dose.
   - Cont fentanyl boluses prn (not requiring)

   concerning for cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s.  HIDA neg.
   TPN stopped [**6-14**].  LFTs continue to trend down.
   - Weaning off benzos: valium 5mg [**Hospital1 **] D [**3-6**]
   - Continue to trend
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial including ATN from hypotension.
   - HD per renal
   - F/u Renal recs
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if adrenally
   insufficient but hypotension initially improved with steroids (lower

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. Respiratory Failure: ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. S/p
   trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. [**6-22**] bronch without obvious source of
   bleeding and with only thin secretions throughout; no further reports
   of bleeding since.  Now off methadone since [**6-24**]. Tachypnea this AM of
   unclear etiology, possible mucous/clot plugging. ?central
   hyperventilation event. Would be transient for PE.
   - Wean off vent to trach mask and recheck ABG
   - F/u CXR final read
   - Sputum cx
   - Wean valium to [**Hospital1 **] (D2/3), decrease to daily on [**6-27**]
   - Cont fentanyl boluses prn (not requiring)
   - Trach care, OOB to chair daily
   - DDAVP if acute bleeding (max few doses). Had required amicar shortly
   after trach for continued bleeding but complicated by seizure shortly
   after starting this.
   #. Fevers/leukocytosis: Fevers off CVVH with stable-improving
   leukocytosis. Possible that continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing
   pancreatitis. Surgery was consulted for fluid collections peri-pancreas
   but felt to not be infected. CMV positive, but likely not contributing
   to current illness per ID. Also with persistent yeast in ucx,
   persistent colonic inflammation on CT with neg C. diff x 3, and concern
   for serotonin syndrome with linezolid and pressors, now discontinued.
   On aztreonam (since [**6-6**]) and micafungin (since [**6-20**]). In setting of
   fevers and hypotension, Cipro was started [**6-21**], but d/c
ed [**6-22**]. Flagyl
   (since [**6-18**]) and po vanc (since [**6-20**]) discontinued [**6-23**].  Linezolid
   started [**6-6**] and stopped [**6-24**].
   - ID would prefer to wean off micafungin last
   - Consider d/c aztreonam today; will f/u with ID
   - Ordered for CMV VL on [**2131-6-27**]
   - D/w IR if abd fluid collection is drainable in case we want to drain
   it later. Currently hesitant given unclear benefit for a procedure that
   could further complicate his ICU course.
   - D/c a-line when able as has been in since [**2131-6-15**]
   - Follow WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - Send bcx from HD line as none yet pending
   # Abd tenderness: Likely secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, now
   able to react as mental status improves. Concern for obstruction given
   emesis this AM but abd xray on our read does not appear c/w this and
   reported to have had BMs. Also has h/o colitis but C. diff neg x 3.
   - F/u abd XR
   - Management of pancreatitis as above
   # Shock: Cont to have hypotension in setting of fevers although only
   intermittent need for pressors and resolved without change in abx
   regimen.
   - If requires pressors without fever, consider other etiologies of
   hypotension including cardiogenic. Consider IVF if BPs drop to see if
   fluid responsive prior to starting levophed again although hypotensive
   events have not occurred in close proximity time-wise to HD sessions
   - Weaned off steroids on [**6-24**]
   - Keep a-line until off pressors x 24 h but d/c when possible
   - Infectious w/u as above
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge
   concerning for cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s.  HIDA neg.
   TPN stopped [**6-14**].  LFTs downtrending as of yesterday.
   - Weaning off benzos: valium 5mg [**Hospital1 **] D [**2-6**]
   - Continue to trend
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial including ATN from hypotension.
   - HD per renal
   - F/u Renal recs
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if adrenally
   insufficient but hypotension initially improved with steroids (lower
   pressor requirement) and eosinophilia resolved.  He has now weaned off
   steroids completely.
   - Last dose prednisone was [**6-24**]
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.
   - Continue keppra at HD dosing
   # Altered Mental Status: Continue to reassess as weaning off sedatives.
   - Off of methadone as of [**6-24**]
   - Cont to wean valium as above
   - Will ask Neuro for input re: prognostication if MS with no further
   improvement by end of week
   # Low ionized calcium: [**Month (only) 8**] be spurious as Ca with Chem 10 nl.
   - Recheck w/ next ABG

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis, complicated by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and has been in the ICU since [**2131-6-8**]. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 94/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2. His mental status has improved, and he is able to follow simple commands. The patient has multiple medical complications that require ongoing management, including respiratory failure, fevers/leukocytosis, abdominal tenderness, shock, elevated liver function tests, acute renal failure, adrenal insufficiency, seizures, and altered mental status. He is receiving multiple medications and treatments, including antibiotics, antifungals, sedatives, analgesics, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. His oxygen saturation is currently at 98% on 40% FiO2, indicating the need for ongoing respiratory support.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has persistent fevers and leukocytosis despite receiving appropriate antibiotics. This"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**6-25**]
   - Sent sputum cx for tachypnea early AM of [**6-25**].
   - Weaned down to trach mask by early afternoon.
   - IR stated it would be very high risk to sample peri-pancreatic fluid
   collection - would likely need to paralyze him as needle would pass
   between dilated splancnic vessels.
   - Renal: plan for HD tomorrow if BP can tolerate it - otherwise may
   need CVVH.
   - ID: recommended d/c'ing aztreonam due to improving fever curve and
   WBC.  Also added galactomanan and beta-glucan.

   Possible that continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing pancreatitis. Surgery
   was consulted for peri-pancreatic fluid collections but felt to not be
   infected.   Discussed draining with IR, and felt difficult to access,
   and will not try unless felt necessary by surgery.  CMV positive, but
   likely not contributing to current illness per ID.  Also with
   persistent yeast in ucx, persistent colonic inflammation on CT with neg
   C. diff x 3, and concern for serotonin syndrome with linezolid and
   pressors, now discontinued. On micafungin (since [**6-20**]). In setting of

ed [**6-22**]. Flagyl
   (since [**6-18**]) and po vanc (since [**6-20**]) discontinued [**6-23**].  Linezolid
   started [**6-6**] and stopped [**6-24**].  Aztreonam started [**6-6**] and stopped
   [**6-24**].   ID prefers to wean micafungin last.
   - sputum culture with +[**Name (NI) 7260**], unclear if contaminant as respiratory
   function improving, though remains tachypneic.  If true infection,
   would suggest resistance to aztreonam.  Will f/u sensitivities and d/w

   - f/u CMV VL on [**2131-6-27**]
   - d/c a-line when able as has been in since [**2131-6-15**]
   - f/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - will get blood cx from a-line tomorrow
   # Abd tenderness: Likely secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, now
   able to react as mental status improves. Concern for obstruction given
   emesis this [**6-25**] but abd xray without SBO.  Also has h/o colitis but C.
   diff neg x 3.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU with multiple complications, including ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, and fevers. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since [**6-8**] and had tracheostomy placement on [**6-8**]. He also has a history of colitis but with negative C. diff tests.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient's fevers have improved with CVVH, and leukocytosis is also improving. It is possible that the continued fevers are related to necrotizing pancreatitis. Surgery was consulted for peri-pancreatic fluid collections but felt that they were not infected. The ID team has recommended discontinuing aztreonam due to improving fever curve and WBC count. They have also added galactomanan and beta-glucan.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had ARDS secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis. He underwent tracheostomy placement on [**6-8**]. On [**6-22**], bronchoscopy without obvious source of bleeding was performed, and the patient has not reported any further bleeding since then. He was weaned off methadone on [**6-24**] and remains on the tracheostomy."

   - Weaned down to trach mask by early afternoon.
   - IR stated it would be very high risk to sample peri-pancreatic fluid

   - Renal: plan for HD tomorrow if BP can tolerate it - otherwise may
   need CVVH.

   Assessment and Plan
   28M with alcoholic hepatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis complicated
   by ARDS, SIRS, ARF, UGIB, fevers.
   #. Fevers/leukocytosis: Fevers off CVVH with improving leukocytosis.
   Possible that continued fevers [**2-5**] necrotizing pancreatitis. Surgery
   was consulted for peri-pancreatic fluid collections but felt to not be
   infected.   Discussed draining with IR, and felt difficult to access,
   and will not try unless felt necessary by surgery.  CMV positive, but
   likely not contributing to current illness per ID.  Also with
   persistent yeast in ucx, persistent colonic inflammation on CT with neg
   C. diff x 3, and concern for serotonin syndrome with linezolid and
   pressors, now discontinued. On micafungin (since [**6-20**]). In setting of
   fevers and hypotension, Cipro was started [**6-21**], but d/c
ed [**6-22**]. Flagyl
   (since [**6-18**]) and po vanc (since [**6-20**]) discontinued [**6-23**].  Linezolid
   started [**6-6**] and stopped [**6-24**].  Aztreonam started [**6-6**] and stopped
   [**6-24**].   ID prefers to wean micafungin last.
   - sputum culture with +[**Name (NI) 7260**], unclear if contaminant as respiratory
   function improving, though remains tachypneic.  If true infection,
   might suggest resistance to aztreonam.  Will f/u sensitivities and d/w
   ID, but hold off on additional abx for now (no change in sputum
   characteristics, and tolerating TM now).
   - f/u CMV VL on [**2131-6-27**]
   - d/c a-line when able as has been in since [**2131-6-15**]
   - f/u WBC count, temp curve, and culture data
   - blood, urine, and stool cx today
   - will get blood cx from a-line tomorrow
   # Abd tenderness: Likely secondary to necrotizing pancreatitis, now
   able to react as mental status improves. Concern for obstruction given
   emesis this [**6-25**] but abd xray without SBO.  Also has h/o colitis but C.
   diff neg x 3.
   - Management of pancreatitis as above
   #. Respiratory Failure:  initially ARDS secondary to necrotizing
   pancreatitis. s/p trach placement on [**2131-6-8**]. [**6-22**] bronch without
   obvious source of bleeding and with only thin secretions throughout; no
   further reports of bleeding since.  Off methadone since [**6-24**]. Tachypnea
   [**6-25**] of unclear etiology, possible mucous/clot plugging vs ?central
   hyperventilation event, though sputum now growing 2+ [**Month/Year (2) 7260**].  Overnight
   weaned back to trach mask, and doing well this AM.
   - f/u sputum cx sensitivities (colonized vs infection), and discuss GN
   coverage with ID.
   - Wean valium to [**Hospital1 **] (D3/3), decrease to daily for tomorrow dose.
   - Cont fentanyl boluses prn (not requiring)
   - Trach care, OOB to chair daily
   - DDAVP if acute bleeding (max few doses). Had required amicar shortly
   after trach for continued bleeding but complicated by seizure shortly
   after starting this.
   # Shock: Patient remained off pressors over last PM and was afebrile.
   - Weaned off steroids on [**6-24**]
   - Keep a-line until off pressors x 24 h but d/c when possible
   - Infectious w/u as above
   # Elevated LFTs: A/w alcoholic hepatitis. [**6-14**] RUQ u/s showed sludge
   concerning for cholestasis but also seen on [**2131-5-17**] u/s.  HIDA neg.
   TPN stopped [**6-14**].  LFTs continue to trend down.
   - Weaning off benzos: valium 5mg [**Hospital1 **] D [**3-6**]
   - Continue to trend
   #. Acute renal Failure: Multifactorial including ATN from hypotension.
   - Renal to hold off on HD today secondary to pts pressures.  Plan to
   dialyze tomorrow.
   - F/u Renal recs
   #. Adrenal Insufficiency: Unclear with [**Last Name (un) **] stim if adrenally
   insufficient but hypotension initially improved with steroids (lower
   pressor requirement) and eosinophilia resolved.  He has now weaned off
   steroids completely.
   - Last dose prednisone was [**6-24**]
   # Seizures: CT head without intracranial process.  EEG showed occipital
   seizures which does not correlate with clinical symptoms, but repeat
   EEG [**6-15**] on higher dose Keppra showed no seizures. As patient now with
   purposeful movements, this may actually be patient waking up, not
   seizures.  Current tonic jerking of hands may represent mild withdrawl,
   so will continue valium dosing for now.
   - Continue keppra at HD dosing
   # Altered Mental Status: Continue to reassess as weaning off sedatives.
   - Off of methadone as of [**6-24**]
   - Cont to wean valium as above, keep current dose for now.
   - Will ask Neuro for input re: prognostication if MS with no further
   improvement by end of week

","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and pancreatitis. The patient has been weaned off the ventilator and is currently on a trach mask. The patient's allergies include meropenem. The patient is receiving multiple medications including metronidazole, linezolid, aztreonam, micafungin, famotidine, and heparin sodium. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory system, which shows tachypnea. The patient's physical examination reveals good air movement in the chest, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and edema in the extremities. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes. Other labs are within normal range. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/61 mmHg to 135/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's assessment and plan include fever of unknown origin, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, impaired motor function, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, seizure without status epilepticus, acute renal failure, severe sepsis, and impaired skin integrity. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, sepsis, acute renal failure, and impaired skin integrity."

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with complaints of respiratory failure and pancreatitis. They have been staying off the ventilator, with no need for pressors overnight. The patient has skin allergies to meropenem and is currently on multiple antibiotics and antifungal medication. Their vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/61 mmHg to 135/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 113.5 kg at admission to 104.5 kg currently.

The patient has received various medications including famotidine, heparin sodium, and others. They have been monitored closely with frequent lab tests and imaging studies. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, lactate levels, and D-dimer. The patient also has impaired arousal, attention, cognition, balance, motor function, muscle performance, respiration/gas exchange, and renal function.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cyclical fevers requiring vasopressor support, which could be due to SIRS, line infections, pancreatic necrosis with infection, pneumonia, drug fever, or serotonin syndrome.
2. Hypotension, which may be transient or associated with febrile episodes.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB.
   .
   # Persistent Fever / Leukocytosis: Marked leukocytosis with low grade
   temperature. UA consistent with UTI, but also may be stress response.
   Off Abx except for micafungin.
   -- f/u blood cultures and urine culture
   -- sputum culture likely a contaminent
   -- f/u final CT read
   .
   #  Neuro
   -- need to discuss with neuro their recommendations for patient
   #  Pancreatitis: Most likely alcoholic in etiology, with elevated
   lipase to 1600 and CT findings consistent without necrosis, cycts, or
   phlemgon.  Only mild epigastric tenderness and no complaints of
   abdominal pain.
   -- continue aggessive hydration
   -- serial abdominal exams
   -- trend lipase
   -- no evidence of obstruction, holding off on further imaging at this
   time
   -- check am lipid panel
   .
   #  Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal ostruction.
   - check viral hepatitis panel, although degree of transaminitis not
   consistant with such an etiology.
   - holding off on further imaging for now, f/u final CT read
   - hepatology following
   - avoid hepatically cleared meds
   - trend LFTs
   .
   #  Hematemesis:  Given alcohol history, potential consideration for
   varriceal bleed.  No known prior history of hepatic cirrhosis, but
   elevated INR and fatty liver infilatration would be consistent.  Also
   should consider PUD or alcoholic gastritis.  Hct was WNL on
   presentation, but patient markedly contracted.  Continued bright red
   blood on NG lavage suggests some degree of continued active bleeding.
   -- hepatology consulted, EGD
   -- access with 2 large bore IVs and a cordis, T + C x 3 units
   -- IV PPI + PPI gtt
   -- octreotide for now until varrices are ruled out.
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Most likely due to volume depletion in the setting of
   inability to tolerate POs.  Patient markedly dry on exam.  [**Month (only) 8**] also
   reflect a more chronic long-term liver disease.
   - fluid repleation as given above
   - if not correcting, will pursue furhter workup with urine lytes.
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawl symptoms, but not
   prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presenation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - repleate thiamine, vb12, folate
   - ativan with CIWA > 10
   - addictions consult

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 125/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy mask with supplemental oxygen. The patient's weight is 104.5 kg, and he has received a total of 1,690 mL of fluids since midnight.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 30.9 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), elevated lipase levels, elevated lactate, and hyponatremia. The patient's coagulation profile shows an elevated prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR). Imaging studies reveal fatty infiltration in the liver and no evidence of distal obstruction.

Plan:
1. Persistent Fever/Leukocytosis: Continue aggressive hydration, monitor blood cultures, and follow up with sputum culture.
2. Neuro: Discuss with neurology regarding recommendations for the patient.
3. Pancreatitis: Continue aggressive hydration, serial abdominal exams, trend lipase levels, and check am lipid"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Persistent fever and leukocytosis: The patient has a low-grade temperature and marked leukocytosis. The urine analysis is consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI), but it may also be a stress response. The patient is currently off antibiotics except for micafungin, and follow-up blood cultures and urine culture are needed.

2. Neurological issues: The patient's neurological status needs to be discussed with the neurology team for their recommendations. There is no mention of any specific neurological symptoms or findings in the progress note.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient most likely has alcoholic pancreatitis, as evidenced by elevated lipase levels and CT findings. There is no evidence of necrosis, cysts, or phlegmon. Aggressive hydration, serial abdominal exams, trending lipase levels, and checking an am lipid panel are recommended.

4. Acute hepatitis: The patient likely has alcoholic hepatitis, as suggested by CT scan findings showing fatty infiltration and no evidence of distal obstruction. A viral hepatitis panel should be checked, although the degree of transaminitis is not consistent with this etiology. Further imaging can be held off for now, and hepat"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).
- The patient has a markedly contracted hematocrit, suggesting ongoing blood loss.
- He has received blood products and is being treated with medications such as octreotide, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and antibiotics.
- The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, and he has a low-grade temperature, which may indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI) or a stress response.
- The patient also has hyponatremia, likely due to volume depletion and an inability to tolerate oral intake.
- His liver function tests show elevated levels of INR, liver enzymes, and bilirubin, indicating possible liver dysfunction.
- Other findings include elevated lipase levels consistent with pancreatitis and fatty liver infiltration on imaging.
- The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and may have thiamine deficiency.
- He is currently receiving IV fluids, electrolyte repletion, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Variceal bleeding: Given the patient's history of alcoholism and elevated INR, there is a possibility of variceal bleeding, which requires further evaluation and management.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase levels and CT findings consistent with alcoholic pancreatitis. Close monitoring of abdominal pain and serial lipase levels is necessary.
3. Acute hepatitis: The"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).
- The patient has been experiencing hematemesis, and there is a concern for a variceal bleed due to his alcohol history. Other possible causes include peptic ulcer disease (PUD) or alcoholic gastritis.
- The patient's hematocrit (Hct) was within normal limits on presentation, but he became markedly contracted, indicating significant blood loss.
- Continued bright red blood on nasogastric (NG) lavage suggests ongoing active bleeding.
- Hepatology has been consulted, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned to evaluate and potentially treat the source of bleeding.
- The patient also has pancreatitis, most likely of alcoholic origin, with significantly elevated lipase levels and CT findings consistent with this diagnosis.
- There is no evidence of necrosis, cysts, or pleigmon.
- The patient is receiving aggressive hydration and will have serial abdominal exams to monitor his condition.
- The patient also has acute hepatitis, likely due to alcoholic hepatitis, with fatty infiltration seen on CT scan.
- Viral hepatitis panel will be checked, although the degree of transaminitis is not consistent with viral etiology.
- The patient has leukocytosis with low-grade fever, and his urine analysis is weakly positive. This could be a stress response or"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB, with persistent fevers/leukocytosis.
   # Respiratory failure
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Marked leukocytosis with low grade temperature. UA
   consistent with UTI, but also may be stress response.  Started on
   empiric cipro/flagyl to cover GI source.
   -- f/u blood cultures and urine culture
   -- continue cipro/flagyl for now
   -- f/u final CT read
   #  Hematemesis:  Given alcohol history, potential consideration for
   varriceal bleed.  No known prior history of hepatic cirrhosis, but
   elevated INR and fatty liver infilatration would be consistent.  Also
   should consider PUD or alcoholic gastritis.  Hct was WNL on
   presentation, but patient markedly contracted.  Continued bright red
   blood on NG lavage suggests some degree of continued active bleeding.
   -- hepatology consulted, EGD today
   -- access with 2 large bore IVs and a cordis, T + C x 3 units
   -- IV PPI + PPI gtt
   -- octreotide for now until varrices are ruled out.
   .
   #  Pancreatitis: Most likely alcoholic in etiology, with elevated
   lipase to 1600 and CT findings consistent without necrosis, cycts, or
   phlemgon.  Only mild epigastric tenderness and no complaints of
   abdominal pain.
   -- continue aggessive hydration
   -- serial abdominal exams
   -- trend lipase
   -- no evidence of obstruction, holding off on further imaging at this
   time
   -- check am lipid panel
   .
   #  Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal ostruction.
   - check viral hepatitis panel, although degree of transaminitis not
   consistant with such an etiology.
   - holding off on furhter imaging for now, f/u final CT read
   - hepatology following
   - avoid hepatically cleared meds
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Most likely due to volume depletion in the setting of
   inability to tolerate POs.  Patient markedly dry on exam.  [**Month (only) 8**] also
   reflect a more chronic long-term liver disease.
   - fluid repleation as given above
   - if not correcting, will pursue furhter workup with urine lytes.
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawl symptoms, but not
   prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presenation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.
   - repleate thiamine, vb12, folate
   - ativan with CIWA > 10
   - addictions consult

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and requires mechanical ventilation. This complication is indicated by the low oxygen saturation (SpO2) and the need for a tracheostomy.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has marked leukocytosis, which can be a sign of infection. The urine analysis is consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI), but it could also be a stress response. Empiric antibiotics have been started to cover a potential gastrointestinal source of infection.

3. Hematemesis: The patient has ongoing hematemesis, which may indicate an upper gastrointestinal bleed. Given the patient's alcohol history, variceal bleeding should be considered. The hepatology team has been consulted, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned. The patient is also receiving octreotide, which can reduce portal blood flow and help control variceal bleeding.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient most likely has alcoholic pancreatitis, as indicated by the elevated lipase levels and CT findings. Aggressive hydration is being continued, and serial abdominal exams are being performed to monitor"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with cyclic fevers/leukocytosis, hypotension, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered mental status, hypernatremia, and hematemesis. The patient has been weaned off antibiotics and is currently only on micafungin. He has also been given IV fluids, repleted electrolytes, and is receiving nutrition via a feeding tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to alcoholism and ongoing antibiotic treatment. This puts him at risk for developing further infections.
2. Bleeding: Despite receiving treatment for UGIB, the patient continues to have active bleeding as evidenced by the presence of bright red blood on NG lavage. This could lead to significant blood loss and potential hypovolemic shock.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with pancreatitis, which can be a serious condition if not managed properly. Complications such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation may occur.
4. Hepatitis: The patient's acute hepatitis may progress to chronic hepatitis, leading to liver cirrhosis and potential liver failure.
5. Thiamine deficiency: Given the patient's history of alcoholism and recent withdrawal symptoms, there is a risk of thiamine"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB, with persistent cyclic
   fevers/leukocytosis.
   # Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis
 febrile to 101.2 overnight, but WBC
   trending down.  Sputum with 4+ GNR likely colonizer, as per ID.  Sputum
   consistency unchanged.  CXR without overt pneumonia.  C diff neg on
   [**6-27**].  U/A weakly positive; cx showing 10k yeast.  Weaning off abx and
   currently only on micafungin as pt has been cx negative.  HD line
   cultured x 2 yesterday.  Given temp [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] draw another set of
   blood cx and order CXR.  Consider CT chest and Abx if clinically
   deteriorates.  Other source lower on ddx includes peripancreatic fluid
   collection.  Hesitant to re-do CT A/P given the contrast required.
   # Hypotension
 resolved, cont to monitor.
   # Respiratory failure
 on trach mask at 40% FIO2, tachypnic this AM.
   Will call thoracics re: position of trach (position seems low on cxr,
   marked on radiology report).
   # Acute renal failure
 stable and UOP improving (currently 30-60
   cc/hr).  Per renal, hold off HD and d/c HD line Fri if UOP stays as
   such.
   # Altered mental status
 Given possibility of seizure activity, will
   continue keppra. MRI showing cerebral edema, poor prognosis as per
   neuro.  EEG completed and report pending. Unclear how much of this is
   medication induced and how much is rehab correctable; would appreciate
   neuro recs regarding potential rehab.
   # Hyponatremia
   - correcting on free water boluses
   # Anemia
 stable.  Will hold off transfusing given that pt currently
   febrile.
   # Hematemesis: resolved.  Given alcohol history, potential
   consideration for variceal bleed.  No known prior history of hepatic
   cirrhosis, but elevated INR and fatty liver infilatration would be
   consistent.  Also should consider PUD or alcoholic gastritis.  Hct was
   WNL on presentation, but patient markedly contracted.  Continued bright
   red blood on NG lavage suggests some degree of continued active
   bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and has a tracheostomy in place. Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and elevated white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which may indicate an infection. The presence of 4+ GNR in the sputum suggests a possible respiratory infection. The patient is currently on micafungin due to a yeast infection detected in the urine analysis. Cultures from the HD line are pending.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output). The plan is to hold off on hemodialysis (HD) for now and reassess the patient's urine output.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy caused by acute hepatitis. This is supported by the presence of cerebral edema on the MRI.

4. Variceal bleeding: The patient's history of alcoholism raises the possibility of variceal bleeding, especially considering"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient's current condition includes hypotension, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered mental status, hypernatremia, hematemesis, pancreatitis, acute hepatitis, and alcoholism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has been on multiple antibiotics and is still showing signs of infection, as indicated by the presence of cyclic fevers/leukocytosis. There is also a sputum culture showing 4+ GNR, which may indicate a bacterial infection.

2. Bleeding: Despite the resolution of hematemesis, the patient continues to have bright red blood on NG lavage, suggesting ongoing bleeding. This could be due to a duodenal ulcer (PUD) or variceal bleeding, especially considering the patient's history of alcoholism.

3. Liver failure: The patient has elevated INR and fatty liver infiltration, which could be consistent with alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. This puts the patient at risk for hepatic encephalopathy and further complications.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase levels and CT findings consistent with pancreatitis. There is a risk of pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, or secondary infections.

5. Thiamine deficiency: Given the patient's history of"

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is currently off the ventilator and off pressors, with improvement in right lung fields seen on a repeat chest X-ray. The patient is also showing improvement in diaphragm visualization, suggesting possible clearing of pleural effusions. The patient's culture results are pending, and an MRI has been done with an EEG ordered. The patient's trach sutures have been removed. 

The patient has allergies to meropenem and skin blisters. The last dose of antibiotics was given on 06-25-2131 at 02:39 PM, and micafungin was given on 06-27-2131 at 10:00 PM. The patient is currently receiving fentanyl infusions. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: the patient has been experiencing cyclic fevers/leukocytosis, which is improving. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117/70 to 144/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia. The patient's weight is currently 103.9 kg, and his height is 67 inches. The patient has received a total of 1,525 mL of fluids since midnight, with 291 mL given through the oral route. The patient has also received 1,201 mL of total fluids through the IV route. The patient's urine output is 1,440 mL since midnight, with blood products totaling 375 mL. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy mask, with an oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 33, PaO2 of 305, and FiO2 of 0.21. 

Physical examination findings include WBC count of 18.9, Hct of 22.2, Plt of 230, Cr of 2.7, TCO2 of 18, glucose of 121, and other lab values as listed in the report. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of cyclic fevers/leukocytosis, resolution of hypotension, weaning off antibiotics, continued respiratory support, stable renal function with improving urine output, altered mental status with possibility of seizure activity, hypernatremia, resolved hematemesis, alcoholic pancreatitis, acute hepatitis, alcoholism, and other conditions. 

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is MICU for now, with long-term rehabilitation planned. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatitis complications, and alcohol withdrawal symptoms."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pancreatitis and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fever, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, as well as impaired motor function and muscle performance. The patient also has impaired respiration/gas exchange, seizure activity, acute renal failure, severe sepsis, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's overall trend is showing improvement, with a decrease in cyclical fevers and white blood cell count. The patient is being weaned off antibiotics, with only micafungin remaining. Blood cultures are being monitored, and the patient's blood catheter will be removed. The patient has gram-negative rods in sputum but is likely colonized. A repeat chest X-ray is needed to assess for pneumonia. The patient's hypotension has resolved, but close monitoring is required due to the tendency to drop MAPs. The patient remains on a tracheal mask and is tachypneic this morning with fevers. The patient's altered mental status is being managed with continued administration of keppra, and consultation with neurology is recommended. The patient's acute renal failure is improving, as evidenced by good urine output this morning. The possibility of holding off on hemodialysis is being considered. The patient's pancreatitis is being managed with post-pyloric tube feedings, and any new peripancreatic fluid collection will be discussed with Dr. [Last Name (STitle)]."

The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a fever and impaired arousal, attention, and cognition. He also has impaired balance, motor function, muscle performance, respiration/gas exchange, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate, D-dimer, and liver enzymes. He has acute renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and other medical problems. The patient's plan includes monitoring cultures, weaning off broad-spectrum antibiotics, and continuing antifungal therapy. Other interventions include tracheostomy, tube feeding, and dialysis catheter placement. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and various tests and consultations are planned."

 single spike today after 3 days without.
   WBC trend is down and hemodynamically stable. We have been weaning off

 will continue only micafungin while
   monitoring culture data. Will got blood cx off HD line. Does have GNR
   in sputum but is likely colonized
 repeat CXR without infiltrate. For
   now would not empirically Rx for GNR PNA unless CXR change with phlegm
   chage and infiltrates but will follow closely. ABd still a potential
   culprit re pancreatic fluid collection but again this is one fever-
   lets follow clinically and re eval.
   2.       Hypotension: resolved
 watch carefully now that he is spiking

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fever, altered mental status, and renal failure. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. On the current day, the patient's temperature is 101.3°F, blood pressure is 121/69 mmHg, heart rate is 115 bpm, respiratory rate is 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97% on the tracheostomy. The patient has been receiving various medications, including meropenem, micafungin, fentanyl, and heparin sodium. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26600/mm³, elevated creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis. The patient's physical examination reveals impaired neurologic function and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and altered mental status suggest the possibility of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection becomes dysregulated.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level and impaired renal function indicate the potential development of AKI, which can be caused by factors such as sepsis, hypotension, or nephrotoxic drugs.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate and arterial blood gas analysis indicate respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation support.
4. Hepatitis: The patient's abnormal liver function tests suggest the possibility of hepatitis, which can be caused by various factors including infections, medications, or toxins.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections, particularly in the ICU setting where patients are often immobilized.
6. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and impaired arousal, attention, and cognition are consistent with delirium, which is common in critically ill patients.

These are potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important to monitor the patient closely and take appropriate measures to prevent or manage these complications."

   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB, with persistent cyclic
   fevers/leukocytosis.
   # Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis
 febrile to 101.2 overnight, but WBC
   trending down.  Sputum with 4+ GNR likely colonizer, as per ID.  Sputum
   consistency unchanged.  CXR without overt pneumonia.  C diff neg on
   [**6-27**].  U/A weakly positive; cx showing 10k yeast.  Weaning off abx and
   currently only on micafungin as pt has been cx negative.  HD line
   cultured x 2 yesterday.  Given temp [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] draw another set of
   blood cx and order CXR.  Consider CT chest and Abx if clinically
   deteriorates.  Other source lower on ddx includes peripancreatic fluid
   collection.  Hesitant to re-do CT A/P given the contrast required.
   # Hypotension
 resolved, cont to monitor.
   # Respiratory failure
 on trach mask at 40% FIO2, tachypnic this AM.
   Will call thoracics re: position of trach (position seems low on cxr,
   marked on radiology report).
   # Acute renal failure
 stable and UOP improving (currently 30-60
   cc/hr).  Per renal, hold off HD and d/c HD line Fri if UOP stays as
   such.
   # Altered mental status
 Given possibility of seizure activity, will
   continue keppra. MRI showing cerebral edema, poor prognosis as per
   neuro.  EEG completed and report pending. Unclear how much of this is
   medication induced and how much is rehab correctable; would appreciate
   neuro recs regarding potential rehab.
   # Hyponatremia
   - correcting on free water boluses
   # Anemia
 stable.  Will hold off transfusing given that pt currently
   febrile.
   # Hematemesis: resolved.  Given alcohol history, potential
   consideration for variceal bleed.  No known prior history of hepatic
   cirrhosis, but elevated INR and fatty liver infilatration would be
   consistent.  Also should consider PUD or alcoholic gastritis.  Hct was
   WNL on presentation, but patient markedly contracted.  Continued bright
   red blood on NG lavage suggests some degree of continued active
   bleeding.
   -- hepatology consulted, EGD showing diulefoy lesion
   -- access with 2 large bore IVs and a cordis, T + C x 3 units
   -- IV PPI + PPI gtt
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Most likely alcoholic in etiology, with elevated lipase
   to 1600 and CT findings consistent without necrosis, cycts, or
   phlemgon.  Only mild epigastric tenderness and no complaints of
   abdominal pain.
   -- continue aggessive hydration
   -- serial abdominal exams
   -- trend lipase
   -- no evidence of obstruction, holding off on further imaging at this
   time
   -- cont post pyloric TF
   -- to hold off on any drainage of new peripancreatic fluid collection
   but will discuss with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 542**]
   # Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal ostruction.
   - check viral hepatitis panel, although degree of transaminitis not
   consistant with such an etiology.
   - holding off on further imaging for now, f/u final CT read
   - hepatology following
   - avoid hepatically cleared meds
   - trend LFTs
   # Alcoholism:  Patient describes history of withdrawal symptoms, but
   not prior seizure.  Last drink was night prior to presentation.
   Tachycardia, weakness, and elevated lactate could be consistent with
   thiamine deficiency.

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism. He presented with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has been experiencing cyclic fevers and leukocytosis. He is currently febrile and his WBC count is trending down.

The patient's hypotension has resolved, but he remains on a tracheostomy mask at 40% FiO2 due to respiratory failure. His acute renal failure is stable, and he is producing adequate urine output. He has altered mental status, possibly due to medication or rehabilitation issues. An MRI showed cerebral edema, and an EEG is pending. The patient has hyponatremia, which is being corrected with free water boluses. He also has anemia, stable for now, and hematemesis, which has resolved. The patient has acute hepatitis, likely alcoholic in etiology, with elevated liver enzymes and fatty liver infiltration on CT scan. Pancreatitis is suspected, most likely alcoholic, with elevated lipase levels and CT findings consistent without necrosis, cysts, or phlegmon.

   # Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis
 febrile to 101.3 yesterday AM, but WBC
   continues trending down.  Sputum with 4+ GNR likely colonizer, as per
   ID, and sputum consistency remains unchanged.  CXR without obvious
   pneumonia.  C diff neg on [**6-27**].  U/A weakly positive; cx showing 10k
   yeast.  On micafungin as pt has been cx negative.  Other source lower
   on ddx includes peripancreatic fluid collection.
   -ID recs CT abd to eval peripancreatic collection.
   -D/C a-line and HD line
   -Will not start gancyclovir as CMV not likely cause of fevers, but will
   follow LFTs and if rising will see if correlates with CMV viral load.
   If correlation will will discuss starting gancyclovir with ID and
   renal.
   -Will continue micofungin but will discuss plan with ID.  Likely
   continue for 2 weeks and CT at that time.  Will need to discuss
   criteria for d/cing micofungin with [**Doctor First Name 91**]/ID.
   # Respiratory failure
 on trach mask at 40% FIO2, tachypnic this AM.
   -Tachypnea may be centrally driven [**2-5**] cerebral injury
   # Acute renal failure
 stable and UOP improving (currently >60 cc/hr
   over last 24hrs.).
   -After renal sees Pt today will likely d/c HD line.
   -Cont. to follow UOP
   # Altered mental status
 Given possibility of seizure activity, will
   continue keppra. MRI showing cerebral edema, poor prognosis as per
   neuro.  EEG completed and report pending. Unclear how much of this is
   medication induced and how much is rehab correctable; would appreciate
   neuro recs regarding potential rehab.
   -Family meeting today with Neuro to discuss
   -Will need neuron rehab.
   # Hyponatremia
   - Correcting.  Will start free water boluses to prevent overcorrection.
   # Anemia
 stable.  Will hold off transfusing and cont to follow.
   # Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal ostruction.
   - trend LFTs
   - Will correlate LFTs with CMV viral load if they continue to rise.
   -If CMV likely cause may need to start gancyclovir however as this is
   nephrotoxic will need to discuss with ID/Renal

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with several ongoing medical complications. These include cyclic fevers/leukocytosis, respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation, acute renal failure, altered mental status with a possibility of seizure activity, hyponatremia, anemia, and acute hepatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis: The patient has been febrile with a temperature of 101.3 degrees yesterday AM, but the white blood cell count continues to trend down. The presence of 4+ GNR (Gram-negative rods) in the sputum suggests a possible infection, although it is likely a colonizer rather than the causative agent. The patient has been started on micafungin due to a positive urine antigen test for Candida, but other sources such as peripancreatic fluid collection should also be considered. Further evaluation is needed, including a CT abdomen to assess the peripancreatic collection, discontinuation of the arterial and hemodialysis lines, and discussion of gancyclovir therapy for possible cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation at 40% FiO2,"

   # Hematemesis: resolved.  Given alcohol history, potential
   consideration for variceal bleed.  No known prior history of hepatic
   cirrhosis, but elevated INR and fatty liver infilatration would be
   consistent.  Also should consider PUD or alcoholic gastritis.  Hct was
   WNL on presentation, but patient markedly contracted.  Continued bright
   red blood on NG lavage suggests some degree of continued active

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been febrile, with temperatures ranging from 38.5 to 101.3 degrees Celsius, and his white blood cell count continues to trend down. The patient's sputum culture showed 4+ GNR likely colonizer, and he has been started on micafungin since his sputum has been negative. His chest X-ray does not show any obvious pneumonia. The patient's urine analysis was weakly positive for yeast, but his central line has been removed. He has been diagnosed with acute renal failure and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient also has impaired arousal, attention, cognition, balance, motor function, muscle performance, respiration/gas exchange, and impaired skin integrity. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with 40% FiO2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures indicate a high risk for sepsis. It is crucial to promptly identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, including dialysis if necessary, are important.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's need for mechanical ventilation and"

   1.           Cyclical fevers
 single spike today after 3 days without.
   WBC trend is down and hemodynamically stable. We have been weaning off
   ABX since nothing has grown
 will continue only micafungin while
   monitoring culture data. Will got blood cx off HD line. Does have GNR
   in sputum but is likely colonized
 repeat CXR without infiltrate. For
   now would not empirically Rx for GNR PNA unless CXR change with phlegm
   chage and infiltrates but will follow closely. ABd still a potential
   culprit re pancreatic fluid collection but again this is one fever-
   lets follow clinically and re eval.
   2.       Hypotension: resolved
 watch carefully now that he is spiking
   as he has a tendency to drop his MAPs
   3.       Resp Failure:  on trach mask and holding his own, though is
   tachyneic this AM w fevers
   4.       Altered Mental status: Given possibility of sz activity, will
   continue keppra. MRI and EEH done to help with work up
   5.       For ARF: making good urine this AM, hold off on HD
   6.          For pancreatitis, will continue post-pyloric TFs, and will
   continue to hold off on any drainage of new peripancreatic fluid
   collection but will discuss with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 542**]

","The patient's chief complaints include pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and anoxic brain injury. The patient has a fever of 101.3°F and is experiencing impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, as well as impaired balance, motor function, muscle performance, respiration/gas exchange, renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF), severe sepsis (with organ dysfunction), and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, indicating a decrease in infection. Hemodynamic stability is maintained, and the patient is being weaned off antibiotics since no growth has been observed. Micafungin will continue to be administered while monitoring culture data. Blood culture was obtained off the HD line.

The patient has a gram-negative rod (GNR) in sputum, which is likely colonized. No infiltrate is observed on repeat chest X-ray. Empirical treatment for GNR pneumonia will not be initiated unless there are changes in the chest X-ray with phlegm change and infiltrates.

Hypotension has resolved, but the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be closely monitored as there is a tendency to drop MAPs. The patient remains on a tracheal mask and is holding his own, although he is tachypneic this morning with fevers.

Altered mental status is present, and the possibility of seizure activity is being considered. Keppra will continue to be administered. MRI and EEG have been"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing cyclical fevers, which could indicate an underlying infection.

2. Impaired arousal, attention, and cognition: The patient is showing altered mental status, which may be due to anoxic brain injury or other factors such as sepsis.

3. Impaired balance and motor function: The patient's impaired balance and weak grasp suggest potential neurological deficits.

4. Impaired muscle performance: The patient's impaired muscle performance could be a result of the anoxic brain injury or other systemic issues.

5. Impaired respiration/gas exchange: The patient is on a tracheal mask and is tachypneic at times, indicating respiratory distress or failure.

6. Acute renal failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output, suggesting acute renal failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB, with persistent cyclic
   fevers/leukocytosis.
   # Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis
 febrile to 101.5 yesterday AM, but WBC
   continues trending down.  Sputum with 4+ GNR likely colonizer, as per
   ID, and sputum consistency remains unchanged.  CXR from [**6-29**] without
   obvious pneumonia.  C diff neg on [**6-27**].  U/A weakly positive; cx
   showing 10k yeast.  Other source lower on ddx includes peripancreatic
   fluid collection and central fevers.
   -ID recs CT abd to eval peripancreatic collection.
   -D/C a-line and HD line yesterday
   -Will not start gancyclovir as CMV not likely cause of fevers, but will
   follow LFTs and if rising will see if correlates with CMV viral load.
   If correlation will will discuss starting gancyclovir with ID and
   renal.
   # Respiratory failure

   ~60 cc/hr over last 24hrs.).
   -Cont. to follow UOP
   -Will follow lytes as may over correct with return of function.
   # Altered mental status
 Given possibility of seizure activity, will
   continue keppra. MRI showing cerebral edema, poor prognosis as per
   neuro.  EEG shows encephalopathy.  Family meeting with Neuro
   yesterday.  Full recovery to baseline unlikely, and longterm meaningful
   survival low due to cerebral injury.
   -Will need neuro rehab.
   # Anemia
 Hctstable.  Will hold off transfusing and cont to follow.
   # Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal obstruction.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Will correlate LFTs with CMV viral load if they continue to rise.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism who presented with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He has persistent cyclic fevers and leukocytosis. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/53 mmHg to 144/119 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a tracheostomy mask. The patient is alert and oriented, but has markedly slurred speech. Physical examination findings include supple neck, no jugular venous distention (JVD), coarse upper airway sounds transmitted throughout the chest, tachycardia with normal rhythm, normal heart sounds, no murmurs or rubs, and no peripheral edema or clubbing. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hgb), elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). Imaging studies reveal cerebral edema and fatty infiltration of the liver. The patient's condition is described as poor prognosis with long-term meaningful survival being low due to cerebral injury. The plan includes continuing ICU care, monitoring LFTs, considering further imaging, and discussing the possibility of starting gancyclovir for suspected cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection."

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been in the ICU for an extended period and is experiencing several medical complications.

1. Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis: The patient has had fevers and an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. His sputum shows the presence of GNR (a type of bacteria), but it is likely a colonizer rather than the actual cause of infection. The patient is currently on micafungin due to the presence of yeast in his urine, which has been negative since starting the medication. The ID (infectious disease) recommends further evaluation of a peripancreatic fluid collection.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on a tracheostomy mask at 40% FiO2 and is tachypneic. This may be centrally driven due to cerebral injury.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is stable, and his urine output has improved. After the renal consultation, the plan is to discontinue the HD line.

4. Altered mental status: The patient has an altered mental status with seizure activity, and an MRI shows cerebral edema. The neurology team has discussed poor prognosis and long-term plans with the family.

5. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, and correction is being made while taking"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB, with persistent cyclic
   fevers/leukocytosis.
   # Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis
 febrile to 101.3 yesterday AM, but WBC
   continues trending down.  Sputum with 4+ GNR likely colonizer, as per
   ID, and sputum consistency remains unchanged.  CXR without obvious
   pneumonia.  C diff neg on [**6-27**].  U/A weakly positive; cx showing 10k
   yeast.  On micafungin as pt has been cx negative.  Other source lower
   on ddx includes peripancreatic fluid collection.
   -ID recs CT abd to eval peripancreatic collection.
   -D/C a-line and HD line
   -Will not start gancyclovir as CMV not likely cause of fevers, but will
   follow LFTs and if rising will see if correlates with CMV viral load.
   If correlation will will discuss starting gancyclovir with ID and
   renal.
   -Will continue micofungin but will discuss plan with ID.  Likely
   continue for 2 weeks and CT at that time.  Will need to discuss
   criteria for d/cing micofungin with [**Doctor First Name 91**]/ID.
   # Respiratory failure
 on trach mask at 40% FIO2, tachypnic this AM.
   -Tachypnea may be centrally driven [**2-5**] cerebral injury
   # Acute renal failure
 stable and UOP improving (currently >60 cc/hr
   over last 24hrs.).
   -After renal sees Pt today will likely d/c HD line.
   -Cont. to follow UOP
   # Altered mental status
 Given possibility of seizure activity, will
   continue keppra. MRI showing cerebral edema, poor prognosis as per
   neuro.  EEG completed and report pending. Unclear how much of this is
   medication induced and how much is rehab correctable; would appreciate
   neuro recs regarding potential rehab.
   -Family meeting today with Neuro to discuss
   -Will need neuron rehab.
   # Hyponatremia
   - Correcting.  Will start free water boluses to prevent overcorrection.
   # Anemia
 stable.  Will hold off transfusing and cont to follow.
   # Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal ostruction.
   - trend LFTs
   - Will correlate LFTs with CMV viral load if they continue to rise.
   -If CMV likely cause may need to start gancyclovir however as this is
   nephrotoxic will need to discuss with ID/Renal
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered mental status, hyponatremia, anemia, and acute hepatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been febrile with cyclic fevers/leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection. Sputum culture showed 4+ GNR, suggesting a potential respiratory infection. The patient also had a urinary analysis (U/A) weakly positive for yeast, but was negative for Candida after starting micafungin. There is a concern for peripancreatic fluid collection as well.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask at 40% FiO2 and is tachypneic. There is a possibility of centrally driven tachypnea due to cerebral injury. Monitoring respiratory function and providing adequate oxygenation support is crucial.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is stable, with improving urine output (UOP) over the last 24 hours. After the renal consultation today, the plan is to discontinue the hemodialysis (HD) line.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, with a possibility of seizure activity. He is already on keppra"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism who presented with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He has been experiencing persistent cyclic fevers and leukocytosis. The patient has been on various treatments including micafungin, which was discontinued due to unclear effectiveness. He is currently on prophylactic heparin, an H2 antagonist for stress ulcers, and has been weaned off the ventilator. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated temperature. Physical examination reveals markedly mottled skin, supple neck, coarse upper airway sounds, and 3+ edema. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, high potassium, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function. Imaging studies show cerebral edema and no obvious pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent cyclic fevers and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infection. The presence of 4+ GNR in the sputum culture raises the concern for a bacterial infection. Additionally, the positive urine analysis for yeast may indicate a fungal infection.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, along with oliguria (low urine output), suggest acute renal failure. This can be attributed to factors such as sepsis, hypotension, or direct kidney injury.
3. Cerebral Edema: The MRI showing cerebral edema indicates potential brain injury, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological complications.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's dependence on the ventilator and tachypnea suggest respiratory failure. The underlying cause may be cerebral-driven due to the cerebral injury.
5. Hepatitis: The patient's presentation with acute hepatitis and evidence of fatty infiltration on the CT scan suggests alcoholic hepatitis. This condition can progress to liver failure and cirrhosis if not managed appropriately.
6. Pancreatitis: The patient's history of pancreatitis increases the risk of complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and abscess formation.

These potential medical complications require close monitoring and appropriate management to prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB, with persistent cyclic
   fevers/leukocytosis.
   # Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis
 febrile to 101.5 yesterday AM, but WBC
   continues trending down.  Sputum with 4+ GNR likely colonizer, as per
   ID, and sputum consistency remains unchanged.  CXR without obvious
   pneumonia.  C diff neg on [**6-27**].  U/A weakly positive; cx showing 10k
   yeast.  On micafungin as pt has been cx negative.  Other source lower
   on ddx includes peripancreatic fluid collection.
   -ID recs CT abd to eval peripancreatic collection.
   -D/C a-line and HD line
   -Will not start gancyclovir as CMV not likely cause of fevers, but will
   follow LFTs and if rising will see if correlates with CMV viral load.
   If correlation will will discuss starting gancyclovir with ID and
   renal.
   -Will continue micofungin but will discuss plan with ID.  Likely
   continue for 2 weeks and CT at that time.  Will need to discuss
   criteria for d/cing micofungin with [**Doctor First Name 91**]/ID.
   # Respiratory failure
 on trach mask at 40% FIO2, tachypnic this AM.
   -Tachypnea may be centrally driven [**2-5**] cerebral injury
   # Acute renal failure
 stable and UOP improving (currently >60 cc/hr
   over last 24hrs.).
   -After renal sees Pt today will likely d/c HD line.
   -Cont. to follow UOP
   # Altered mental status
 Given possibility of seizure activity, will
   continue keppra. MRI showing cerebral edema, poor prognosis as per
   neuro.  EEG completed and report pending. Unclear how much of this is
   medication induced and how much is rehab correctable; would appreciate
   neuro recs regarding potential rehab.
   -Family meeting today with Neuro to discuss
   -Will need neuron rehab.
   # Hyponatremia
   - Correcting.  Will start free water boluses to prevent overcorrection.
   # Anemia
 stable.  Will hold off transfusing and cont to follow.
   # Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal ostruction.
   - trend LFTs
   - Will correlate LFTs with CMV viral load if they continue to rise.
   -If CMV likely cause may need to start gancyclovir however as this is
   nephrotoxic will need to discuss with ID/Renal

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has persistent cyclic fevers/leukocytosis, and his WBC count is trending down. Sputum culture showed 4+ GNR likely colonizer, but there are no obvious signs of pneumonia on the chest X-ray. The patient tested negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) on [**6-27**]. Urinalysis (U/A) was weakly positive with 10k yeast, and the patient has been on micafungin as he has been culture negative. 

The patient's respiratory status is stable on the tracheostomy mask at 40% FIO2, but he is tachypnic this morning. The physician suspects that tachypnea may be centrally driven due to cerebral injury. The patient has acute renal failure, but his urine output (UOP) is improving, and he is expected to have his HD line discontinued soon.

The patient has altered mental status, and given the possibility of seizure activity, the physician has decided to continue keppra. MRI results show cerebral edema, and the prognosis is poor according to neurology. An EEG has been completed, but the report is pending. The physician is uncertain about how much of the altered mental status is medication-induced and how much can be"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB, with persistent cyclic
   fevers/leukocytosis.
   # Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis
 Pt had temp to 101.7 yesterday.  WBC at
   11
 still stable/trending down.
   - will tolerate slight fevers as long as patient does not have clinical
   deterioration or WBC elevations
   - Cdiff negative
   - sputum cultures
 moderate growth GNR resembling acinetobacter
   (susceptibilities done)
   - blood cultures pending
   - will not start gancyclovir at this point - CMV not likely cause of
   fevers.  Per yesterday
s progress note, will follow LFTs and if rising
   will see if correlates with CMV viral load.  If so, will discuss with
   renal and ID.
   - will order an abdominal CT in the next few days to reevaluate
   peripancreatic fluid.
   # Respiratory failure
 on trach mask at 40% FIO2, tachypnic this AM.
   -Tachypnea may be centrally driven [**2-5**] cerebral injury
   # Acute renal failure
 stable and UOP continues improving (currently
   ~60 cc/hr over last 24hrs.).
   -Cont. to follow UOP
   -Will follow lytes as may over correct with return of function.
   # Altered mental status
 Given possibility of seizure activity, will
   continue keppra. MRI showing cerebral edema, poor prognosis as per
   neuro.  EEG shows encephalopathy.  Family meeting with Neuro
   yesterday.  Full recovery to baseline unlikely, and longterm meaningful
   survival low due to cerebral injury.
   -Will need neuro rehab.
   # Anemia
 Hctstable.  Will hold off transfusing and cont to follow.
   # Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal obstruction.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Will correlate LFTs with CMV viral load if they continue to rise.
   -If CMV likely cause may need to start gancyclovir however as this is
   nephrotoxic will need to discuss with ID/Renal
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism who presented with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been in the ICU and is currently on invasive ventilation, but has been off the ventilator for a few days. He is now on tracheal mechanical ventilation and is showing improvement.

The patient has had intermittent fevers and leukocytosis, which is being monitored. Blood cultures are pending, and sputum cultures have shown moderate growth of a bacteria resembling Acinetobacter, with susceptibility testing done. Gancyclovir will not be started at this point as CMV is not considered the likely cause of the fevers.

The patient's respiratory status is stable on the tracheal mask at 40% FiO2. Tachypnea may be centrally driven due to cerebral injury. His renal function remains stable with improving urine output.

The patient has altered mental status and is at risk for seizure activity. He is being continued on keppra. An MRI has shown cerebral edema, and the prognosis is poor with long-term meaningful survival unlikely due to cerebral injury. Neuro rehabilitation will be needed.

The patient has anemia with a stable hematocrit level and will be monitored without immediate transfusion.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis: The patient had a temperature of 101.7 yesterday. The WBC count is still stable"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism admitted to the ICU. He presented with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has been off invasive ventilation for a couple of days but is still on tracheal mask ventilation at 40% FiO2. He is experiencing cyclic fevers and leukocytosis, and his white blood cell count is stable and trending down. Blood cultures are pending, and sputum cultures show moderate growth of a GNR resembling Acinetobacter, with susceptibilities being done. The patient has been tested negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and will have repeat sputum cultures. The attending physician has decided not to start gancyclovir at this point, as cytomegalovirus (CMV) is not likely the cause of the fevers. They will follow liver function tests (LFTs) and monitor for rising levels, correlating with CMV viral load if present. An abdominal CT will be ordered in the next few days to reevaluate peripancreatic fluid. The patient's neuro findings indicate diffuse subacute anoxic injury involving the basal ganglia and cortex, with poor prognosis per neurologist. He will require neuro rehab upon discharge from the MICU. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable, and his acute renal failure is being monitored with urine output (UOP),"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB, with persistent cyclic
   fevers/leukocytosis.
   # Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis
 Pt had temp to 101.7 yesterday.  WBC at
   11
 still stable/trending down.
   - will tolerate slight fevers as long as patient does not have clinical
   deterioration or WBC elevations
   - Cdiff negative
   - sputum cultures
 moderate growth GNR resembling acinetobacter
   (susceptibilities done)
   - blood cultures pending
   - will not start gancyclovir at this point - CMV not likely cause of
   fevers.  Per yesterday
s progress note, will follow LFTs and if rising
   will see if correlates with CMV viral load.  If so, will discuss with
   renal and ID.
   - will order an abdominal CT in the next few days to reevaluate
   peripancreatic fluid.
   # Respiratory failure
 Pt is on trach mask at 40% FIO2.
   - Pt is still tachypneic.  (RR 27-40).
   - Considering pt
s neuro findings, this may be a centrally-driven.
   # Acute renal failure
   -
   - will continue to follow UOP, BUN, and Cr
   # Altered mental status
 Given possibility of seizure activity, will
   continue keppra. MRI showing cerebral edema, poor prognosis as per
   neuro.  EEG shows encephalopathy.  Family meeting with Neuro
   yesterday.  Full recovery to baseline unlikely, and longterm meaningful
   survival low due to cerebral injury.
   -Will need neuro rehab.
   # Anemia
 Hctstable.  Will hold off transfusing and cont to follow.
   # Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal obstruction.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Will correlate LFTs with CMV viral load if they continue to rise.
   -If CMV likely cause may need to start gancyclovir however as this is
   nephrotoxic will need to discuss with ID/Renal

   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB, with persistent cyclic
   fevers/leukocytosis and anoxic brain injury.
   # Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis
 Tmax 100.0 overnight.  WBC at 10.5
   still stable/trending down.
   - will tolerate slight fevers as long as patient does not have clinical
   deterioration or WBC elevations
   - off abx
   - Cdiff negative [**6-27**]
   - sputum cultures
 moderate growth GNR resembling acinetobacter
   (susceptibilities done).  Likely colonization.
   - will recheck sputum cultures
   - blood cultures pending
   - will not start gancyclovir at this point - CMV not likely cause of
   fevers.  Per yesterday
s progress note, will follow LFTs and if rising
   will see if correlates with CMV viral load.  If so, will discuss with
   renal and ID.
   - will order an abdominal CT in the next few days to reevaluate
   peripancreatic fluid.
   # Respiratory failure
 Pt is on trach mask at 40% FIO2.
   - Pt is still tachypneic.  (RR 27-40).
   - Considering pt
s neuro findings, this may be centrally-driven.
   # Acute renal failure
   - pt put out 1.5 L urine yesterday; good UOP
   - will continue to follow UOP, BUN, and Cr
   # Altered mental status/anoxic brain injury
 pt had MRI that showed
   diffuse subacute anoxic injury involving the basal ganglia and cortex
   - poor prognosis per neuro.
   - pt will need neuro rehab upon discharge from the MICU
   # Anemia
   - Hct stable
   - continue to monitor Hct
   # Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal obstruction.
   - will continue to trend LFT
   - will also observe whether any rises in LFT
s are correlated with
   rises in CMV titer

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient also has persistent cyclic fevers/leukocytosis and anoxic brain injury.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still tachypneic despite being on a tracheostomy mask at 40% FiO2. This may be centrally-driven due to the neuro findings. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of respiratory support may be necessary.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's urine output was good yesterday, with 1.5 L output. However, ongoing monitoring of urine output, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (Cr) levels is required to assess renal function.

3. Altered mental status/anoxic brain injury: The patient has diffuse subacute anoxic injury involving the basal ganglia and cortex, resulting in poor prognosis and the need for neuro rehabilitation upon discharge from the MICU.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable, indicating no significant anemia at present. However, continuous monitoring of Hct levels is necessary.

5. Acute hepatitis: The patient likely has alcoholic hepatitis. The CT scan shows fatty infiltration, and no evidence of distal obstruction. Trending liver function tests (LFT"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has been experiencing cyclic fevers/leukocytosis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered mental status, anemia, and acute hepatitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Infection: The patient's history of alcoholism increases the risk of infections such as pneumonia, sepsis, or urinary tract infections due to a weakened immune system. The presence of moderate growth GNR resembling Acinetobacter in the sputum cultures suggests a potential respiratory infection.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's acute hepatitis and history of alcoholism, there is a risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by altered mental status and confusion.

3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremia if not properly managed.

4. Pancreatitis complications: The patient's pancreatitis increases the risk of developing complications such as pseudocysts, abscesses, or pancreatic necrosis.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT formation, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and tachypnea. The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. On admission, he was alert but unresponsive to commands. His vital signs showed a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure of 91/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a tracheostomy mask. The patient was placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate, and D-dimer, indicating an inflammatory response. Blood cultures were obtained to identify the source of infection. The patient's renal function tests revealed acute renal failure, and liver function tests showed elevated levels of AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase.

The patient's condition has been monitored closely, with frequent assessments of vital signs, oxygenation, and fluid balance. He has received aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. Antibiotics have been administered to treat the suspected sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's impaired respiration and gas exchange, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

   fevers/leukocytosis and anoxic brain injury.
   # Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis
 Tmax 100.9 overnight.  WBC at 11.1.
   - will tolerate slight fevers as long as patient does not have clinical
   deterioration (hypotension/other) or WBC elevations
   - off abx
   - Cdiff negative [**6-27**]
   - sputum cultures
 moderate growth GNR resembling acinetobacter
   (susceptibilities done).  Likely colonization.
   - will recheck sputum cultures
   - blood cultures pending from [**6-27**] & [**6-28**]
   - will not start gancyclovir at this point - CMV not likely cause of
   fevers. Will continue to follow LFTs and if rising will see if
   correlates with CMV viral load.  If so, will discuss with renal and ID.
   -CMV viral load to be drawn with 7/1 AM labs.
   - Will order an abdominal CT in the next few days to reevaluate
   peripancreatic fluid.
   # Respiratory failure
 Pt is on trach mask at 40% FIO2.
   - Pt is still tachypneic.  (RR 27-40).
   - Considering pt
s neuro findings, this may be centrally-driven.
   # Acute renal failure
   - pt put out 0.75 L urine yesterday;
   -Cr now 1.1 continuing to trend down.
   - will continue to follow UOP, BUN, and Cr
   # Altered mental status/anoxic brain injury
 pt had MRI that showed
   diffuse subacute anoxic injury involving the basal ganglia and cortex
   - poor prognosis per neuro with likely long term prognosis persistent
   vegetative state.
   - pt will need neuro rehab upon discharge from the MICU
   # Anemia
   - Hct stable
   - continue to monitor Hct
   # Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal obstruction.
   - will continue to trend LFT

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has persistent cyclic fevers/leukocytosis and anoxic brain injury. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy and receiving IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, as indicated by his tachypnea and dependence on the tracheostomy and high levels of supplemental oxygen. This may be centrally-driven due to his neuro findings.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, evidenced by oliguria (low urine output) and elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of urine output, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine is recommended.
3. Altered Mental Status/Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient has an altered mental status and anoxic brain injury, with diffuse subacute anoxic injury involving the basal ganglia and cortex. The prognosis is poor, with a likely long-term prognosis of persistent vegetative state. Neuro rehabilitation will be needed upon discharge from the MICU.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but his hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable. Continuous monitoring of Hct is necessary.
5. Acute Hepatitis: The patient likely has alcoholic hepatitis, as indicated by fatty infiltration on CT scan"

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He has persistent cyclic fevers/leukocytosis, anoxic brain injury, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, anemia, and acute hepatitis. The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.3 C (100.9 F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/70 mmHg to 138/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on tracheal mask at 40% FiO2.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics, acetaminophen, albuterol inhaler, diazepam, famotidine, fentanyl citrate, heparin, insulin, and levetiracetam. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated potassium, low magnesium, and low phosphorus levels. Imaging studies reveal diffuse subacute anoxic injury involving the basal ganglia and cortex, with poor prognosis per neurologist.

The patient's family has requested a second opinion regarding the long-term prognosis for neuro recovery. The attending physician will coordinate this request. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and further assessments and tests are planned, including sputum"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB, with persistent cyclic
   fevers/leukocytosis and anoxic brain injury.
   # Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis
 Tmax 100.0 overnight.  WBC at 10.5
   still stable/trending down.
   - will tolerate slight fevers as long as patient does not have clinical
   deterioration or WBC elevations
   - off abx
   - Cdiff negative [**6-27**]
   - sputum cultures
 moderate growth GNR resembling acinetobacter
   (susceptibilities done).  Likely colonization.
   - will recheck sputum cultures
   - blood cultures pending
   - will not start gancyclovir at this point - CMV not likely cause of
   fevers.  Per yesterday
s progress note, will follow LFTs and if rising
   will see if correlates with CMV viral load.  If so, will discuss with
   renal and ID.
   - will order an abdominal CT in the next few days to reevaluate
   peripancreatic fluid.
   # Respiratory failure
 Pt is on trach mask at 40% FIO2.
   - Pt is still tachypneic.  (RR 27-40).
   - Considering pt
s neuro findings, this may be centrally-driven.
   # Acute renal failure
   - pt put out 1.5 L urine yesterday; good UOP
   - will continue to follow UOP, BUN, and Cr
   # Altered mental status/anoxic brain injury
 pt had MRI that showed
   diffuse subacute anoxic injury involving the basal ganglia and cortex
   - poor prognosis per neuro.
   - pt will need neuro rehab upon discharge from the MICU
   # Anemia
   - Hct stable
   - continue to monitor Hct
   # Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal obstruction.
   - will continue to trend LFT
   - will also observe whether any rises in LFT
s are correlated with
   rises in CMV titer
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, Nutren at 50 ml/hr

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He has persistent cyclic fevers/leukocytosis and anoxic brain injury. The patient is currently being treated in the ICU and is on a tracheostomy mask at 40% FiO2 due to respiratory failure. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 134/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated liver enzymes. His kidney function is normal, but he has elevated levels of lactate and D-dimer. The abdominal CT scan shows fatty infiltration without evidence of distal obstruction, suggesting alcoholic hepatitis. 

The patient's neurologic condition is poor with diffuse subacute anoxic injury involving the basal ganglia and cortex. The prognosis is poor, and the patient will need neuro rehabilitation upon discharge from the MICU. 

The patient's nutritional status is being addressed with the administration of Nutren at 50 mL/hr. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male who presented with a chief complaint of altered mental status and was found unresponsive. Upon admission, the patient had a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Initial vital signs revealed a high body temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), tachycardia with a heart rate of 116 bpm, and hypotension with blood pressure readings of 134/70 mmHg and 92/61 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate was also elevated at 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was maintained at 95% through a tracheostomy mask. The patient's weight has decreased from 113.5 kg at admission to 99.5 kg currently.

Fluid balance assessment showed an intake of 4,550 mL with outputs totaling 750 mL via urine, 450 mL via stool, and 263 mL via TF output. The patient's blood products and NG output were not significant. The patient's current fluid balance is positive at 3,800 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicated elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC) at 341 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 6.7 g/dL, sodium (Na+) at 147 mg/dL, chloride (Cl-) at 1.1 mg/dL, potassium (K+) at 18 mEq/L, magnesium (Mg++) at 61 mg/dL, calcium (Ca++) at 120 mEq/L, and glucose at 177 mg/dL. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level was significantly elevated at 38 mg/dL, while creatinine (Cr) levels were increased at 2.1 mg/dL. Liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were elevated, along with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), amylase, lipase, and D-dimer. Other lab values, including platelet count (Plt), hematocrit (Hct), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR), were within normal limits.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis revealed a pH of 7.18, indicating respiratory acidosis. The patient's condition was complicated by impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, as well as impaired balance, motor function, and muscle performance. The patient also exhibited signs of renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and impaired skin integrity. Acute toxic hepatitis was also noted.

The patient was started on free water intravenous fluid (IVF) to correct hypernatremia, and the free water rate was increased with repeat electrolyte measurements at midnight. A"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient has a medical history of multiple comorbidities and is currently experiencing several medical complications.

1. Fever of unknown origin: The patient has been having cyclical fevers that are stable despite being off antibiotics. The chest X-ray shows improvement, and no focal sources have been identified. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, suggesting that this could be central fever. Further investigations such as abdominal imaging may be necessary if the patient spikes a fever and exhibits leukocytosis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing increased frothy pink sputum, which could indicate fluid overload. The patient has been prescribed Lasix, a diuretic, to address this issue. A stat chest X-ray has also been ordered, and positive pressure may be required if needed. Considering the patient's persistent tachycardia and potential cardiomyopathy, a repeat echo is recommended.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is concerning, and an MRI has shown anoxic features with a prognosis that he is unlikely to recover dramatically. The family has requested a second opinion, and contact has been made with Dr. [Name], who previously saw the patient.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient is currently off dialysis, and the urine output is being monitored.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing respiratory distress and requires suctioning. The patient's vital signs show a fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient's blood glucose levels are fluctuating, with some readings being within normal range and others being elevated. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. There is also evidence of hepatic dysfunction, as suggested by the elevated liver enzymes.

The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, altered mental status, renal failure, and impaired skin integrity. The source of infection is still unknown, and the patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored. The patient's prognosis is poor, with concerns about anoxic brain damage and potential recovery.

The patient is receiving nutritional support through enteral feeding and has multiple lines inserted for medication administration. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, progression of renal failure, worsening hepatic dysfunction, and further decline in mental status."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition is complex, and several potential medical complications can arise. Some of the noted complications include:

1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing cyclical fevers, which are stable even when off all antibiotics. No focal sources have been identified, but there is a possibility of central fever. Further investigation is required to determine the cause.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on the tracheal mask and is showing signs of respiratory distress. There is a concern about the possibility of central respiratory failure, and further evaluation is necessary.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is impaired, and an MRI has shown anoxic features. The prognosis provided by Dr. [First Name (Title) 7307] suggests that there may be limited improvement in the patient's condition.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is being monitored for signs of ARF, and dialysis is being considered based on urine output.

5. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which requires close monitoring and management.

6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has skin blisters, indicating impaired skin integrity, which needs attention and care.

7. Acute Hepatitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating acute hepatitis. Further investigation is needed to"

   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   no pericardial effusion. No vegetation seen (cannot definitively

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has persistent cyclic fevers/leukocytosis and anoxic brain injury. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis: The patient has spiked a fever to 101.9 degrees last night, and pan cultures have been done. Preliminary sputum culture shows multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora. Blood and urine cultures are still pending, as well as CMV viral load testing. If there is an increase in CMV viral load, it will be correlated with liver function tests (LFTs) to consider treatment for CMV. Treatment for CMV will also be considered if the patient continues to have fevers, clinical deterioration, or end-organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on a tracheostomy mask at 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2). The patient is still tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 27-59 breaths per minute. This may be centrally-driven or due to an infectious process, although the chest X-ray is clear. Follow-up culture data will be monitored.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has produced 2.6 liters of urine yesterday with a net positive fluid balance of 2.3 liters."

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He has persistent cyclic fevers/leukocytosis and anoxic brain injury. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 125/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 44 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheal mask at 40% FiO2. 

Medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, mental status/anoxic brain injury, anemia, acute hepatitis, and the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is concern for centrally-driven respiratory failure. Renal function has improved with an output of 2.6 L of urine and a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury, with a poor prognosis and potential for persistent vegetative state. Anemia is present, likely due to chronic blood loss from UGIB. Alcoholic hepatitis is also suspected, with fatty infiltration seen on CT scan and no evidence of distal obstruction. The patient is receiving IV fluids and nutrition, as well as prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers."

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 125/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 44 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on tracheal mask at 40% FiO2. His weight is currently 99.1 kg, down from his admission weight of 113.5 kg. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, antacids, diuretics, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still tachypneic (respiratory rate of 44 breaths per minute) and on tracheal mask at 40% FiO2. This indicates ongoing respiratory distress, which may be centrally-driven or due to an infectious process.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has produced 2.6 L of urine yesterday with a net positive fluid balance of 2.3 L. His creatinine level has improved to 1.0. Close monitoring of urine output (UOP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (Cr) levels is necessary. Another dose"

   Echo ([**7-3**]) - The left atrium is normal in size. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   no pericardial effusion. No vegetation seen (cannot definitively
   exclude).
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-6-5**], there is
   no significant change.
Sputum culture PRELIM
 multiple organisms c/w oropharyngeal flora
Blood/urine cx and CMV VL
 PENDING
Neurology consult (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7307**] - There are still metabolic abnormalities which
may play some role in the neurological assessment, however, the likelihood of me
aningful recovery is low and examination at present suggests that the probable o
utcome will be a persistent vegetative state. Plan at this point should be to tr
eat the toxic metabolic infectious factors and and any ongoing seizures.
   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB, with persistent cyclic
   fevers/leukocytosis and anoxic brain injury.
   # Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis
   - Pt spiked a fever to 101.9 last night.  Pan cultures done.  WBC 11.6
   - Prelim sputum culture c/w oropharyngeal flora
 will f/u
   - Blood and urine cx still pending
 will f/u
   - CMV VL pending
 if increased, will check to see if it correlates
   with an increase in LFTs
 if so, will consider tx of CMV
   - will also consider tx of CMV if pt continues to have fevers, has
   clinical deterioration, or has end organ disfunction
   - CT abdomen?
   # Respiratory failure
 Pt is on trach mask at 40% FIO2.
   - Pt is still tachypneic.  (RR 27-59).
   - Considering pt
s neuro findings, this may be centrally-driven.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] also be d/t an infectious process
 will follow up culture data
   # Acute renal failure
   - pt put out 2.6 L urine yesterday.
 I/O net positive 2.3 L
   -Cr improved at 1.0.
   - will continue to follow UOP, BUN, and Cr
   - Will give pt another dose of Lasix today - 40 mg IV to try to get
   some fluid off
   # Mental status/anoxic brain injury
 pt had MRI that showed diffuse
   subacute anoxic injury involving the basal ganglia and cortex
   - poor prognosis per neuro with likely long term prognosis persistent
   vegetative state.
   - Second neuro opinion confirmed poor prognosis
   # Anemia
   - Hct stable
   - continue to monitor Hct
   # Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal obstruction.
   - will continue to trend LFT
s and correlate with CMV load
   - AST/ALT on [**7-4**] were 60 and 85, which is improved from previous
   overall
 will correlated with CMV VL
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, Nutren at 50 ml/hr.  Given volume
   status will discuss with nutrition if possible to concentrate further.

","Summary:
- 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism
- Acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB)
- Persistent cyclic fevers/leukocytosis and anoxic brain injury
- Currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications

Potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient has had cyclic fevers/leukocytosis, which suggests an ongoing infection. The pending blood/urine culture results will help identify the specific pathogens involved. The preliminary sputum culture shows multiple organisms similar to oropharyngeal flora. Treatment will depend on the culture results.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on a tracheal mask at 40% FiO2 due to respiratory failure. Tachypnea (RR 27-59) may be centrally-driven or due to an infectious process. Further evaluation and follow-up of culture data are necessary.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has produced 2.6 liters of urine yesterday, with a net positive fluid balance of 2.3 liters. His creatinine level has improved to 1.0. Continued monitoring of urine output, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine is recommended. Another dose of Lasix (40 mg IV) will be given to attempt to remove excess fluid.

4. Mental status/anoxic brain injury: The patient had an MRI showing diffuse subacute anoxic injury involving the basal ganglia"

 HEPATITIS, ACUTE TOXIC (INCLUDING ALCOHOLIC, ACETAMINOPHEN, ETC.)
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB, with persistent cyclic
   fevers/leukocytosis and anoxic brain injury.
   # Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis
 Tmax 100.9 overnight.  WBC at 11.1.
   - will tolerate slight fevers as long as patient does not have clinical
   deterioration (hypotension/other) or WBC elevations
   - off abx
   - Cdiff negative [**6-27**]
   - sputum cultures
 moderate growth GNR resembling acinetobacter
   (susceptibilities done).  Likely colonization.
   - will recheck sputum cultures
   - blood cultures pending from [**6-27**] & [**6-28**]
   - will not start gancyclovir at this point - CMV not likely cause of
   fevers. Will continue to follow LFTs and if rising will see if
   correlates with CMV viral load.  If so, will discuss with renal and ID.
   -CMV viral load to be drawn with 7/1 AM labs.
   - Will order an abdominal CT in the next few days to reevaluate
   peripancreatic fluid.
   # Respiratory failure
 Pt is on trach mask at 40% FIO2.
   - Pt is still tachypneic.  (RR 27-40).
   - Considering pt
s neuro findings, this may be centrally-driven.
   # Acute renal failure
   - pt put out 0.75 L urine yesterday;
   -Cr now 1.1 continuing to trend down.
   - will continue to follow UOP, BUN, and Cr
   # Mental status/anoxic brain injury
 pt had MRI that showed diffuse
   subacute anoxic injury involving the basal ganglia and cortex
   - poor prognosis per neuro with likely long term prognosis persistent
   vegetative state.
   - Family requesting second opinion regarding long term prognosis.  This
   will be coordinated by attending physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 202**].
   # Anemia
   - Hct stable
   - continue to monitor Hct
   # Acute Hepatitis: Likely alcoholic hepatitis.  CT scan shows fatty
   infiltration, and no evidence of distal obstruction.
   - will continue to trend LFT
s and correlate with CMV load
   - check LFT
s with 7/1 AM labs to correlate with CMV load
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, Nutren at 50 ml/hr.  Given volume
   status will discuss with nutrition if possible to concentrate further.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism. He presents with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has been experiencing persistent cyclic fevers/leukocytosis and anoxic brain injury. He is currently in the ICU with various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA): The patient has had recurrent fevers, which could indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation.
2. IMPAIRED BALANCE, MOTOR FUNCTION, MUSCLE PERFORMANCE, RESPIRATION/GAS EXCHANGE: Due to the anoxic brain injury, the patient has impaired balance, motor function, muscle performance, and respiration/gas exchange.
3. RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): The patient shows signs of acute renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output.
4. SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): Given the patient's history of alcoholism, recurrent infections, and the presence of sepsis, there is a risk of severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.
5. IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY: The patient has skin blisters due to an allergic reaction to meropenem.
6. HEPATITIS, ACUTE TOXIC (INCLUDING ALCOHOLIC, ACETAMINOPHEN, ETC.): The patient has acute hepatitis, which could be related to alcohol abuse or other toxic causes.
7. PANCREATITIS: The patient also has pancreatitis, which can be associated with alcohol abuse.

Please note that this is a summary of the progress note, and further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional are necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment."

   1.           Cyclical fevers:  stable off all ABX, CXR is improved and
   no focal sources. Overall stable WBC and this could be central. Should
   he spike and leukocytosis will pan cx, consider repeat abd imaging.
   2.       Resp Failure:  today with increased frothy pink sputum, ?
   volume overload. Will RX lasix, stat CXR, positive pressure if need
   be.  Would repeat echo since he has been persistenyl tachy and could
   have cardiomyopathy
 no echo since [**2131-6-5**]
   3.       Altered Mental status: MRI with concerning anoxic features and
   prognosis from Dr [**First Name (STitle) 7307**] was he could improve slightly but unlikely to
   recover dramatically. Family would like 2nd opinion and we will contact
   Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) **] who had seen him previously.
   4.            ARF: resolved, off HD, start po lasix to match I and O

","The patient is a [age]-year-old male who was admitted with altered mental status and fever. The patient has a history of sepsis, acute renal failure, impaired respiration, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's current condition is stable, with a fever of 101.9°F and tachycardia. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/61 mmHg to 144/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, slightly elevated platelet count, increased creatinine level, elevated blood glucose level, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's physical examination reveals impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, as well as impaired balance, motor function, muscle performance, and respiration/gas exchange. 

The patient's assessment and plan include fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and potential problems related to cyclical fevers, respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute toxic hepatitis, and volume overload. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of sepsis, further deterioration of renal function, respiratory failure, and potential neurological decline."

   1.           Cyclical fevers:  Temp to 101.9 again last PM but stable
   WBC and CXR, pan cx. stable off all ABX, CXR is improved and no focal
   sources. Overall stable WBC and this could be central. We will follow
   cx, follow up CMV viral load, LFTS, we can consider abd imaging but my
   sense is that in the absence of exam change IR or surgery would be
   loathe to intervent on pancreas unless systemically ill and thus
   imaging alone is not helpful at this point. Should fevers persist or he
   deteriorate we can re evaluate.
   2.       Resp Failure:  yesterday with increased frothy pink sputum, ?
   volume overload. But CXR without infiltrate and echo WNL. He is
   positive everyday so may just be secrtions
 we will start lasix to
   keep closer to even and reduce obligate ins.
   3.       Altered Mental status: MRI with concerning anoxic features and
   prognosis from Dr [**First Name (STitle) 7307**] was he could improve slightly but unlikely to
   recover dramatically. Family would like 2nd opinion and we will contact
   Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) **] who will see him today.
   4.            ARF: resolved, off HD, start po lasix to match I and O
   more closely
   5.            Transaminitis: follow LFTS and CMV viral load

   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB, with persistent cyclic
   fevers/leukocytosis and anoxic brain injury.
   # Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis
   - Tmax 99.8 over past 24hrs.  WBC 10.3
   - Prelim sputum culture c/w oropharyngeal flora
 continues to be same
   as priors and thought to be colonization
   - Blood and urine cx still pending from [**7-3**].  Prior blood cx are
   negative.
   - CMV VL pending
 LFT
s were down making a correlation between an
   increased VL and LFT
s moot/negative but will follow up VL
   - will consider tx of CMV if pt continues to have fevers, has clinical
   deterioration, or has end organ dysfunction
   - [**Month (only) 8**] be due to necrotic pancreas or process in the peripancreatic
   fluid and thus may still require a CT if Pt develops high fevers.
   # Respiratory failure
 Pt is on trach mask at 40% FIO2.
   - Pt is still tachypneic.  (RR 27-59).
   - Considering pt
s neuro findings, this may be centrally-driven.
   # Acute renal failure
   - pt put out 2.6 L urine yesterday.
 I/O net positive 2.3 L
   -Cr improved at 0.8
   - will continue to follow UOP, BUN, and Cr
   - Will start pt on PO lasix at 40 mg daily
   # Mental status/anoxic brain injury
 pt had MRI that showed diffuse
   subacute anoxic injury involving the basal ganglia and cortex
   - poor prognosis per neuro with likely long term prognosis persistent
   vegetative state.
   - Second neuro opinion appreciated and noted that while it is hopeful
   it is unlikely to recover to baseline function and at present Pt should
   be placed at a facility that can monitor his progress such that if he
   achieves a level of function at which he is able to participate in
   neuro rehab he could be transferred to a facility able to provide said

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism.
- He has been admitted to the ICU with acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).
- The patient is experiencing cyclic fevers and leukocytosis, with a recent temperature of 99.8°F and WBC count of 10.3.
- There is a pending CMV viral load (VL) test, and the patient may be considered for antiviral treatment if he continues to have fevers, shows clinical deterioration, or has end organ dysfunction.
- The patient's respiratory function is compromised, requiring supplemental oxygen via tracheal mask at 40% FIO2 due to tachypnea and potential central nervous system involvement.
- Acute renal failure is present, but the patient has improved urine output and a decreasing creatinine level.
- The patient has mental status changes and anoxic brain injury, with an MRI showing diffuse subacute anoxic injury involving the basal ganglia and cortex. Neuro prognosis is poor, with a likely persistent vegetative state.
- Anemia is noted, with stable hematocrit (Hct) levels.
- The patient likely has alcoholic hepatitis, with improved liver function tests (LFTs) on [**7-4**].

   Assessment and Plan
   28 year old male with a history of alcoholism presenting with acute
   hepatitis, pancreatitis, and UGIB, with persistent cyclic
   fevers/leukocytosis and anoxic brain injury.
   # Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis
   - Tmax 99.8 over past 24hrs.  WBC 10.3
   - Prelim sputum culture c/w oropharyngeal flora
 continues to be same
   as priors and thought to be colonization
   - Blood and urine cx still pending from [**7-3**].  Prior blood cx are
   negative.
   - CMV VL pending
 LFT

   increased VL and LFT
s moot/negative but will follow up VL
   - will consider tx of CMV if pt continues to have fevers, has clinical
   deterioration, or has end organ dysfunction
   - [**Month (only) 8**] be due to necrotic pancreas or process in the peripancreatic
   fluid and thus may still require an CT.
   # Respiratory failure
 Pt is on trach mask at 40% FIO2.
   - Pt is still tachypneic.  (RR 27-59).
   - Considering pt
s neuro findings, this may be centrally-driven.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] also be d/t an infectious process, although clear CXR makes this
   unlikely and negative blood cx.

   # Acute renal failure
   - pt put out 2.6 L urine yesterday.
 I/O net positive 2.3 L
   -Cr improved at 0.8
   - will continue to follow UOP, BUN, and Cr
   - Will start pt on PO lasix at 40 mg daily
   - will also decrease free water boluses to 100mL q4 hrs
   # Mental status/anoxic brain injury
 pt had MRI that showed diffuse
   subacute anoxic injury involving the basal ganglia and cortex
   - poor prognosis per neuro with likely long term prognosis persistent
   vegetative state.
   - Second neuro opinion appreciated and nonted that while it is hopeful
   it is unlikely to recover to baseline function and at present Pt should
   be placed at a facility that can monitor his progress such that if he
   achieves a level of function at which he is able to participate in
   neuro rehab he could be transferred to a facility able to provide said
   services.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of alcoholism. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He also has persistent cyclic fevers/leukocytosis and anoxic brain injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cyclic fevers/leukocytosis: The patient has had elevated temperatures and white blood cell count. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, with preliminary sputum culture showing oropharyngeal flora colonization. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and consideration will be given to treating cytomegalovirus (CMV) if the patient continues to have fevers, shows clinical deterioration, or experiences end-organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on a tracheostomy mask with 40% FiO2 and is still tachypneic. There may be a central cause for the respiratory failure, possibly due to the anoxic brain injury. An infectious process is also possible, although less likely given the clear chest X-ray and negative blood cultures. Waiting for culture data to make further decisions.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has produced 2.6 liters of urine yesterday, with a net positive fluid balance of 2.3 liters. Creatinine has improved to 0.8, and plans are to continue monitoring urine output, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels. The patient will"

   started ABX< no new cx data. We will follow cx, follow up CMV viral
   load, LFTS. The question of repeat abd imaging has been raised but my
   sense is that in the absence of exam change, systemic illness,  IR or
   surgery would be loathe to intervent on pancreas and thus imaging alone
   is not helpful at this point. Should fevers persist or he deteriorate
   we can re evaluate.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient had cyclical fevers but was afebrile for the past 24 hours. It is important to monitor the patient's temperature and investigate the cause of the fever if it recurs.

2. Impaired Arousal, Attention, and Cognition: The patient has impaired mental status, which may be due to anoxic brain injury. The prognosis for recovery is poor, but there is a possibility of some improvement with time.

3. Impaired Balance: The patient is experiencing balance issues, which can be attributed to the impaired mental status and potential neurological damage.

4. Impaired Motor Function: The patient has impaired motor function, which could be related to the anoxic brain injury and potential damage to the motor areas of the brain.

5. Impaired Muscle Performance: The patient's muscle performance is impaired, which may be a result of the impaired motor function and neurological damage.

6. Impaired Respiration/Gas Exchange: The patient is on a tracheostomy mask and continues to have persistent tachypnea, indicating impaired respiration and gas exchange. Central-mediated respiratory failure is suspected.

7. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient previously had acute renal failure, but it has resolved, and the patient is now off dialysis. However, careful monitoring of renal function"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. These include pancreatitis, respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, impaired motor function, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, acute renal failure, severe sepsis, impaired skin integrity, acute toxic hepatitis, and potential complications related to COVID-19.

The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and various interventions are being implemented to manage these complications. These include the administration of antibiotics, fluid management with Lasix, monitoring of liver function tests and CMV viral load, consideration of abdominal imaging, and the use of a tracheostomy for respiratory support.

Given the severity of the patient's condition, it is important to continue closely monitoring their vital signs, lab results, and clinical progress. Multidisciplinary care involving physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals will be crucial in managing these complex medical complications."

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has pancreatitis and respiratory failure.
- The patient's Neuro prognosis is severe anxiety, but the extent of recovery remains uncertain. They are a candidate for LTAC.
- The patient has allergies to meropenem and skin blisters.
- The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2131-7-4**] at 12:02 PM.
- The patient is receiving infusions of Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis and Famotidine (Pepcid) at 12:03 PM.
- Other medications being administered include those for ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/85 to 144/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient is on respiratory support with a tracheal mask and has a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) value.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,401 mL and output of 2,670 mL since 12 AM, with a negative balance of -269 mL.
- The patient's weight is currently 98.6 kg, down from 113.5 kg at admission.
- The patient's blood products show a total in of 888 mL and out of 950 mL.
- The patient's urine output is within normal limits.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are normal.
- The patient's physical examination reveals coarse bilateral breath sounds, slight tremulousness, and 1+ edema.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), creatinine (Cr), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and C-reactive protein (CRP), along with decreased levels of platelets (Plt), albumin, potassium (K+), and magnesium (Mg++).
- The patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory results indicate potential medical complications such as fever of unknown origin (FUO), impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, impaired motor function, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, acute renal failure (ARF), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and impaired skin integrity.
- The patient's medical issues include cyclical fevers, respiratory failure, altered mental status, ARF, transaminitis, and CMV infection.
- The patient's plan of care includes monitoring the fever and conducting further investigations, managing respiratory failure with Lasix to reduce volume overload, obtaining a second opinion for altered mental status, continuing renal replacement therapy, following liver function tests and CMV viral load, and implementing infection control precautions.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate assessments and potential medical complications."
