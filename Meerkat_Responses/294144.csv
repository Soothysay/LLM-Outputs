","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and subsequent management. The patient has been mechanically ventilated since admission. Recent interventions include placement of an arterial line, bronchoscopy, and MRI/MRA.

The patient's current vital signs show a blood pressure of 147/49 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2. The patient is still hypernatremic with a sodium level of 149 mEq/L. Chest X-ray reveals moderate bilateral pleural effusions without enhancement and collapsed lower lobes of the lungs. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (450 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin level (8.1 g/dL), elevated potassium level (5.4 mEq/L), and normal glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's condition continues to be complicated by respiratory failure, pericardial effusion without tamponade, dysphagia, ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation, acute diastolic heart failure, and hypernatremia. The patient remains on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4569**] is a 70 yo male with Type 2 DM, HTN, BPH, CHF, A. fib,
   admitted for tamponade, now s/p pericardial drain with PNA and possible
   CVA, and now transfered to the MICU for resp distress with incrased
   somulence requiring intubation.
   .
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: Patient more tachypnic and solumnolent
   (likely secondary to sedating medications). In addition he had
   increased mucus secretions and was at high risk for aspiration. Initial
   CXR showed a white out of his left lung, which may be secondary to
   mucus plugging. Pt is also being treated for an underlying PNA with
   zosyn, started [**1-10**]. At baseline the pt may have resp disease due to a
   long hx of tobacco use. New infection is possible, but pt has been
   afebrile and BP stable, so likely more an obstructive process. ABG
   improved to 7.32/62/119 after intubation. Bronch and blood/urine/sputum
   samples so far unrevealing. CT chest/abd cuts showed large pleural
   effusions
   - Consider IP consult or aggressive diuresis for pleural effusions
   (although likely overdiuresed, hypernatremic)
   - continue zosyn for now (Last day of 10 day course: [**2107-1-20**])
   - Hold further zyprexa and haldol
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   # Expressive aphasia/AM- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA per
   neuro. New worsening MS is concerning for either delerium vs new
   cerbral vascular event. No new focal findings, but pt was not
   cooperative with exam prior to intubation. MRI/MRA yesterday negative
   for acute processes so ?delirium/toxic metabolic as etiology for his
   symptoms
   - Appreciate neurology following
   - Restarting anticoagulation given subtherapeutic INR today and no
   acute intracranial bleed seen on MRI
   - BP control
   # Hypernatremia- Likely due to decreased free water intake in setting
   of dysphagia and lack of NGT and being on lasix. Free water deficit of
   ~1.5 liters today. Slightly improved from Na 151
 149. Received D5W at
   100/hr X1L after D5W with bicarb and 500cc of D5W in KCl repletion, D5W
   still running
   - PM lytes for correcting sodium
   .
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Pt likely
   aspirated last night, [**Last Name **] problem above. Pt has failed a swallow
   study.  Started tube feeds overnight
   - Discuss with GI vs. IR re: PEG tube placement now that INR
   subtherapeutic
   .
   #. A. fib/Bradycardia- new onset prior to OSH admission. Thought to be
   [**1-18**] his CHF and diuresis. Now in sinus. Seems to have runs of sinus
   brady as well as junctional rhythms. Has been anticoagulated due to
   recent cardioembolic stroke.
   - supratheraputic INR so holding coumadin
   - consider restarting dig if needed
   - will give PO dilt with OG tube
   # CHF: Diastolic HF, had been tx for last month with lasix. Now appears
   over diuresed due to hypernatremia.
   - Will continue gentle IVF to correct Na
   - Hold lasix for now
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cutlures were negative. Could
   have been viral or autoimmune. Pt has some renal failure, but not
   likely severe enough to develop efuusion [**1-18**] to this. Pt is now s/p
   pericardial drain. TSH was normal.
   - Monitor clinically for reaccumulation of pericardial effusion
   - Cardiology following
   .
   # DM2- On metformin at home.
   - ISS, follow fingersticks  especially on D5W
   .
   # HTN- Was on lopressor & nifedipine at home, then had been on
   amlodipine in-house when pt had prior PO access. BP now stable.
   Restarted amlodipine yesterday
   - Continue Diltiazem but consider decreasing dose (currently Dilt 60
   TID)
   # BPH/hematuria- Hematuria improving
   - Will need outpatient cystoscopy
   - Continue foley for now since intubated
   - Resume flomax prior to foley removal
   .
   # FEN: will start tube feeds today once done with [**Last Name (un) **], on D5W

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for cardiac tamponade and underwent pericardial drainage. He is now experiencing respiratory distress and has been intubated. The patient also has hypercarbic respiratory failure, expressive aphasia, hypernatremia, dysphagia, atrial fibrillation with bradycardia, heart failure (diastolic), pericardial effusion, diabetes mellitus type 2, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and subsequent intubation indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure. It is important to monitor his oxygenation and ventilation parameters closely.
2. Pericardial Effusion: The patient had a pericardial effusion, which required drainage. Monitoring for reaccumulation of the effusion is crucial.
3. Dysphagia: The patient's dysphagia may increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Ensuring proper airway protection and feeding techniques are essential.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke): The patient's expressive aphasia and potential"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4569**] is a 70 yo male with Type 2 DM, HTN, BPH, CHF, A. fib,
   admitted for tamponade, now s/p pericardial drain with PNA and possible
   CVA, and now transfered to the MICU for resp distress with incrased
   somulence requiring intubation.
   .
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: Patient more tachypnic and solumnolent
   (likely secondary to sedating medications). In addition he had
   increased mucus secretions and was at high risk for aspiration. Initial
   CXR showed a white out of his left lung, which may be secondary to
   mucus plugging. Pt is also being treated for an underlying PNA with
   zosyn, started [**1-10**]. At baseline the pt may have resp disease due to a
   long hx of tobacco use. New infection is possible, but pt has been
   afebrile and BP stable, so likely more an obstructive process. ABG
   improved to 7.32/62/119 after intubation. Bronch and blood/urine/sputum
   samples so far unrevealing. CT chest/abd cuts showed large pleural
   effusions
   - Consider IP consult or aggressive diuresis for pleural effusions
   (although likely overdiuresed, hypernatremic)
   - continue zosyn for now (Last day of 10 day course: [**2107-1-20**])
   - Hold further zyprexa and haldol
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   # Expressive aphasia/AM- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA per
   neuro. New worsening MS is concerning for either delerium vs new
   cerbral vascular event. No new focal findings, but pt was not
   cooperative with exam prior to intubation. MRI/MRA yesterday negative
   for acute processes so ?delirium/toxic metabolic in addition to recent
   cardioembolic stroke as etiology for his symptoms
   - Appreciate neurology following
   - Restarting anticoagulation given subtherapeutic INR today and no
   acute intracranial bleed seen on MRI
   - BP control
   #. A. fib/Bradycardia- new onset prior to OSH admission. Thought to be
   [**1-18**] his CHF and diuresis. Now in sinus. Seems to have runs of sinus
   brady as well as junctional rhythms. Has been anticoagulated due to
   recent cardioembolic stroke.
   - Follow-up Cards recs
   - Consider restarting dig if needed
   - Continue PO Dilt via OG tube but ?decreasing dose given overnight
   tachybrady
   - Atropine at bedside
   # Hypernatremia- Likely due to decreased free water intake in setting
   of dysphagia and lack of NGT and being on lasix. Free water deficit of
   ~1.5 liters today. Slightly improved from Na 151
 149. Received D5W at
   100/hr X1L after D5W with bicarb and 500cc of D5W in KCl repletion, D5W
   still running
   - PM lytes for correcting sodium
   .
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Pt likely
   aspirated last night, [**Last Name **] problem above. Pt has failed a swallow
   study.  Started tube feeds overnight
   - Discuss with GI vs. IR re: PEG tube placement now that INR
   subtherapeutic
   .
   # CHF: Diastolic HF, had been tx for last month with lasix. Now appears
   over diuresed due to hypernatremia.
   - Will continue gentle IVF to correct Na
   - Hold lasix for now
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cutlures were negative. Could
   have been viral or autoimmune. Pt has some renal failure, but not
   likely severe enough to develop efuusion [**1-18**] to this. Pt is now s/p
   pericardial drain. TSH was normal.
   - Monitor clinically for reaccumulation of pericardial effusion
   - Cardiology following
   .
   # DM2- On metformin at home.
   - ISS, follow fingersticks  especially on D5W
   .
   # HTN- Was on lopressor & nifedipine at home, then had been on
   amlodipine in-house when pt had prior PO access. BP now stable.
   Restarted amlodipine yesterday
   - Continue Diltiazem but consider decreasing dose (currently Dilt 60
   TID)
   # BPH/hematuria- Hematuria improving
   - Will need outpatient cystoscopy
   - Continue foley for now since intubated
   - Resume flomax prior to foley removal
   .
   # FEN: will start tube feeds today once done with [**Last Name (un) **], on D5W

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including Type 2 DM, HTN, BPH, CHF, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for cardiac tamponade and underwent pericardial drainage. He also has pneumonia and a possible CVA (stroke). The patient required intubation due to respiratory distress and increased sputum production. He is currently in the MICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's ABG showed a low pH indicating respiratory acidosis, which suggests hypoventilation leading to increased CO2 levels in the blood.
2. Pleural effusions: The CT chest/abdomen cuts revealed large bilateral pleural effusions. This could be due to an underlying infection or heart failure.
3. Expressive aphasia/AM: The patient has expressive aphasia and altered mental status, likely secondary to a cardioembolic CVA. Further evaluation by neurology is recommended.
4. Bradycardia: The patient has a history of bradycardia, which may be related to his CHF and diuretic use. Atropine has been ordered at the bedside.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, likely due to decreased free water intake, dysphagia, and diuretic use. Free water deficit is being corrected with D5W.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4569**] is a 70 yo male with Type 2 DM, HTN, BPH, CHF, A. fib,
   admitted for tamponade, now s/p pericardial drain with PNA and possible
   CVA, and now transfered to the MICU for resp distress with incrased
   somulence requiring intubation.
   .
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: Patient less tachypnic and solumnolent
   (likely secondary to sedating medications). In addition he has improved
   mucus secretions/pulmonary status after bronch although scant
   secretions were found. Initial CXR showed a white out of his left lung,
   which may be secondary to mucus plugging that has since improved on
   ventilation. Pt is also being treated for an underlying PNA with zosyn,
   started [**1-10**]. At baseline the pt may have resp disease due to a long hx
   of tobacco use. New infection is possible, but pt has been afebrile and
   BP stable, so likely more an obstructive process. ABG improved to
   7.32/62/119 after intubation and continues to improve (mild alkalosis
   today on ABG that responded well to decreasing RR). Bronch and
   blood/urine/sputum samples so far unrevealing. CT chest/abd cuts showed
   large pleural effusions
   - Thoracentesis for pleural effusion management and diagnosis
   - Order serologies for concern of systemic processes (connective
   tissues vs. malignancy vs. viral)
   - Discontinue Zosyn (last day of 10 day course: [**2107-1-20**])
   - Hold further zyprexa and haldol
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   # Expressive aphasia/AM- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA per
   neuro. New worsening MS is concerning for either delirium vs new
   cerebral vascular event. MRI/MRA yesterday negative for acute processes
   so ?delirium/toxic metabolic in addition to recent cardioembolic stroke
   as etiology for his symptoms
   - Appreciate neurology following
   - Restarting anticoagulation given subtherapeutic INR today after
   planned procedures ([**Female First Name (un) 217**]/PEG) and no acute intracranial bleed seen on
   MRI
   - BP control
   #. A. fib/Bradycardia- new onset prior to OSH admission. Thought to be
   [**1-18**] his CHF and diuresis. Now in sinus. Seems to have runs of sinus
   brady as well as junctional rhythms. Has been anticoagulated due to
   recent cardioembolic stroke.
   - Follow-up Cards recs regarding heart rate management and ?serositis
   given pericardial tamponade as well
   - Consider restarting dig if needed
   - Continue PO Dilt via OG tube but ?decreasing dose given overnight
   tachybrady
 will discuss with Cards first
   - Atropine at bedside
   # Hypernatremia- Likely due to decreased free water intake in setting
   of dysphagia and lack of NGT and being on lasix. Free water deficit of
   ~1.5 liters today. Slightly improved from Na 151
 149. Received D5W at
   100/hr X1L after D5W with bicarb and 500cc of D5W in KCl repletion, D5W
   still running
   - PM lytes for correcting sodium
   .
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Pt likely
   aspirated which, in conjunction with large, ?gradual pleural effusions
   caused his acute respiratory distress issues. Pt has failed a swallow
   study.  Started tube feeds overnight after bronch.
   - Discuss with re: PEG tube placement now that INR subtherapeutic
   - Will restart anti-coagulation after procedures today
   .
   # CHF: Diastolic HF, had been tx for last month with lasix. Differing
   EFs, however, between OSH and inpatient ECHOs.
   - Hold lasix for now and continue to monitor clinically
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cultures were negative. Could
   have been viral or autoimmune. Pt has some renal failure, but not
   likely severe enough to develop effusion [**1-18**] to this. Pt is now s/p
   pericardial drain. TSH was normal.
   - Monitor clinically for reaccumulation of pericardial effusion
   - Cardiology following and will discuss with them today

   - ISS, follow fingersticks  especially on D5W
   .
   # HTN- Was on lopressor & nifedipine at home, then had been on

   Restarted amlodipine yesterday with good effect
   - Continue Diltiazem but consider decreasing dose (currently Dilt 60
   TID)
   # BPH/hematuria- Hematuria improving
   - Will need outpatient cystoscopy
   - Continue foley for now since intubated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including Type 2 DM, HTN, BPH, CHF, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted for cardiac tamponade and subsequently developed pneumonia and a possible CVA (cerebrovascular accident or stroke). He was intubated due to respiratory distress and now requires mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, dysphagia, atrial fibrillation with bradycardia, hypernatremia, and a history of congestive heart failure. He also has a pericardial effusion that has been drained and large bilateral pleural effusions. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Stroke: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent CVA, there is a risk of recurrent stroke or progression of neurological deficits.

3. Cardiac Tamponade: Although the pericardial effusion has been drained, there is a possibility of reaccumulation or development of recurrent tamponade.

4. Pleural Effusion: The large bilateral pleural effusions may require thoracentesis for management and diagnosis.

5. Delirium: The patient's mental status changes could be attributed to delirium, metabolic disturbances,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for cardiac tamponade, now post-pericardial drain, with pneumonia and possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to respiratory distress and increased somnolence requiring intubation. The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, dysphagia, acute stroke, atrial fibrillation, diastolic heart failure, hypernatremia, pericardial effusion without tamponade, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, as indicated by his hypercarbic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the pleural effusions recur or if there is a new infection.
2. Stroke: The patient has had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), which has resulted in expressive aphasia and possible worsening mini-mental state (MS). There is a potential for another stroke due to the presence of atrial fibrillation and the patient's underlying cardiovascular conditions.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's new-onset atrial fibrillation needs to be managed to prevent further complications such as thromboembolic events.

   # Hypercarbic resp failure: Had been doing well on CPAP/PSV from 0800
   AM [**1-20**] to 0200 [**1-21**], but with downward tending minute volume. At 0200
   put back on vent for ABG 7.22/85/117. CXR: RLL haziness compared to
   [**1-20**]; derecruited? Something brewing? No PTX. Ride side was where
   effusion tapped. Pleural effusion looks larger too. (Off Zosyn 1 day).
   Repeat ABG was 7.38/58/133. Note elevated WBC (8->13).
   -          Restarted Zosyn in case this an early pneumonia about to
   reblossom

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and a recent pericardial drain for idiopathic effusion. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with pneumonia, large bilateral pleural effusions, possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and respiratory distress requiring intubation.

The patient's condition has been fluctuating. Initially, he was doing well on CPAP/PSV but then developed hypercarbic respiratory failure and was placed back on the ventilator. A thoracentesis was performed, revealing exudates in the pleural fluid. The patient's ABG showed a low pH level, indicating respiratory acidosis. The chest X-ray revealed right lower lobe haziness, suggesting possible pneumonia or fluid accumulation.

The patient's white blood cell count has been increasing, indicating a possible infection. He was restarted on antibiotics, but his sputum culture results are pending. The patient's renal function tests are abnormal, showing elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. His liver function tests are also abnormal, with elevated liver enzymes.

The patient's neurological status has been declining, with expressive aphasia and altered mental status (AMS). An MRI/MRA of the brain was negative for acute processes, leaving the cause of the AMS unclear. The patient had an episode of brad"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 4569**] is a 70 yo male with Type 2 DM, HTN, BPH, CHF, A. fib,
   admitted for tamponade, now s/p pericardial drain with PNA and possible
   CVA, and now transfered to the MICU for resp distress with incrased
   somulence requiring intubation.
   .
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: Patient less tachypnic and solumnolent
   (likely secondary to sedating medications). In addition he has improved
   mucus secretions/pulmonary status after bronch although scant
   secretions were found. Initial CXR showed a white out of his left lung,
   which may be secondary to mucus plugging that has since improved on
   ventilation. Pt is also being treated for an underlying PNA with zosyn,
   started [**1-10**]. At baseline the pt may have resp disease due to a long hx
   of tobacco use. New infection is possible, but pt has been afebrile and
   BP stable, so likely more an obstructive process. ABG improved to
   7.32/62/119 after intubation and continues to improve (mild alkalosis
   today on ABG that responded well to decreasing RR). Bronch and
   blood/urine/sputum samples so far unrevealing. CT chest/abd cuts showed
   large pleural effusions
   - Thoracentesis for pleural effusion management and diagnosis
   - Order serologies for concern of systemic processes (connective
   tissues vs. malignancy vs. viral)

   recent cardioembolic stroke.
   - Follow-up Cards recs regarding heart rate management and ?serositis

   # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cultures were negative. Could
   have been viral or autoimmune. Pt has some renal failure, but not
   likely severe enough to develop effusion [**1-18**] to this. Pt is now s/p
   pericardial drain. TSH was normal.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), hypertension (HTN), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient was admitted for cardiac tamponade, which required a pericardial drain. He also has pneumonia (PNA) and a possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), leading to his transfer to the MICU for respiratory distress.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues:

1. Pleural effusion, acute: The patient has large pleural effusions that required thoracentesis for management and diagnosis. Further serologies will be ordered to investigate systemic processes such as connective tissue diseases, malignancy, or viral infections.

2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory status has improved after intubation and mechanical ventilation. An initial chest X-ray showed white-out of his left lung, possibly due to mucus plugging. This has since improved with ventilation.

3. Pericardial effusion (without tamponade): The patient had an unclear etiology pericardial effusion that was drained. Cultures were negative, suggesting a viral or autoimmune etiology. The patient will be monitored for reaccumulation of the effusion.

4. Dysphagia: The patient's dysphagia is"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 4569**] is a 70 yo male with Type 2 DM, HTN, BPH, CHF, A. fib,
   admitted for tamponade, now s/p pericardial drain with PNA and possible
   CVA, and now transfered to the MICU for resp distress with incrased
   somulence requiring intubation.
   .
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: Patient less tachypnic and solumnolent
   (likely secondary to sedating medications). In addition he has improved
   mucus secretions/pulmonary status after bronch although scant
   secretions were found. Initial CXR showed a white out of his left lung,
   which may be secondary to mucus plugging that has since improved on
   ventilation. Pt is also being treated for an underlying PNA with zosyn,
   started [**1-10**]. At baseline the pt may have resp disease due to a long hx
   of tobacco use. New infection is possible, but pt has been afebrile and
   BP stable, so likely more an obstructive process. ABG improved to
   7.32/62/119 after intubation and continues to improve (mild alkalosis
   today on ABG that responded well to decreasing RR). Bronch and
   blood/urine/sputum samples so far unrevealing. CT chest/abd cuts showed
   large pleural effusions
   - Thoracentesis for pleural effusion management and diagnosis
   - Order serologies for concern of systemic processes (connective
   tissues vs. malignancy vs. viral)
   - Discontinue Zosyn (last day of 10 day course: [**2107-1-20**])
   - Hold further zyprexa and haldol
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   # Expressive aphasia/AM- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA per
   neuro. New worsening MS is concerning for either delirium vs new
   cerebral vascular event. MRI/MRA yesterday negative for acute processes
   so ?delirium/toxic metabolic in addition to recent cardioembolic stroke
   as etiology for his symptoms
   - Appreciate neurology following
   - Restarting anticoagulation given subtherapeutic INR today after
   planned procedures ([**Female First Name (un) 217**]/PEG) and no acute intracranial bleed seen on
   MRI
   - BP control
   #. A. fib/Bradycardia- new onset prior to OSH admission. Thought to be
   [**1-18**] his CHF and diuresis. Now in sinus. Seems to have runs of sinus
   brady as well as junctional rhythms. Has been anticoagulated due to
   recent cardioembolic stroke.
   Cards: brady likely vagal w/ETT. No further recs re effusion. Change
   standing Dilt to IV prn. Anticoag. EP f/u once stable for ablation
   - Consider restarting dig if needed
   - Continue PO Dilt via OG tube but ?decreasing dose given overnight
   tachybrady
 will discuss with Cards first
   - Atropine at bedside
   # Hypernatremia- Likely due to decreased free water intake in setting
   of dysphagia and lack of NGT and being on lasix. Free water deficit of
   ~1.5 liters today. Slightly improved from Na 151
 149. Received D5W at
   100/hr X1L after D5W with bicarb and 500cc of D5W in KCl repletion, D5W
   still running
   - PM lytes for correcting sodium
   .
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Pt likely
   aspirated which, in conjunction with large, ?gradual pleural effusions
   caused his acute respiratory distress issues. Pt has failed a swallow
   study.  Started tube feeds overnight after bronch.
   - Discuss with re: PEG tube placement now that INR subtherapeutic
   - Will restart anti-coagulation after procedures today
   .
   # CHF: Diastolic HF, had been tx for last month with lasix. Differing
   EFs, however, between OSH and inpatient ECHOs.
   - Hold lasix for now and continue to monitor clinically
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cultures were negative. Could
   have been viral or autoimmune. Pt has some renal failure, but not
   likely severe enough to develop effusion [**1-18**] to this. Pt is now s/p
   pericardial drain. TSH was normal.
   - Monitor clinically for reaccumulation of pericardial effusion
   - Cardiology following and will discuss with them today
   .
   # DM2- On metformin at home.
   - ISS, follow fingersticks  especially on D5W
   .
   # HTN- Was on lopressor & nifedipine at home, then had been on
   amlodipine in-house when pt had prior PO access. BP now stable.
   Restarted amlodipine yesterday with good effect
   - Continue Diltiazem but consider decreasing dose (currently Dilt 60
   TID)
   # BPH/hematuria- Hematuria improving
   - Will need outpatient cystoscopy
   - Continue foley for now since intubated
   - Resume flomax prior to foley removal
   .
   # FEN: Turn off tube feeds for now given thoracentesis and PEG
   placement with GI today

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for cardiac tamponade and underwent a pericardial drain. The patient also has pneumonia and a possible cerebrovascular accident (stroke).

Assessment and plan:
1. Pleural effusion, acute
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
3. Pericardial effusion (without tamponade)
4. Dysphagia
5. CVA (stroke), ischemic
6. Atrial fibrillation (AFib)
7. Heart failure (CHF), diastolic, acute
8. Hypernatremia (high sodium)

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, reaccumulation of pericardial effusion, further neurological decline, electrolyte imbalances, and possible infections. It is crucial to continue with aggressive supportive care, including ongoing respiratory support, fluid management, and close monitoring of vital signs, electrolytes, and neurologic status."

 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4569**] is a 70 yo male with Type 2 DM, HTN, BPH, CHF, A. fib,
   admitted for tamponade, now s/p pericardial drain with PNA and possible
   CVA, and now transfered to the MICU for resp distress with incrased
   somulence requiring intubation.
   .
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: Patient less tachypnic and solumnolent
   (likely secondary to sedating medications). In addition he has improved
   mucus secretions/pulmonary status after bronch although scant
   secretions were found. Initial CXR showed a white out of his left lung,
   which may be secondary to mucus plugging that has since improved on
   ventilation. Pt is also being treated for an underlying PNA with zosyn,
   started [**1-10**]. At baseline the pt may have resp disease due to a long hx
   of tobacco use. New infection is possible, but pt has been afebrile and
   BP stable, so likely more an obstructive process. ABG improved to
   7.32/62/119 after intubation and continues to improve (mild alkalosis
   today on ABG that responded well to decreasing RR). Bronch and
   blood/urine/sputum samples so far unrevealing. CT chest/abd cuts showed
   large pleural effusions
   - Thoracentesis for pleural effusion management and diagnosis
   - Order serologies for concern of systemic processes (connective
   tissues vs. malignancy vs. viral)
   - Discontinue Zosyn (last day of 10 day course: [**2107-1-20**])
   - Hold further zyprexa and haldol
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   # Expressive aphasia/AM- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA per
   neuro. New worsening MS is concerning for either delirium vs new
   cerebral vascular event. MRI/MRA yesterday negative for acute processes
   so ?delirium/toxic metabolic in addition to recent cardioembolic stroke
   as etiology for his symptoms
   - Appreciate neurology following
   - Restarting anticoagulation given subtherapeutic INR today after
   planned procedures ([**Female First Name (un) 217**]/PEG) and no acute intracranial bleed seen on
   MRI
   - BP control
   #. A. fib/Bradycardia- new onset prior to OSH admission. Thought to be
   [**1-18**] his CHF and diuresis. Now in sinus. Seems to have runs of sinus
   brady as well as junctional rhythms. Has been anticoagulated due to
   recent cardioembolic stroke.
   - Follow-up Cards recs regarding heart rate management and ?serositis
   given pericardial tamponade as well
   - Consider restarting dig if needed
   - Continue PO Dilt via OG tube but ?decreasing dose given overnight
   tachybrady
 will discuss with Cards first
   - Atropine at bedside
   # Hypernatremia- Likely due to decreased free water intake in setting
   of dysphagia and lack of NGT and being on lasix. Free water deficit of
   ~1.5 liters today. Slightly improved from Na 151
 149. Received D5W at
   100/hr X1L after D5W with bicarb and 500cc of D5W in KCl repletion, D5W
   still running
   - PM lytes for correcting sodium
   .
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Pt likely
   aspirated which, in conjunction with large, ?gradual pleural effusions
   caused his acute respiratory distress issues. Pt has failed a swallow
   study.  Started tube feeds overnight after bronch.
   - Discuss with re: PEG tube placement now that INR subtherapeutic
   - Will restart anti-coagulation after procedures today
   .
   # CHF: Diastolic HF, had been tx for last month with lasix. Differing
   EFs, however, between OSH and inpatient ECHOs.
   - Hold lasix for now and continue to monitor clinically
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cultures were negative. Could
   have been viral or autoimmune. Pt has some renal failure, but not
   likely severe enough to develop effusion [**1-18**] to this. Pt is now s/p
   pericardial drain. TSH was normal.
   - Monitor clinically for reaccumulation of pericardial effusion
   - Cardiology following and will discuss with them today
   .
   # DM2- On metformin at home.
   - ISS, follow fingersticks  especially on D5W
   .
   # HTN- Was on lopressor & nifedipine at home, then had been on
   amlodipine in-house when pt had prior PO access. BP now stable.
   Restarted amlodipine yesterday with good effect
   - Continue Diltiazem but consider decreasing dose (currently Dilt 60
   TID)
   # BPH/hematuria- Hematuria improving
   - Will need outpatient cystoscopy
   - Continue foley for now since intubated
   - Resume flomax prior to foley removal
   .
   # FEN: Turn off tube feeds for now given thoracentesis and PEG
   placement with GI today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), hypertension (HTN), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation (AFib). He was admitted for cardiac tamponade and underwent pericardial drain. He also has pneumonia (PNA) and possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient required intubation due to respiratory distress and increased somnolence.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pleural effusion, acute: Thoracentesis for management and diagnosis.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): Continue ventilatory support.
3. Pericardial effusion (without tamponade): Monitor clinically for reaccumulation.
4. Dysphagia: Discuss with dietitian regarding possible percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.
5. Hypernatremia: Administer D5W and monitor electrolytes.
6. CHF, diastolic: Hold Lasix and continue to monitor clinically.
7. Atrial fibrillation/bradycardia: Follow-up cardiology recommendations regarding heart rate management.
8. BPH/hematuria: Schedule outpatient cystoscopy and resume flomax prior to foley removal.
9. Fever: Monitor temperature and investigate potential sources of infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   70M with Type 2 DM, HTN, CHF, AF, s/p pericardial drain for idiopathic
   effusion, admitted to MICU with PNA, large bilateral pleural effusions,
   possible CVA, resp distress with incrased somulence requiring
   intubation.
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: Had been doing well on CPAP/PSV from 0800
   AM [**1-20**] to 0200 [**1-21**], but with downward tending minute volume. At 0200
   put back on vent for ABG 7.22/85/117. CXR: RLL haziness compared to
   [**1-20**]; derecruited? Something brewing? No PTX. Ride side was where
   effusion tapped. Pleural effusion looks larger too. (Off Zosyn 1 day).
   Repeat ABG was 7.38/58/133. Note elevated WBC (8->13).
   -          Restarted Zosyn in case this an early pneumonia about to
   reblossom
   -          Get sputum cx
   -          If sputum cx negative, consider steroids, since pericardial
   and parapneumonic effusions c/w autoimmune process.
   -          F/u rheum labs.
   # Expressive aphasia/AMS- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA per
   neuro. MRI/MRA negative for acute processes so ?delirium/toxic
   metabolic in addition to cardioembolic stroke as etiology. Note off
   Heparin today pending peg tube
   - BP control
   #. AF / Bradycardia- Looks like tachy-brady syndrome. After D/c
   standing Dilt per cards recs, patient had frequent PVCs o/n, bradys to
   40s and 30s. (Prior bradys had been seen as possibly vagal w/ETT).
   -          Anticoagulate.
   -          EP f/u once stable for ablation &pacer
   -          Atropine and pacer pads at bedside
   # Hypernatremia-. Received D5W at 100/hr X1L after D5W with bicarb and
   500cc of D5W in KCl repletion, Na+ went from 149->146.
   - PM lytes for correcting sodium
   - Hang a second liter of D5W
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Failed a swallow
   study.  On tube feeds, though held for peg.
   - PEG tube placement today
   - Restart anti-coagulation after
    # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cultures were negative.
   - Monitor clinically for reaccumulation
   - Cardiology: no further recs
   # DM2- On metformin at home.
   - ISS, follow fingersticks  especially on D5W
   # HTN- Continue amlodipine
   # BPH/hematuria- Hematuria improving
   - Will need outpatient cystoscopy
   - Continue foley for now since intubated
   - Resume flomax prior to foley removal
   FEN: Turn off tube feeds for now given thoracentesis and PEG placement
   with GI

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent pericardial drain for idiopathic effusion. He was admitted to the MICU with pneumonia, large bilateral pleural effusions, possible cerebrovascular accident, and respiratory distress requiring intubation.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient had been doing well on CPAP/PSV but required mechanical ventilation due to a downward trending minute volume and an ABG of 7.22/85/117. A repeat ABG was 7.38/58/133.
2. Expressive aphasia/Altered mental status: Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA per neuro. MRI/MRA negative for acute processes.
3. Atrial fibrillation/Bradycardia: The patient had frequent PVCs and bradycardias after discontinuing Diltiazem.
4. Hypernatremia: Corrected with D5W and electrolyte management.
5. Dysphagia: Failed a swallow study, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed.

   put back on vent for ABG 7.22/85/117 and has remained on Assist Control
   since. CXR: RLL haziness compared to [**1-20**]; derecruited? But CXR from
   this morning looks impoved. No PTX on the right side where effusion was
   diagnostically tapped (only 50cc removed). WBC bumped yesterday but
   back to baseline again today (~8.3)
   - Discontinue Zosyn that was restarted yesterday for ?reblossoming
   pneumonia
   - Follow-up sputum culture; gram stain negative
   - Follow-up rheum labs
   - If cultures remain negative, may consider steroids since pericardial
   and parapneumonic effusions consistent with exudative process (could be
   collagen vascular disease vs. lung infection vs. malignancy vs. PE)
   -          Restarted Zosyn in case this an early pneumonia about to

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and possible cerebrovascular accident. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with pneumonia, large bilateral pleural effusions, and respiratory distress requiring intubation. The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, pericardial effusion, dysphagia, atrial fibrillation with bradycardia, hypernatremia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia with hematuria. The patient underwent a pericardial drain for idiopathic effusion and had a positive troponin I level. He also had a negative cardiac enzyme panel. The patient's recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin concentration, and normal platelet count. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's condition indicates acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia and large bilateral pleural effusions. Close monitoring of respiratory function and continued mechanical ventilation support may be necessary.
2. Pericardial effusion: The patient has an idiopathic pericardial effusion that required drainage. Monitoring for reaccumulation of fluid and possible recurrence is essential.
3. Dysphagia: The patient has expressive aphasia and altered mental status, which may be"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and possible cerebrovascular accident. He was admitted to the MICU with pneumonia, large bilateral pleural effusions, and respiratory distress requiring intubation. 

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with assist control mode since January 21st due to worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure. His condition has shown some improvement with improvement in chest X-ray findings. 

The patient's white blood cell count has fluctuated but is now back to baseline. He has been weaned off Zosyn, an antibiotic, as his sputum culture came back negative. Rheumatology labs are pending for further evaluation.

The patient's blood pressure and heart rate have been stable, but he experienced episodes of bradycardia and atrial fibrillation. His coagulation status is being managed with heparin, and he will be bridged to coumadin soon.

The patient has hypernatremia, which was addressed by administering D5W at 100 cc/hr and potassium repletion. Lasix diuresis is planned to resume once his electrolytes are within normal range.

The patient has dysphagia likely due to a cardioembolic stroke. A swallow study was failed, and he required a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement for nutrition.

His pericardial effusion remains unclear in etiology, and cultures were negative. Cardiology recommendations were not pursued further.

The patient's other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and hematuria. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure has been recurrent, and he required intubation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has large bilateral pleural effusions. If the effusions reaccumulate or do not improve with current management, thoracentesis may be necessary, which carries its own risks.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which requires careful management to avoid complications such as dehydration or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

4. Dysphagia: The patient's dysphagia secondary to a possible cardioembolic stroke can lead to aspiration pneumonia or malnutrition if proper nutrition support is not provided.

5. Pericardial Effusion: Although the patient's pericardial effusion appears to be stable for now, there is a risk of reaccumulation or development of cardiac tamponade if the effusion worsens.

6. Cardiovascular Events: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and possible cerebrovascular accident increases the risk of future cardiovascular events such as stroke or arrhythmias.

7. Infection: Despite negative cultures, the patient initially presented with pneumonia, and there is a risk of recurrent infections, especially with prolonged intubation and immunosuppression.

8. Delirium or Metabolic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to delirium, metabolic encephal"

   Assessment and Plan
   70M with Type 2 DM, HTN, CHF, AF, s/p pericardial drain for idiopathic
   effusion, admitted to MICU with PNA, large bilateral pleural effusions,
   possible CVA, resp distress with incrased somulence requiring
   intubation.
   .
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: Had been doing well on CPAP/PSV from 0800
   AM [**1-20**] to 0200 [**1-21**], but with downward tending minute volume. At 0200
   put back on vent for ABG 7.22/85/117 and has remained on Assist Control
   since. CXR: RLL haziness compared to [**1-20**]; derecruited? But CXR from
   this morning looks impoved. No PTX on the right side where effusion was
   diagnostically tapped (only 50cc removed). WBC bumped yesterday but
   back to baseline again today (~8.3)
   - Discontinue Zosyn that was restarted yesterday for ?reblossoming
   pneumonia
   - Follow-up sputum culture; gram stain negative
   - Follow-up rheum labs
 [**Doctor First Name **] positive, titer still pending this morning
   - Will diurese today and trial SBT. If unsuccessful, will do
   thoracentesis therapeutically this afternoon and then attempt
   extubation
   - If cultures remain negative, may consider steroids since pericardial
   and parapneumonic effusions consistent with exudative process (could be
   collagen vascular disease vs. lung infection vs. malignancy vs. PE)
   .
   # Expressive aphasia/AMS- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA per
   neuro. MRI/MRA negative for acute processes so ?delirium/toxic
   metabolic in addition to cardioembolic stroke as etiology. Back on
   Heparin gtt but with low PTT goal for possible thoracentesis later
   today
   - BP control
   #. AF / Bradycardia- Looks like tachy-brady syndrome. After D/c
   standing Dilt per cards recs, patient had frequent PVCs and bradys to
   40s and 30s, but no more episodes in the last 24 hours. (Prior bradys
   had been seen as possibly vagal w/ETT).
   - Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt per above
 eventual bridge
   to coumadin will be needed
   - EP f/u once stable for ablation &pacer
   - Atropine and pacer pads at bedside
   # Hypernatremia-. Received D5W at 100/hr X1L after D5W with bicarb and
   500cc of D5W in KCl repletion, Na+ went from 149->146
 147
   - Patient receiving free water with flushes for PEG tube feeds
   - PM lytes for resumption of Lasix diuresis
   .
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Failed a swallow
   study; PEG placed yesterday and can be used starting this afternoon
   - Continuing heparin gtt for now
   # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cultures were negative.
   - Monitor clinically for reaccumulation
   - Cardiology: no further recs
   .
   # DM2- On metformin at home.
   - ISS, follow fingersticks
   .
   # HTN- Continue amlodipine
   # BPH/hematuria- Hematuria improving
   - Will need outpatient cystoscopy
   - Continue foley for now since intubated
   - Resume flomax prior to foley removal

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Pneumonia (PNA) with large bilateral pleural effusions, possible CVA (cerebrovascular accident), respiratory distress, and increased somnolence requiring intubation.
2. Expressive aphasia/AMS (acute mental status change) likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. MRI/MRA negative for acute processes, so possibly delirium/toxic metabolic in addition to cardioembolic stroke as etiology.
3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure. Initially doing well on CPAP/PSV, but with a downward-trending minute volume. Put back on vent for ABG 7.22/85/117 and remained on assist control since. CXR: RLL haziness compared to 01/20; derecruited? But CXR from this morning looks improved.
4. Dysphagia likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Failed swallow study; PEG placed yesterday and can be used starting this afternoon.
5. AF (atrial fibrillation) with bradycardia. Looks like tachy-brady syndrome. After discontinuing standing diltiazem per cardiology recommendations, the patient had frequent PVCs and bradys to 40s and 30s, but no more episodes in the last 24 hours.

   Assessment and Plan
   70M with Type 2 DM, HTN, CHF, AF, s/p pericardial drain for idiopathic
   effusion, admitted to MICU with PNA, large bilateral pleural effusions,
   possible CVA, resp distress with incrased somulence requiring
   intubation.

   # Hypercarbic resp failure: Had been doing well on CPAP/PSV from 0800
   AM [**1-20**] to 0200 [**1-21**], but with downward tending minute volume. At 0200
   put back on vent for ABG 7.22/85/117. CXR: RLL haziness compared to
   [**1-20**]; derecruited? Something brewing? No PTX. Ride side was where
   effusion tapped. Pleural effusion looks larger too. (Off Zosyn 1 day).
   Repeat ABG was 7.38/58/133. Note elevated WBC (8->13).
   -          Restarted Zosyn in case this an early pneumonia about to
   reblossom
   -          Get sputum cx

   -          F/u rheum labs.
   # Expressive aphasia/AMS- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA per
   neuro. MRI/MRA negative for acute processes so ?delirium/toxic
   metabolic in addition to cardioembolic stroke as etiology. Note off
   Heparin today pending peg tube
   - BP control
   #. AF / Bradycardia- Looks like tachy-brady syndrome. After D/c
   standing Dilt per cards recs, patient had frequent PVCs o/n, bradys to
   40s and 30s. (Prior bradys had been seen as possibly vagal w/ETT).

   -          EP f/u once stable for ablation &pacer
   -          Atropine and pacer pads at bedside
   # Hypernatremia-. Received D5W at 100/hr X1L after D5W with bicarb and
   500cc of D5W in KCl repletion, Na+ went from 149->146.
   - PM lytes for correcting sodium
   - Hang a second liter of D5W
   .
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Failed a swallow
   study.  On tube feeds, though held for peg.
   - PEG tube placement today
   - Restart anti-coagulation after

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Pleural effusion: The patient has large bilateral pleural effusions, which can lead to respiratory distress and compromise lung function.

2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient initially did well on CPAP/PSV but later required intubation due to increased somnolence and a downward trending minute volume. This indicates possible hypercarbic respiratory failure.

3. Possible CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident) or stroke: The patient has expressive aphasia and altered mental status, which could be secondary to a cardioembolic stroke. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this.

4. Bradycardia and tachy-brady syndrome: The patient experienced frequent PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) and bradycardia after discontinuing Diltiazem. This may indicate tachy-brady syndrome, which is a combination of fast and slow heart rhythms.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels were elevated, requiring careful management with IV fluids to prevent complications like cerebral edema.

6. Dysphagia: The patient likely has dysphagia secondary to a cardioembolic CVA. This can lead to aspiration pneumonia if not managed properly.

7. Pericardial effusion: The patient had an idiopathic pericardial effusion that required drainage. The etiology"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was intubated upon admission due to hypoxemia and subsequent ventilatory failure. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, dysphagia, hypernatremia, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion. 

During the 24-hour period, the patient underwent thoracentesis, which revealed an exudative pleural effusion. The pleural fluid analysis showed elevated protein, glucose, LDH, and WBC count, indicating an inflammatory process. The patient's pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio was 0.71, suggesting exudation. 

A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed without complications, and the patient is expected to start tube feeding tomorrow. The patient's condition has been stable, with improving respiratory status as evidenced by decreased oxygen requirements and weaning off ventilatory support. 

The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a slightly elevated sodium level. His renal function is normal, and liver enzymes are within normal limits. 

The patient's blood cultures were negative for any infections. The patient's INR was elevated, which precluded the placement of a gastrointestinal peg. However, once the INR normalizes, the patient will be started on anticoagulation therapy"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to aspiration. They have a history of pneumonia and are currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient is intubated and unresponsive, with decreased breath sounds in the lungs. There is evidence of fluid overload, as indicated by the trace edema and positive fluid balance. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. There is also evidence of hypernatremia. Imaging reveals large effusions in the chest. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, acute pleural effusion, pericardial effusion without tamponade, and atrial fibrillation. They are currently being treated with IV heparin and antibiotics, and efforts are being made to diurese the pleural effusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum color or odor is essential.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of blood clots forming in the deep veins. Regular monitoring for signs of DVT, such as leg swelling or pain, and the use of prophylactic heparin are important preventive measures.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is significantly low, which can compromise organ perfusion. Continuous monitoring and appropriate fluid management are crucial to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels may lead to neurological complications if not properly managed. Close attention to fluid balance and electrolyte management is necessary.
5. Pericardial effusion: Although currently without tamponade, the presence of fluid around the heart increases the risk of cardiac tamponade. Close monitoring of cardiac function and echocardiograms will be necessary to detect any worsening of the effusion.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   70M with Type 2 DM, HTN, CHF, AF, s/p pericardial drain for idiopathic
   effusion, admitted to MICU with PNA, large bilateral pleural effusions,
   possible CVA, resp distress with incrased somulence requiring
   intubation.
   .
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: Had been doing well yesterday and weaned to
   Pressure Support 5, PEEP 5. Sedation turned off and patient extubated
   without issues. Overnight, however, became progressively hypertensive,
   increased work of breathing/diaphoretic and found to be in respiratory
   acidosis/hypercarbia. Reintubated.
   * Etiology for repeat episode of respiratory distress unclear. ?pleural
   effusions. No flash pulmonary edema seen on post-intubation CXR.
   - Likely therapeutic thoracentesis today; will keep heparin gtt PTT
   goal low
   - Follow-up rheum labs
 [**Doctor First Name **] positive, titer still pending this morning
   - Will continue diuresis with lasix gtt today
   - Follow-up sputum culture; gram stain negative
   - If cultures remain negative, may consider steroids since pericardial
   and parapneumonic effusions consistent with exudative process (could be
   collagen vascular disease vs. lung infection vs. malignancy vs. PE)
   .
   # Expressive aphasia/AMS- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA per
   neuro. MRI/MRA negative for acute processes so ?delirium/toxic
   metabolic in addition to cardioembolic stroke as etiology. Back on
   Heparin gtt but with low PTT goal for likely therapeutic thoracentesis
   later today
   - BP control
   #. AF / Bradycardia- Looks like tachy-brady syndrome. After D/c
   standing Dilt per cards recs, patient had frequent PVCs and bradys to
   40s and 30s, but no more episodes in the last 24 hours. (Prior bradys
   had been seen as possibly vagal w/ETT).
   - Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt per above
 eventual bridge
   to coumadin will be needed
   - EP f/u once stable for ablation &pacer
   - Atropine and pacer pads at bedside
   # Hypernatremia- Stable in the 145-147 range
   - Patient receiving free water with flushes for PEG tube feeds
   - PM lytes for resumption of Lasix diuresis
   .
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Failed a swallow
   study; PEG placed and was used starting yesterday
   - Continuing heparin gtt for now
   # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cultures were negative.
   - Monitor clinically for reaccumulation
   - Cardiology: no further recs
   .
   # DM2- On metformin at home.
   - ISS, follow fingersticks
   .
   # HTN- Continue amlodipine
   # BPH/hematuria- Hematuria resolved
   - Will need outpatient cystoscopy
   - Continue foley for now since re-intubated
   - Resume flomax prior to foley removal
   # FEN: PEG tube feeds, replete electrolytes PRN

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and previous pericardial drain for idiopathic effusion. The patient was admitted to the MICU with pneumonia, large bilateral pleural effusions, and possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient experienced respiratory distress requiring intubation.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient had been doing well and was successfully extubated, but overnight became hypertensive, increased work of breathing, diaphoretic, and found to be in respiratory acidosis/hypercarbia. The patient was reintubated.
2. Expressive aphasia/AMS: The patient is likely experiencing cardioembolic CVA. An MRI/MRA was negative for acute processes, so the etiology could be delirium/toxic/metabolic in addition to cardioembolic stroke.
3. Atrial fibrillation/Bradycardia: The patient had frequent PVCs and bradys, but no more episodes in the last 24 hours. The patient will continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt and may need to be bridged to coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have been stable between 145-147. The patient is receiving free water"

   agitation, hypertension leading to possible flash pulmonary edema.
   - Will aggressively diurese today with Lasix gtt, goal -2L (until
   Creatinine bumps)
   - If insufficient diuresis of pleural effusions, will consider
   therapeutic bilateral thoracenteses
   - With next extubation, will attempt to keep patient calm/oriented and
   aggressively control blood pressures with IV nitroglycerin/hydralazine
   as needed to prevent flash pulmonary edema
   - Follow-up rheum labs
 [**Doctor First Name **] positive, titer still pending this morning
   - Follow-up sputum culture; gram stain negative
   - If cultures remain negative, may consider steroids since pericardial
   and parapneumonic effusions consistent with exudative process (could be
   collagen vascular disease vs. lung infection vs. malignancy vs. PE)
   .
   # Expressive aphasia/AMS- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA per
   neuro. MRI/MRA negative for acute processes so ?delirium/toxic
   metabolic in addition to cardioembolic stroke as etiology.
   - Back on Heparin gtt with normal PTT goals for now
   - Blood pressure control
   #. AF / Bradycardia- Looks like tachy-brady syndrome. After D/c
   standing Dilt per cards recs, patient had frequent PVCs and bradys to
   40s and 30s, but no more episodes in the last 48 hours. (Prior bradys
   had been seen as possibly vagal w/ETT).
   - Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt per above
 eventual bridge
   to coumadin will be needed
   - EP f/u once stable for ablation +/- pacer
   - Atropine and pacer pads at bedside
   # Hypernatremia- Stable in the 145-147 range
   - Patient receiving free water with flushes for PEG tube feeds; will
   increase today in setting of slightly elevated serum sodium
   - PM lytes given ongoing Lasix diuresis
   .
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Failed a swallow
   study; PEG placed and was used starting yesterday
   - Continuing heparin gtt for now
   # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cultures were negative.
   - Monitor clinically for reaccumulation
   - Cardiology: no further recs
   .
   # DM2- On metformin at home.
   - ISS, follow fingersticks
   .
   # HTN- Continue amlodipine
   # BPH/hematuria- Hematuria resolved
   - Will need outpatient cystoscopy
   - Continue foley for now since re-intubated
   - Resume flomax prior to foley removal

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to pneumonia, large bilateral pleural effusions, and respiratory distress requiring intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient had a previous episode of respiratory distress that led to reintubation. The etiology for this repeat episode is unclear but may be related to significant ongoing pleural effusions, agitation, hypertension, and possible flash pulmonary edema.

2. Expressive aphasia/AMS: The patient exhibits expressive aphasia and altered mental status (AMS), likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. An MRI/MRA ruled out acute processes, leaving delirium, toxic/metabolic causes, or cardioembolic stroke as potential etiologies.

3. Atrial fibrillation/bradycardia: The patient presented with tachy-brady syndrome, which included frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and bradycardia. This condition resolved after discontinuing standing diltiazem per cardiology recommendations.

4. Dysphagia: The patient likely developed dysphagia due to a cardioembolic CVA. A swallow study failed, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastro"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a well-nourished individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient required invasive ventilation support on 01/22/2107 at 05:21 PM and was weaned off it on 01/23/2107 at 04:06 AM.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, propofol, lansoprazole, metoprolol, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/43(62) mmHg to 199/87(128) mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.52, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 168 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 36 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals no notable findings in the head, ears, nose, throat, cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular system, or extremities. However, the patient has symmetric breath sounds in the chest and soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. The patient's neurologic examination is not assessed due to sedation.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 8.3 to 10.7 thousand/mm3, hematocrit (Hct) ranging from 23.7% to 28.2%, platelet (Plt) count ranging from 321 to 349 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr) level ranging from 0.6 to 0.7 mg/dL, and blood glucose level ranging from 82 to 128 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, pericardial effusion without tamponade, pleural effusion, dysphagia, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and hypernatremia (high sodium).

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, arterial and peripheral IV lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is not mentioned."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. 

The patient's chief complaint is agitation and hypertension, which led to re-intubation after extubation. The patient is now on invasive ventilation.

The patient has a history of piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotic use and is currently receiving multiple infusions including furosemide, heparin sodium, and propofol. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. 

The vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 156/52 to 199/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The plateau pressure is 25 cmH2O, and the compliance is 27.5 cmH2O/mL. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.52, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 168. 

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to agitation and hypertension leading to pulmonary edema. A chest X-ray revealed diffuse infiltrates consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and sodium, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. The patient also has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and productive cough, should be done.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of blood clots forming in the legs. Regular assessment for symptoms like swelling, pain, and redness in the lower extremities is important. Prophylactic heparin is being administered.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness can lead to stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. Prophylactic use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is recommended to prevent these ulcers.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium level needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient in the ICU is experiencing several health issues. The patient is agitated and hypertensive, with a blood pressure reading of 7.21/81/93. They were re-intubated 10 hours post-extubation. The patient has been receiving invasive ventilation, with the mode being CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The FiO2 is set at 50%, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, and RR (set) at 16. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.52, PaCO2 of 36, and HCO3- of 84. The patient's physical examination shows a heart rhythm of SB (Sinus Bradycardia) with a heart rate of 57 bpm.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 36.2 C, HR: 57 bpm, BP: 156/52 mmHg, RR: 16 inspiratory minutes, and SpO2: 100%. The patient has received various medications, including Furosemide (Lasix), Heparin Sodium, and Propofol. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 01-22-2107 at 08:00 AM.

The patient's labs show a WBC count of 8.3, Hct of 24.4, Plt of 348, Cr of 0.7, TCO2 of 34, Glucose of 115, and other lab values within normal ranges. The CXR reveals diffuse infiltrates. The assessment and plan include PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE; RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (not ARDS); PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (without tamponade); ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB); HYPERNATREMIA (high sodium).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pleural effusion: This can lead to respiratory distress and decreased oxygenation if not managed properly.
2. Acute respiratory failure: If the patient's respiratory function continues to deteriorate, it can result in hypoxemia and subsequent organ damage.
3. Pericardial effusion: Although currently without tamponade, there is a risk of developing cardiac tamponade, which can be life-threatening if not addressed promptly.
4. Atrial fibrillation: This arrhythmia can increase the risk of thrombus formation and potential embolic events.
5. Hypernatremia: Elevated sodium levels can lead to neurological complications and dehydration.

Please note that the information provided in the progress note is based on the given data and does not include any additional details or follow-up information."

   Assessment and Plan
   70M with Type 2 DM, HTN, CHF, AF, s/p pericardial drain for idiopathic
   effusion, admitted to MICU with PNA, large bilateral pleural effusions,
   possible CVA, resp distress with incrased somulence requiring
   intubation.
   .
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: Had been doing well yesterday and weaned to
   Pressure Support 5, PEEP 5. Sedation turned off and patient extubated
   without issues. Overnight, however, became progressively hypertensive,
   increased work of breathing/diaphoretic and found to be in respiratory
   acidosis/hypercarbia. Reintubated ~10 hours after extubation at 3-4am.
   * Etiology for repeat episode of respiratory distress unclear but
   likely due to significant, ongoing pleural effusions in the setting of
   agitation, hypertension leading to possible flash pulmonary edema.
   - Will aggressively diurese today with Lasix gtt, goal -2L (until
   Creatinine bumps)
   - If insufficient diuresis of pleural effusions, will consider
   therapeutic bilateral thoracenteses
   - With next extubation, will attempt to keep patient calm/oriented and
   aggressively control blood pressures with IV nitroglycerin/hydralazine
   as needed to prevent flash pulmonary edema
   - Follow-up rheum labs
 [**Doctor First Name **] positive, titer still pending this morning
   - Follow-up sputum culture; gram stain negative
   - If cultures remain negative, may consider steroids since pericardial
   and parapneumonic effusions consistent with exudative process (could be
   collagen vascular disease vs. lung infection vs. malignancy vs. PE)
   .
   # Expressive aphasia/AMS- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA per
   neuro. MRI/MRA negative for acute processes so ?delirium/toxic
   metabolic in addition to cardioembolic stroke as etiology.
   - Back on Heparin gtt with normal PTT goals for now
   - Blood pressure control
   #. AF / Bradycardia- Looks like tachy-brady syndrome. After D/c
   standing Dilt per cards recs, patient had frequent PVCs and bradys to
   40s and 30s, but no more episodes in the last 48 hours. (Prior bradys
   had been seen as possibly vagal w/ETT).
   - Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt per above
 eventual bridge
   to coumadin will be needed
   - EP f/u once stable for ablation +/- pacer
   - Atropine and pacer pads at bedside
   # Hypernatremia- Stable in the 145-147 range
   - Patient receiving free water with flushes for PEG tube feeds; will
   increase today in setting of slightly elevated serum sodium
   - PM lytes given ongoing Lasix diuresis
   .
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Failed a swallow
   study; PEG placed and was used starting yesterday
   - Continuing heparin gtt for now
   # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cultures were negative.
   - Monitor clinically for reaccumulation
   - Cardiology: no further recs
   .
   # DM2- On metformin at home.
   - ISS, follow fingersticks
   .
   # HTN- Continue amlodipine
   # BPH/hematuria- Hematuria resolved
   - Will need outpatient cystoscopy
   - Continue foley for now since re-intubated
   - Resume flomax prior to foley removal
   # FEN: PEG tube feeds, replete electrolytes PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He presented to the ICU with pericardial and pulmonary effusions, unclear etiology. The patient had a previous episode of respiratory distress that required intubation, but was successfully extubated. However, overnight, he became hypertensive, increased work of breathing, diaphoretic, and developed respiratory acidosis/hypercarbia, leading to reintubation. The patient's current condition includes expressive aphasia/AMS, possible cardioembolic CVA, and hypernatremia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's repeat episode of respiratory distress could be due to ongoing pleural effusions, agitation, hypertension leading to flash pulmonary edema, and inadequate diuresis. Aggressive diuresis with Lasix gtt and consideration of therapeutic bilateral thoracenteses may be necessary.
2. Cardioembolic CVA: The patient's expressive aphasia/AMS could be secondary to a cardioembolic stroke. Further follow-up with neurology is recommended.
3. Tachy-brady syndrome: The patient had frequent PVCs and bradys after discontinuation of Dilt, but no recent episodes have been observed. Anticoagulation with heparin gtt and consideration of bridging to coumadin for long"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   70M with Type 2 DM, HTN, CHF, AF, s/p pericardial drain for idiopathic
   effusion, admitted to MICU with PNA, large bilateral pleural effusions,
   possible CVA, resp distress with incrased somulence requiring
   intubation.
   .
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: Had been doing well yesterday and weaned to
   Pressure Support 5, PEEP 5. Sedation turned off and patient extubated
   without issues. Overnight, however, became progressively hypertensive,
   increased work of breathing/diaphoretic and found to be in respiratory
   acidosis/hypercarbia. Reintubated ~10 hours after extubation at 3-4am.
   * Etiology for repeat episode of respiratory distress unclear but
   likely due to significant, ongoing pleural effusions in the setting of
   agitation, hypertension leading to possible flash pulmonary edema.
   - Will aggressively diurese today with Lasix gtt, goal -2L (until
   Creatinine bumps)
   - If insufficient diuresis of pleural effusions, will consider
   therapeutic bilateral thoracenteses
   - With next extubation, will attempt to keep patient calm/oriented and
   aggressively control blood pressures with IV nitroglycerin/hydralazine
   as needed to prevent flash pulmonary edema
   - Follow-up rheum labs
 [**Doctor First Name **] positive, titer still pending this morning
   - Follow-up sputum culture; gram stain negative
   - If cultures remain negative, may consider steroids since pericardial
   and parapneumonic effusions consistent with exudative process (could be
   collagen vascular disease vs. lung infection vs. malignancy vs. PE)
   .
   # Expressive aphasia/AMS- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA per
   neuro. MRI/MRA negative for acute processes so ?delirium/toxic
   metabolic in addition to cardioembolic stroke as etiology.
   - Back on Heparin gtt with normal PTT goals for now
   - Blood pressure control
   #. AF / Bradycardia- Looks like tachy-brady syndrome. After D/c
   standing Dilt per cards recs, patient had frequent PVCs and bradys to
   40s and 30s, but no more episodes in the last 48 hours. (Prior bradys
   had been seen as possibly vagal w/ETT).
   - Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt per above
 eventual bridge
   to coumadin will be needed
   - EP f/u once stable for ablation +/- pacer
   - Atropine and pacer pads at bedside
   # Hypernatremia- Stable in the 145-147 range
   - Patient receiving free water with flushes for PEG tube feeds; will
   increase today in setting of slightly elevated serum sodium
   - PM lytes given ongoing Lasix diuresis
   .
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Failed a swallow
   study; PEG placed and was used starting yesterday
   - Continuing heparin gtt for now
   # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cultures were negative.
   - Monitor clinically for reaccumulation
   - Cardiology: no further recs
   .
   # DM2- On metformin at home.
   - ISS, follow fingersticks
   .
   # HTN- Continue amlodipine
   # BPH/hematuria- Hematuria resolved
   - Will need outpatient cystoscopy
   - Continue foley for now since re-intubated
   - Resume flomax prior to foley removal
   # FEN: PEG tube feeds, replete electrolytes PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He presented to the ICU with pericardial and pulmonary effusions of unclear etiology. The patient was extubated for about 10 hours but then became hypertensive, aphasic, labored breathing, and diaphoretic, leading to reintubation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.2°C (98.9°F) and current temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate (HR) of 71 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 150/49-165/53 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.7 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) of 28.2%, platelet count (Plt) of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation who was admitted to the ICU for pericardial and pulmonary effusions. He was extubated but then reintubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypercarbic respiratory failure, bilateral pulmonary effusions, pericardial effusion, expressive aphasia, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation with bradycardia, dysphagia, and a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia with hematuria, and a feeding tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's previous episode of respiratory distress indicates the potential for recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Bilateral pulmonary effusions: The presence of chronic and poorly explained bilateral pulmonary effusions suggests a possible underlying condition that could lead to further complications.
3. Pericardial effusion: Although the patient's pericardial effusion is currently stable, it may worsen or develop complications such as cardiac tamponade.
4. Expressive aphasia: The patient's inability to speak fluently may impact communication and increase the risk of complications related to inadequate information exchange.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels could indicate a disturbance in fluid balance, potentially leading to further electrolyte imbalances.

   respiratory failure
   .
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: Etiology for repeat episode of respiratory
   distress unclear. Was diaphoretic, hypertensive, agitated, w/normal EKG
   and CXR now c/w some new pulmonary edema. Occurred in setting of these
   chronically and still poorly explained bilateral pulmonary effusions.
   -          Cycle troponins, EKG
   -          Echo to assess systolic fx and r/o new pericardial effusion
   -          On assist control Fi50% 550x16 PEEP 5, had a limited
   successful SBT this am, possible extubation tomorrow but should
   optimize him  first in hopes he will not need reintubated
   # Bilateral pulmonary effusions: Likely one process driving both the
   pericardial and pulmonary effusions, note [**Doctor First Name **]+.
   -          f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] titers
   -          If still significantly +, start steroids for likely
   rheumatological process
   -          CT chest today to scan for lung parenchyma, size of
   effusions
   -          Therapeutic [**Female First Name (un) 217**]
   -          Continue Lasix gtt at 12, while reducing free H2O PO, could
   expect diureses to finally be successful today
   # Hypernatremia: Working hypothesis is this resulted from earlier fluid
   management decisions. Now resolving.
   -          Decrease free H2O from 200 mL q4 to 100 mL q4
   -          PM lytes
   # Expressive Aphasia: In setting of runs of A Fib, with known atrial
   thrombus, and MRI/MRA showing sequelae of cardioembolic strokes.
   -          On Heparin gtt, PTT 52.6
   -          Good blood pressure control
   #. AF / Bradycardia: Has been in sinus rhythm for past day. Note
   thrombus in atrium.
   - Continue anticoagulation with Heparin gtt -- eventual bridge to
   Coumadin
   - EP f/u once stable for ablation +/- pacer
   - Atropine and pacer pads at bedside
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Failed a swallow
   study.
   - PEG tube feeds
   # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cultures were negative.
   - Echo today will evaluate
   # DM2- On metformin at home.
   - ISS, follow fingersticks
   .
   # HTN- Continue amlodipine
   # BPH/hematuria- Hematuria resolved

","Summary:
The patient is a 86-year-old male with a chief complaint of dyspnea and cough. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure and pleural effusion. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypernatremia, and pericardial effusion without tamponade. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 115/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has been receiving heparin sodium infusion, furosemide (Lasix) infusion, and propofol sedation. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose levels, and normal kidney function. The patient's recent EBV serologies indicate a past infection. Thoracentesis was deferred until tomorrow. The patient's overall condition remains stable with ongoing lasix therapy to manage fluid balance.

   # Hypercarbic resp failure: Etiology for repeat episode of respiratory
   distress unclear. Occurred in setting of these chronically and still
   poorly explained bilateral pulmonary effusions. Tired quickly on
   pressure support yesterday, ECHO unchanged from prior.
   - Continue Lasix gtt for attempted diuresis
   - Will discuss with Interventional Pulmonary pleural effusion removal
   options which should help with extubation and maintaining
   self-ventilation
   # Bilateral pulmonary effusions: Likely one process driving both the
   pericardial and pulmonary effusions. [**Doctor First Name **] positive but titer 1:80,
   speckled likely non-specific
   - Consult Rheumatology
   - Discuss with IP per above (therapeutic thoracentesis vs. drain
   placement)
   - CT chest after therapeutic [**Female First Name (un) 217**] or sufficient drainage to assess
   size of effusions
   - Continue Lasix gtt per above although decreasing urine output to
   Lasix and systolic blood pressures low yesterday
   # Hypernatremia: Working hypothesis is this resulted from earlier fluid
   management decisions. Now resolved
   - Decrease free water with tube feeds
   # Expressive Aphasia: In setting of runs of A Fib, with known atrial
   thrombus, and MRI/MRA showing sequelae of cardioembolic strokes.
   - On Heparin gtt, PTT 52.6
   - Good blood pressure control
   #. AF / Bradycardia: Has been in sinus rhythm for past two days. Note
   thrombus in atrium.
   - Continue anticoagulation with Heparin gtt -- eventual bridge to
   Coumadin
   - EP f/u once stable for ablation +/- pacer
   - Atropine and pacer pads at bedside
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Failed a swallow
   study.
   - PEG tube feeds
   # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cultures were negative.  ECHO
   yesterday showed stable, minimal pericardial effusions
   # DM2- On metformin at home.
   - ISS, follow fingersticks

- The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation (AF) who was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient has chronic bilateral pulmonary effusions of unclear etiology, which led to his initial extubation and subsequent intubation.
- He also has a pericardial effusion that was drained but with unclear etiology.
- The patient is currently experiencing fever, and blood and urine cultures were sent.
- His current vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure ranging from 125/42 to 168/97 mmHg, heart rate ranging from 63-94 bpm, respiratory rate ranging from 13-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase levels.
- The pleural fluid analysis indicates an exudative effusion.
- The patient has hypernatremia, which has been resolved.
- He also has expressive aphasia, likely secondary to cardioembolic strokes.
- The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium, propofol, and other ICU medications.

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He presented to the ICU with pericardial and pulmonary effusions of unclear etiology. The patient was extubated and then reintubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with expressive aphasia, likely secondary to cardioembolic strokes. Other medical conditions include dysphagia, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia with hematuria, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial respiratory failure required intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the effusions recur or worsen.
2. Stroke: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the presence of atrial thrombus increase the risk of stroke. The patient has already experienced cardioembolic strokes causing expressive aphasia.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and comorbidities increase the risk of DVT. Anticoagulation therapy is being administered to prevent thrombus formation.
4. Infection: The patient has developed fever and elevated inflammatory markers, suggesting a possible infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection is essential.
5. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's history of congestive heart failure may predispose him to worsening cardiac function. Close monitoring of fluid"

   # Respiratory status: Most recent gas 7.46/46/100, good looking CXR
   after thoracentesis. He will have the other side drained today and if
   that goes well we can try pressure support, then SBT, possible
   extubation tomorrow. Etiology of respiratory problems likely the
   effusions, which could be rheumatologic or represent fluid overload. Of
   note he is 3.7 L + for LOS, and despite great UOP he is basically even
   for fluid balance not counting the thoracentesis. The effusions could
   be rheumatologic, although the [**Doctor First Name **] positive but titer 1:80, speckled
   likely non-specific. Sed rate and CRP markedly elevated.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with pericardial and pulmonary effusions of unclear etiology, extubated, then reintubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status has improved, with plans to attempt pressure support, spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), and potential extubation tomorrow. 

The patient's pleural effusion was drained, and cultures were negative. An echocardiogram showed minimal pericardial effusion. He also has dysphagia likely secondary to a cardioembolic stroke. 

The patient's atrial fibrillation has resolved, and he has a known atrial thrombus. He is on heparin and will be bridged to Coumadin. 

The patient has hypernatremia, which was resolved by adjusting fluid management. He also has expressive aphasia, possibly related to his runs of atrial fibrillation and known atrial thrombus. 

The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia with hematuria, and familial dyslexia. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pleural effusion: The patient has had an acute respiratory failure and a pleural effusion. This could potentially lead to further respiratory compromise if not managed appropriately.

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU for evaluation and management of respiratory failure, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, hypotension, and hypernatremia. The patient underwent thoracentesis on [date] and had a mildly exudative pleural fluid with a LDH level of 127. The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension requiring interventions such as a bolus of fluids and holding lasix. The patient is currently on pressure support and ABG analysis shows a pH of 7.53, PaCO2 of 43, PaO2 of 151, HCO3- of 34, and BE of -12. Other notable findings include fever, elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and elevated troponin T levels. The patient is also experiencing dysphagia and atrial fibrillation. The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but there are concerns about the potential complications arising from the pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia. The patient is receiving nutritional support through Boost Glucose Control and is on multiple medications including heparin sodium, lasix, and others. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is unknown."

   70M DM CHF AF p/w pericardial (drained) and pulmonary (diuresing)
   effusions, unclear etiologies, extubated then intubated for hypercarbic
   respiratory failure
   .
   # Respiratory status: Good looking CXR after thoracentesis X2. Etiology
   of respiratory problems likely the effusions, which could be
   rheumatologic or represent fluid overload. Of note he is 3.7 L + for
   LOS, and despite great UOP he is basically even for fluid balance not
   counting the thoracentesis. The effusions could be rheumatologic,
   although the [**Doctor First Name **] positive but titer 1:80, speckled likely non-specific.
   Sed rate and CRP markedly elevated. Rheumatology does not feel strongly
   that patient
s effusions are caused by underlying connective tissue
   disease
   - Although tired after three hours on pressure support yesterday, doing
   well this morning. Will try to extubate today. If fails again, would
   consider tracheostomy
   - Hold on further Lasix gtt diuresis given low blood pressures
   overnight
   - Will order repeat CT chest
   # Expressive Aphasia: In setting of runs of A Fib, with known atrial
   thrombus, and MRI/MRA showing sequelae of cardioembolic strokes.
   - On Heparin gtt
   - Good blood pressure control
   # Mild leukocytosis: Could be due to demargination from thoracenteses
   vs. underlying infectious/malignant/rheum process
   - Will trend for now
   - Monitor fever curve
   #. AF / Bradycardia: Has been in sinus rhythm for past 3 days. Note
   thrombus in atrium.
   - Continue anticoagulation with Heparin gtt -- eventual bridge to
   Coumadin
   - EP f/u once stable for ablation +/- pacer, if needed
   - Atropine and pacer pads at bedside
   - On Amlodipine and home lopressor for now
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Failed a swallow
   study.
   - PEG tube feeds
   # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cultures were negative.
   Recent Echo showed stable, minimal pericardial effusions
   # DM2- On metformin at home.
   - ISS, follow fingersticks
   .
   # HTN- Continue amlodipine and home lopressor
   - Will consider adding Captopril as needed but blood pressures low
   overnight
   # BPH/hematuria- Hematuria resumed overnight but mild
   - Outpatient cystoscopy
   - Continue Foley while intubated
   - Resume Flomax prior to Foley removal

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), pericardial and pulmonary effusions, dysphagia, hypertension (HTN), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with hematuria, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for various complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing low blood pressure, which may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

2. Pleural effusion, acute: The patient has had pleural fluid drained through thoracentesis. This suggests an underlying condition causing fluid accumulation in the pleural space.

3. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient initially required intubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if the effusions are not adequately managed.

4. Pericardial effusion: Although the recent echo showed stable and minimal pericardial effusions, there is still a risk of recurrent effusion development or cardiac tamponade if not properly managed.

5. Dysphagia: The patient has expressive aphasia and dysphagia, likely secondary to a cardioembolic stroke. This can lead to aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition if proper feeding"

   70M DM CHF AF p/w pericardial (drained) and pulmonary (diuresing)
   effusions, unclear etiologies, extubated then intubated for hypercarbic
   respiratory failure
   .
   # Respiratory status: Most recent gas 7.46/46/100, good looking CXR
   after thoracentesis. He will have the other side drained today and if
   that goes well we can try pressure support, then SBT, possible
   extubation tomorrow. Etiology of respiratory problems likely the
   effusions, which could be rheumatologic or represent fluid overload. Of
   note he is 3.7 L + for LOS, and despite great UOP he is basically even
   for fluid balance not counting the thoracentesis. The effusions could
   be rheumatologic, although the [**Doctor First Name **] positive but titer 1:80, speckled
   likely non-specific. Sed rate and CRP markedly elevated.
   -          Consult Rheumatology
   -          Schedule second [**Female First Name (un) 217**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He was admitted to the ICU for pericardial and pulmonary effusions, unclear etiologies, extubated then intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory status with good-looking chest X-ray after thoracentesis, hypotension, pleural effusion, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), pericardial effusion without tamponade, dysphagia, atrial fibrillation, hypernatremia, and hypertension.

The patient underwent thoracentesis on [**2107-1-26**] at 07:59 PM, removing 1.7 liters of pleural fluid that was mildly exudative with an LDH level of 127. The patient restarted Hep gtt after the procedure and subsequently became tachypneic and tachycardic, leading to being put back on assisted controlled ventilation (AC). An arterial blood gas (ABG) was sent, showing a pH of 7.53, PaCO2 of 43, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 377.

At midnight, the patient had a blood pressure reading of 80/30 mmHg and received a 500"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU for pericardial and pulmonary effusions, unclear etiology, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated and re-intubated multiple times. He has been tolerating extubation well but may require a tracheostomy if it fails again. The patient's pleural effusions have improved, and there are no signs of infection or malignancy. His cardiac function is compromised, with a history of a thrombus in the atrium and evidence of cardioembolic strokes. He is currently in sinus rhythm but requires anticoagulation with heparin and will start bridging to Coumadin today. The patient also has mild leukocytosis, dysphagia, and mild hypernatremia. He has a history of hypertension, benign hypotension, acute pleural effusion, acute respiratory failure, pericardial effusion without tamponade, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still a concern, as evidenced by previous episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure. If the patient's lungs do not recover adequately, there is a risk of further respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, with a history of congestive heart failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. However, the patient was successfully extubated but may require tracheostomy if extubation fails. The family has requested a second opinion from Doctor Last Name 775.

24-hour events include the patient being placed back on invasive ventilation, increasing tube feed rate, discontinuing Lasix, and obtaining sputum and pleural fluid cytology results that are negative for malignancy. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged except for new onset atrial fibrillation.

Flow sheet data shows the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's weight is currently 91.4 kg, with a total fluid input of 2,968 mL, including 712 mL of IV fluids. The total fluid output was 2,345 mL, resulting in a balance of 623 mL. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and is on standby ventilator mode. The ABG results indicate a slightly elevated pH level.

Physical examination findings are mostly not assessed. Lab results show elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, but within normal range for the context. The assessment and plan include hypertension, pleural effusion, respiratory failure, pericardial effusion, dysphag"

   # Respiratory status: Good looking CXR after thoracentesis X2. Etiology
   of respiratory problems likely the effusions, which could be
   rheumatologic or represent fluid overload. Of note he is 3.7 L + for
   LOS, and despite great UOP he is basically even for fluid balance not
   counting the thoracentesis. The effusions could be rheumatologic,
   although the [**Doctor First Name **] positive but titer 1:80, speckled likely non-specific.
   Sed rate and CRP markedly elevated. Rheumatology does not feel strongly
   that patient
s effusions are caused by underlying connective tissue
   disease
   - Although tired after three hours on pressure support yesterday, doing
   well this morning. Will try to extubate today. If fails again, would
   consider tracheostomy
   - Hold on further Lasix gtt diuresis given low blood pressures
   overnight
   - Will order repeat CT chest
   - Will wean nasal cannula as tolerated
   # Expressive Aphasia: In setting of runs of A Fib, with known atrial
   thrombus, and MRI/MRA showing sequelae of cardioembolic strokes.
   - On Heparin gtt; start Coumadin today
   - Good blood pressure control
   # Mild leukocytosis: Could be due to demargination from thoracenteses
   vs. underlying infectious/malignant/rheum process
   - Will trend for now
   - Monitor fever curve
   #. AF / Bradycardia: Has been in sinus rhythm for past 3 days. Note
   thrombus in atrium.
   - Continue anticoagulation with Heparin gtt -- eventual bridge to
   Coumadin
   - EP f/u once stable for ablation +/- pacer, if needed
   - Atropine and pacer pads at bedside
   - On Amlodipine and home lopressor for now
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Failed a swallow
   study.
   - PEG tube feeds
   # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cultures were negative.
   Recent Echo showed stable, minimal pericardial effusions
   # DM2- On metformin at home.
   - ISS, follow fingersticks
   .
   # HTN- Continue amlodipine and home lopressor
   - Will consider adding Captopril as needed but blood pressures low
   overnight
   # BPH/hematuria- Hematuria resumed overnight but mild
   - Outpatient cystoscopy
   - Continue Foley while intubated
   - Resume Flomax prior to Foley removal

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and had pericardial and pulmonary effusions that were drained. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His blood pressure has been fluctuating, with episodes of hypertension and hypotension. He also has leukocytosis, dysphagia, hypernatremia, and a history of benign hypertension and hypotension. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, amlodipine, and heparin. The plan is to extubate the patient today if he tolerates pressure support, and if not, a tracheostomy may be considered. Repeat CT chest will be ordered, and the patient will be weaned off the nasal cannula as tolerated. Sed rate and CRP are markedly elevated, indicating an inflammatory process. Rheumatology does not strongly believe that the patient's effusions are caused by underlying connective tissue disease."

   He is much improved but we still have several issues: Cardiomeg - with
   EF 65% here seems likely he either has MR or his EF is overestimated-
   will re-echo and consult cardiology. Nature of serositis - seems likely
   this was viral but have not completely r/o drug induced SLE.  Resp
   failure - likely has substantial emphysema and chronic mild hypercarbia
   - should have f/u as an outpt. We are initiating coumadin and getting
   him screened for rehab.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has been off the ventilator for 24 hours and is comfortable. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient has a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hypernatremia, dysphagia, and pericardial effusion. The patient is currently on heparin and metoprolol. The patient's review of systems is negative except for fatigue. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable except for poor dentition and the presence of a PEG tube. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 146/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and elevated glucose levels. The patient's EKG shows atrial fibrillation. The assessment and plan include hypertension, hypotension, pleural effusion, respiratory failure, pericardial effusion, dysphagia, atrial fibrillation, and hypernatremia. The patient's cardiomegaly with an estimated ejection fraction of 65% suggests the possibility of mitral regurgitation or overestimation of the"
