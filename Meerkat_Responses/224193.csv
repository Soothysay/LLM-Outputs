","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of asplenia, HIV, recent strep viridans sepsis, and multiple comorbidities. He presents with fever, chills, hypotension, and tachycardia, which are consistent with septic shock. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's current presentation suggests septic shock, likely caused by encapsulated organisms due to his asplenic status. MRSA is also a possibility given the history of a positive MRSA swab. Cultures will be followed, and antibiotics will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from baseline, indicating a possible pre-renal component. Close monitoring of urine output and fluid balance will be important in managing this complication.
3. HIV: The patient's last CD4 count was above 600, and his viral load is undetectable. Confirmation of HIV care and last CD4/viral load with PCP is recommended.
4. Hepatitis C: The patient has tested positive for Hep C recently. Further evaluation of viral load and discussion with PCP regarding patient awareness are necessary.
5. Hyperlipidemia/CAD risk factors: The patient's risk factors for cardiovascular disease should be managed by continuing home atorvastatin and ASA, while holding lis"

","The patient is a 57-year-old asplenic male with HIV, presenting with chills, lightheadedness, and an elevated white blood cell count. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, tachycardia, and fever. 

The patient has a history of strep viridans sepsis, recent Hepatitis C seroconversion, and a baseline creatinine level of 0.9. His current creatinine level is 1.3, indicating acute renal failure. 

The patient is on Atripla for HIV management, and his last CD4 count was over 600 with an undetectable viral load. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease risk factors, completed Hepatitis B treatment, and is now positive for Hepatitis C.

The patient's physical examination reveals a regular heart rhythm, clear lungs, and a well-healed laparotomy scar. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, and without rebound tenderness or guarding. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated glucose, and normal potassium levels. His blood cultures are pending, and he is receiving Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam for suspected sepsis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.1°F (37.8°C), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 128/51 mmHg,"

   Disposition:  ICU pending stabilization of hemodynamics
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old asplenic male with HIV who presented with chills, lightheadedness, and an elevated white blood cell count. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, tachycardia, and fever.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's symptoms of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension indicate a possible severe infection leading to septic shock. Given his asplenic status, encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae are more likely. Additionally, the presence of MRSA should be considered due to a history of a positive swab.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 0.9 to 1.3, suggesting acute renal failure. This may be pre-renal in nature due to hypotension and dehydration. It is important to monitor urine output and trend creatinine levels after fluid resuscitation.

3. HIV: The patient's last CD4 count was above 600, and his viral load is undetectable. He is currently on Atripla, a combination antiretroviral therapy. Regular monitoring of CD4 count and viral load is necessary.

4. Hepatitis C: The patient tested positive for hepatitis C recently, but the viral load is unknown. Further evaluation and monitoring are required"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male with a history of fever, hypotension, pneumonia, and renal failure. He was admitted to the ICU and received fluids during the night for an episode of hypotension. The patient responded well to the fluids, and his urine output is excellent. The patient has a preexisting allergy to erythromycin base, Biaxin (clarithromycin), and ciprofloxacin. He was on piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin, but the last doses were given on 11/22/22 at 4:30 AM and 10:04 AM, respectively. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's presentation of fever, hypotension, and pneumonia suggests septic shock. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. If left untreated, acute renal failure can lead to the accumulation of waste products in the body and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as fever and abnormal breath sounds, suggest pneumonia. If not properly managed, pneumonia can worsen and lead to respiratory failure.
4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is concerning, with an excessive intake and output."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old asplenic male with HIV (per pt. most recent CD4=600), with
   recent strep viridans sepsis ([**Month (only) 572**]/[**2148-6-14**]) presents with chills,
   lightheadedness, and elevated wbc who is admitted to the ICU for
   hypotension and tachycardia with fever.
   .
   # Sepsis:  Pt presented w fever, tachycardia and hypotension, which has
   responded to fluids.   Patient asplenic so there is concern for
   encapsulated organisms.  Pneumonia is not convincing on CXR; pt has not
   had productive cough or respiratory symptoms.   Left leg cellulites
   started yesterday morning, worsened overnight, even after starting
   vancomycin; because fevers and chills started prior to cellulitis
   appearance, it may or may not be the source of his initial hypotension
   and fevers.  Patient also has history of MRSA swab positive, which
   makes MRSA possible.   GC swabs negative.
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for now.
   - follow fever curve on antibiotics
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Cr 1.4 , though baseline in past appeared to be
   0.9, although recent outpatient Cr 1.44.  Urine output 150+ cc/hr.
   FeNa 2.1%, FeUrea 54% so patient likely has intrarenal chronic renal
   insufficiency
   -will follow u/o and trend Cr
   .
   #HIV:  last CD4 > 600 per pt, viral load undetectable.  On Atripla
   - continue antiretrovirals: continue home efavirenz--a NNRTI,
   emtricitabine--a nucleoside RTI, and tenofavir--a nucleoside RTI, 1 tab
   PO daily.
   #Hep C:  recent testing [**10-23**] shows Ab +.    viral load unknown.
   - PCP:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 861**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10614**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10615**]
   #Hyperlipidemia/CAD risk factors:
   - continue home atorvastatin and ASA
   - hold lisinopril in context of concern for hypotension.  Can restart
   tomorrow if BP holds well
   #Hep B:  diagnosed [**2117**].  ""completed treatment"" at that time.

","The patient is a 57-year-old asplenic male with HIV, presenting with chills, lightheadedness, and elevated white blood cell count. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and tachycardia with fever. The patient has a history of strep viridans sepsis, recent pneumonia, and cellulitis on the left leg. He also has a history of MRSA swab positive and negative GC swabs.

Assessment and plan include sepsis, acute renal failure, HIV, hep C, hyperlipidemia/CAD risk factors, and hep B. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for possible MRSA and other bacterial infections. Acute renal failure is suspected with a creatinine level of 1.4 and urine output of 150+ cc/hr. The patient's HIV status is well-controlled with antiretrovirals. He is also positive for hep C and has a history of hep B.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.3°C (101°F)
- Heart rate: 80 bpm (normal range: 72-101 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 120/62 mmHg (normal range: 76/48-145/73 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute (normal range: 16-32 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on nasal cannula
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

Physical examination reveals a pleasant and conversational patient with no distress. The patient has a well-healed laparotomy scar, clear oropharynx without thrush, and regular heart sounds with a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. Lung auscultation shows clear lungs bilaterally with no wheezes, rales, or ronchi. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, and bowel sounds are present. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding, and no organomegaly.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (28.1 K/uL), slightly elevated hemoglobin (11.3 g/dL), normal platelet count (383 K/uL), and elevated creatinine (1.4 mg/dL). Other lab values include normal electrolyte levels, slightly elevated lactate (1.8 mmol/L), and normal liver function tests.

The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and antiretrovirals. He has also been receiving nutrition and glycemic control measures in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis, acute renal failure, hep C progression, and possible MRSA infection. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old asplenic male with HIV (per pt. most recent CD4=600), with
   recent strep viridans sepsis ([**Month (only) 572**]/[**2148-6-14**]) presents with chills,
   lightheadedness, and elevated wbc who is admitted to the ICU for
   hypotension and tachycardia with fever.
   .
   # Sepsis:  Pt presented w fever, tachycardia and hypotension, which has
   responded to fluids.   Patient asplenic so there is concern for
   encapsulated organisms.  Pneumonia is not convincing on CXR; pt has not
   had productive cough or respiratory symptoms.   Left leg cellulites
   started yesterday morning, worsened overnight, even after starting
   vancomycin; because fevers and chills started prior to cellulitis
   appearance, it may or may not be the source of his initial hypotension
   and fevers.  Patient also has history of MRSA swab positive, which
   makes MRSA possible.   GC swabs negative.
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for now.
   - follow fever curve on antibiotics
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Cr 1.4 , though baseline in past appeared to be
   0.9, although recent outpatient Cr 1.44.  Urine output 150+ cc/hr.
   FeNa 2.1%, FeUrea 54% so patient likely has intrarenal chronic renal
   insufficiency
   -will follow u/o and trend Cr
   .
   #HIV:  last CD4 > 600 per pt, viral load undetectable.  On Atripla
   - continue antiretrovirals: continue home efavirenz--a NNRTI,
   emtricitabine--a nucleoside RTI, and tenofavir--a nucleoside RTI, 1 tab
   PO daily.
   #Hep C:  recent testing [**10-23**] shows Ab +.    viral load unknown.
   - PCP:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 861**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10614**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10615**]

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed his history with him, and
   was present for the key portion of the services provided.  I have
   reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10501**]
s note and agree with her findings and plan of care.
   Mr [**Known lastname 3781**] feels better, his BP is improved, and his WBC and fever are
   trending down.  I am not convinced pneumonia is the cause of his
septic
 presentation, and while  his cellulitis would explain his
   initial presenting clinical sx, he actually didn
t have any cellulitic
   findins till yesterday. Hence his cellulitis appears to have occurred
   while on Vanco and Zosyn.  Bld cultures are neg and overall he is not
   toxic, but for now, until I am convinced his left shin cellulitis is
   improving I would continue both of these antibiotics, especially with
   his asplenic state and prior positive MRSA status.  He has already been
   called out to the floor and can be transferred once a bed is
   available.  If he doesn
t continue to improve I would have a low
   threshold for ID consultation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old asplenic male with HIV who presented with chills, lightheadedness, and an elevated white blood cell count. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and tachycardia with fever. The patient has a history of recent strep viridans sepsis and his current conditions include sepsis, acute renal failure, HIV, hepatitis C, hyperlipidemia/CAD risk factors, and hepatitis B.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin sodium, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and atripla.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which has responded to fluids. There is concern for encapsulated organisms due to his asplenic status. The patient also has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.4 and urine output of 150+ cc/hr. The patient's renal function appears to be intrarenal chronic renal insufficiency.

Other notable findings include the patient's HIV status with a CD4 count over 600 and an undetectable viral load. He is currently on antiretrov"

   recent strep viridans sepsis ([**Month (only) 572**]/[**2148-6-14**]) presents with chills,
   lightheadedness, and elevated wbc who is admitted to the ICU for
   hypotension and tachycardia with fever.
   .
   # Septic Shock: Fever, tachycardia and hypotension (has responded to
   fluids).  Patient asplenic so encapsulated organisms likely, and with
   consolidation on CXR, strep pnemo is most likely organism.  Patient
   also has history of MRSA swab positive, which makes MRSA possible.
   Recent sexual exposures were protected, but could consider GC as
   another possible source.
   -Vanco/Zosyn for now.
   - Narrow to ceftriaxone + azithromycin if cultures remain negative
   after 48 hours.
   -f/u cultures (blood, urine, stool).  Will send sputum for culture if
   develops a productive cough
   -allow pt to take POs, will follow u/o.  Goal U/O > 50 cc/hr.  will
   bolus LR.
   -follow fever curve on antibiotics
   -d/c central line and foley cath given well-appearing
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Cr 1.4 , though baseline appears to be 0.9,
   although recent outpatient Cr 1.44.  Urine output 150cc/hr.  FeNa 2.1%,
   FeUrea 54%
   -will follow u/o and trend Cr after fluid rescuscitation.
   .
   #HIV:  last CD4 > 600 per pt, viral load undetectable.  On Atripla
   -confirm HIV care and last CD4/viral load with PCP tomorrow
   [**Name9 (PRE) 175**] home efavirenz--a NNRTI, emtricitabine--a nucleoside RTI, and
   tenofavir--a nucleoside RTI, 1 tab PO daily.
   #Hep C:  recent testing [**10-23**] shows Ab +.   ? viral load.
   - touch base with PCP re whether or not patient is aware.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 861**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10614**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10615**]
   #Hyperlipidemia/CAD risk factors:
   - continue home atorvastatin
   - continue home ASA
   - hold lisinopril in context of concern for hypotension.  Can restart
   if BP holds well.
   #Hep B:  diagnosed [**2117**].  ""completed treatment"" at that time.
   #FEN: non-anion gap acidosis (pH 7.36), likely secondary to NS
   administration (Cl 111), regular diet.
   -No NS for IVF, will use LR if needed
   -full diabetic diet for now given low likelihood of intubation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old asplenic male with HIV and a recent history of strep viridans sepsis. He presents with chills, lightheadedness, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, tachycardia, and fever. He is currently receiving Vancomycin and Zosyn for suspected septic shock due to encapsulated organisms like Streptococcus pneumoniae or possible MRSA. The patient also has a history of Hepatitis B and C, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular disease risk factors. He is being treated for acute renal failure and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's symptoms of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension indicate septic shock. The use of Vancomycin and Zosyn is appropriate, but close monitoring of vital signs and response to antibiotics is necessary. If the patient's condition worsens, additional interventions such as vasopressors may be required.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output suggest acute renal failure. Monitoring the patient's renal function and ensuring adequate fluid resuscitation are essential. Adjustments to medication dosages may be necessary due to altered renal clearance.

3. Hepatitis B and C: The patient has tested positive for both Hepatitis B and"
