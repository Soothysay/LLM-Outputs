   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 year-old male with a history of hodkin's s/p BMT in 93,
   h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, admitted with influenza B now with
   worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress and CT concerning for
   multilobar PNA.
   1) Respiratory failure: Patient required intubation yesterday for
   worsening respiratory status and was started on linezolid and
   oseltamavir for MRSA pneumonia (had continued to decompensate on
   vancomycin) and influenza respectively.  Given presumptively negative
   respiratory cultures and current appearance of diffuse process seems
   more likely to be virally induced ARDS than bacterial superinfection
   but given severity will continue abx until final cultures.
   - cont linezolid/cefepime/azithro until final respiratory cultures
   negative
   - Continue oseltamavir for influenza B
   - Ventilation per ARDSnet protocol
   2) SIRS/ Hypotension: Still possiblity of sepsis thought blood cx are
   still negative.  Other major differential is for SIRS due to ARDS.
   Most recent CVP low at 3.
   - NS bolus of  1000 cc and repeat to CVP of [**8-6**]
   - Broadly covered if he is septic, will continue abx per above
   - culture with fevers; monitoring leukocytosis curve
   3) Hypothyroidism: cont home levothyroxine
   4)  FEN:  NPO for now, given potential for prolonged intubation will
   initiate nutrtition consult to start tube feeds

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's disease, post bone marrow transplant in 1993, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted with influenza B and subsequently developed worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress.
- The patient required intubation for worsening respiratory status and was started on linezolid and oseltamavir for suspected MRSA pneumonia and influenza, respectively.
- The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, and a CT scan is concerning for multilobar pneumonia.
- The patient has a fever, and blood cultures have been obtained. The rapid test came back positive for influenza B, and the patient is being treated with oseltamavir for this.
- The patient received a blood transfusion and has been given broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential sepsis.
- The patient's hypothyroidism is being managed with levothyroxine.
- The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) at the moment, and a nutrition consult has been initiated to start tube feeds due to the potential for prolonged intubation.
- The patient has multiple lines and catheters inserted, including a multi-lumen line, arterial line, and central venous pressure monitoring.
- The patient is receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (SQ UF Heparin) and stress ulcers (P"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, post bone marrow transplant in 1993, hypothyroidism, and pericarditis. He was admitted with influenza B and is now experiencing worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress. A CT scan showed concern for multilobar pneumonia.

The patient required intubation yesterday due to worsening respiratory status and was started on linezolid and oseltamavir for suspected MRSA pneumonia and influenza, respectively. His respiratory status is currently stable on ventilator.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring. Continue vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin. Check sputum culture and repeat ABG with significant hypoxemia and A-a gradient. Consider CVL placement for CVP monitoring.
2) SIRS: The likely source of infection is pulmonary given CT findings. Consider CVL placement for CVP monitoring. Continue with current antibiotic regimen.
3) Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
4) FEN: Keep the patient NPO for now and give a 500 cc NS bolus.
5) Access: Have 2 PIVs and consider CVL placement.
6) PPx: Perform hepatic sc, ppi as outpatient.
7) Code: Confirm full code status.
8) Dispo: Keep the patient in the ICU until respiratory status improves.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory failure: The patient may experience further deterioration in respiratory function, leading to potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2) Sepsis: Given the patient's SIRS criteria and positive blood cultures, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction.
3) Pneumonia: The patient has signs of multilobar pneumonia on CT, and the infection may progress or not respond to current antibiotic therapy.
4) Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently within normal limits, but there is a risk of developing hypotension due to sepsis or fluid shifts.
5) Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobilization and the patient's medical history increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures are in place, but regular monitoring is essential.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate assessment and management of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo male with Hodgkin's disease now admitted with influenza and who
   has evolved significant worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure
   across the admission.  This is with evolution of bilateral and patchy
   consolidations consistent with superinfection of initial viral insult.
   This is suggested by evolution of cough/plegm/feve/infiltrate.
   7.46/34/47 was repeat ABG following arrival in ICU.  Patient was
   intubated with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure likley related to
   bilateral and dependent consolidations with likley bacterial
   superinfection of previous viral pneumonitis.
   Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure-
   -A/C
will maintain PEEP at 10-12
   -Continue FIO2=1.0
   -Will need to replace volume with patient currently hypotensive
   -PIP=30, Pplat-27 consistent with presentation
   -Wean FIO2 as possible
   -Advance ETT
   -Will place A-line
   Pneumonia-
   -Linezolid/Cefepime/Axithro
   -Sputum GS C+S
   -Follow up culture results
   -Urine Legionella pending
   -Bronch and BAL if patient improved stability to tolerate procedure or
   with inadequate sampling
   Sepsis-
   -Patient with significant hypotension with intubation and leading to
   respiratory failure
   -Will need CVL and volume replacement
   -Follow up cultures results
   -Will titrate therapy to stability of blood pressure.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's disease, who was admitted with influenza and has since developed significant worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's condition is consistent with bilateral and patchy consolidations, suggesting a superinfection of the initial viral insult. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/65 mmHg to 145/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.6, hemoglobin level of 28.5 g/dL, platelet count of 250,000/mm³, blood glucose level of 117 mg/dL, and a lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L. The arterial blood gas analysis reveals a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 135 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination findings include general appearance of appearing unwell, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, endotracheal tube in situ, and bilateral rhonchi"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo male with Hodgkin's disease now admitted with influenza and who
   has evolved significant worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure
   across the admission.  This is with evolution of bilateral and patchy
   consolidations consistent with superinfection of initial viral insult.
   This is suggested by evolution of cough/plegm/feve/infiltrate.
   7.46/34/47 was repeat ABG following arrival in ICU.  Patient was
   intubated with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure likley related to
   bilateral and dependent consolidations with likley bacterial
   superinfection of previous viral pneumonitis.
   Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure-
   -A/C
will maintain PEEP at 10-12
   -Continue FIO2=1.0
   -Will need to replace volume with patient currently hypotensive
   -PIP=30, Pplat-27 consistent with presentation
   -Wean FIO2 as possible
   -Advance ETT
   -Will place A-line
   Pneumonia-
   -Linezolid/Cefepime/Axithro
   -Sputum GS C+S
   -Follow up culture results
   -Urine Legionella pending
   -Bronch and BAL if patient improved stability to tolerate procedure or
   with inadequate sampling
   Sepsis-
   -Patient with significant hypotension with intubation and leading to
   respiratory failure
   -Will need CVL and volume replacement
   -Follow up cultures results
   -Will titrate therapy to stability of blood pressure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's disease, currently admitted for influenza. He has experienced significant worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure across his admission. The patient has bilateral and patchy consolidations consistent with superinfection of the initial viral insult. He has been intubated due to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure likely related to bacterial superinfection of previous viral pneumonitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition is characterized by severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, which may lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation. This can result in complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and septic shock.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of bilateral consolidations and the positive influenza B test suggest a bacterial superinfection. If left untreated, this can progress to community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia, leading to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
3. Sepsis: The patient's significant hypotension following intubation indicates possible sepsis, which can be caused by a bacterial infection. If not managed promptly, sepsis can progress to septic shock, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented through appropriate measures"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's disease, currently admitted for influenza. He has experienced significant worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure across his admission, likely related to bilateral and dependent consolidations with a possible diagnosis of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient was intubated due to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently on invasive ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. ARDS: The presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and the clinical presentation suggest a high likelihood of ARDS. If not properly managed, ARDS can progress to respiratory failure and potentially require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support.
3. Bacterial Superinfection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing a bacterial superinfection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). If not managed appropriately, it may lead to shock and organ dysfunction.
5. Nosocomial Infections: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) and"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 year-old male with a history of hodkin's s/p BMT in 93,
   h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, admitted with influenza B now with
   worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress and CT concerning for
   multilobar PNA.
   1) Respiratory failure: Patient required intubation yesterday for
   worsening respiratory status and was started on linezolid and
   oseltamavir for MRSA pneumonia (had continued to decompensate on
   vancomycin) and influenza respectively.  Given presumptively negative
   respiratory cultures and current appearance of diffuse process seems
   more likely to be virally induced ARDS than bacterial superinfection
   but given severity will continue abx until final cultures.
   - cont linezolid/cefepime/azithro until final respiratory cultures
   negative
   - Continue oseltamavir for influenza B
   - Ventilation per ARDSnet protocol
   2) SIRS/ Hypotension: Still possiblity of sepsis thought blood cx are
   still negative.  Other major differential is for SIRS due to ARDS.
   Most recent CVP low at 3.
   - NS bolus of  1000 cc and repeat to CVP of [**8-6**]
   - Broadly covered if he is septic, will continue abx per above
   - culture with fevers; monitoring leukocytosis curve
   3) Hypothyroidism: cont home levothyroxine
   4)  FEN:  NPO for now, given potential for prolonged intubation will
   initiate nutrtition consult to start tube feeds
   5)  Access: 2 PIVs; right IJ
   6)  PPx: hep sc, ppi as outpt
   7) Code: FULL (confirmed with patient)
   8)  Dispo: ICU until respiratory status improves

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, post bone marrow transplant in 1993, and previous pericarditis and hypothyroidism. He was admitted with influenza B and has now developed worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient required intubation yesterday and was started on linezolid and oseltamivir for suspected MRSA pneumonia and influenza, respectively. His respiratory cultures have been presumptively negative, but there is concern for a diffuse process, possibly viral-induced ARDS. He will continue on antibiotics until final respiratory cultures are obtained. He is being ventilated according to the ARDSnet protocol. The patient also has potential sepsis, possibly due to SIRS from ARDS. He received a NS bolus to improve CVP and will continue broad-spectrum antibiotics. His thyroid function needs to be monitored while on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. He is NPO for now, but a nutrition consult has been initiated to start tube feeds due to the potential for prolonged intubation. The patient has two PIVs and a right IJ line for access. His code status is full code, and he will be dispositioned in the ICU until his respiratory status improves."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 year-old male with a history of hodkin's s/p BMT in 93,
   h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, admitted with influenza B now with
   worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress and CT concerning for
   multilobar PNA.
   1) Respiratory failure: Patient with hypoxic respiratory presumed due
   to infectious process/ ARDS.  Patient with known influenza and with
   PaO2/FiO2<200 he does meet criteria for ARDS.  Main differential is
   Post flu ARDS vs influenza with bacterial superinfection leading to
   ARDS.  The patient
s chest radiograph is worsened today with increased
   non-anatomic hazy opacity consistent with atelectasis vs effusion per
   radiology.   Nevertheless he maintains good ventilation and adequate
   oxygenation on pressure support currently.  Tidal volumes are
   relatively low (450-475) so minimal concern for barotrauma secondary to
   allowing patient to set own tidal volumes.
   -wean pressure support
   - On day 4 of linezolid (or vanc), cefepime, azithromycin.  Will plan
   to d/c azithromycin tomorrow after completion of  five day course.
   Will continue typical coverage until the patient
s final respiratory
   cultures are negative.
   -F/U cultures
   - Continue oseltamavir for influenza B
   2) SIRS/ Hypotension: Presumedly due to sepsis/SIRS.  Blood cultures
   remain negative as yet but patient was still febrile last night.
   Possibly flu vs persistent bacterial infection.  Patient received 3L NS
   for hypotension in context of low CVP
s.  Received norepinephrine for
   persistent hypotension despite CVP of 10.  Now off pressors and some
   concern LOS positive fluid balance could worsen ARDS and make weaning
   more difficult.
   -If  pressures will tolerate attempt gentle diuresis.
   -Continue broad abx coverage pending final respiratory cultures per
   above, culture if spikes
   - Broadly covered if he is septic, will continue abx per above
   -Given elevated LFT
s and increased leukocytosis will obtain RUQ u/s to
   rule out choleycystitis and look for drainable source of infection
   3) Hx of Hodgkin
s Lymphoma/pericardial disease: Particularly given
   current concern for effusion there is a possibility of post radiation
   serositis in the chest or possibility of effusion.  Will obtain ECG to
   assess voltages as patient
s clinical picture not consistent with
   tamponade (no chest pain, SOB) and have more compelling causes of
   hypotension and CXR findings.  Still if ECG abnormal or continued
   concern would obtain TTE to assess for pericarditis.
   -ECG +/- TTE as indicated.
   4) Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   5)  FEN:  NPO for now, given potential for prolonged intubation will
   initiate nutrtition consult to start tube feeds
   6)  Access: 2 PIVs; right IJ (pulled back yesterday and more
   appropriately sited on follow up scans)

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, post bone marrow transplant in 1993, hypothyroidism, and pericarditis. He was admitted with influenza B and is now experiencing worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress. The chest X-ray shows multilobar pneumonia (PNA) and he meets the criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. He has been started on ARDSnet protocol for ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress, along with the presence of multilobar PNA on chest X-ray, indicate the possibility of respiratory failure. The main differential is post-flu ARDS versus influenza with bacterial superinfection leading to ARDS. The patient's tidal volumes are relatively low, minimizing concern for barotrauma.

2. SIRS/Hypotension: The patient's presumed sepsis/SIRS could be due to flu or persistent bacterial infection. Blood cultures remain negative, but the patient is still febrile. He received a 3L NS bolus for hypotension in the context of a low central venous pressure (CVP). The patient also received norepinephrine for persistent hypotension despite a CVP of 10. Now, there is concern about the potential"

   hypoxemic respiratory failure.  He has shown some substantial
   improvement in oxygenation and ventilation over past 24 hours.  Of note
   he has shown recurrent fever and requirement for pressor support--this
   is in the setting of elevation of AP and TA's.
   1)Respiratory Failure/ARDS-patient with substantial improvement in
   ventilation and oxygenation over the past 24 hours.  This is consistent
   with substantial improvement and in the setting of supportive care with
   lung protective strategy

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted with influenza, which has progressed to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and hypoxemic respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient has shown some improvement in oxygenation and ventilation over the past 24 hours. However, he has recurrent fever and requires pressor support. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and liver enzymes. Imaging reveals bilateral lower lung field opacities consistent with effusion and consolidations. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient's condition can worsen if he experiences further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, leading to increased respiratory distress and potential need for more aggressive respiratory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, elevated inflammatory markers, and organ dysfunction indicate the possibility of sepsis. If not appropriately managed, it can lead to organ failure and potentially death.
3. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): There is a risk of developing a secondary bacterial infection due to his compromised respiratory status. Prompt identification and treatment of any new or worsening symptoms are crucial.
4. Acalculous cholecystitis: The patient's worsening hypotension and increased liver enzymes raise the possibility of ac"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 year-old male with a history of hodkin's s/p BMT in 93,
   h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, admitted with influenza B now with
   worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress and CT concerning for
   multilobar PNA.
   1) Respiratory failure: Patient with hypoxic respiratory presumed due
   to infectious process/ ARDS.  Patient with known influenza and with
   PaO2/FiO2<200 he does meet criteria for ARDS.  Initial insult was most
   likely flu but given staph aureus in respiratory culture there is
   evidence for bacterial superinfection.  He is continuing to maintain
   good ventilation and adequate oxygenation on pressure support.
   Potentially concerning to allow ARDS patient off protocol due to
   ability to exceed low lung volumes but he seems more comfortable on PS
   and tidal volumes are relatively low (450-475) decreasing concern for
   barotrauma.
   - On day 5 of linezolid (or vanc), cefepime and oseltamavir.
   -F/U cultures
   - Continue oseltamavir for influenza B
   2) SIRS/ Hypotension/Fevers: This patient
s fever is not as concerning
   in and of itself given influenza can often cause persistent fever.
   Still, with persistent white count and his leukocytosis recurring it is
   very concerning that we are not adequately covering an infectious
   process.  Blood cultures remain negative and RUQ U/S not suggestive of
   choleycystitis.  Major concern now if for a drainable collection as his
   broad spectrum antibiotics should cover most common organisms.
   -Continue current antimicrobial regimen
   -CT scan of torso and sinuses looking for possible closed space
   infection and to better evaluate possible effusions vs atelectasis in
   lungs
   -Echo to evaluate for other causes of hypotension give patient has hx
   of pericarditis and could potentially have some restrictive pathology
   3) Hx of Hodgkin
s Lymphoma/pericardial disease: Particularly given
   current concern for effusion there is a possibility of post radiation
   serositis in the chest or possibility of effusion.
   -TTE per above
   4) Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   5)  FEN:  NPO for now, given potential for prolonged intubation will
   initiate nutrtition consult to start tube feeds
   6)  Access: 2 PIVs; right IJ (pulled back yesterday and more
   appropriately sited on follow up scans)
   7)  PPx: hep sc, ppi as outpt
   8 Code: FULL (confirmed with patient)
   8)  Dispo: ICU until respiratory status improves

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, post bone marrow transplant in 1993, hypothyroidism, admitted with influenza B, now with worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, suspected acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis with possible bacterial superinfection, and possible closed space infection.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient also has a history of pericarditis and hypothyroidism.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, oseltamivir for influenza B, and monitoring for potential complications such as pneumonia, effusion, or atelectasis. Further imaging and diagnostic tests, including a CT scan of the torso and sinuses, and an echocardiogram, may be necessary to evaluate for other causes of hypotension and assess the patient's cardiac function.

Nutritional support is also being considered due to the potential for prolonged intubation, and the patient is currently receiving enteral nutrition.

Overall, the patient's condition remains critical, and close monitoring and management are required to address the multiple medical complications present."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 year-old male with a history of hodkin's s/p BMT in 93,
   h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, admitted with influenza B now with
   worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress and CT concerning for
   multilobar PNA.
   1) Respiratory failure: Patient with hypoxic respiratory presumed due
   to infectious process/ ARDS.  Patient with known influenza and with
   PaO2/FiO2<200 he does meet criteria for ARDS.  Main differential is
   Post flu ARDS vs influenza with bacterial superinfection leading to
   ARDS.  The patient
s chest radiograph is worsened today with increased
   non-anatomic hazy opacity consistent with atelectasis vs effusion per
   radiology.   Nevertheless he maintains good ventilation and adequate
   oxygenation on pressure support currently.  Tidal volumes are
   relatively low (450-475) so minimal concern for barotrauma secondary to
   allowing patient to set own tidal volumes.
   -wean pressure support
   - On day 4 of linezolid (or vanc), cefepime, azithromycin.  Will plan
   to d/c azithromycin tomorrow after completion of  five day course.
   Will continue typical coverage until the patient
s final respiratory
   cultures are negative.
   -F/U cultures
   - Continue oseltamavir for influenza B
   2) SIRS/ Hypotension: Presumedly due to sepsis/SIRS.  Blood cultures
   remain negative as yet but patient was still febrile last night.
   Possibly flu vs persistent bacterial infection.  Patient received 3L NS
   for hypotension in context of low CVP
s.  Received norepinephrine for
   persistent hypotension despite CVP of 10.  Now off pressors and some
   concern LOS positive fluid balance could worsen ARDS and make weaning
   more difficult.
   -If  pressures will tolerate attempt gentle diuresis.
   -Continue broad abx coverage pending final respiratory cultures per
   above, culture if spikes
   - Broadly covered if he is septic, will continue abx per above
   -Given elevated LFT
s and increased leukocytosis will obtain RUQ u/s to
   rule out choleycystitis and look for drainable source of infection
   3) Hx of Hodgkin
s Lymphoma/pericardial disease: Particularly given
   current concern for effusion there is a possibility of post radiation
   serositis in the chest or possibility of effusion.  Will obtain ECG to
   assess voltages as patient
s clinical picture not consistent with
   tamponade (no chest pain, SOB) and have more compelling causes of
   hypotension and CXR findings.  Still if ECG abnormal or continued
   concern would obtain TTE to assess for pericarditis.
   -ECG +/- TTE as indicated.
   4) Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   5)  FEN:  NPO for now, given potential for prolonged intubation will
   initiate nutrtition consult to start tube feeds
   6)  Access: 2 PIVs; right IJ (pulled back yesterday and more

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo male with admission with influenza with a history of Hodgkin
   Disease and now subsequently complicated by ARDS and hypoxemic
   respiratory failure now complicated by persistent sepsis.  He has
   continued good tolerance of PSV support with FIO2 wean oxygenation has
   remained reasonably stable.  The issue has been one of continued fevers
   and hypotension despite antibiotics in place.  In addition he has had
   significant rise in WBC count all arguing for untreated bacterial
   infection, although, cultures have been negative to date.  LFT's have
   improved in this setting and may be consistent with mild intrahepatic
   cholestasis.
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   -Cefepime/Linezolid
   -He has GPC
s noted in sputum and suggestion of S. Aureus involving
   pulmonary
   -Continue with ABX and raise issue of alternative coverage based up on
   culture and imaging findings.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   -would favor return to A/C support to maintain adequate ventilatory
   support if worsening
   -return to A/C support if need for further imaging needed as with
   increased sedation will be needed
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   -Levophed continues
   -WBC is rising and persistent fevers seen
   -Concern for possible empyema and pulmonary cavitary lesions
   -Catheter placed in the setting of fevers and fevers have continued
   -No cultures positive
   -Sinusitis is somewhat unilikely as is relatively early in course but
   is possible
   -Pulmonary abscess is possible and of concern
   -U/S negative but intra-abdominal source is possible with focal
   collection
   -DVT is possible but will be evaluated with LENI
   -ECHO to eval for possible
   -No evidence of rash
will follow up on diff and consider possible drug
   fever
   -Will pursue further interventions as indicated based upon findings
   -No change in ABX and will pursue evaluation given hypotension, fever,

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin Disease who was admitted with influenza and subsequently developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with persistent sepsis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient has a significant rise in white blood cell count, which may indicate an untreated bacterial infection. Cultures have been negative to date, but there is a suggestion of Staphylococcus aureus involving the pulmonary system.

2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient's oxygenation has remained reasonably stable, but there is a concern for worsening ventilatory support. The physician suggests returning to assist-control (A/C) support to maintain adequate ventilation.

3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has persistent fevers and a rising white blood cell count, indicating ongoing infection. There is concern for possible empyema (pus collection in the lungs), pulmonary cavitary lesions, sinusitis, pulmonary abscess, intra-abdominal source of infection, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and drug fever. Further investigations will be pursued based on findings.

4. Other complications: The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various aspects, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against D"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 year-old male with a history of hodkin's s/p BMT in 93,
   h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, admitted with influenza B now with
   worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress and CT concerning for
   multilobar PNA.
   1) Respiratory failure: Patient with hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has
   known influenza B as well as staph aureus in sputums.  Presumably, flu
   with bacterial superinfection is the etiology of his ARDS.  The patient
   was on AC overnight but was switched back to CPAP this AM.  Since then,
   he has been pulling lower tidal volumes than previously (<400) and more
   tachypneic.  We will place him back on AC to decrease work of breathing
   while we continue to treat his pneumonia and support him through his
   ARDS.  He is on day 6 of antimicrobial therapy with linezolid, cefepime
   and oseltamavir.
   -F/U cultures, obtain viral cultures per ID recommendation
   - Continue current antimicrobials pending culture data
   -IP will attempt to perform diagnostic thoracentesis today as couldn
   be done at bedside.
   2) Leukocytosis/Fevers: Imaging yesterday failed to reveal a closed
   space infection or a drainable abcess.  The presumed etiology of his
   fevers is pneumonia and possibly sinusitis though his
   -Continue current antimicrobial regimen
   -CT scan of torso and sinuses looking for possible closed space
   infection and to better evaluate possible effusions vs atelectasis n
   lungs
   -Echo to evaluate for other causes of hypotension give patient has hx
   of pericarditis and could potentially have some restrictive pathology
   3) Hx of Hodgkin
s Lymphoma/pericardial disease: Particularly given
   current concern for effusion there is a possibility of post radiation
   serositis in the chest or possibility of effusion.
   -TTE per above
   4) Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   5)  FEN:  NPO for now, given potential for prolonged intubation will
   initiate nutrtition consult to start tube feeds

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma post bone marrow transplant in 1993, hypothyroidism, and pericarditis. He was admitted with influenza B and is now experiencing worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress. His current condition suggests acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely secondary to influenza B with bacterial superinfection. The patient's respiratory status has worsened despite being on CPAP, so he has been placed back on assisted controlled ventilation (AC) to decrease work of breathing while treating his pneumonia and supporting him through ARDS. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS. Continued support and treatment for pneumonia will be necessary to improve his respiratory status.
2. Bacterial Superinfection: The presence of staph aureus in sputum cultures suggests a bacterial superinfection, which needs to be addressed with appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
3. Sinusitis: Bilateral paranasal sinusitis has been reported, indicating possible sinus infection that may contribute to the patient's overall respiratory symptoms and should be treated accordingly.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure (88/48 mmHg) may be due to sepsis or other underlying conditions such as pericarditis. Further evaluation and management are needed to address this issue.

   moderate.
   2. Prominence of the esophagus, which is diffusely filled with oral
   contrast
   material, consistent with extensive gastroesophageal reflux disease.
   Given the degree of contrast reflux into the esophagus, which is

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 year-old male with a history of hodkin's s/p BMT in 93,
   h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, admitted with influenza B now with
   worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress and CT concerning for
   multilobar PNA.
   1) Respiratory failure: Patient with hypoxic respiratory presumed due
   to infectious process/ ARDS.  Patient with known influenza and with
   PaO2/FiO2<200 he does meet criteria for ARDS.  Initial insult was most
   likely flu but given staph aureus in respiratory culture there is
   evidence for bacterial superinfection.  He is continuing to maintain
   good ventilation and adequate oxygenation on pressure support.
   Potentially concerning to allow ARDS patient off protocol due to
   ability to exceed low lung volumes but he seems more comfortable on PS
   and tidal volumes are relatively low (450-475) decreasing concern for
   barotrauma.
   - On day 5 of linezolid (or vanc), cefepime and oseltamavir.
   -F/U cultures
   - Continue oseltamavir for influenza B
   2) SIRS/ Hypotension/Fevers: This patient
s fever is not as concerning
   in and of itself given influenza can often cause persistent fever.
   Still, with persistent white count and his leukocytosis recurring it is
   very concerning that we are not adequately covering an infectious
   process.  Blood cultures remain negative and RUQ U/S not suggestive of
   choleycystitis.  Major concern now if for a drainable collection as his
   broad spectrum antibiotics should cover most common organisms.
   -Continue current antimicrobial regimen
   -CT scan of torso and sinuses looking for possible closed space
   infection and to better evaluate possible effusions vs atelectasis in
   lungs
   -Echo to evaluate for other causes of hypotension give patient has hx
   of pericarditis and could potentially have some restrictive pathology
   3) Hx of Hodgkin
s Lymphoma/pericardial disease: Particularly given
   current concern for effusion there is a possibility of post radiation
   serositis in the chest or possibility of effusion.
   -TTE per above
   4) Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   5)  FEN:  NPO for now, given potential for prolonged intubation will
   initiate nutrtition consult to start tube feeds
   6)  Access: 2 PIVs; right IJ (pulled back yesterday and more
   appropriately sited on follow up scans)
   7)  PPx: hep sc, ppi as outpt
   8 Code: FULL (confirmed with patient)
   8)  Dispo: ICU until respiratory status improves

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, post bone marrow transplant in 1993, hypothyroidism, and pericarditis. He was admitted with influenza B and is now experiencing worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress. The CT scan shows evidence of multilobar pneumonia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress suggest the possibility of respiratory failure. Given his known influenza infection and PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200, he meets the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is also evidence of a bacterial superinfection with Staphylococcus aureus in the respiratory culture.

2. SIRS/hypotension/fevers: The patient's persistent fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension indicate a potential ongoing infectious process. Blood cultures remain negative, and there are no signs of cholecystitis on RUQ ultrasound. The concern now is for a drainable collection, especially considering the patient's broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.

3. Hx of Hodgkin's lymphoma/pericardial disease: Given the current concern for effusion, there is a possibility of post-radiation serositis in the chest or potential effusion related to his past medical history of Hodgkin's lymphoma and pericarditis.

4. Hypothyroid"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 year-old male with a history of hodkin's s/p BMT in 93,
   h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, admitted with influenza B now with
   worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress and CT concerning for
   multilobar PNA.
   1) Respiratory failure: Patient with hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has
   known influenza B as well as staph aureus in sputums.  Presumably, flu
   with bacterial superinfection is the etiology of his ARDS.  The patient
   was on AC overnight but was switched back to CPAP this AM.  Since then,
   he has been pulling lower tidal volumes than previously (<400) and more
   tachypneic.  We will place him back on AC to decrease work of breathing
   while we continue to treat his pneumonia and support him through his
   ARDS.  He is on day 6 of antimicrobial therapy with linezolid, cefepime
   and oseltamavir.
   -F/U cultures, obtain viral cultures per ID recommendation
   - Continue current antimicrobials pending culture data
   -IP will attempt to perform diagnostic thoracentesis today as ICU team
   unable to safely do at bedside
   2) Leukocytosis/Fevers: Imaging yesterday failed to reveal a closed
   space infection or a drainable abcess.  The presumed etiology of his
   fevers is pneumonia and possibly sinusitis though this should be
   appropriately covered by his antibiotics.
   -Continue linezolid/cefepime/oseltamavir pending culture data
   -obtain pleural fluid to rule out complicated effusion
   3) Hx of Hodgkin
s Lymphoma/pericardial disease: Particularly given
   current concern for effusion there is a possibility of post radiation
   serositis in the chest or possibility of effusion.
   -TTE  today to evaluate for effusion/tamponade
   4) Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   5)  FEN:  Pt with noted aspiration event this AM, presumably due to
   history of irradiation, we will hold tube feeds for now and swallow
   study once extubated.
   6)  Access: 2 PIVs; right IJ
   7)  PPx: hep sc, PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, post bone marrow transplant in 1993, hypothyroidism, admitted with influenza B, and now presenting with worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress.
- The patient has known influenza B and Staphylococcus aureus in sputum cultures, indicating a possible viral infection with bacterial superinfection leading to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient's respiratory condition has been worsening, with decreased tidal volumes and increased tachypnea. He is now on assisted ventilation to decrease work of breathing and support his ARDS.
- The patient's fevers and leukocytosis are presumed to be due to pneumonia and possibly sinusitis, which should be covered by his current antibiotic therapy.
- A diagnostic thoracentesis will be attempted today to evaluate the pleural effusion.
- The patient's history of Hodgkin's lymphoma and pericardial disease raises concerns for post-radiation serositis or effusion. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed today to evaluate for effusion/tamponade.
- The patient's hypothyroidism will be managed with continued home levothyroxine.
- Due to the patient's risk of aspiration, tube feeds will be held for now,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 year-old male with a history of hodkin's s/p BMT in 93,
   h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, admitted with influenza B now with
   worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress and CT concerning for
   multilobar PNA.
   1) Respiratory failure: Patient with hypoxic respiratory presumed due
   to infectious process/ ARDS.  Patient with known influenza and with
   PaO2/FiO2<200 he does meet criteria for ARDS.  Initial insult was most
   likely flu but given staph aureus in respiratory culture there is
   evidence for bacterial superinfection.  He is continuing to maintain
   good ventilation and adequate oxygenation on pressure support.
   Potentially concerning to allow ARDS patient off protocol due to
   ability to exceed low lung volumes but he seems more comfortable on PS
   and tidal volumes are relatively low (450-475) decreasing concern for
   barotrauma.
   - On day 5 of linezolid (or vanc), cefepime and oseltamavir.
   -F/U cultures
   - Continue oseltamavir for influenza B
   2) SIRS/ Hypotension/Fevers: This patient
s fever is not as concerning
   in and of itself given influenza can often cause persistent fever.
   Still, with persistent white count and his leukocytosis recurring it is
   very concerning that we are not adequately covering an infectious
   process.  Blood cultures remain negative and RUQ U/S not suggestive of
   choleycystitis.  Major concern now if for a drainable collection as his
   broad spectrum antibiotics should cover most common organisms.
   -Continue current antimicrobial regimen
   -CT scan of torso and sinuses looking for possible closed space
   infection and to better evaluate possible effusions vs atelectasis n
   lungs
   -Echo to evaluate for other causes of hypotension give patient has hx
   of pericarditis and could potentially have some restrictive pathology
   3) Hx of Hodgkin
s Lymphoma/pericardial disease: Particularly given
   current concern for effusion there is a possibility of post radiation
   serositis in the chest or possibility of effusion.
   -TTE per above
   4) Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   5)  FEN:  NPO for now, given potential for prolonged intubation will
   initiate nutrtition consult to start tube feeds

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and sepsis. The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of influenza and Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, which has complicated into ARDS. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers for seven days, and despite an extensive search, alternative sources of infection have not been found. The patient's bilateral effusions have slightly diminished. The patient also has minimal sinusitis.

The patient's current medical conditions include pneumonia (bacterial, community-acquired), respiratory failure (acute), and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient is being treated with antibiotics (Cefepime/Linezolid) and is receiving mechanical ventilation support in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and the use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications can increase the risk of stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures can increase the risk of acquiring new infections, such"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 year-old male with a history of hodkin's s/p BMT in 93,
   h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, admitted with influenza B now with
   worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress and CT concerning for
   multilobar PNA.
   1) Respiratory failure: Patient with hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has
   known influenza B as well as staph aureus in sputums.  Presumably, flu
   with bacterial superinfection is the etiology of his ARDS.  The patient
   was on AC overnight but was switched back to CPAP this AM.  Since then,
   he has been pulling lower tidal volumes than previously (<400) and more
   tachypneic.  We will place him back on AC to decrease work of breathing
   while we continue to treat his pneumonia and support him through his
   ARDS.  He is on day 6 of antimicrobial therapy with linezolid, cefepime
   and oseltamavir.
   -F/U cultures, obtain viral cultures per ID recommendation
   - Continue current antimicrobials pending culture data
   -IP will attempt to perform diagnostic thoracentesis today as ICU team
   unable to safely do at bedside
   2) Leukocytosis/Fevers: Imaging yesterday failed to reveal a closed
   space infection or a drainable abcess.  The presumed etiology of his
   fevers is pneumonia and possibly sinusitis though this should be
   appropriately covered by his antibiotics.
   -Continue linezolid/cefepime/oseltamavir pending culture data
   -obtain pleural fluid to rule out complicated effusion
   3) Hx of Hodgkin
s Lymphoma/pericardial disease: Particularly given
   current concern for effusion there is a possibility of post radiation
   serositis in the chest or possibility of effusion.
   -TTE  today to evaluate for effusion/tamponade
   4) Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   5)  FEN:  Pt with noted aspiration event this AM, presumably due to
   history of irradiation, we will hold tube feeds for now and swallow
   study once extubated.
   6)  Access: 2 PIVs; right IJ
   7)  PPx: hep sc, PPI
   8 Code: FULL (confirmed with patient)
   8)  Dispo: ICU until respiratory status improves

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, post bone marrow transplant in 1993, hypothyroidism, admitted with influenza B, worsening hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He has multilobar pneumonia and is experiencing respiratory failure. The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, linezolid, cefepime, oseltamivir, and heparin sodium prophylaxis. He is intubated and on assisted mechanical ventilation (CMV/ASSIST) with FiO2 of 50%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which is potentially life-threatening. Immediate intervention is necessary to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multilobar pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory distress and deterioration of lung function.
3. Bacterial Superinfection: The presence of Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum suggests a bacterial superinfection, which may require adjustment of antibiotics.
4. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis indicate a possible systemic infection, potentially leading to sepsis.
5. Pericarditis: The patient's history of pericarditis should be considered, especially if there is suspicion of pleural effusion or tamponade.
6. Aspiration: The patient had an aspiration"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 year-old male with a history of hodkin's s/p BMT in 93,
   h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, now with influenza B pneumonia, S.
   aureus superinfections, and ARDS.
    1) Respiratory failure/Influenza Pneumonia with secondary bacterial
   pneumonia: The patient was initially intubated for hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Has known influenza B as well as staph aureus in sputums
   presumably causing ARDS.  Ventilation and oxygenation stable on AC
   settings.   He is on day 7 of antimicrobial therapy with cefepime, he
   received six days of vancomycin/linezolid, he is on day six of
   oseltamavir.  His linezolid was stopped and nafcillin started after his
   staph was cultured as MSSA.  Thoracentesis showed exudative effusion
   and lung reexpansion after the procedure would suggest this is freely
   flowing.
   -F/U cultures
   - Continue oseltamavir through tomorrow as well as cefepime, discuss
   duration of nafcillin therapy in this very sick patient with ID who is
   following
   2) Leukocytosis/Fevers/Hypotension: Imaging failed to reveal a closed
   space infection or a drainable abcess.  The presumed etiology of his
   fevers is pneumonia and possibly sinusitis though this should be
   appropriately covered by his antibiotics.   Hypotension presumably due
   to continued SIRs driving process (active infection vs ARDS).
   -Afrin and saline nasal washes for sinus disease
   -Continue nafcillin/cefepime/oseltamavir pending culture data
   -F/U cultures and culture if spikes
   -F/U ID reccs
   3) Hx of Hodgkin
s Lymphoma/pericardial disease:  Echo failed to reveal
   a pericardial effusion.
   4) Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   5)  FEN:  Pt with noted aspiration event yesterday, presumably due to
   history of irradiation, nevertheless he needs nutrition.  We will speak
   to GI re: post-pyloric feeding tube and start PPN in the interim.
   6)  Access: 2 PIVs; right IJ
   7)  PPx: hep sc, PPI
   8 Code: FULL (confirmed with patient)
   8)  Dispo: ICU until respiratory status improves

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma post bone marrow transplant in 1993, hypothyroidism, pericarditis, influenza B pneumonia, and Staphylococcus aureus superinfections. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure/influenza pneumonia with secondary bacterial pneumonia, leukocytosis/fevers/hypotension, and hypothyroidism. The patient has been diagnosed with influenza B pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus superinfections, which are causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is on day 7 of antimicrobial therapy with cefepime, and previously received six days of vancomycin/linezolid. Nafcillin was started after the Staphylococcus aureus was cultured as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). 

The patient's leukocytosis/fevers/hypotension may be due to continued sepsis-induced respiratory failure (SIRs) driving the process, likely secondary to the active infection and ARDS. The patient's hypothyroidism is being managed with home levothyroxine.

Other assessments and plans include the need for nutrition support, as the patient had an aspiration event yesterday,"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo male with admission for febrile illness now seen with Influenza B
   and subsequent MSSA pneumonia.  In this setting patient has had
   continued high fever and recurrent hypotension with only pulmonary
   source of pneumonia identified despite look with CT scan, tap of
   effusion. He has likely continued and persistent left sided effusion.
   The source of fevers may well be continued SIRS in the setting of
   pneumonia as we have failed to find alternative source of infection.
   In the setting of influenza and S. Auresus PNA with associated ARDS
   does carry significant mortality.  Favorable here is patient has
   preserved organ function outside of original pulmonary insult.
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP) with Influenza B-
   -Continue with naf/Cefepime
   -Appreciate ID input and will continue for 7 days Cefepime and 14 day
   course of NAF and continue Influenza Rx
   -Follow up pleaural fluid culture

Barriers to extubation do
   include persistent hypoxemia and high Ve requirement.
   -Continue with A/C Support
   -Wean FIO2 to 0.4
   -If successful will continue to wean PEEP to 5
   -Rx for PNA and lung protective ventilation to continue with A/C
   -Will follow left sided effusion and move to tap only if unable to wean

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with an admission for febrile illness. The patient has been diagnosed with Influenza B and subsequent MSSA pneumonia. He continues to have high fever and recurrent hypotension with only pulmonary sources of pneumonia identified. The patient also has a likely persistent left-sided pleural effusion. 

The source of fevers may be continued SIRS in the setting of pneumonia, as no alternative source of infection has been found. Influenza and MSSA pneumonia with associated ARDS carry significant mortality, but the patient has preserved organ function outside of the original pulmonary insult.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia caused by MSSA. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased fever, and potential sepsis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical intervention. It includes persistent hypoxemia and high ventilation requirements.

3. Sepsis: The patient's recurrent hypotension and rising WBC count indicate a possible progression to sepsis. Sepsis is a severe infection that can lead to organ dysfunction and even death if not treated promptly and effectively.

4. Pleural effusion: The patient has a likely persistent left-sided pleural effusion. If the effusion becomes infected or continues to grow, it"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 year-old male with a history of hodkin's s/p BMT in 93,
   h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, now with influenza B pneumonia, S.
   aureus superinfections, and ARDS.
   1) Respiratory failure/Influenza Pneumonia with secondary bacterial
   pneumonia: The patient was initially intubated for hypoxic respiratory
   failure.  Has known influenza B as well as staph aureus in sputums
   presumably causing ARDS.  Ventilation and oxygenation stable on AC
   settings.   He is on day 7 of antimicrobial therapy with cefepime, he
   received six days of vancomycin/linezolid, he is on day six of
   oseltamavir.  His linezolid was stopped and nafcillin started after his
   staph was cultured as MSSA.  Thoracentesis showed exudative effusion
   and lung reexpansion after the procedure would suggest this is freely
   flowing.
   -F/U cultures
   - Continue oseltamavir through tomorrow as well as cefepime, discuss
   duration of nafcillin therapy in this very sick patient with ID who is
   following
   2) Leukocytosis/Fevers/Hypotension: Imaging failed to reveal a closed
   space infection or a drainable abcess.  The presumed etiology of his
   fevers is pneumonia and possibly sinusitis though this should be
   appropriately covered by his antibiotics.   Hypotension presumably due
   to continued SIRs driving process (active infection vs ARDS).
   -Afrin and saline nasal washes for sinus disease
   -Continue nafcillin/cefepime/oseltamavir pending culture data
   -F/U cultures and culture if spikes
   -F/U ID reccs
   3) Hx of Hodgkin
s Lymphoma/pericardial disease:  Echo failed to reveal
   a pericardial effusion.
   4) Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   5)  FEN:  Pt with noted aspiration event yesterday, presumably due to
   history of irradiation, nevertheless he needs nutrition.  We will speak
   to GI re: post-pyloric feeding tube and start PPN in the interim.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, who underwent bone marrow transplantation in 1993. He has a history of pericarditis and hypothyroidism. Currently, he is admitted to the ICU with influenza B pneumonia, S. aureus superinfections, and ARDS. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has been receiving various antimicrobial therapies including cefepime, vancomycin, linezolid, and oseltamivir. His linezolid was stopped and nafcillin was started after his staph was cultured as MSSA. Thoracentesis showed an exudative effusion, suggesting freely flowing fluid that can be drained.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure/Influenza Pneumonia with secondary bacterial pneumonia: The patient initially required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure. He has known influenza B as well as S. aureus in sputums, presumably causing ARDS. Ventilation and oxygenation are stable on AC settings.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old male admitted with influenza B and MSSA superinfection, along with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS. The patient has had extensive evaluation for alternative sources of infection and WBC count elevation, but no significant findings have been revealed to date.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention. The patient will continue with A/C support and lung protective strategy for ventilation, aiming to wean FiO2 as possible today and maintain PEEP while only moving to wean if able to maintain stable PO2 at decreased PEEP.

2. Pneumonia, Bacterial, Community Acquired (CAP): The patient is being treated with nafcillin and cefepime for suspected bacterial pneumonia. It is important to monitor the patient's response to the antibiotics and consider ID input if there is no improvement.

3. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient is also diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to assess the patient's response to treatment and prevent progression to septic shock.

4. C. Difficile Infection: The patient's continued rise in WBC count raises concern for C. difficile infection. It is important to consider ID input and evaluate for alternative sources of infection.

   This is a 53 year-old male with a history of hodkin's s/p BMT in 93,
   h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, now with influenza B pneumonia, S.
   aureus superinfections, and ARDS.
   #) Hypoxic Respiratory failure/Influenza Pneumonia with secondary
   bacterial pneumonia: The patient was initially intubated for hypoxic
   respiratory failure.  Has known influenza B as well as staph aureus in
   sputums presumably causing ARDS.  Ventilation and oxygenation stable on
   AC settings.   He is on day 7 of antimicrobial therapy with cefepime,
   he received six days of vancomycin/linezolid, he is on day six of
   oseltamavir.  His linezolid was stopped and nafcillin started after his
   staph was cultured as MSSA.  Thoracentesis showed exudative effusion
   and lung reexpansion after the procedure would suggest this is freely
   flowing.
   -F/U cultures
   - Continue oseltamavir through tomorrow as well as cefepime, discuss
   duration of nafcillin therapy in this very sick patient with ID who is
   following
   #) Sepsis:  Patient met SIRS criteria with fever and leukocytosis and
   also had known source of infection.  No longer requiring pressors.
   2) Leukocytosis/Fevers/Hypotension: Imaging failed to reveal a closed
   space infection or a drainable abcess.  The presumed etiology of his
   fevers is pneumonia and possibly sinusitis though this should be
   appropriately covered by his antibiotics.   Hypotension presumably due
   to continued SIRs driving process (active infection vs ARDS).
   -Afrin and saline nasal washes for sinus disease
   -Continue nafcillin/cefepime/oseltamavir pending culture data
   -F/U cultures and culture if spikes
   -F/U ID reccs
   3) Hx of Hodgkin
s Lymphoma/pericardial disease:  Echo failed to reveal
   a pericardial effusion.
   4) Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   5)  FEN:  Pt with noted aspiration event yesterday, presumably due to
   history of irradiation, nevertheless he needs nutrition.  We will speak
   to GI re: post-pyloric feeding tube and start PPN in the interim.
   6)  Access: 2 PIVs; right IJ

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, post bone marrow transplant in 1993, hypothyroidism, and previous pericarditis. He is currently experiencing influenza B pneumonia, S. aureus superinfection, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and is on day 7 of antimicrobial therapy with cefepime. He has also received six days of vancomycin/linezolid and is on day six of oseltamivir. The patient's linezolid was stopped and nafcillin started after his S. aureus was cultured as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Thoracentesis showed exudative effusion, and lung reexpansion suggests that the effusion is freely flowing. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he is being monitored for sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/Influenza Pneumonia with secondary bacterial pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2) Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis with fever, leukocytosis, and a known source of infection. There is a risk of continued hypotension and organ dysfunction.
3) Leukocytosis/Fevers/Hypotension:"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 year-old male with a history of hodkin's s/p BMT in 93,
   h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, now with influenza B pneumonia and S.
   aureus superinfections.
   #) Hypoxic Respiratory failure:   He was initially intubated for
   hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has known influenza B as well as
   secondary bacterial pneumonia from staph aureus in sputum.  Ventilation
   and oxygenation stable on AC settings.   He is on day 8 of
   antimicrobial therapy with cefepime, he received six days of
   vancomycin/linezolid, he is on day seven of oseltamavir.  His linezolid
   was stopped and nafcillin started (now day 4) after his staph was
   cultured as MSSA.  Thoracentesis showed exudative effusion and lung
   re-expansion after the procedure, suggesting that it is freely
   flowing.    FiO2 40% from 50%.
   - Hypoxia appears more consistent with pneumonia/lobar consolidation
   instead of ARDS so will attempt PS today
   - Has completed course of oseltamavir
   - continue nafcillin but can d/c cefepime considering no clear source
   of GNR infection
   - F/U cultures
   - diuresis with lasix drip today to decrease total body fluid and
   maximize chance of successful extubation
   #) Sepsis:  Patient met SIRS criteria with fever and leukocytosis and
   also had known source of infection.  No longer requiring pressors.
   #) Leukocytosis: Imaging failed to reveal a closed space infection or a
   drainable abscess.  The presumed etiology of his fevers is pneumonia
   and possibly sinusitis vs cholecystitis, but no clear source on CT
   torso and sinus.  Repeated CT chest on [**2-5**] but no evidence of abscess
   on exam.
   - Afrin and saline nasal washes for sinus disease
   - Continue nafcillin
   - consider pulling central line, particularly if any blood cx are
   positive
   - F/U cultures and culture if spikes
   - F/U ID reccs
   #) Hx of Hodgkin
s Lymphoma/pericardial disease:  Echo failed to reveal
   a pericardial effusion.
   #) Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   #)  FEN:  Pt with noted aspiration event on [**2181-1-27**], presumably due to
   history of irradiation and esophageal stricture.  Attempted to place
   Duboff in post-pyloric position but appears to remain in the stomach
   despite raglan and mechanical manipulation.  Will consult radiology
   regarding advancing tube.
   #)  Access: 2 PIVs; right IJ

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, post bone marrow transplant in 1993, and previous pericarditis. He is currently admitted to the ICU with influenza B pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus superinfections, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. He has been receiving antimicrobial therapy, including cefepime, vancomycin, linezolid, and oseltamivir. Thoracentesis showed exudative effusion and lung re-expansion, suggesting that the effusion is freely flowing. The patient's FiO2 has been decreased from 50% to 40%. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza B pneumonia and secondary bacterial pneumonia from Staph aureus. His ventilation and oxygenation are stable on AC settings.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria with fever and leukocytosis, and also has a known source of infection. He is no longer requiring pressors.
3. Leukocytosis: Imaging did not reveal a closed space infection or a drainable abscess. The presumed etiology of his fevers is pneumonia and possibly sinusitis vs cholecystitis, but no clear source on CT torso and sinus.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, post bone marrow transplant in 1993, hypothyroidism, and pericarditis. He was initially intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza B pneumonia and secondary bacterial pneumonia from Staphylococcus aureus in his sputum. The patient received treatment with tamiflu, cefepime, and nafcillin. A thoracentesis showed exudative effusion and lung re-expansion, suggesting that the effusion is freely flowing. The patient's FiO2 is 40% and PS is 5/5, but his blood gas this noon shows a pH of 7.52, indicating respiratory alkalosis. Hypoxia appears more consistent with pneumonia/lobar consolidation instead of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has completed the course of oseltamivir and will continue nafcillin for another day. Follow-up cultures have been ordered.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza B pneumonia and secondary bacterial pneumonia from Staphylococcus aureus. Despite being on PS 5/5 and FiO2 40%, the patient's blood gas shows respiratory alkalosis.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   This is a 53 year-old male with a history of hodkin's s/p BMT in 93,
   h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, now with influenza B pneumonia and S.
   aureus superinfections.
   #) Hypoxic Respiratory failure:   He was initially intubated for
   hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has known influenza B as well as
   secondary bacterial pneumonia from staph aureus in sputum.  Ventilation
   and oxygenation stable on AC settings.   He is on day 8 of
   antimicrobial therapy with cefepime, he received six days of
   vancomycin/linezolid, he is on day seven of oseltamavir.  His linezolid
   was stopped and nafcillin started (now day 4) after his staph was
   cultured as MSSA.  Thoracentesis showed exudative effusion and lung
   re-expansion after the procedure, suggesting that it is freely
   flowing.    FiO2 40% from 50%.
   - Hypoxia appears more consistent with pneumonia/lobar consolidation
   instead of ARDS so will attempt PS today
   - Has completed course of oseltamavir
   - continue nafcillin but can d/c cefepime considering no clear source
   of GNR infection
   - F/U cultures
   - diuresis with lasix drip today to decrease total body fluid and
   maximize chance of successful extubation
   #) Sepsis:  Patient met SIRS criteria with fever and leukocytosis and
   also had known source of infection.  No longer requiring pressors.
   #) Leukocytosis: Imaging failed to reveal a closed space infection or a
   drainable abscess.  The presumed etiology of his fevers is pneumonia
   and possibly sinusitis vs cholecystitis, but no clear source on CT
   torso and sinus.  Repeated CT chest on [**2-5**] but no evidence of abscess
   on exam.
   - Afrin and saline nasal washes for sinus disease
   - Continue nafcillin
   - consider pulling central line, particularly if any blood cx are
   positive
   - F/U cultures and culture if spikes
   - F/U ID reccs
   #) Hx of Hodgkin
s Lymphoma/pericardial disease:  Echo failed to reveal
   a pericardial effusion.
   #) Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   #)  FEN:  Pt with noted aspiration event on [**2181-1-27**], presumably due to
   history of irradiation and esophageal stricture.  Attempted to place
   Duboff in post-pyloric position but appears to remain in the stomach
   despite raglan and mechanical manipulation.  Will consult radiology
   regarding advancing tube.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma post bone marrow transplant in 1993, hypothyroidism, and pericarditis. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza B pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus superinfection. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's linezolid was stopped, and nafcillin was started after the staph was cultured as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Thoracentesis showed an exudative effusion and lung re-expansion, suggesting freely flowing fluid. The patient is being weaned off FiO2 from 50% to 40%. The patient also meets SIRS criteria with fever and leukocytosis and has a known source of infection. He is no longer requiring pressors. Leukocytosis could be due to pneumonia and possibly sinusitis or cholecystitis, but no clear source on CT torso and sinus. The patient has a history of irradiation and esophageal stricture, which may have led to an aspiration event. There is an attempt to place a feeding tube in the post-pyloric position. The patient's blood sugars are well-controlled, and he is receiving TPN without lipids. He has multiple lines including an arterial line and a multi-lumen central line. Prophylactic measures include D"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's disease, post bone marrow transplant in 1993, hypothyroidism, and previous pericarditis. He presented with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and Staphylococcus aureus superinfection. He required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure and was given antiviral treatment for influenza B. The patient also has completed a course of oseltamivir, and his current plan includes continuing nafcillin for 14 days, following up with cultures, and considering bolus lasix for diuresis. The patient's sepsis has improved, and he no longer requires pressors. However, he still has leukocytosis, and imaging failed to reveal a closed space infection or a drainable abscess. The patient's medical history includes Hodgkin's lymphoma, pericardial disease, hypothyroidism, and a previous aspiration event. He currently has an endotracheal tube in place, and his respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and Staphylococcus aureus superinfection. There is a potential for worsening respiratory symptoms and further infection.

   This is a 53 year-old male with a history of hodkin's s/p BMT in 93,
   h/o pericarditis, hypothyroidism, now with influenza B pneumonia and S.
   aureus superinfections.
   #) Hypoxic Respiratory failure:   He was initially intubated for
   hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has known influenza B as well as
   secondary bacterial pneumonia from staph aureus in sputum.  s/p 7 D
   tamiflu tx. Cefepime (d/c [**2-5**])/linezolid used originally. Linezolid
   changed to  Nafcillin when MSSA grew [**2-2**] .   Thoracentesis [**2-1**] showed
   exudative effusion and lung re-expansion after the procedure,
   suggesting that it is freely flowing.    FiO2 40% today and on PS 5/5
   but blood gas this noon 7.52/41/64
   - Hypoxia appears more consistent with pneumonia/lobar consolidation
   instead of ARDS. Trying to wean PS daily but did not tolerate today.
   Will try again tomorrow.
   - Has completed course of oseltamavir
   - continue nafcillin day 5 today
   - F/U cultures
   - lasix gtt stopped today [**1-29**] contraction alkylosis. Consider lasix
   boluses for CVP >4.  Started Diamox 500 TID [**2-6**]
   -added cefepime to allergy list given likely elevation LFT
s with this.
   #) Sepsis:  Patient met SIRS criteria with fever and leukocytosis and
   also had known source of infection.  No longer requiring pressors.
   #) Leukocytosis: Imaging  failed to reveal a closed space infection or
   a drainable abscess.  The presumed etiology of his fevers is pneumonia
   and possibly sinusitis vs cholecystitis, but no clear source on CT
   torso and sinus.  Repeated CT chest on [**2-4**] but no evidence of abscess
   on exam.
   - Afrin 3 D course finished [**2-6**]. Cont saline nasal washes for sinus
   disease
   - Continue nafcillin
   - consider pulling central line if any blood cx are positive. Keep now
   for TPN
   - F/U cultures and culture if spikes
   - F/U ID reccs
   #) Hx of Hodgkin
s Lymphoma/pericardial disease:  Echo [**2-2**] failed to
   reveal a pericardial effusion.
    #) Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   #)  FEN:  Pt with noted aspiration event on [**2181-1-27**], presumably due to
   history of irradiation and esophageal stricture.  Has Doppoff in place
   now. Will give TF until early am [**2-7**] for possible am extubation

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-inch individual with a chief complaint of pneumonia, secondary to respiratory failure. The patient was previously intubated and extubated successfully but experienced nausea intermittently. They were given boluses of ativan and fentanyl for potential opiate or benzodiazepine withdrawal. The patient's allergies include cefepime, and they have received antibiotics such as cefipime and nafcillin. The patient is currently on various infusions including midazolam, heparin sodium, lorazepam, and fentanyl. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), with a current temperature of 35.9 C (96.7 F). The heart rate is 94 bpm with a range of 91-114 bpm. Blood pressure is 116/58 mmHg, with a range of 72-144/55-87 mmHg. Respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute with a range of 14-40 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,308 mL and output of 5,035 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a volume control mode, set at a tidal volume of 730 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are not provided. 

Physical examination findings include general appearance of no acute distress, thin build, and clear breath sounds with better airflow on the left side. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Extremities show trace edema without cyanosis. Neurologic examination reveals attentive behavior, purposeful movement, and normal muscle tone. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit (Hct). Blood glucose levels are within the normal range. Other lab values such as creatinine, total carbon dioxide (TCO2), electrolytes, liver enzymes, and kidney function tests are also provided. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and sepsis without organ dysfunction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures can increase the risk of nosocomial infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheter use increase the risk of developing DVT.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition may lead to stress ulcers, which can cause gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Organ dysfunction: Although the patient is currently classified as sepsis without organ dysfunction, there is a possibility of deterioration and development of organ dysfunction if the infection spreads or if other complications arise."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's disease, post bone marrow transplant in 1993, hypothyroidism, and previous pericarditis. The patient was admitted with influenza B pneumonia and secondary bacterial pneumonia from Staphylococcus aureus. He required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure and was initially treated with cefepime and linezolid. Linezolid was later changed to nafcillin when methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) grew. The patient underwent a thoracentesis, which showed an exudative effusion and lung re-expansion after the procedure. He was successfully extubated and completed a course of oseltamivir. The patient continues to receive nafcillin for a 21-day course and will start another antibiotic course when linezolid was started on January 29th. He is monitored for diuresis and considered for a lasix bolus as needed. A speech and swallow evaluation is planned today. The patient may have benzodiazepine or narcotic withdrawal, as indicated by nausea, and will be considered for fentanyl or ativan as needed. Incentive spirometry, physical therapy, and out-of-bed chair activities are recommended. The patient met SIRS criteria with fever and leukocytosis and also had a known source of infection. No longer requiring pressors, imaging failed"

   tamiflu tx. Cefepime (d/c [**2-5**])/linezolid used originally. Linezolid
   changed to  Nafcillin when MSSA grew [**2-2**] .   Thoracentesis [**2-1**] showed
   exudative effusion and lung re-expansion after the procedure,
   suggesting that it is freely flowing.    FiO2 40%[**2-6**] and on PS 5/5 but
   blood gas this noon 7.52/41/64.  This am, did well on SBT (although had
   some mucous plugging around 7a).
   - Has completed course of oseltamavir
   - continue nafcillin day 6 today- plan for 14 D course
   - F/U cultures
   - extubate this am. Will start Incentive spirometry
   -monitor diuresis and consider bolus lasix PRN. D/c diamox
   -will need speech and swallow eval but will hold off until tomorrow
   -of note, since pt has been on fent/versed for sedation for >1wk, may
   have benzo withdrawl. Will consided valium or versed PRN
   #) Sepsis:  Patient met SIRS criteria with fever and leukocytosis and
   also had known source of infection.  No longer requiring pressors.
   #) Leukocytosis: Imaging  failed to reveal a closed space infection or
   a drainable abscess.  The presumed etiology of his fevers is pneumonia
   and possibly sinusitis vs cholecystitis, but no clear source on CT
   torso and sinus.  Repeated CT chest on [**2-4**] but no evidence of abscess
   on exam.
   - Afrin 3 D course finished [**2-6**]. Cont saline nasal washes for sinus
   disease
   - Continue nafcillin for 14 D course
   - consider pulling central line if any blood cx are positive. Keep now
   for TPN. If stable tomorrow, will likely pull CVL.
   - F/U cultures and culture if spikes
   - F/U ID recs- they rec thoracentesis but do not think this is
   medically necessary for now.

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's disease post bone marrow transplant in 1993, hypothyroidism, and previous pericarditis. He was admitted with influenza B pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus superinfection. The patient initially required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure. He has completed a course of oseltamivir and is currently on nafcillin for a 14-day course.

The patient's condition has improved, as evidenced by his ability to breathe spontaneously and the removal of invasive ventilation and arterial lines. However, he continues to experience intermittent nausea, which may be related to opiate or benzodiazepine withdrawal, and is receiving boluses of lorazepam (Ativan) and fentanyl as needed.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/58 mmHg to 144/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 16 mmHg. Fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 3,727 mL since midnight.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma post bone marrow transplant in 1993, hypothyroidism, and previous pericarditis. He was admitted with community-acquired pneumonia and subsequent respiratory failure due to influenza B and Staphylococcus aureus superinfection. The patient was initially intubated but successfully extubated on day 7. He completed a course of oseltamivir and is currently on nafcillin for a 21-day course. Other medications include lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and lorazepam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia with influenza B and Staphylococcus aureus superinfection. Close monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and respiratory status is essential.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure. Continued monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.
3. Sepsis: The patient met SIRS criteria with fever and leukocytosis, indicating a potential infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and infection control measures is important.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has elevated white blood cell counts, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Frequent monitoring of complete blood counts and evaluation for source control are necessary.

    #) Sepsis:  Patient met SIRS criteria with fever and leukocytosis and
   also had known source of infection.  No longer requiring pressors.
   #) Leukocytosis: Imaging  failed to reveal a closed space infection or
   a drainable abscess.  The presumed etiology of his fevers is pneumonia
   and possibly sinusitis vs cholecystitis, but no clear source on CT
   torso and sinus.  Repeated CT chest on [**2-4**] but no evidence of abscess
   on exam. WBC now trending down to 22

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, post bone marrow transplant in 1993, hypothyroidism, and pericarditis. He was admitted with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and subsequent respiratory failure. The patient had influenza B pneumonia and a secondary bacterial superinfection caused by Staphylococcus aureus. He received treatment with cefepime and linezolid initially, but linezolid was changed to nafcillin when methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) was identified in the sputum.

The patient underwent a thoracentesis, which showed an exudative effusion and lung re-expansion, indicating that the effusion was freely flowing. He was successfully extubated and completed a course of oseltamivir for influenza. The patient continues to receive nafcillin for a total of 21 days. He is also being monitored for diuresis and potential bolus lasix administration as needed. A speech and swallow evaluation was performed, clearing the patient to take thin liquids and soft solids orally.

The patient may have benzodiazepine or narcotic withdrawal, as he is experiencing nausea, which could be a symptom of this. Fentanyl or ativan may be considered for pain or anxiety management on a PRN basis. Incentive spirometry and physical therapy consultation have been ordered."
