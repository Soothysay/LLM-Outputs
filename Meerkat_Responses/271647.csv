   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension and
   recently diagnosed stage IIIb to IV non-small cell lung cancer who
   presents with three days of progressive dyspnea found to have large
   right sided pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion and right sided
   collapse.
   Dyspnea:  Likely multifactorial secondary to large right sided
   pulmonary embolism, large right sided pleural effusion, right lung
   collapse.  All findings not present on previous CT scan from late
   [**Month (only) **] when she was diagnosed.  No signs and symptoms of infection
   presently.  Lymphangitic spread of tumor may also be contributing to
   her symptoms. Given the acuity of her presentation suspect a large
   component is related to acute infarction. No indications for lysis at
   this time given that she is hemodynamically stable and BNP and
   troponins are within normal limits.
   - heparin started because Lovenox contraindication, was stopped d/t PT
   of 130.  Will restart pending recs from IP
   - thoracentesis for today
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   Non-small cell lung cancer:  Patient was scheduled to initiate
   chemotherapy shortly.  Now presents with dyspnea, large effusion and
   pulmonary embolism.
   - oncology recs:
   ----Lovenox 1mg/kg q12
   ----Thoracentesis with cell samples sent for analysis
   ----transfer to OMED when more stable
   Anxiety:
   -Receiving Xanax PRN anxiety
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensive agents
   Diabetes:
   - insulin sliding scale
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue simvastatin

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of type II diabetes, hypertension, and recently diagnosed stage IIIb to IV non-small cell lung cancer. She presents with three days of progressive dyspnea and was found to have a large right-sided pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, and right-sided collapse. The dyspnea is likely multifactorial due to the large right-sided pulmonary embolism, large right-sided pleural effusion, and right lung collapse. There are no signs or symptoms of infection, and lymphangitic spread of the tumor may also be contributing to her symptoms. Given the acuity of her presentation, a large component is related to acute infarction. No indications for lysis at this time, as she is hemodynamically stable and BNP and troponins are within normal limits.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be managed, including non-small cell lung cancer, anxiety, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fluid and electrolyte balance. The patient is receiving heparin, thoracentesis with cell samples sent for analysis, transfer to OMED when more stable, Xanax PRN for anxiety, holding all antihypertensive agents, insulin sliding scale for diabetes, simvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and a cardiac, diabetic diet with no IV fluids, replete electrolytes, and peripheral access.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, along with the presence of a large right-sided pulmonary embolism, indicate a potential complication related to the clot in the pulmonary artery.
2. Pleural effusion: The large right-sided pleural effusion can further compromise respiratory function and lead to additional respiratory distress.
3. Right lung collapse: The collapse of the right lung may contribute to impaired gas exchange and decreased oxygenation.
4. Lymphangitic spread of tumor: The involvement of lymphatic vessels by cancer cells may result in lymphatic obstruction and contribute to the patient's symptoms.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count (280,000) indicates a possible risk for bleeding complications.
6. Hyperglycemia: The high glucose levels (183 mg/dL) suggest poorly controlled diabetes, which can lead to various complications if not managed appropriately.
7. Hypotension: The blood pressure readings below the normal range indicate a potential risk for low blood pressure, which can cause dizziness and fainting.
8. Anemia: The low hemoglobin level (36.4 g/dL) suggests a potential risk for decreased oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood.
9. Electrolyte imbalances: Abnormalities in potassium (4"

   diabetes, hypertension and recently diagnosed stage IIIb to IV
   non-small cell lung cancer who presents with three days of progressive
   dyspnea found to have large right sided pulmonary embolism, pleural
   effusion and right sided collapse.
   Dyspnea:  Likely multifactorial secondary to large right sided
   pulmonary embolism, large right sided pleural effusion, right lung
   collapse.  All findings not present on previous CT scan from late
   [**Month (only) **] when she was diagnosed.  No signs and symptoms of infection
   presently.  Lymphangitic spread of tumor may also be contributing to
   her symptoms. Given the acuity of her presentation suspect a large
   component is related to acute infarction. No indications for lysis at
   this time given that she is hemodynamically stable and BNP and
   troponins are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, and recently diagnosed stage IIIb to IV non-small cell lung cancer. She presents with three days of progressive dyspnea and has been found to have a large right-sided pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, and right-sided lung collapse. The patient's dyspnea is likely multifactorial, secondary to the large right-sided pulmonary embolism, large right-sided pleural effusion, and right lung collapse. There are no signs or symptoms of infection at this time. Lymphangitic spread of tumor may also be contributing to her symptoms. The patient is hemodynamically stable with normal BNP and troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged or recurrent pulmonary embolism: The presence of a large right-sided pulmonary embolism increases the risk of complications such as hypoxia, respiratory distress, or even death if not promptly treated.
2. Tension pneumothorax: Given the right lung collapse and paradoxical chest expansion, there is a potential risk of developing a tension pneumothorax, which can lead to respiratory compromise and cardiovascular instability.
3. Malignant spread: The lymphangitic spread of tumor could potentially lead to further complications, such as superior vena cava syndrome or other local invasions, impacting the patient's respiratory and overall health status.
4. Pleural effusion-related complications:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLCA) presenting with pulmonary embolism (PE) and pleural effusion. She is currently experiencing shortness of breath despite being on a low-flow nasal cannula. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia and hypoxemia. Physical examination reveals bilateral wheezes, diminished breath sounds on the right side, and no lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels. The patient's medication includes systemic anticoagulation with heparin.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has an acute PE, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential hypoxemia. It is crucial to monitor her oxygen saturation levels and provide appropriate respiratory support.
2. Pleural effusion: The patient has a large right-sided pleural effusion, which can contribute to respiratory symptoms and compromise lung function. Thoracentesis has been planned to remove the fluid and send it for cytology analysis.
3. Dyspnea: The patient's primary complaint is shortness of breath, indicating impaired respiratory function. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and supportive care are necessary.
4. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety, likely related to her critical illness and recent diagnosis of lung cancer. Psychological support and appropriate management of anxiety symptoms should be considered.
5. Cancer progression:"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension and
   recently diagnosed stage IIIb to IV non-small cell lung cancer who
   presents with three days of progressive dyspnea found to have large
   right sided pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion and right sided
   collapse.
   .
   Dyspnea:  Likely multifactorial secondary to large right sided
   pulmonary embolism, large right sided pleural effusion, right lung
   collapse.  All findings not present on previous CT scan from late
   [**Month (only) **] when she was diagnosed.  No signs and symptoms of infection
   presently.  Lymphangitic spread of tumor may also be contributing to
   her symptoms. Given the acuity of her presentation suspect a large
   component is related to acute infarction. No indications for lysis at
   this time given that she is hemodynamically stable and BNP and
   troponins are within normal limits.
   - continue heparin
   - follow-up labs from thoracentesis yesterday
   - wean oxygen as tolerated

   Non-small cell lung cancer:  Patient was scheduled to initiate
   chemotherapy shortly.  Now presents with dyspnea, large effusion and
   pulmonary embolism.

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of type II diabetes, hypertension, and recently diagnosed stage IIIb to IV non-small cell lung cancer. She presents with progressive dyspnea and has been found to have a large right-sided pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, and right lung collapse. 

The dyspnea is likely multifactorial, secondary to the large right-sided pulmonary embolism, large right-sided pleural effusion, and right lung collapse. There are no signs or symptoms of infection at present. Lymphangitic spread of tumor may also be contributing to her symptoms. Given the acuity of her presentation, it is suspected that a large component is related to acute infarction.

The plan includes continuing heparin, following-up labs from thoracentesis yesterday, and weaning oxygen as tolerated. The patient was scheduled to initiate chemotherapy shortly but now presents with dyspnea, large effusion, and pulmonary embolism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress due to the pulmonary embolism and pleural effusion, further spread of the non-small cell lung cancer, development of deep vein thrombosis, and potential complications related to the chemotherapy treatment."

She presents with three days of progressive dyspnea and was found to have a large right-sided pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, and right lung collapse. 

The patient is currently on a heparin drip for anticoagulation and is expected to undergo further management for her conditions.

 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   61 year old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension and
   recently diagnosed stage IIIb to IV non-small cell lung cancer who
   presents with three days of progressive dyspnea found to have large
   right sided pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion and right sided
   collapse.
   .
   Dyspnea:  Likely multifactorial secondary to large right sided
   pulmonary embolism, large right sided pleural effusion, right lung
   collapse.  All findings not present on previous CT scan from late
   [**Month (only) **] when she was diagnosed.  No signs and symptoms of infection
   presently.  Lymphangitic spread of tumor may also be contributing to
   her symptoms. Given the acuity of her presentation suspect a large
   component is related to acute infarction. No indications for lysis at
   this time given that she is hemodynamically stable and BNP and
   troponins are within normal limits.
   - continue heparin
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   -pleural fluid mostly blood, likely malignant. Will follow up cytology.
   .

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, and recently diagnosed stage IIIb to IV non-small cell lung cancer. She presents with three days of progressive dyspnea and was found to have a large right-sided pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, and right-sided collapse. The patient's dyspnea is likely multifactorial secondary to the large right-sided pulmonary embolism, large right-sided pleural effusion, and right lung collapse. There are no signs or symptoms of infection, and lymphangitic spread of tumor may also be contributing to her symptoms. The patient is hemodynamically stable with normal troponin levels, so there are no indications for lysis at this time.

The patient's anemia is due to a significant drop in her hematocrit (HCT) today. A repeat chest X-ray (CXR) will be done to ensure that she is not bleeding into her pleural fluid, and a guaiac stool test will be performed to check for blood in the stool. If the CXR worsens, a computed tomography (CT) scan will be obtained to assess for blood in the pleural fluid.

The patient's non-small cell lung cancer was scheduled to initiate chemotherapy shortly, but now presents with dyspnea, large effusion, and pulmonary embolism. The oncology recommendations include initiating Lovenox at 1 mg/kg q12 and transferring to the oncology medical expert (OMED) when more stable.

The patient also has hypokalemia, which will be repleted with oral K sliding scale. Anxiety will be managed with Xanax PRN. Hypertension is being held on all antihypertensive medications. Diabetes will be managed with insulin sliding scale, and hyperlipidemia will continue with simvastatin.

Nutrition will focus on cardiac, diabetic diet, and repleting electrolytes. Prophylaxis will include heparin. The patient's peripheral lines will be used for access, and her code status is full. Communication will be maintained with the patient and her husband. The patient's position is on the OMED floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the pulmonary embolism, further pleural effusion, development of pneumonia, and worsening of the patient's underlying lung cancer. Additionally, the patient may develop complications related to her diabetes, hypertension, and hypokalemia. Close monitoring of vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory values will be crucial in preventing and managing these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, and recently diagnosed stage IIIb to IV non-small cell lung cancer. She presents with three days of progressive dyspnea and has been found to have a large right-sided pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, and right-sided lung collapse. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving heparin for the pulmonary embolism, oxygen therapy as tolerated, and will have the pleural fluid analyzed for cytology. The patient's anemia is being investigated further with a repeat chest X-ray and guaiac stool test to assess for bleeding into the pleural fluid. Her non-small cell lung cancer treatment will be discussed with the oncology team, and she is scheduled to initiate chemotherapy soon. The patient also has hypokalemia, anxiety, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, which are being managed accordingly.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, and recently diagnosed stage IIIb to IV non-small cell lung cancer. She presents with three days of progressive dyspnea and was found to have a large right-sided pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, and right-sided lung collapse. The patient is currently in the ICU and receiving heparin for her condition. She also has anemia, hypokalemia, anxiety, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and requires nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a large right-sided pulmonary embolism, which can lead to further complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, or even cardiac arrest if not managed appropriately.
2. Pleural effusion: The presence of pleural effusion may indicate an underlying infection or malignancy. It could potentially lead to respiratory compromise if it continues to accumulate.
3. Right-sided lung collapse: The collapse of the right lung can cause impaired gas exchange and reduced oxygenation. If not treated, it could result in respiratory failure.
4. Anemia: The significant drop in the patient's hematocrit (HCT) indicates anemia. This condition can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Hypokalemia: The low potassium levels can cause muscle weakness, irregular heart rhythms, and cardiac arrhythmias if not"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, and recently diagnosed stage IIIb to IV non-small cell lung cancer. The patient presents with three days of progressive dyspnea and was found to have a large right-sided pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, and right-sided lung collapse.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
- Heart rate: 89 bpm
- Blood pressure: 120/89 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 96% on nasal cannula

The patient is currently receiving heparin infusion and oxygen as tolerated. The pleural fluid is mostly blood, likely malignant, and will be followed up with cytology. The patient's HCT has significantly dropped, so a repeat chest X-ray will be done to ensure there is no bleeding into the pleural fluid, and a guaiac stool test will be performed. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and platelet count (Plt), while the creatinine (Cr) and glucose levels are within normal limits. The PT/PTT/INR levels are also within normal limits. The pleural fluid analysis reveals an increased WBC count with a predominance of lymphocytes, indicating a possible malignant effusion. 

The patient's medical conditions include anxiety, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the lung, dyspnea (shortness of breath), pleural effusion, acute pulmonary embolism (PE), and right-sided lung collapse. The dyspnea is likely multifactorial due to the large right-sided PE, large right-sided pleural effusion, and right lung collapse. The patient's symptoms may also be contributed by lymphangitic spread of tumor.

The patient's medications include metoprolol, heparin sodium, and Lovenox. The plan is to continue heparin and wean oxygen as tolerated. The patient is also prescribed Xanax for anxiety, and her diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia will be managed accordingly.

In summary, the patient is a female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer who presents with acute pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, and right-sided lung collapse. She is currently receiving heparin and oxygen therapy and will undergo further evaluation of the pleural fluid."
