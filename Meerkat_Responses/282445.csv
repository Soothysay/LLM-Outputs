   The pt is a 74y/o F with a PMH of CAD, DM, recent diagnosis of
   cholangiocarcinoma with metaseses to the transverse colon s/p resection
   and PEG placement admitted s/p PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA Arrest - unclear precipitating event. Pt with multiple potential
   sources of infection which could lead to hypovolemia however lactate
   only elevated to 1.4 - recent history of bacteremia as well as PNA, hx
   of cholangiocarcinoma with biliary stent, no clear evidence of hypoxia
   documented at rehab or ED prior to arrest as trigger. Hyperkalemia
   possible factor with K of 6.0, FS not dramatically abnormal, no
   evidence of tamponade on fast exam in ED, consider cardiac ischemia
   with trop elevated to 0.6 however this not unexpected post-arrest and
   quickly trending down. Given risk factors of HR>100, immobilization and
   malignancy risk for PE is approx 37% by Well
s Criteria. Given risk of
   bleed post CPR and malignancy as well as recent surgery will hold on
   empiric anticoagulation while awaiting CTA
   - Continue supportive care with intubation, pressor
   - CTA to rule out PE and TTE to assess for cardiac function
   - Work up infectious etiology for sepsis with blood cultures, urine
   cultures (UA clear), sputum culture, would pursue diagnostic
   thoracentesis of R pleural effusion
   - Continue broad spectrum antimicrobials with vanc/zosyn, will continue
   bactrim for now, obtain OSH data
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - Check TTE
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC 19.0 at OSH, 25.3 here with left shift, no fever
   reported. Pt with recent history of MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia.
   Leukocytosis may be reactive in setting or arrest, given pt hemodynamic
   instability and unclear source of arrest will continue broad spectrum
   antimicrobials awaiting culture data
   - continue vanc/zosyn/bactrim as above
   - f/u final read of CT A/P
   - consider diagnostic thoracentesis
   - f/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - trend LFTs and consider ERCP drainage if evidence of obstruction
   - trend CE as above
   - obtain OSH data
   .
   # Pleural Effusion - per OSH notes the pt has a history of PNA and R
   sided pleural effusion, unclear if previous diagnostic thoracentesis
   - consider diagnostic/therapuetic thoracentesis
   - f/u final read Chest CT to eval for PNA
   - Continue previous bactrim course for now with Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma - pt with recent diagnosis and
   complicated course including mets to transverse colon s/p resection.
   Tumor unresectable, felt to have poor likelihood of tolerating
   chemotherapy per OSH oncology notes
   - trend LFTs
   - obtain OSH records re baseline

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), recent diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma with metastasis to the transverse colon, post-endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, admitted after a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has multiple potential sources of infection which could lead to hypovolemia, but lactate levels are only elevated to 1.4. She also has hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 6.0, and there is no clear evidence of hypoxia documented prior to the arrest. The patient's condition is complicated by recent bacteremia, pneumonia, and biliary stent. She is currently intubated and on pressor support, and further diagnostic tests are being planned, including a computed tomography angiography (CTA) to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess cardiac function. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials are being continued, and blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum culture have been obtained. A diagnostic thoracentesis of right pleural effusion is also being considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a high risk of PE due to immobilization, malignancy, and recent surgery. A CTA will be performed to rule out PE"

   elsewhere. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular
   cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
   valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
   thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
   mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
   regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   The pt is a 74y/o F with a PMH of CAD, DM, recent diagnosis of
   cholangiocarcinoma with metaseses to the transverse colon s/p resection
   and PEG placement admitted s/p PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA Arrest - unclear precipitating event. Pt with multiple potential
   sources of infection which could lead to hypovolemia however lactate
   only elevated to 1.4 - recent history of bacteremia as well as PNA, hx
   of cholangiocarcinoma with biliary stent, no clear evidence of hypoxia
   documented at rehab or ED prior to arrest as trigger. Hyperkalemia
   possible factor with K of 6.0, FS not dramatically abnormal, no
   evidence of tamponade on fast exam in ED, consider cardiac ischemia
   with trop elevated to 0.6 however this not unexpected post-arrest and
   quickly trending down. Given risk factors of HR>100, immobilization and
   malignancy risk for PE is approx 37% by Well
s Criteria. Given risk of
   bleed post CPR and malignancy as well as recent surgery will hold on
   empiric anticoagulation while awaiting CTA
   - Continue supportive care with intubation, pressor
   - CTA to rule out PE and TTE to assess for cardiac function
   - Work up infectious etiology for sepsis with blood cultures, urine
   cultures (UA clear), sputum culture, would pursue diagnostic
   thoracentesis of R pleural effusion
   - Continue broad spectrum antimicrobials with vanc/zosyn, will continue
   bactrim for now, obtain OSH data

   - Check TTE
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC 19.0 at OSH, 25.3 here with left shift, no fever
   reported. Pt with recent history of MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia.
   Leukocytosis may be reactive in setting or arrest, given pt hemodynamic
   instability and unclear source of arrest will continue broad spectrum
   antimicrobials awaiting culture data
   - continue vanc/zosyn/bactrim as above
   - f/u final read of CT A/P
   - consider diagnostic thoracentesis
   - f/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - trend LFTs and consider ERCP drainage if evidence of obstruction
   - trend CE as above
   - obtain OSH data
   .
   # Pleural Effusion - per OSH notes the pt has a history of PNA and R
   sided pleural effusion, unclear if previous diagnostic thoracentesis
   - consider diagnostic/therapuetic thoracentesis

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), recent diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma with metastases to the transverse colon, post-PEG placement. She was admitted after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including bacteremia, pneumonia, and a history of cholangiocarcinoma with a biliary stent. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a high risk of PE due to immobilization, malignancy, and recent surgery. A CT angiography (CTA) was performed to rule out PE, and no evidence of PE was found.
2. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's troponin level is elevated, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. Further cardiac evaluation is needed.
3. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be reactive or due to an infectious etiology. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials are being continued, and cultures are pending.
4. Right pleural effusion: The patient has a large right pleural effusion with associated right lower lobar collapse. It is unclear if this is due to pneumonia or another cause. A diagnostic thoracentesis may be considered.
5. Ascites: The patient has ascites, but no specific abdominal process has been identified.

- The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and recent diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma with metastasis to the transverse colon, status post resection and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.
- She was admitted after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.
- The cause of the PEA arrest is unclear, but possible causes include pneumonia with or without a mucous plug causing transient hypoxemia, or a primary cardiomyopathy.
- The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is severely decreased at 15-20%.
- Hyperkalemia (K 6) was also noted on presentation.
- A computed tomography angiography (CTA) for pulmonary embolism (PE) was negative, ruling out PE.
- The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support (PS) at 18 cmH2O, which was decreased to 15 cmH2O overnight.
- Blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum culture have been obtained to follow up on the infectious etiology workup for sepsis.
- A diagnostic thoracentesis of the right pleural effusion will be pursued.
- Broad-spectrum antimicrobials, including vancomycin (Vanc), piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and bactrim, are being continued.
- Ongoing assessment and management of the patient's medical conditions, including CAD, DM, metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, and diabetes-related complications, are being addressed.
- The patient's recent history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and pneumonia is also noted.
- Leukocytosis is trending down, but the source of infection is still unclear.
- Other issues mentioned include a positive guaiac test indicating gastrointestinal bleeding, a history of pneumonia and right-sided pleural effusion, a recent bowel obstruction following right colectomy, and a history of coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of recent pneumonia, and the presence of a right lower lobe atelectasis and moderate right pleural effusion on the CTA suggests a possible infectious etiology. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential sepsis.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's severely decreased ejection fraction (EF) at 15-20% indicates significant impairment of cardiac function. This increases the risk of cardiogenic shock, which can be life-threatening and may require further cardiac interventions or support.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The positive guaiac test suggests the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be related to the patient's recent bowel obstruction or other underlying conditions. This can lead to anemia, hypotension, and potential need for blood transfusion.

4. Metastatic cholangiocarcinoma: The patient has a recent diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma with metastasis to the transverse colon. The tumor is considered unresectable, and the patient may have a poor likelihood of tolerating chemotherapy. This may affect the patient's prognosis and overall survival.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the CTA for PE was negative, the patient is at high risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and recent diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma with metastases to the transverse colon, status post resection and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She was admitted after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which ruled out pulmonary embolism (PE) and cardiac tamponade. The patient has impaired skin integrity and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by pneumonia. Her mental status has improved.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Severe cardiomyopathy: The patient's recent TTE revealed severe cardiomyopathy, which is a new finding since [**2153**]. This condition may lead to heart failure and decreased cardiac output.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia, which could progress to severe pneumonia and potentially develop into sepsis or septic shock.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores. These can be difficult to heal and may lead to infection.

4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest impaired renal function. This may progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) or CKD if not managed appropriately.

5. Wound infection: The patient has an ostomy site"

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and recent diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma with metastases to the transverse colon, status post resection and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She was admitted after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has pneumonia on CT and requires ventilatory support. There is a possibility of worsening respiratory failure if the lung does not re-expand.

2. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient has impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), indicating cardiomyopathy. This may lead to further cardiac dysfunction.

3. Wound Infection: The patient has pus and erythema at the midline incision site with a guaiac-positive stool, suggesting a possible wound infection. This requires close monitoring and appropriate treatment.

4. Fluid/Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is positive with a total in of 3,401 mL and total out of 3,120 mL, indicating fluid overload. Monitoring and managing fluid intake and output is crucial to prevent further fluid/electrolyte imbalances.

   The pt is a 74y/o F with a PMH of CAD, DM, recent diagnosis of
   cholangiocarcinoma with metaseses to the transverse colon s/p resection
   and PEG placement admitted s/p PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA Arrest - unclear precipitating event.  Her CT scan in concerning
   for RLL pneumonia.   Possible causes of PEA include pneumonia +/-
   mucuous plug causing transient hypoxemia or possible primary
   cardiomyopathy.  Patient has decreased EF to 15-20% unlcear primary or
   secondary to recent code.  Patient also had hyperkalemia (K 6) on
   presentation as nother possible factor.  Ruled out PE with negative
   PE-CTA.
   - successfully extubated
   - follow up infectious etiology workup for sepsis with blood cultures,
   urine cultures (UA clear), sputum culture, would pursue diagnostic
   thoracentesis of R pleural effusion
   - Continue broad spectrum antimicrobials with vanc/zosyn for now
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, recent diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma with metastases to the transverse colon, and previous percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement. She was admitted after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was unclear in precipitating event. Possible causes included pneumonia with mucous plug, primary cardiomyopathy, or hyperkalemia. A CT scan showed right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient had decreased ejection fraction of 15-20% and was successfully extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of right lower lobe pneumonia, which could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially sepsis if not adequately treated.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's decreased ejection fraction indicates possible primary or secondary cardiomyopathy. This can result in heart failure symptoms and may require further cardiac evaluation and management.
3. Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma: The patient has a recent diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma with metastases to the transverse colon. This indicates a poor prognosis and potential complications related to tumor growth and spread.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is impaired, most likely due to prerenal causes such as poor forward flow. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of malignancy and recent cardiac arrest, currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's chief complaint is oliguria/anuria (low urine output), which has not improved despite a fluid bolus. Other notable events include the placement of a PICC line and removal of a CVL from OSH, as well as extubation and initiation of pain management with Fentanyl. Diagnostic thoracentesis was performed, showing a transudative effusion with negative gram stain. The patient's pleural fluid culture grew GNR, speciation pending. Post-thoracentesis chest X-ray showed improvement. The patient has been receiving various medications including Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Pantoprazole (Protonix), Furosemide (Lasix), and Heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound dehiscence: The patient has a history of malignancy, which increases the risk of impaired wound healing. Wound dehiscence refers to the reopening of a surgical incision.
2. Oliguria/anuria: The patient's low urine output is concerning and may indicate acute kidney injury or urinary tract obstruction. Further evaluation and management are required.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has signs of pneumonia, as indicated by the presence of GNR bacteria in the pleural fluid culture. This infection needs to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and recent diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma with metastases to the transverse colon, who was admitted after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She had a CT scan indicating right lower lobe pneumonia and possible causes of PEA arrest including pneumonia with or without a mucous plug, or primary cardiomyopathy. The patient also had hyperkalemia on presentation. A negative pulmonary embolism CT angiography ruled out pulmonary embolism as a cause.

The patient is currently intubated and on pressor support. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) have been initiated, along with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for MRSA coverage. A diagnostic thoracentesis of the right pleural effusion was performed, and the pleural fluid is consistent with transudate and gram stain negative. The patient has shown improvement post-thoracentesis on chest X-ray. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture is pending for speciation.

Other interventions include the placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line and discontinuation of the left central venous line. Lasix was given at the time of extubation. Metoprolol has been started for cardiomyopathy,"

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and recent diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma with metastases to the transverse colon. She was admitted after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient underwent thoracentesis twice, multi-lumen placement, insertion of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, and invasive ventilation. She was extubated successfully.

The patient's condition is currently stable, with respiratory support on 2 liters of oxygen post-intubation. Her pleural fluid analysis showed a transudate, and culture results are pending. The patient has severe cardiomyopathy, as indicated by a new finding on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Repeat TTE is planned in a few days/weeks to assess improvement in global function. The patient has been started on a beta-blocker.

The patient also exhibits signs of renal failure, with a fractional excretion of sodium (Fena) of 0.6, acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with contrast nephropathy, and jugular venous distention (JVD) elevated but without peripheral edema. Fluid management is being monitored to allow the patient to autoregulate.

Regarding oncology, the patient is not a candidate for further treatment until her functional status improves. A consultation with an oncologist is planned.

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and recent diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma with metastasis to the transverse colon. She was admitted after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient underwent thoracentesis, multi-lumen placement, and insertion of a percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line. She was also intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. The patient's urine output decreased and did not respond to fluid bolus, indicating potential renal impairment. Her INR improved with vitamin K administration. Diagnostic pleural fluid analysis showed transudate, and chest X-ray revealed pulmonary edema. Sedation was stopped, and the patient was extubated successfully. She was started on metoprolol for cardiomyopathy and given lasix for fluid management. The patient's allergies are unknown. She received vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned events. Flow sheet data indicates stable vital signs, hemodynamics, and fluid balance. Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities apart from the presence of pus and erythema at the abdominal incision site and ostomy with liquid stool. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. Microbiology"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and recent diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma with metastases to the transverse colon, who presented with a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She underwent thoracentesis, multi-lumen catheter placement, and PICC line insertion. The patient was intubated and received invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated. Her urine output decreased and did not respond to fluid bolus. She received vitamin K, which improved her INR. Diagnostic thoracentesis revealed transudate fluid. Chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis is pending for gram-negative bacteria (GNR) speciation. The patient's sedation was stopped, and she was extubated. Lasix was started for congestive heart failure (CHF), and metoprolol was started for cardiomyopathy. She has no known drug allergies. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). She is currently on furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. There are no significant changes in her medical, social, or family history, or review of systems.
