   Assesment: This is a 62 year-old male with a history of wide spread ca
   who presents with persistant poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic
   picture despite on antibiotics
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient meets SIRS criteria with source to be likely source
   is lungs.  WBC increasing, slightly hypothermic, hypotensive.
   - Central venous line  not needed for now
   - IV fluids as dry and possibly prerenal
   - Transfuse for further Hct drop
   - cont vanc and ad zosyn to cover for hospital aquired pna/bowel flora
   given ascitis and ca
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   # tachypnea: out of proportion to oxygen and CxR, pna could be
   underestimated on xrayas very dry. PE despite on lovenox possible as
   significant tumor burden with possible compression on abdominal vena
   cava. tumor emboli possible as well. further more central causes of
   tachypnea e.g. sepsis, ca, pain, delirium, should be considered.
   ascitis and tumor decreasing lung volume possible as well however less
   likely as tachypnea after paracentesis rather than befor. given
   hypotension, distant heart sounds, and low voltage could be tamponade,
   however, ekg unchagned over the past several weeks, no jvd, no pulsus.
   - consider echo
   - d/c lovenox given renal failure and start heparin gtt
   - abx for pna
   - symptomatic treatment (pain, etc)
   - trop to r/o signif heart failure due to PE
   # Metastatic Carcinoma: Likely colonic primary and is now s/p colonic
   stent placement. The pt has never met Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**] before. Given extent of
   disease and poor functional status treatment chemotherapy (?FOLFOX)
   would be palliative.
   - plan for family meeting and discussion of goal of care.
   - palliative care consult recs

   # Bacterial Peritonitis:  Peritoneal fluid wbc 700(70P/9L). Peritoneal
   culture showed coag negative staph of 2 colonial morphologies and
   1+pmn. Vancomycin and Zosyn (started on [**2-25**]) and then zosyn was
   discontinued following the read on MRCP.
   - broadening coverage with zosyn to cover bowel flora (possible gi ca)
   and other gram negatives
   - vanc trough in am
   # Delerium: Patient AOx1. Trying to get out of bed and pulling out
   lines. DDx: Peritoneal infection, opiods. Will continue to tx
   underlying infection, d/c PCA for PRN dilaudid dosing.
   - Haldol 1-2mg q8H:PRN
   - Zyprexa 5mg SL
   - try to avoid central active meds
   - delirium could be due to pain or pain meds
   # Abdominal Distension: Pt had 4.5L removed on [**3-1**].  hypotension could
   be due to fluid shift. needs fluid back.
   - albumin given, 50 g
   - IVF.
   # liver failure: could be cause of MS change, cont lactulose and
   symptomatic treatment. treatment of mets per oncology
   # Type I Diabetes : Continue lantus, although monitor for hypoglycemia
   in setting of imparied hepatic function.
   - Lantus + HISS
   # Constipation: Potentially secondary to opiod requiremnets, less
   likely obstruction given stent in place and no evidence of obstruction
   on imaging.
   - place pt on Senna, Lactulose.
   # ARF: most likely due to prerenal hypovolemia, possibly ATN due to
   hypotension or sepsis. unlikely meds. possible vascular
   compression/invasion. unlikely hepatorenal
   - UA and lytes
   - fluids

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of widespread cancer (malignant neoplasm) presenting with persistent poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic picture despite being on antibiotics. The patient's current condition is complex and involves multiple medical complications.

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has been assessed for a possible PE due to tachypnea that is out of proportion to oxygen saturation and chest X-ray findings. This could be caused by tumor emboli or compression on the abdominal vena cava. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram is recommended.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may not be delirium. This could be due to various factors such as sepsis, cancer, pain, or other underlying causes. Symptomatic treatment and addressing the underlying causes are advised.

3. Bacterial Peritonitis: The patient has evidence of bacterial peritonitis with high white blood cell counts in the peritoneal fluid. Treatment with vancomycin and Zosyn has been initiated, and broadening the coverage with Zosyn to include bowel flora and other gram-negative bacteria is suggested.

4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which may be related to peritoneal infection, opioids, or other factors. Treatment of underlying infections, discontinuation of PCA for PRN dilaudid dosing"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of widespread cancer, specifically colorectal cancer. He is currently in the ICU and presents with persistent poor mental status, tachypnea, and signs of sepsis despite being on antibiotics. The patient also has several other medical conditions and complications, including pulmonary embolism (PE), altered mental status (not delirium), metastatic carcinoma, bacterial peritonitis, abdominal distension, liver failure, type I diabetes, constipation, acute renal failure (ARF), anemia, hypocalcemia, and malnutrition.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already showing signs of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.

2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may indicate a possible PE, especially considering his history of cancer and recent paracentesis. If left untreated, a PE can lead to respiratory distress, cardiac complications, and even death.

3. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating possible liver failure. This can result in hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and other systemic complications.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels and low urine output. ARF can progress to"

 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), COLORECTAL (COLON CANCER)
   Assesment: This is a 62 year-old male with a history of wide spread ca
   who presents with persistant poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic
   picture despite on antibiotics
   Plan:
   # Delerium:  Calmer this morning, required 4 point restraints
   overnight.  On admission, patient AOx1 and was tying to get out of bed
   and pulling out lines. Broad differential including infection, hepatic
   encephalopathy, acidosis, malignancy, uremia, medications.   Head CT
   was with acute process by team
s read
   - Haldol 1-2mg q8H:PRN
   - Zyprexa 5mg SL
   - try to avoid central active meds
   - delirium could be due to pain or pain meds
   - f/u final CT read of head
   - continue vano and zosyn for broad coverag
   # Sepsis - Patient met  SIRS criteria on admission with source to be
   likely source is lungs..  On admission, WBC was increasing, slightly
   hypothermic, hypotensive.   Continues to be hypotensive to 90
   - Central venous line  not needed for now
   - continue IV fluids as dry and possibly prerenal
   - Transfuse for further Hct drop <21
   - cont vanc and zosyn to cover for hospital aquired pna/bowel flora
   given ascitis and ca
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   # tachypnea: In 40
s this morning,  of proportion to oxygen and CxR,
   pna could be underestimated on xrayas very dry. PE despite on lovenox
   possible as significant tumor burden with possible compression on
   abdominal vena cava and now s/p paracentesis  could have released IVC
   clot, tumor emboli possible as well. Would also consider central causes
   of tachypnea e.g. sepsis, ca, pain, delirium. Ascites and tumor
   decreasing lung volume possible as well however less likely as
   tachypnea after paracentesis rather than befor. given hypotension,
   distant heart sounds, and low voltage could be tamponade, however, ekg
   unchagned over the past several weeks, no jvd, no pulsus.
   - will order echo to r/o tamponade given distant heart sounds and hx of
   malignancy though low concern
   - continue heparin gtt for known PE
   - abx for pna
 vanco and zosyn
   - symptomatic treatment (pain, etc)
   - if goals of care become comfort, could consider inhaled fnetanyl in
   placed or as adjuvant to iv morphine- inhaled fentanyl may relieve
   dyspnea with less sedative ffects compared to iv morphine
   # Metastatic Carcinoma: Likely colonic primary and is now s/p colonic
   stent placement. The pt has never met Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**] before. Given extent of
   disease and poor functional status treatment chemotherapy (?FOLFOX)
   would be palliative.   Give overall poor prognosis, no further efforts
   for definitive diagnosis are indicated
   - plan for family meeting and discussion of goal of care this afternoon
   - palliative care consult recs
   - currently full code
   # Bacterial Peritonitis:  Peritoneal fluid wbc 700(70P/9L). Peritoneal
   culture showed coag negative staph of 2 colonial morphologies and
   1+pmn. Vancomycin and Zosyn (started on [**2-25**]) and then zosyn was
   discontinued following the read on MRCP.
   - broadening coverage with zosyn to cover bowel flora (possible gi ca)
   and other gram negatives
   - vanc trough 17.9, goal 15-20, continue current dosing regimen
   # Abdominal Distension: Pt had 4.5L removed on [**3-1**], got 50gm albumin.
   Hypotension could be due to fluid shift.
   - albumin given, 50 g
   - IVF
   # Liver failure: Could be cause of MS change, cont lactulose and
   symptomatic treatment. treatment of mets per oncology
   - no indication to check ammonia level as does not correlate with level
   of hepatic encephalopahty
   - can give lactulose PR, will hold off on NGT placement pending family
   meeting regarding goals of care
   # Type I Diabetes : Continue lantus, although monitor for hypoglycemia
   in setting of imparied hepatic function.
   - Lantus + HISS
   # Constipation: Potentially secondary to opiod requiremnets, less
   likely obstruction given stent in place and no evidence of obstruction
   on imaging.
   - place pt on Senna, Lactulose.
   # ARF: most likely due to prerenal hypovolemia, possibly ATN due to
   hypotension or sepsis. unlikely meds. possible vascular
   compression/invasion. unlikely hepatorenal
   - UA and lytes
   - fluids
   - albumin
   # Anemia: iron deficiency most likely as hypochromic, microcytic and
   thrombocytosis. most likely due to gi loss or poor iron absorbtion. no
   po iron for now to avoid further constipation.
   -iron studies, b12 folate,  retic count pending
   # Hypocalcemia:6.9  last night, this morning is pending.  Partly
   uncorrected due to hypoalbuminemia, possible contribution to to poor GI
   absorption
   - trend
   # FEN:  IVF, npo for now
   # Access : peripheral, consider central line if further hypotensive
   hypoxic needing intubation
 however would hold off on line placement
   pending family meeting

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of widespread cancer, presenting with persistent poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic picture despite being on antibiotics. The patient's medical history includes malignancy, colorectal cancer, and metastatic carcinoma with likely colonic primary. He underwent colonic stent placement and has never met the oncologist before. The patient's overall prognosis is poor, and no further efforts for a definitive diagnosis are indicated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has been diagnosed with PE, which is a serious condition where one or more arteries in the lungs become blocked by a blood clot. This can lead to difficulty in breathing and decreased oxygen levels in the blood.

2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a widespread infection in the body. It can lead to organ failure and death if not treated promptly and effectively.

3. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status, possibly due to delirium, which is a sudden change in mental status characterized by confusion, disorientation, and agitation. It requires prompt management to prevent complications such as falls, self-removal of lines, and increased risk of mortality.

4. Tachypnea: The patient's rapid breathing may be due to various causes including pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, or an underlying respiratory condition. Tachyp"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo male with history of metastatic GI malignancy and admitted with
   altered mental status.  This is likely attributable to the evolution of
   renal failure, persistent mild hypernatremia and in the setting of
   paracentesis patient did have likely significant volume shifts
   resulting in evolution of hypotension.  Most impressively patient has
   new right sided infiltrate and certainly pulmonary infection or
   pulmonary pneumonitis may well be driving acute changes at this time.
   1)Altered Mental Status--[**Month (only) 8**] be related to active infection/pneumonitis
   in addition to possible hepatic mediated encephaolopathy and metabolic
   abnormalities
   -Lactulose to be given
   -Will Rx underlying infection
   2)Hypotension
Consistent with sepsis
pulmonary source and previous Coag
   Neg Staph species
   Vaco/Zosyn for possible pneumonia
   Peritonitis does appear to be less active at this time
   Will check ECHO for possible tamponade
   Will treat pulmonary source in addition
   3)Pulmonary Embolism--Patient on Lovenox and now change to Heparin in
   the setting of renal failure
   Heparin IV to continue and recurrent PE is of concern although with BP
   stabilized lysis is not to be considered.
   4)Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary-
   -Will need discussion with Oncology

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of metastatic gastrointestinal malignancy. He was admitted with altered mental status, which is likely due to renal failure, mild hypernatremia, and significant volume shifts from paracentesis. The patient also has new right-sided infiltrate, indicating a possible pulmonary infection or pneumonitis. Other findings include hypotension, low white blood cell count, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: This may be related to active infection/pneumonitis, hepatic-mediated encephalopathy, and metabolic abnormalities. Treatment includes lactulose administration and addressing the underlying infection.
2. Hypotension: Consistent with sepsis, possibly from a pulmonary source and previous coagulation issues. Treatment involves antibiotics for pneumonia and peritonitis, as well as checking for tamponade and treating the pulmonary source.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is on Lovenox and has been switched to Heparin due to renal failure. Heparin IV will continue, and there is concern for recurrent PE, although BP stabilization reduces the likelihood of lysis.
4. Adenocarcinoma of Unknown Primary: Discussion with Oncology is needed to define possibilities for treatment.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 62 year-old male with a history of wide spread ca
   who presents with persistant poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic
   picture despite on antibiotics
   Plan:
   # Delerium:  Calmer this morning, required 4 point restraints
   overnight.  On admission, patient AOx1 and was tying to get out of bed
   and pulling out lines. Broad differential including infection, hepatic
   encephalopathy, acidosis, malignancy, uremia, medications.   Head CT
   was with acute process by team
s read
   - Haldol 1-2mg q8H:PRN
   - Zyprexa 5mg SL
   - try to avoid central active meds
   - delirium could be due to pain or pain meds
   - f/u final CT read of head
   - continue vano and zosyn for broad coverag
   # Sepsis - Patient met  SIRS criteria on admission with source to be
   likely source is lungs..  On admission, WBC was increasing, slightly
   hypothermic, hypotensive.   Continues to be hypotensive to 90
   - Central venous line  not needed for now
   - continue IV fluids as dry and possibly prerenal
   - Transfuse for further Hct drop <21
   - cont vanc and zosyn to cover for hospital aquired pna/bowel flora
   given ascitis and ca
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   # tachypnea: In 40
s this morning,  of proportion to oxygen and CxR,
   pna could be underestimated on xrayas very dry. PE despite on lovenox
   possible as significant tumor burden with possible compression on
   abdominal vena cava and now s/p paracentesis  could have released IVC
   clot, tumor emboli possible as well. Would also consider central causes
   of tachypnea e.g. sepsis, ca, pain, delirium. Ascites and tumor
   decreasing lung volume possible as well however less likely as
   tachypnea after paracentesis rather than befor. given hypotension,
   distant heart sounds, and low voltage could be tamponade, however, ekg
   unchagned over the past several weeks, no jvd, no pulsus.
   - will order echo to r/o tamponade given distant heart sounds and hx of
   malignancy though low concern
   - continue heparin gtt for known PE
   - abx for pna
 vanco and zosyn
   - symptomatic treatment (pain, etc)
   - if goals of care become comfort, could consider inhaled fnetanyl in
   placed or as adjuvant to iv morphine- inhaled fentanyl may relieve
   dyspnea with less sedative ffects compared to iv morphine
   # Metastatic Carcinoma: Likely colonic primary and is now s/p colonic
   stent placement. The pt has never met Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**] before. Given extent of
   disease and poor functional status treatment chemotherapy (?FOLFOX)
   would be palliative.   Give overall poor prognosis, no further efforts
   for definitive diagnosis are indicated
   - plan for family meeting and discussion of goal of care this afternoon
   - palliative care consult recs
   - currently full code
   # Bacterial Peritonitis:  Peritoneal fluid wbc 700(70P/9L). Peritoneal
   culture showed coag negative staph of 2 colonial morphologies and
   1+pmn. Vancomycin and Zosyn (started on [**2-25**]) and then zosyn was
   discontinued following the read on MRCP.
   - broadening coverage with zosyn to cover bowel flora (possible gi ca)
   and other gram negatives
   - vanc trough 17.9, goal 15-20, continue current dosing regimen
   # Abdominal Distension: Pt had 4.5L removed on [**3-1**], got 50gm albumin.
   Hypotension could be due to fluid shift.
   - albumin given, 50 g
   - IVF
   # Liver failure: Could be cause of MS change, cont lactulose and
   symptomatic treatment. treatment of mets per oncology
   - no indication to check ammonia level as does not correlate with level
   of hepatic encephalopahty
   - can give lactulose PR, will hold off on NGT placement pending family
   meeting regarding goals of care
   # Type I Diabetes : Continue lantus, although monitor for hypoglycemia
   in setting of imparied hepatic function.
   - Lantus + HISS
   # Constipation: Potentially secondary to opiod requiremnets, less
   likely obstruction given stent in place and no evidence of obstruction
   on imaging.
   - place pt on Senna, Lactulose.
   # ARF: most likely due to prerenal hypovolemia, possibly ATN due to
   hypotension or sepsis. unlikely meds. possible vascular
   compression/invasion. unlikely hepatorenal
   - UA and lytes
   - fluids
   - albumin
   # Anemia: iron deficiency most likely as hypochromic, microcytic and
   thrombocytosis. most likely due to gi loss or poor iron absorbtion. no
   po iron for now to avoid further constipation.
   -iron studies, b12 folate,  retic count pending
   # Hypocalcemia:6.9  last night, this morning is pending.  Partly
   uncorrected due to hypoalbuminemia, possible contribution to to poor GI
   absorption
   - trend
   # FEN:  IVF, npo for now
   # Access : peripheral, consider central line if further hypotensive
   hypoxic needing intubation
 however would hold off on line placement
   pending family meeting

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of widespread cancer. He presents with persistent poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic picture despite being on antibiotics. The patient has multiple medical complications including delirium, sepsis, tachypnea, metastatic carcinoma, bacterial peritonitis, abdominal distension, liver failure, type I diabetes, constipation, acute renal failure (ARF), anemia, and hypocalcemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's poor mental status and requirement for restraints indicate delirium. The broad differential includes infection, hepatic encephalopathy, acidosis, malignancy, uremia, and medications. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the SIRS criteria and has a likely source of infection in the lungs. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the patient remains hypotensive. Central venous access may be required for further management.
3. Tachypnea: The patient's increased respiratory rate could be due to pneumonia, tumor-related compression on the diaphragm or abdominal vena cava, or central causes such as sepsis. A chest X-ray and echocardiogram are recommended to rule out tamponade.
4. Metastatic Carcinoma: The patient has extensive disease with a likely colonic primary. Palliative chemotherapy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of widespread cancer, specifically metastatic carcinoma with a likely colonic primary. He presents with persistent poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic picture despite being on antibiotics. The patient has been made comfort measures only (CMO) after a family discussion with his oncologist. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient met SIRS criteria on admission, indicating a possible infection. He is hypotensive and has an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the source of infection is likely the lungs.

2. Tachypnea: The patient's respiratory rate is high, which could be due to pneumonia or metastatic disease causing compression of the lungs. Other causes such as sepsis, pain, or delirium should also be considered.

3. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status and requires restraints at night, indicating possible delirium. Medications, pain, or hepatic encephalopathy could be contributing factors.

4. Bacterial Peritonitis: The patient's peritoneal fluid analysis shows an elevated white blood cell count with the presence of coag-negative staphylococci. Antibiotics have been started, but coverage may need to be broadened.

5. Liver Failure: The patient may have liver failure, which could be causing the change in mental status"

   62 year-old male with a history of wide spread ca who presents with
   persistant poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic picture despite on
   antibiotics, now made [**Year (4 digits) 115**] after family discussion with his oncologist.
   # Metastatic Carcinoma: Likely colonic primary and is now s/p colonic
   stent placement. Given extent of disease and poor functional status
   treatment chemotherapy (?FOLFOX) would be palliative.   Give overall
   poor prognosis, no further efforts for definitive diagnosis are
   indicated.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**], his oncologist met with him and his family
   yesterday and stated that chemo was not indicated in his case and he
   was made [**Last Name (STitle) 115**].
   - Morphine prn for SOB or pain
   - F/u palliative care consult recs
   # Delerium:  Calmer this morning, required 4 point restraints
   overnight.  On admission, patient AOx1 and was tying to get out of bed
   and pulling out lines. Broad differential including infection, hepatic
   encephalopathy, acidosis, malignancy, uremia, medications.   Head CT
   was with acute process by team
s read
   - Haldol 1-2mg q8H:PRN
   - Zyprexa 5mg SL
   - try to avoid central active meds
   - delirium could be due to pain or pain meds
   - f/u final CT read of head
   - continue vano and zosyn for broad coverag
   # Sepsis - Patient met  SIRS criteria on admission with source to be
   likely source is lungs..  On admission, WBC was increasing, slightly
   hypothermic, hypotensive.   Continues to be hypotensive to 90
   - Central venous line  not needed for now
   - continue IV fluids as dry and possibly prerenal
   - Transfuse for further Hct drop <21
   - cont vanc and zosyn to cover for hospital aquired pna/bowel flora
   given ascitis and ca
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   # Respiratory status/Aspiration PNA: The patient was tachypneic
   yesterday to the 40
s this morning, out proportion to oxygen and CxR,
   pna could be underestimated on xrayas very dry. PE despite on lovenox
   possible as significant tumor burden with possible compression on
   abdominal vena cava and now s/p paracentesis  could have released IVC
   clot, tumor emboli possible as well. Would also consider central causes
   of tachypnea e.g. sepsis, ca, pain, delirium. Ascites and tumor
   decreasing lung volume possible as well however less likely as
   tachypnea after paracentesis rather than befor. given hypotension,
   distant heart sounds, and low voltage could be tamponade, however, ekg
   unchagned over the past several weeks, no jvd, no pulsus.
   - will order echo to r/o tamponade given distant heart sounds and hx of
   malignancy though low concern
   - continue heparin gtt for known PE
   - abx for pna
 vanco and zosyn
   - symptomatic treatment (pain, etc)
   - if goals of care become comfort, could consider inhaled fnetanyl in
   placed or as adjuvant to iv morphine- inhaled fentanyl may relieve
   dyspnea with less sedative ffects compared to iv morphine
   # Bacterial Peritonitis:  Peritoneal fluid wbc 700(70P/9L). Peritoneal
   culture showed coag negative staph of 2 colonial morphologies and
   1+pmn. Vancomycin and Zosyn (started on [**2-25**]) and then zosyn was
   discontinued following the read on MRCP, however zosyn was restarted on
   zosyn to further cover bowel flora (possible gi ca) and other gram
   negatives.  Were stopped yesterday while [**Last Name (LF) 115**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] be restarted today.
   - Continue vanc and zosyn.  Will checl vanc levels given her ARF.
   # Type I Diabetes : Continue lantus, although monitor for hypoglycemia
   in setting of imparied hepatic function.
   - Continue lantus 7 units and SSI.
   # Constipation: Patient had a bm this am.
   - Continue colace and senna prn
   # ARF: Cr increased to 2.0 this am; (baseline Cr is 1.1-1.2).  Given
   his hypotension yesterday, likely prerenal vs ATN.
   - Continue to follow
   # Anemia:  Hct stable this am at 28.7 (from 24.6).  No clinical
   evidence of bleeding, although with possible colon cancer, may have a
   chronic slow GI bleed.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Guaiac stools

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of widespread cancer, specifically colon cancer, and is now status post colonic stent placement. He presented with persistent poor mental status, tachypnea, and a septic picture despite being on antibiotics. The patient was made DNR/DNI after a discussion with his oncologist. He is currently hypotensive and has a flat JVP, indicating possible hypovolemia or septic shock. The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with tachypnea and coarse breath sounds in the anterior chest. His abdomen is markedly distended, with a palpable liver and other masses scattered throughout. The patient has significant edema in his extremities. Laboratory results show an elevated WBC count, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies are pending, including a head CT, chest X-ray, and abdominal imaging.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with persistent poor mental status, hypotension, and tachypnea suggests sepsis. The source of infection is likely the lungs, given the increasing WBC count, fever curve, and the presence of a central line. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) are being continued to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia and bowel flora.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia"

   62 year-old male with a history of wide spread ca who presents with
   persistant poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic picture despite on
   antibiotics, now made [**Year (4 digits) 115**] after family discussion with his oncologist.
   # Metastatic Carcinoma: Likely colonic primary and is now s/p colonic
   stent placement. Given extent of disease and poor functional status
   treatment chemotherapy (?FOLFOX) would be palliative.   Give overall
   poor prognosis, no further efforts for definitive diagnosis are
   indicated.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**], his oncologist met with him and his family
   yesterday and stated that chemo was not indicated in his case and he
   was made [**Last Name (STitle) 115**].  This morning given his clinical improvement, he and his
   wife have decided to reverse the [**Name (NI) 115**] and want to know if chemo would be
   an option at this time.
   - Will communicate the change in status with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**] and have him meet
   with the patient to discuss chemo options.
   - Morphine prn for SOB or pain
   - F/u palliative care consult recs
   # Delerium:  Resolved, the patient was alert and oriented this am.
   Head CT was negative.  His delirium was likely secondary to his recent
   infection vs aspiration vs medication effecct.
   # Sepsis - Patient met  SIRS criteria on admission with source to be
   likely source is lungs.  On admission, WBC was increasing, slightly
   hypothermic, hypotensive.   Was hypotensive to 80
s yesterday, however
   his SBPs have been improving and his WBC is trending downward.
   - Will obtain a PICC for access and remove his central line once
   placed.
   - continue IV fluids prn for fluid depletion.
   - cont vanc and zosyn to cover for hospital aquired pna/bowel flora
   given ascitis and ca
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   # Respiratory status/Aspiration PNA/Hx of PE: The patient was
   tachypneic yesterday to the 40
s this morning, however his respiratory
   distress resolved and he has been breathing comfortably on 2 L.
   Patient was thought to have aspirated and has been on vanc and zosyn.
   - continue heparin gtt for known PE
   - abx for pna
 vanco and zosyn
   - symptomatic treatment (pain, etc)
   # Bacterial Peritonitis:  Peritoneal fluid wbc 700(70P/9L). Peritoneal
   culture showed coag negative staph of 2 colonial morphologies and
   1+pmn. Vancomycin and Zosyn (started on [**2-25**]) and then zosyn was
   discontinued following the read on MRCP, however zosyn was restarted on
   zosyn to further cover bowel flora (possible gi ca) and other gram
   negatives.  Were stopped yesterday while [**Last Name (LF) 115**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] be restarted today.
   - Continue vanc and zosyn.  Will checl vanc levels given her ARF.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of widespread cancer, specifically metastatic carcinoma with a likely colonic primary. He presented with persistent poor mental status, tachypnea, and septic picture despite being on antibiotics. The patient was made do-not-resuscitate (DNR) after a discussion with his oncologist. 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Mental Status: The patient's delirium has resolved, and he is alert and oriented.
2. Respiratory Status: The patient was tachypneic but is now breathing comfortably on 2 L of oxygen.
3. Sepsis: The patient met SIRS criteria on admission, and his source of infection is likely the lungs. His white blood cell count was increasing, and he was slightly hypothermic and hypotensive. However, his blood pressure has been improving, and his white blood cell count is trending downward. 
4. Central Line: A PICC line will be placed for access, and the central line will be removed once the PICC line is in place.
5. Antibiotics: The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia and bowel flora, given his ascites and cancer.
6. Blood, Urine, and Sputum Cultures: Follow-up cultures will be obtained to identify any changes in the"

   62 yo male with wide spread likely colon cancer now with decision made
   for no chemotherapy offered patient did have clinical decline and when
   faced with possible intubation decision made to pursue patient
   treatment plan as comfort measures only.  In that setting he had
   substantial improvement clinically with comfort care only.  We have
   readdressed the issues given his excellent improvement overnight with
   patient and his wife and will move to DNR/DNI status only.
   1)Sepsis-
   -Will continue to treat with Vanco/Zosyn for likely pulmonary source
   and peritoneal site
   -Follow up labs this am
   -BP has much improved
   2)PE-
   -Has had PE in past and raised as concern with acute chagned
   3)Respiratory Distress/Aspiration Pneumonia-
   -Will have speech and swallow to eval for strategies for minimization
   of aspiration events.  Significant aspiration was seen in the setting
   of severely altered mental status.
   -Continue Vanco/Zosyn

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of widespread colon cancer, who has made the decision to pursue comfort care measures only after experiencing a clinical decline. The patient showed substantial improvement overnight with comfort care and has now been readdressed by the healthcare team. The patient's current medical conditions include sepsis with a likely pulmonary source and peritoneal site, pulmonary embolism (PE), respiratory distress/aspiration pneumonia, and metastatic malignancy (likely colon cancer). The patient is currently on comfort care measures and has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already being treated with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam for a likely pulmonary source and peritoneal site. Close monitoring of vital signs and lab results is essential to manage this condition effectively.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has had a PE in the past and it was raised as a concern with acute changes. Regular follow-up evaluations and appropriate anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to prevent further episodes.
3. Respiratory Distress/Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient will undergo a speech and swallow evaluation to assess strategies for minimizing aspiration events. Continuing with the current antibiotics and supportive care will help manage this condition.
4. Metastatic Malignancy: Further follow-up evaluation and care by the oncology"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of widespread colon cancer, who has been admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, respiratory distress, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient's medical history includes malignancy, specifically colon cancer. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but there are some abnormalities in his laboratory results. The patient's condition has shown improvement after being placed on comfort measures only. The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is being treated with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam for a likely pulmonary source and peritoneal site. It is important to monitor the patient's response to antibiotics and follow-up labs to ensure resolution of sepsis.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's history of PE and the presence of acute changes, it is necessary to consider returning to heparin if the patient's anemia is stable and there is no evidence of active blood loss.

3. Respiratory Distress/Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient will have a speech and swallow evaluation to assess strategies for minimizing aspiration events. It is crucial to continue treatment with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam to address the aspiration pneumonia.

4. Metastatic Malignancy: Further follow-up evaluation and care will be provided by the oncology team for the patient's metastatic colon"
