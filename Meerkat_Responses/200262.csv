","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ethanol abuse, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea who was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia after undergoing a laparoscopic sigmoidectomy and coloproctostomy. The patient is currently stable on non-rebreather oxygen but bipap has been unsuccessful. He has mild back pain, no shortness of breath, or other pain. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 99 bpm (normal range: 80-110 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 125/44mmHg to 154/69mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (normal range: 20-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has no murmurs. The patient is overweight and obese with no acute distress. Physical examination findings include symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and purposeful movement with normal tone. Neurologic examination reveals an attentive patient who follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal muscle tone. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8 g/d"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ethanol abuse, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea who underwent a laparoscopic sigmoidectomy and coloproctostomy. He is currently in the ICU due to hypoxia post-surgery. His vital signs are stable, but he is hypertensive and tachycardic. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His electrolyte levels are within normal range. The assessment indicates possible hypoxia due to volume overload, diastolic dysfunction, or postoperative atelectasis. The plan includes continuing non-rebreather oxygen, repeating ABG, trying CPAP or bipap, administering lasix to control fluid balance, controlling heart rate and blood pressure, and considering a CT angiogram for pulmonary embolism.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient may experience further respiratory distress or develop pneumonia due to his history of OSA and recent surgery.
2. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of hypertension, there is a risk of cardiac dysfunction or heart failure.
3. Thromboembolic events: Considering the patient's malignancy and recent surgery, there is a possibility of developing deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
4. Wound infection or dehiscence: The patient's surgical wound"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ethanol abuse, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia after undergoing a laparoscopic sigmoidectomy and coloproctostomy. 

On the first day, the patient was initially on labetalol and hydralazine for blood pressure and heart rate control but was later switched to metoprolol and hydralazine. The patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 125/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's physical examination revealed diaphoresis, crackles in the lungs, and an distended abdomen. 

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and blood glucose levels. The assessment plan included addressing the patient's hypoxia, hypercarbia, hypertension, and tachycardia. The possible etiologies for the hypoxia were volume overload, pulmonary embolism, postoperative atelectasis, or pulmonary edema. The plan involved maximizing control of blood pressure and heart rate, following up with a final read CTA, using nonrebreather mask for now, and trying CPAP for hypoxia.

   Assessment: This is a 63 year-old male with a history of DM2, HTN, HLP,
   ETOH abuse, obesity, OSA on CPAP who is transferred to the ICU for
   hypoxia s/p laparoscopic sigmoidectomy and coloproctostomy
   Plan:
   # Hypoxia: most likely etiology is volume overload in the setting of
   IVFs intra and postoperatively.  ECHO recently done with normal EF.
   ECG without concerning findings, but likely given his h/o of HTN, has a
   component of diastolic dysfunction not well seen on suboptimal ECHO.
   He has been persistently hypertensive and tachycardic.  No fevers or
   leukocytosis or cough to suggest PNA.  Not an aspiration risk at this
   time. other possibility includes PE given malignancy and recent surgery
   though patient has been on hep sc for ppx.  He does also have sinus
   tachycardia. also, could be post op atelectasis. Most likely seems to
   be pulmonary edema.
   -maximize control of BP and HR-meds changed from IV to Metoprolol 25 Q
   8 PO and Captopril 12.5 Q 8 PO today
   -f/u final read CTA
   - NRB for now- wean as tol
   -Recheck pm ABG
   - If decompensates, can try CPAP for hypoxia, though could benefit from
   bipap given the hypercarbia
   - lasix 80 mg IV BID- goal I/O -1 to -2L in 24H.
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - sputum culture if possible
   - incentive spirometry
   - NEBS ATC
    # Hypercarbia: likely due to OSA, hypoventilation/obesity.  Unclear
   what baseline is, but given elevated bicarb, likely is a chronic
   retainer
   - hold off on BIPAP for now
   - diuresis as above
   - incentive spirometry
   # Hypertension/tachycardia: Peristently hypertensive and tachycardic.
   Likely from not taking home meds; pain, and possibly component of ETOH
   withdrawal
   - Metoprolol and captopril PO as above.
    # h/o ETOH abuse- Pt on day 4 of hospitalization. No signs, sx of
   withdrawl.
   -d/c CIWA scale
    # Colonic adenocarcinoma s/p lap sigmoidectomy: on PCA for pain
   control without a basal rate requiring 1-6x/hr
   - f/u surgery recs

   - d/w surgery re consider peeling off on PCA since able to take POs

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, alcohol abuse, and obesity. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia after undergoing a laparoscopic sigmoidectomy and coloproctostomy. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 192/78 mmHg to 200/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with high-flow nasal cannula.

24-hour events:
- The patient's arterial line was started at 07:09 PM.
- The patient was given metoprolol and captopril, initially through intravenous (IV) administration but later switched to oral (PO) dosages.
- The patient experienced hypercapnia in the afternoon, which improved after a trial of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
- Furosemide was discontinued because the patient's contraction alkalosis was believed to be driving respiratory acidosis.
- Acetazolamide 500 mg IV was administered.
- The patient's beta blocker medication was titrated up.
- An arterial blood gas (ABG) test was conducted at 6:00 am on [**2115-2-1**].

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's assessment includes cancer (m"
