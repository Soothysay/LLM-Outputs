   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). CCU team.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Was hypoxemic and hypercarbic last night --> intubated and mechanically
   ventilated.  This morning, went into AF
 given amiodarone and
   eventually converted to NSR.  Diuresed and extubated without incident.
   Plan:
   1.       Continue gentle diuresis
   2.       Wean off phenylephrine
   3.       Finish amiodarone infusion and then given PO 200 mg/day
   4.       enoxaparin
 long-term warfarin
   5.       Continue ICU care for now.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, hypertension, bilateral hip replacement, NSTEMI, CHF, and COPD flare. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and subsequent intubation. 

During the course of treatment, the patient experienced hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), NSTEMI, acute decompensated CHF, and COPD flare. 

Assessment and plan include managing hypercarbic respiratory failure, addressing hypotension, treating AFib with RVR, managing NSTEMI, treating acute decompensated CHF, and managing COPD flare. 

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications such as ASA, beta-blocker, Plavix, statin, and antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia. 

There are potential medical complications that can arise, including but not limited to: 
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
3. Stress ulcer
4. Further cardiac complications due to NSTEMI
5. Respiratory failure
6. Hypotension
7. COPD exacerbation
8. Infection from hospital-acquired sources

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, gas exchange, and response to medications and interventions. Regular assessments and adjustments to the treatment plan should be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, hypertension, bilateral hip replacement, NSTEMI, CHF, and COPD flare. She was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently intubated. She has been experiencing fevers and requires invasive ventilation. Her blood pressure is low, and she has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She also had an acute decompensated CHF episode, for which she received a 2L diuresis overnight. The patient has been on multiple medications including ASA, beta-blocker, Plavix, statin, and has been encouraged to quit tobacco. She has been diagnosed with hyperinflated lungs with hypercarbia suggestive of a COPD flare. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient is on invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
3. Stress ulcer - Critical illness and medications can increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Hypotension - The patient's blood pressure is low, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient was intubated and started on invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient also had a fever of 101.2°F and somnolence. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH 7.18, pCO2 91, pO2 166, HCO3- 33, and base excess -2. The patient was given dopamine, fentanyl, and midazolam. Furosemide was administered twice. The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.4°C, heart rate between 70-90 bpm, blood pressure between 115/41-153/90 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 509 mL and output of 2575 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2066 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and RSBI of 110. The patient's ABG results are pH 7.29, pCO2 64, pO2 189, HCO3- 33, and base excess -2. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased glucose level. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa, Demerol, and unknown medication. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
2. Barotrauma: The high peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 25 cmH2O indicates the potential risk of barotrauma to the lungs.
3. Volutrauma: The high tidal volume of 500 mL may cause volutrauma, especially in a patient with underlying COPD.
4. Fluid overload: The negative fluid balance suggests that the patient may be at risk for fluid overload due to excessive administration of fluids.
5. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines increase the risk of nosocomial infections, such as bloodstream infections or catheter-related infections.
6. Stress ulcer: The use of corticosteroids and the ICU stay can predispose the patient to stress ulcers.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
8. Delirium: The patient's somnolence and altered mental status may indicate the development of delirium, which is common in critically ill patients."

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, bilateral hip replacement, NSTEMI, CHF, and COPD flare, complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, chest pain, and was found to have an atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient underwent synchronized cardioversion and started on amiodarone for rhythm control. He was extubated yesterday and successfully weaned off phenylephrine. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, blood pressure of 131/57 mmHg, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 28 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 21 mEq/L, and base excess (BE) of -3 mEq/L.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, hypertension, bilateral hip replacement, NSTEMI, CHF, and COPD flare, complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's current condition includes sinus rhythm with intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter, NSTEMI, CHF, COPD, and hypertension. She is extubated and receiving various medications such as amiodarone, heparin, beta-blockers, statin, and inhalers. The patient's vital signs are stable, and her lab results are within normal limits. She is expected to be transferred to the floor once her condition improves.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter, which can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient has had an NSTEMI, indicating possible ongoing cardiac ischemia. This increases the risk of future myocardial infarction or heart failure.
3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: The patient's COPD is currently exacerbated, putting her at risk for respiratory failure and pneumonia.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which increases the risk of cardiovascular events and organ damage if not well-controlled.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for hospital-ac"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, hypertension, bilateral hip replacement, NSTEMI, CHF, and COPD flare. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, NSTEMI, acute decompensated CHF, and COPD flare. The patient underwent various interventions, including cardioversion, extubation, and administration of medications such as amiodarone, heparin, propofol, and insulin. She is currently on multiple medications for her conditions and has had several lab tests conducted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which indicates impaired oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination. There is a risk of recurring respiratory failure if the patient's COPD exacerbation is not adequately managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, likely due to intubation and worsened by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid management are necessary to maintain adequate circulation.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Conversion to sinus rhythm may be attempted, and anticoagulation therapy with coumadin should be considered before discharge due to the patient's CHADS score of 3, indicating a high risk of"

She presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) on two occasions yesterday and was successfully converted to sinus rhythm overnight. She had another episode this morning, which was resolved with diliazem 10mg IV.

The patient's NSTEMI was managed with aspirin, beta-blocker, Plavix, statin, and encouragement to quit tobacco. Her acute decompensated CHF was treated with diuresis overnight. She is currently on diuretics and will have a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) tomorrow to assess wall motion abnormalities and ejection fraction.

Her COPD flare was characterized by hyperinflated lungs with hypercarbia, for which she was empirically given levofloxacin and vancomycin due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and sputum culture was sent. A steroid taper was also initiated, especially considering the active myocardial infarction (MI). Inhalers were prescribed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, hypertension, bilateral hip replacement, NSTEMI, CHF, and COPD flare. She presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and was intubated. She also had hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib/RVR), NSTEMI, acute decompensated CHF, and a COPD flare. The patient was given amiodarone, propofol, and phenylephrine. She was extubated and weaned off phenylephrine. The patient's mental status is improving, and her PaCO2 levels are decreasing. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient initially had difficulty breathing and required intubation. However, her mental status is improving, and her PaCO2 levels are decreasing, indicating improvement.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension likely due to intubation and worsened by afib/RVR. Fluids were given, and neo support was provided until extubation.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib/RVR): The patient had a brief episode of afib/RVR but spontaneously converted. Consideration should be given to direct current cardioversion (DCCV) if she goes back into afib. Coumadin before discharge is recommended given her CHADS score of 3.
4. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient had an NSTEMI and received aspirin, beta-blocker, Plavix, heparin, statin, and encouragement to quit tobacco.
5. Acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient had acute decompensated CHF and underwent 2L diuresis overnight. Diuresis should be continued if blood pressure tolerates, and beta-blocker and [Last Name (un)] should be held for marginal blood pressure.
6. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) flare: The patient had a COPD flare with hyperinflated lungs and hypercarbia. Levofloxacin and vancomycin were given empirically for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and sputum culture was ordered. A steroid taper is recommended, especially in the setting of active myocardial infarction. Inhalers should also be provided.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure should be monitored, and home beta-blocker and [Last Name (un)] should be held.
8. Depression and anxiety: Paxil and klonopin PRN were prescribed for depression and anxiety.
9. Cardiac diet: The patient should follow a cardiac diet.
10. Prophylaxis: The patient is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
11. Possible transfer to the floor: The patient's disposition is pending."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, hypertension, bilateral hip replacement, NSTEMI, CHF, and a COPD flare. She was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has now resolved. She also has episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter but is currently in sinus rhythm. The patient has been diagnosed with multi-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and diastolic dysfunction. Her ejection fraction (EF) is 40-45%. She is on various medications including beta-blockers, statins, anticoagulants, and inhalers for COPD. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and she is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of NSTEMI, CAD, and CHF, there is a potential risk of recurrent cardiac events such as myocardial infarction, heart failure exacerbation, or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of COPD increases the risk of respiratory infections, exacerbations of COPD, and potential need for reintubation.
3. Bleeding complications: Due to the use of anticoagulants like coumadin, there is a risk of bleeding events.
4. Thromboembolic complications: Despite prophylactic measures, there is still a risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary emb"

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, hypertension, bilateral hip replacement, NSTEMI, CHF, and a recent flare-up of COPD complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure. She presented to the hospital with an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has since resolved. The patient also had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have an ejection fraction of 45% on trans-thoracic echo. 

The patient's current medications include diltiazem, carvedilol, amiodarone, coumadin, lasix, levofloxacin, and a statin. She is also being encouraged to quit tobacco use. 

Her vital signs are stable with a heart rate ranging from 64-164 beats per minute, blood pressure between 117/54 and 156/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17-35 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and a temperature of 37.3°C. 

Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally with expiratory wheezes, trace ankle edema, and warm and well-perfused extremities. 

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, there are elevated levels of potassium, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and troponin T. Other lab values are"

1. Transthoracic echo performed on [**2178-4-23**] at 09:08 AM.
2. EKG performed on [**2178-4-23**] at 01:50 PM.
   - The patient experienced two episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib/rvr) in the morning and afternoon. These episodes were treated with 10mg IV diltiazem and an increased dose of carvedilol to 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - The patient was started on amiodarone, coumadin, and losartan.
   - Repeat chest X-ray showed improvement, and vancomycin was de-escalated.
   - Repeat echo revealed regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with multi-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) or other diffuse process. Diastolic dysfunction was also observed along with mild mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and Demerol (meperidine Hcl), with an unknown reaction. The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin on [**2178-4-22**] at 12:00 PM and levofloxacin on [**2178-4-22**] at 10"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of anxiety. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, and is currently experiencing an acute exacerbation. The patient also has atrial fibrillation (AFib) and a myocardial infarction, specifically an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

24-hour events include two episodes of AFib with rapid ventricular response, which were successfully treated with diltiazem and increased carvedilol dosage. The patient was started on amiodarone, coumadin, and losartan. Repeat chest X-ray shows improvement, and vancomycin was discontinued. Repeat transthoracic echo revealed regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with multi-vessel coronary artery disease or other diffuse process, diastolic dysfunction, mild mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Allergies include sulfa, Demerol (meperidine HCl), and an unknown allergy. The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on April 22nd at 12:00 PM and levofloxacin at 10:15 PM. Infusions currently being administered include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, diltiazem, and other ICU medications.

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, hypertension, bilateral hip replacement, NSTEMI, CHF, and COPD flare, complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure. She presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, NSTEMI, congestive heart failure, and COPD exacerbation. She was intubated but successfully extubated yesterday. The patient has been diagnosed with multi-vessel coronary artery disease, diastolic dysfunction, mild mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. She has been prescribed various medications including amiodarone, coumadin, carvedilol, diltiazem, heparin, and losartan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She may be at risk for future arrhythmias due to her underlying cardiac conditions.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF 45%). This puts her at risk for further deterioration in cardiac function and symptoms such as shortness of breath and fluid retention.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has multi-vessel coronary artery disease, which increases her risk for future myocardial infarctions or angina episodes.
4. Pulmonary Complications: The patient has COPD, which puts her at risk for exacerbations and respiratory"
