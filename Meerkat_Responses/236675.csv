 HYPOXEMIA
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   This is a 45 year old female presenting with new diagnosis of likely
   AML now with worsening hypoxia, fever and diffuse interstitial
   infiltrates on CT.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Pt with underlying emphysema
   compounding current picture.  With interval progression of intersitial
   pattern on CT scan and worsening O2 requirement.  Differential includes
   infectious etiologies (viral/bacterial including superimposing
   nosocomial infection given that she is now day #4 of hospitalization).
   Given progression despite broad spectrum coverage, infiltrative
   leukemia is also on differential.
   - Trial of diuresis with CVP goal < 10
   - Check BNP, consider repeat ECHO if elevated
   - Continue broad spectrum coverage including vanc, cefepime, levoflox,
   micafungin and tamiflu.
   - Will add empiric anaerobic coverage with flagyl given recent emesis
   and worsening respiratory status
   - Follow up culture data
   - Frequent ABGs, trial of non-invasive ventilation if persistent O2
   requirement/evidence of CO2 retention [**2-12**] fatigue
   - Chemotherapy per oncology
   - Nebs prn
   .
   # Fever: Currently meets SIRS criteria with temperature, HR, RR, and
   WBC.  Remains hemodynamically stable, cultures negative to date.
   Clinical picture is compounded leukemia which may be responsible for
   the above.
   - f/u culture data
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Chemotherapy per oncology
   - ATC tylenol for fever given tachycardia, increase in metabolic demand
   .
   # Leukemia: With likely AML, awaiting cytogentics.  Plan to start
   idarubacin and cytarabine tonight.
   - Dexamethasone, idarubacin, cytarabine per heme onc
   - TLS, DIC labs q6 hours
   - Transfuse to hct >24, plt> 15K
   - IVF with NS

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presenting with worsening hypoxia, fever, and diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT scan. She has a history of emphysema, which may be contributing to her respiratory distress. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 103.5°F, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/65 to 166/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on high-flow nasal cannula. Her oxygen requirement has been increasing, and she is now requiring non-invasive ventilation. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals, as well as chemotherapy for her leukemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and increased work of breathing may progress to respiratory failure if her oxygenation cannot be adequately maintained.
2. Sepsis: The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and diffuse interstitial infiltrates suggests the possibility of a severe infection leading to sepsis. This is further supported by the patient's tachycardia, tachypnea, and altered mental status.
3. Leukemic Infiltration: Given the patient's likely diagnosis of AML, there is a risk of leukemic cells infiltrating"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She presents with worsening hypoxia, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT scan, and a pleural effusion. The patient's condition has progressed despite broad-spectrum coverage, and infiltrative leukemia is on the differential.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory distress: The patient has worsening hypoxia and evidence of alveolar infiltrate on imaging. This could indicate a worsening infection or progression of leukemia involving the lungs.
2. Pleural effusion: The patient shows signs of pleural effusion on imaging. This can be caused by an infection, fluid overload, or complications related to leukemia.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a lactic acid level of 1.5 mmol/L, which may suggest metabolic acidosis. This could be due to poor tissue perfusion, sepsis, or respiratory failure.
4. Febrile neutropenia: The patient meets the criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock with fever and leukopenia. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention.
5. Transfusion-related complications: The patient is receiving blood products, which carry the risk of transfusion-related complications such as transfusion reaction, transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), or transfusion-associated dyspnea.
6. Infection: The patient has a fever and"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Received valium for anxiety last night. Had fever with chemo; Tmax was
   103 degrees. Transfused platelets and PRBCs yesterday.
   Some shortness of breath at 5 AM this morning with fever spike and was
   given lasix for desaturation and tachypnea. Given non-rebreather mask
   with improvement. CVP was 9 this morning down from 11 pre-lasix.
   Patient feels breathing is more comfortable now than earlier this AM.

   Oxygenation worsened this morning, possibly related to volume overload.
   CXR and exam suggest worsening pleural effusions. Would aim for
   negative fluid balance today of 0.5-1.0 liters. Continue antibiotics.
   If we cannot stabilize respiratory status to the point that we can feed
   her, may need to consider TPN.
   Mild metabolic acidosis, likely a non-gap, hyperchloremic state
   secondary to IV fluids; alternatively, may be renal response to chronic
   respiratory alkalosis. Would use lactated ringers rather than normal
   saline if patient needs crystalloid.
   Hct increased with transfusion. No evidence of bleeding. No need for
   transfusion now. Platelet count remains marginal despite transfusion
   yesterday. Monitor for bleeding. Chemotherapy continues.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is critically ill and has a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), pneumonia, hypoxemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient received Valium for anxiety last night and had a fever with chemotherapy, reaching a maximum temperature of 103 degrees. The patient was also transfused with platelets and PRBCs yesterday.

This morning, the patient experienced shortness of breath at 5 AM with a fever spike and was given Lasix for desaturation and tachypnea. The patient was then placed on a non-rebreather mask, which showed improvement. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) was 9 this morning, down from 11 pre-Lasix. The patient reported feeling more comfortable with their breathing compared to earlier in the morning.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were Micafungin on 08/12/2015 at 12:01 PM, Levofloxacin on 08/12/2015 at 09:29 PM, Cefepime on 08/13/2015 at 07:45 AM, Vancomycin on 08/13/2015 at 08:15 AM, and Metronidazole on 08/13/2015 at 09:00 AM.

   45 year old female presenting with new diagnosis of likely AML now with
   worsening hypoxia, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT, and
   CXR concerning for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Intubated last night for hypoxemic
   distress.  She was initially on CMV with tidal volumes around 500, PEEP
   8 but had very high minute volumes.  Changed to pressure support with
   high PEEP.  Pt with underlying emphysema compounding current picture.
   With interval progression of intersitial pattern on CT scan, pleural
   effusion and alveolar infiltrate, and worsening O2 requirement.
   Differential includes infectious etiologies (viral/bacterial including
   superimposing nosocomial infection given that she is now day #6 of
   hospitalization).  Given progression despite broad spectrum coverage,
   infiltrative leukemia is also on differential.
   - diuresis with goal of -500 cc fluid balance
   - continue broad spectrum coverage including vanc, cefepime, levoflox,
   micafungin, metronidazole
   - d/c Tamiflu.
   - f/u cultures
   - frequent ABGs, trial of non-invasive ventilation if persistent O2
   requirement/evidence of CO2 retention [**2-12**] fatigue
   - Chemotherapy per oncology
   - Nebs PRN
   .
   # Hypotension/low UOP:  Hypotension and low urine output in the setting
   of high PEEP.  Question if this is due to poor filling pressures from
   SVC/IVC compression.  Differential also includes hypovolemia from blood
   loss (although no clear e/o active bleeding) or peripheral vasodilation
   from sepsis.  Had hct drop but no signs of bleeding- following stool
   guaiac.  Receiving 2 units pRBCs now.
   -monitor BP, UOP after 2 units pRBCs
   -off lasix

   # Fever: Currently meets SIRS criteria with temperature, HR, RR, and
   WBC.  Remains hemodynamically stable, cultures negative to date.
   Clinical picture is compounded leukemia which may be responsible for
   the above.  Will consider BAL to look for PNA.
   - f/u cultures
   - possible BAL today
   - continue antibiotics as above
   - chemotherapy per oncology
   - ATC tylenol for fever given tachycardia, increase in metabolic demand

   # Leukemia: With likely AML, awaiting cytogentics.  Heme/onc is on
   board
   - Dexamethasone, idarubacin, cytarabine as per heme onc
   - TLS, DIC labs q6 hours
   - monitor Hct and platelets and transfuse to goal of hct >21, plt> 10K

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently experiencing worsening hypoxia, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT scan, and CXR showing pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate. She was intubated last night for hypoxemic distress and is now on invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of underlying emphysema, which may be compounding the current respiratory picture. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory distress: The patient's worsening hypoxia and diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT scan suggest the possibility of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury, or pneumonia. These conditions can lead to severe respiratory failure and may require more aggressive measures such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) if not responsive to conventional treatments.
2. Infection: Given the patient's fever and progressive respiratory symptoms, there is a concern for an infectious etiology, including bacterial or viral infections. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but if symptoms persist, additional diagnostic tests like bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may be needed to identify the causative organism.
3. Leukemia infiltration: Considering the patient's recent diagnosis of AML, it is important to consider leukemia infiltration as a possible cause of the respiratory distress. Further evaluation, including cytogenetic studies, is warranted"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61.5 kg individual with a height of 62 inches, currently weighing 68.4 kg. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with increasing work of breathing and hypoxic respiratory distress leading to intubation.

The patient has received multiple interventions, including invasive ventilation, administration of medications such as midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, Lasix, Micafungin, vancomycin, levofloxacin, cefepime, metronidazole, and Bactrim. The patient also received 3 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) to correct a low hemoglobin level.

The patient's vital signs show an elevated temperature of 101.9 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate within the range of 96-130 beats per minute, blood pressure fluctuating between 54/67 mmHg and 146/70 mmHg, respiratory rate between 19-37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,681 mL and output of 3,098 mL since midnight, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 1,583 mL. The patient has received a total of 4,105 mL of intravenous fluids, including 2,132 mL since midnight.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presenting with worsening hypoxia, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT, and CXR concerning for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypoxemia, and an undiagnosed fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infectious etiologies: The patient's worsening condition despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage suggests the possibility of infectious causes such as viral or bacterial infections, including superimposed nosocomial infection due to prolonged hospitalization.

2. Infiltrative leukemia: The progression of symptoms, along with the presence of diffuse interstitial infiltrates on imaging, raises suspicion for infiltrative leukemia as a possible differential diagnosis.

3. Hypotension/low urine output: The patient's hypotension and low urine output may be due to various causes, including poor filling pressures from superior vena cava (SVC)/inferior vena cava (IVC) compression, hypovolemia from blood loss, peripheral vasodilation from sepsis, or possible hemolysis or internal bleeding with coagulopathy.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may be a response to chronic respiratory"

   inclined to allow her to continue on PSV rather than sedate her heavily
   to achieve low tidal volume ventilation until we determine if PCP

","The patient's medical history is significant for acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, emphysema, and anemia. The patient was intubated last night due to rising PaCO2 and worsening oxygenation/respiratory distress. A transient drop in blood pressure occurred post intubation, which responded to fluids. The patient also received a blood transfusion yesterday.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 90/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on invasive ventilation and has been since August 13th at 7:45 PM.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and normal heart rhythm. There is a systolic murmur heard at the apex, and crackles are heard in the anterior and lateral chest. The patient's extremities show no edema or cyanosis. The abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to time, place, and person.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 21.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 6.8 g/dL, platelet count of 24 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 30 mg/dL, creatinine of 0"

   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress: BAL ruled out PCP yesterday so
   changed to AC for low tidal volumes per ARDSnet protocol.  However
   patient was pulling large tidal volumes and became hypotensive with
   increased sedation.  Switched back to PS O/N still with large tidal
   volumes.  Good oxygenation.  Pt with underlying emphysema compounding
   current picture.  Improving CXR today.  Differential includes
   infectious etiologies (viral/bacterial including superimposing
   nosocomial infection).  Given progression despite broad spectrum
   coverage, infiltrative leukemia is also on differential.
   - f/u results of BAL: galactomannan, cx, legionella
   - continue broad spectrum coverage including vanc, cefepime, levoflox,
   micafungin, metronidazole
   - f/u cultures
   - frequent ABGs
   - Chemotherapy per oncology
   - Increased nebs to q4 PRN
   - holding IVF boluses for now given +6 liters yesterday and good UOP
   but bolus to maintain UOP>30cc/hr
   .
   # Hypotension:  Resolving. Had hypotension in setting of increased
   sedation for ARDSnet protocol AC control.  Previous hypotension and low
   UOP was possibly due to poor filling pressures from SVC/IVC
   compression.  Differential also includes hypovolemia from blood loss
   (although no clear e/o active bleeding), peripheral vasodilation from
   sepsis (although lactate nml).  Must also consider possible hemolysis
   or internal bleed with coagulopathy.
   -monitor BP, UOP
   -stool guaiac
   - monitor q6 DIC, TLS labs:  D-dimer up from 7000s yesterday,
   fibrinogen slowly trending down
   .
   # Fever: Remains hemodynamically stable, cultures negative to date.
   Clinical picture is compounded leukemia which may be responsible for
   the above.  Awaiting results of cultures from BAL, blood and urine.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue antibiotics as above
   - chemotherapy per oncology
   - ATC tylenol for fever given tachycardia, increase in metabolic demand
   .
   # Increased Cr: Bump from 0.8 to 1.3, likely secondary to chemo.
   Doesn
t appear to be dry.  Will monitor Cr and changed levaquin
   dosage.  Also likely responsible for increased K as pt being
   supplemented with K per NG and is likely not metabolizing as well.
   - monitor Cr
   - monitor UOP, IVF bolus as needed to maintain >30cc/hr
   - continues to receive 100cc/hr NS

   # Leukemia: With likely AML, awaiting cytogenetics.  Heme/onc is on
   board
   - Dexamethasone, idarubacin, cytarabine as per heme onc

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and worsening hypoxia, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT, and CXR concerning for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate. The patient is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), thrombocytopenia, leukemia, hypoxemia, and fever of unknown origin. The patient's condition is complicated by underlying emphysema and a possible infiltrative leukemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory distress: The patient's worsening hypoxia and diffuse interstitial infiltrates on imaging suggest the possibility of ARDS. The patient's underlying emphysema may compound the current picture.
2. Infectious etiologies: Given the progression of symptoms despite broad-spectrum coverage, infectious causes such as viral or bacterial infections, including superimposed nosocomial infection, should be considered.
3. Infiltrative leukemia: The patient's clinical picture is also concerning for possible infiltrative leukemia.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient may have metabolic acidosis, possibly due to chronic respiratory alkalosis or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
6. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which could be due to various factors including"

   45 year old female presenting with new diagnosis of likely AML now with
   worsening hypoxia, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT, and
   CXR concerning for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress: Initially on CMV with tidal volumes
   around 500, PEEP 8 but had high RR (30s) with high minute vents.
   Changed to pressure support with high PEEP.  Currently meets ARDS
   criteria but given patient
s current comfort with high PEEP, will keep
   on PS vent until results of BAL rule out PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] with underlying
   emphysema compounding current picture.  Worsening CXR today.
   Differential includes infectious etiologies (viral/bacterial including
   superimposing nosocomial infection given that she is now day #6 of
   hospitalization).  Given progression despite broad spectrum coverage,
   infiltrative leukemia is also on differential.
   - diuresis with goal of -500 cc fluid balance
   - continue broad spectrum coverage including vanc, cefepime, levoflox,
   micafungin, metronidazole
   -continue tx dose of [**Name10 (NameIs) 5901**] for PCP pending results of BAL
   - f/u cultures
   - frequent ABGs
   - Chemotherapy per oncology
   - Nebs PRN
   .
   # Hypotension/low UOP:  Hypotension and low urine output in the setting
   of high PEEP.  Question if this is due to poor filling pressures from
   SVC/IVC compression.  Differential also includes hypovolemia from blood
   loss (although no clear e/o active bleeding), peripheral vasodilation
   from sepsis (although lactate nml).  Must also consider possible
   hemolysis or internal bleed with coagulopathy.  Receiving 2 units pRBCs
   now.
   -monitor BP, UOP after 2 units pRBCs
   -stool guaiac
   - monitor q6 DIC, TLS labs
   .
   # Fever: Currently meets SIRS criteria with temperature, HR, RR, and
   WBC.  Remains hemodynamically stable, cultures negative to date.
   Clinical picture is compounded leukemia which may be responsible for
   the above.  BAL today for more information about lung infiltrates.
   - f/u cultures
   - BAL today
   - continue antibiotics as above
   - chemotherapy per oncology
   - ATC tylenol for fever given tachycardia, increase in metabolic demand
   .
   # Leukemia: With likely AML, awaiting cytogenetics.  Heme/onc is on
   board
   - Dexamethasone, idarubacin, cytarabine as per heme onc
   - TLS, DIC labs q6 hours
   - monitor Hct and platelets and transfuse to goal of hct >21, plt> 10K
   - IVF with NS
   # Metabolic acidosis: likely [**2-12**] IV fluids or lactate, but can also be
   response to chronic respiratory alkalosis
   - check ABG
   - use lactated ringers instead of normal saline

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is now experiencing worsening hypoxia, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT, and CXR concerning for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate. The patient has been in the hospital for six days and has developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and an elevated D-dimer level.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.2°F, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 108/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 706 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory support is currently set to pressure support mode.

The patient's lab results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 21.5 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 17 K/uL, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 523 IU/L, elevated D-dimer level of 7578 ng/mL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 125 mg/dL. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) of 16.5 seconds, prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 31.4 seconds, and decreased fibrinogen level of 303 mg/dL. The patient's urine analysis reveals the presence of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), no nitrites, leukocytes, and two hyaline casts.

The patient's imaging studies show bilateral patchy infiltrates on the chest X-ray (CXR), which have improved compared to previous days. However, there is still concern for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate. The CT scan of the chest shows mild improvement of bilateral patchy infiltrates, with more clear left upper fields and visualization of the hemidiaphragms.

The patient's medical conditions include ARDS, acute leukemia, hypoxemia, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). The differential diagnosis includes infectious etiologies, such as viral or bacterial infections including nosocomial infection, and infiltrative leukemia. Other possible complications and medical conditions that can arise include sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury (AKI)."

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   PCP negative on BAL
   Attempt made to ventilate patient last night with ARDSnet protocol.
   Patient did not tolerate low tidal volumes and efforts to sedate her
   led to hypotension. Continues to pull very large tidal volumes on
   relatively small amounts of pressure support.
   Continues to be febrile.

   about using the low tidal volume strategy; still not clear that she has
   pathologic diffuse alveolar damage. Issue of leukemic infiltrates
   remains a possibility. Diffuse expiratory wheeze is new. By CVP does
   not appear to be volume overloaded. Will continue with bronchodilators.
   Have reduced FIO2 to 0.4 and PEEP to 10.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint includes acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, leukemia, and anemia. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to the acute respiratory failure.

The patient's medical history reveals that they have not tolerated low tidal volume ventilation strategy, pulling 1 L tidal volumes on pressure support ventilation (PSV) 5. There is an improvement seen in the chest X-ray, showing mild improvement in diffuse alveolar infiltrates. The patient is experiencing fever with unknown origin and has a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia, acute leukemia, hypoxemia, and anemia. The patient's renal function is also compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels.

The plan includes reducing FiO2 to 0.4 and PEEP to 10, monitoring urine output, providing fluids as needed, and continuing with bronchodilators. The patient's nutrition and glycemic control are being managed accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): ARDS is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. It can lead to respiratory failure if not promptly treated.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including fever and diffuse alveolar infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggest the presence of pneumonia. If left untreated, pneumonia can progress"

   TV 700ml, RR 22, PSV 7, PEEP 10, 40% FiO2, Minute Vent 15.1 L, PIP 38,
   Plateau 27.  Saturating in high 90s.  Pt has underlying emphysema
   compounding current picture.  CXR shows some improvement.  Differential
   includes infectious etiologies (viral/bacterial including superimposing
   nosocomial infection).  Given progression despite broad spectrum
   coverage, infiltrative leukemia is also on differential.
   - f/u results of BAL: galactomannan, cx, legionella
   - continue broad spectrum coverage including vanc, cefepime, levoflox,
   micafungin, metronidazole
   - f/u cultures
   - ABGs to assess oxygenation
   - Chemotherapy per oncology
   - continue nebulizers
   - maintain UOP>30cc/hr, bolus as needed
   .
   # Hypotension:  Resolving. Had hypotension in setting of increased
   sedation for ARDSnet protocol AC control.  Previous hypotension and low
   UOP was possibly due to poor filling pressures from SVC/IVC
   compression.  Differential also includes hypovolemia from blood loss
   (although no clear e/o active bleeding), peripheral vasodilation from
   sepsis (although lactate nml).  Must also consider possible hemolysis
   or internal bleed with coagulopathy.
   -monitor BP, UOP
   - stool guaiac
   - monitor q6 DIC, TLS labs:  fibrinogen 192 today, FDP 40-80
   .
   # Fever: Fever of 104.7 overnight.  Remains hemodynamically stable,
   cultures negative to date.  Clinical picture is compounded leukemia
   which may be responsible for the above.  Awaiting results of cultures
   from BAL, blood and urine.
   - recultured this AM
   - f/u cultures
   - continue antibiotics as above
   - chemotherapy per oncology
   - ATC tylenol for fever given tachycardia, increase in metabolic demand
   .
   # Increased Cr: improved from 1.3 to 0.8 today, likely secondary to
   chemo.  Doesn
t appear to be dry.  Will monitor Cr and changed levaquin
   dosage.  Also likely responsible for increased K as pt being
   supplemented with K per NG and is likely not metabolizing as well.
   - monitor Cr
   - monitor UOP, IVF bolus as needed to maintain >30cc/hr

","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is now experiencing worsening hypoxia, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT, and CXR concerning for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate. She has underlying emphysema compounding the current picture. The differential includes infectious etiologies (viral/bacterial including superimposing nosocomial infection), infiltrative leukemia, and other potential causes. 

The patient has been changed to SIMV with TV 700ml, RR 22, PSV 7, PEEP 10, 40% FiO2, Minute Vent 15.1 L, PIP 38, and Plateau 27. She is saturating in high 90s. The CXR shows some improvement. 

Broad spectrum coverage including Vanc, cefepime, levoflox, micafungin, and metronidazole has been continued, along with f/u results of BAL: galactomannan, cx, legionella. ABGs will be followed to assess oxygenation. Chemotherapy per oncology, nebulizers, and maintaining UOP >30cc/hr with bolus as needed are also planned. 

The patient's hypotension is resolving, possibly due to increased sedation for ARDSnet protocol AC control, poor filling pressures from SVC/IVC compression, hypovolemia from blood"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
- She is experiencing worsening hypoxia, fever, and diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT and CXR, which are concerning for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate.
- The patient has underlying emphysema, which may complicate the current picture.
- She was changed to SIMV with TV 700ml, RR 22, PSV 7, PEEP 10, 40% FiO2, Minute Vent 15.1 L, PIP 38, Plateau 27. She is saturating in high 90s.
- The patient's underlying conditions include acidosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leukemia, hypoxemia, and fever of unknown origin (FUO).
- The patient has received broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage including vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, metronidazole, and micafungin.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 104.7 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 125/52 to 132/58 mmHg, heart rate between 81 and 124 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

   today and switch to PSV tonight for possible extubation tomorrow.
   BUN/Creat elevated and CVP is low. Will stop D5W with sodium
   bicarbonate (patient now hypernatremic) and use lactated Ringers for
   volume replacement.
   Persistent fevers despite other improvement. Some concern about drug
   fever at this time. Cultures from lines are all negative. Will consult
   ID service.
   Hct not at transfusion threshold. No significant bleeding.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on SIMV (synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation) and has shown improvement in respiratory status. However, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury, and pneumonia.

2. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers despite other improvements. This may indicate an ongoing infection or drug fever. Further evaluation is required to determine the cause of the fever.

3. Leukemia: The patient has been diagnosed with acute leukemia (ALL or AML). Proper management and treatment are necessary to address this condition.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient is hypernatremic, which means their sodium levels are elevated. This can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Corrective measures should be taken to address this issue.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute thrombocytopenia, which is characterized by a low platelet count. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications. Monitoring and appropriate interventions are needed to manage this condition.

6. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which can be a result of various underlying conditions. Close monitoring and treatment are essential to correct the acid-base imbalance.

7. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but the type and severity are not"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently experiencing worsening hypoxia, fever, and diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT and CXR. The patient has underlying emphysema, which is compounding the current picture. The differential includes infectious etiologies (viral/bacterial including superimposing nosocomial infection) and infiltrative leukemia. 

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum coverage including vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, micafungin, and metronidazole. The plan is to follow up with results of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), culture, and consult oncology for chemotherapy. The patient's hypotension is resolving, and there is a concern for possible hemolysis or internal bleed with coagulopathy. 

The patient's increased creatinine level has improved from 1.3 to 0.8 today, likely secondary to chemotherapy. There is ongoing concern for fever of unknown origin, and the patient remains hemodynamically stable with negative cultures to date. 

The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to a response to chronic respiratory alkalosis, and lactated ringers should be used instead of normal saline. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and stool culture should be done to check for Clostridium difficile.

Overall, the potential medical complications that"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presenting with worsening hypoxia, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT, and CXR concerning for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate. She has underlying emphysema and is currently intubated in the ICU. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics due to febrile neutropenia, but her fever persists. She also has metabolic acidosis, hypotension, anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and suspected leukemia. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory distress: The patient's worsening hypoxia indicates a potential complication of ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Sepsis: The persistent fever and diffuse interstitial infiltrates on imaging raise concerns for a nosocomial infection or superimposed infection on top of leukemia. This could lead to sepsis and septic shock if not promptly treated.
3. Leukemic infiltration of the lungs: Given the patient's recent diagnosis of AML, there is a possibility of leukemic cells infiltrating the lungs, contributing to the respiratory distress and hypoxia.
4. Pleural effusion: The CXR shows bibasilar h"

   underlying emphysema compounding current picture.  CXR shows some
   improvement.  Differential includes infectious etiologies
   (viral/bacterial including superimposing nosocomial infection).  Given
   progression despite broad spectrum coverage, infiltrative leukemia is
   also on differential.
   - changed RR to 17
   - f/u results of BAL: galactomannan, cx, legionella
   - continue broad spectrum coverage including vanc, cefepime, levoflox,
   micafungin, metronidazole
   - f/u cultures, new surveillance cultures for GPC on BCx
   - ABGs to assess oxygenation
   - Chemotherapy per oncology
   - continue nebulizers

   - pressure control trial tonight for possible extubation tomorrow
   morning
   .
   # Hypotension:  Resolving. Had hypotension in setting of increased
   sedation for ARDSnet protocol AC control.  Previous hypotension and low
   UOP was possibly due to poor filling pressures from SVC/IVC
   compression.  Differential also includes hypovolemia from blood loss
   (although no clear e/o active bleeding), peripheral vasodilation from
   sepsis (although lactate nml).  Must also consider possible hemolysis
   or internal bleed with coagulopathy.
   - monitor BP, UOP
   - monitor q6 DIC, TLS labs:  fibrinogen 147 today, FDP 40-80, give cryo
   if fibrinogen is less than 100

   # Fever: Fever of 104.1 overnight.  Remains hemodynamically stable.
   Clinical picture is compounded leukemia which may be responsible for
   the above.   BCx showed GPC.
   - recultured this AM
   - f/u cultures
   - continue antibiotics as above
   - chemotherapy per oncology
   - ATC tylenol for fever given tachycardia, increase in metabolic demand

   # Increased Cr: resolved, Cr 0.5 today.  Received 2L free water
   yesterday.
   - monitor Cr
   - monitor UOP, IVF bolus as needed to maintain >30cc/hr

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is experiencing worsening hypoxia, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT and CXR, and concern for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate. The patient has underlying emphysema, which may complicate the current picture. The differential includes infectious etiologies (viral/bacterial including superimposing nosocomial infection) and infiltrative leukemia.

The patient's respiratory distress has been managed with SIMV overnight with TV 700ml, RR 22, PSV 7, PEEP 10, 40% FiO2, minute vent 15.1 L, PIP 38, Plateau 27. The patient is saturated in the high 90s, and PaCO2 is 29 this morning. CXR shows some improvement. The patient is also on broad-spectrum coverage including vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, micafungin, and metronidazole. Additional tests such as BAL for galactomannan, CX, and Legionella will be followed up on.

The patient's hypotension is resolving and may be due to increased sedation for ARDSnet protocol AC control or poor filling pressures from SVC/IVC compression. Other differentials include hypovolemia from blood loss, peripheral"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and presents with several medical complications. The summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU includes:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by severe shortness of breath, low oxygen levels, and difficulty breathing. This condition requires immediate medical intervention and respiratory support.

2. Anemia: The patient has anemia, specifically other anemia, which means that the cause of the anemia is not specified. Anemia is a condition characterized by a decrease in the number of red blood cells or a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin in the blood, leading to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity.

3. Leukemia: The patient has acute leukemia, specifically acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, resulting in the overproduction of abnormal white blood cells.

4. Fever: The patient has a fever, with a maximum temperature of 104.1°F (40°C) recorded. Fever is an elevated body temperature that can be a sign of infection or inflammation.

5. Hypertension with bradycardia: The patient developed hypertension (high blood pressure) and bradycardia (slow heart rate). This combination of symptoms may indicate a disturbance in the autonomic nervous system.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient has high"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presenting with hypoxia, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT, and CXR concerning for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient was switched to airway control (AC) overnight, which resulted in increased saturations and comfort. The patient has underlying emphysema, which complicates the current picture. The CXR shows little improvement. The differential includes infectious etiologies (viral/bacterial including superimposing nosocomial infection) and infiltrative leukemia. 

Recommendations include:
- Continue airway control
- Follow up results of BAL: galactomannan, cx, legionella
- Discontinue micafungin per ID recommendations
- Continue broad spectrum coverage including vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, metronidazole
- Follow up cultures, new surveillance cultures for GPC on BCx
- ABGs to assess oxygenation
- Continue nebulizers
- Maintain UOP >30cc/hr, bolus as needed

","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who presents with continued hypoxia, fever, and diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT scan, concerning for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate. She has worsening respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is now on assisted ventilation with increased saturations and comfort. The differential includes infectious etiologies (viral/bacterial including superimposing nosocomial infection) vs pulmonary edema as the patient appears volume overloaded on exam. Given the progression despite broad-spectrum coverage, infiltrative leukemia is also on the differential.

The patient has a small cerebellar lesion, which may be an infarct, and is currently unable to perform a neuro exam. Repeat CT head today to ensure it is not growing.

The patient's fever remains hemodynamically stable, and clinical picture is confounded by leukemia, which may be responsible for the above. New blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum culture are pending.

The patient has metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to bicarbonate administration as part of tumor lysis protocol, but per NSG, it is not part of onc protocol. Will d/w Oncology re: need for bicarb.

   CXR: Improvement of interstitial edema, bilat hemidiaphragms better
   visualized, ET tube a little high, needs to be advanced 2 cm
   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female presenting with new diagnosis of likely AML now with
   continued hypoxia, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT, and
   CXR concerning for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory distress: Continues on AC.  Pulmonary edema
   improved on CXR with good oxygenation on PEEP 10 and FiO2 0.4.
   Differential includes infectious etiologies (viral/bacterial including
   superimposing nosocomial infection) vs pulm edema as pt appears volume
   overloaded on exam.  Given progression despite broad spectrum coverage,
   infiltrative leukemia is also on differential.
   -Continue AC with ABGs to assess oxygenation
   - decrease PEEP to 8 and decrease rate to see how she does; then try to
   decrease PEEP to 5 with new ABG
   - Lasix 40mg IV x1 with goal even/-500 cc
   - f/u results of BAL: galactomannan, cx, legionella
   - d/c
d micafungin per ID recs
   - continue broad spectrum coverage including vanc, cefepime, levoflox,
   metronidazole
   - f/u BCx
   - continue nebulizers
   .
   # L cerebellar lesion
 Repeat CT showed small lesion calling acute
   infarct. No acute hemorrhage. Unable to perform neuro exam.
   -radiology and heme/onc suggesting MRI/MRA but will hold for now as
   will not change management
   -Echo to eval for endocarditis as source
   -neurology consult
   .
   # Fever: Spiked to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday.  Remains hemodynamically stable.
   Clinical picture is confounded by leukemia which may be responsible for
   the above.
   - f/u cultures
   -New BCx, Ucx, Sputum Cx for 102 temp spike
   - continue antibiotics as above
   - chemotherapy per oncology
   - ATC tylenol for fever, cooling blankets given tachycardia, increase
   in metabolic demand
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis
 Pt received bicarb as part of tumor lysis
   protocol per Oncology but was d/c yesterday as pt is past tumor lysis
   stage (tumor has been lysed).  [**Month (only) 11**] have component of contraction
   alkalosis as well given great response (8.8L of UOP) to lasix
   yesterday.
   .
   # Leukemia: With likely AML- cytogenetics completed.  Heme/onc is
   following.
   - continue dexamethasone, idarubacin, cytarabine as per heme onc
   -Continue q12h CBC/aPTT/INR/Fibrinogen; can stop checking FDP, D-dimer,
   uric acid as pt is past tumor lysis stage
   -received vitamin K 5mg PO for elevated INR (1.7), nl aPTT
   -if INR continues to rise, give FFP
   -If fibrinogen <100, give cryoprecipitate
   - monitor Hct and platelets and transfuse to goal of hct >21, plt> 20K
   .
   # Constipation
BMs yesterday, now off lactulose
   - continue bowel regimen

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and presenting with hypoxia, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT, and concerns for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate. 

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with PEEP at 10 and FiO2 at 0.4. The differential diagnosis includes infectious etiologies (viral/bacterial including superimposing nosocomial infection) versus pulmonary edema, given the appearance of volume overload on examination. Infiltrative leukemia is also on the differential.

The plan is to continue aggressive care with ABGs to assess oxygenation, decrease PEEP to 8 and rate to see how the patient responds, then attempt to decrease PEEP to 5 with new ABG. Lasix 40mg IV is given to reduce fluid overload. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are continued, including vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. Blood cultures are also being followed up.

Additionally, there is a concern for a cerebellar lesion that was identified on CT scan, which showed a small lesion consistent with an acute infarct without any acute hemorrhage. An MRI/MRA is suggested by radiology and heme/onc, but it will be held for now as it will not change management. An echo is also ordered to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presenting with hypoxia, fever, and diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT and CXR, concerning for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate. The patient has underlying emphysema, which complicates the current picture. The differential includes infectious etiologies (viral/bacterial including superimposing nosocomial infection) vs pulmonary edema as the patient appears volume overloaded on exam. Given the progression despite broad-spectrum coverage, infiltrative leukemia is also on the differential.

The patient's vital signs show a fever ranging from 99-102 degrees Fahrenheit, tachycardia, and stable blood pressure. The patient's oxygen saturation is at 96% while on ventilatory support. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for noted below.

The patient has received multiple transfusions and infusions, including blood products, Lasix, micafungin, levofloxacin, vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, fentanyl, midazolam, and Lasix.

The patient's lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.3 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 15 K/uL, elevated white blood cell count of 25 K/uL, and elevated lactate acid level"

   Oxygenation improved with diuresis. Would keep fluid balance even to
   0.5 L negative today. Will decrease PEEP to 8; if sats are stable,
   reduce futher to 5 cm H2O. If patient's oxygenation remains stable,
   consider trial on PSV.
   Repeat CT suggests that there is a cerebellar infarct. Will get an echo
   to assess for clot and vegetation on valve and PFO for paradoxical
   embolism. Will likely need TEE if TTE negative. Neuro to be consulted.
   Hct remains low. Will need additional transfusions today.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female presenting with new diagnosis of likely AML now with
   continued hypoxia, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT, and
   CXR concerning for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory distress: Continues on AC.  Pulmonary edema
   improved on CXR with good oxygenation on PEEP 10 and FiO2 0.4.
   Differential includes infectious etiologies (viral/bacterial including
   superimposing nosocomial infection) vs pulm edema as pt appears volume
   overloaded on exam.  Given progression despite broad spectrum coverage,
   infiltrative leukemia is also on differential.
   -Continue AC with ABGs to assess oxygenation
   - decrease PEEP to 8 and decrease rate to see how she does; then try to
   decrease PEEP to 5 with new ABG
   - Lasix 40mg IV x1 with goal even/-500 cc
   - f/u results of BAL: galactomannan, cx, legionella
   - d/c
d micafungin per ID recs
   - continue broad spectrum coverage including vanc, cefepime, levoflox,
   metronidazole
   - f/u BCx
   - continue nebulizers
   .
   # L cerebellar lesion
 Repeat CT showed small lesion calling acute
   infarct. No acute hemorrhage. Unable to perform neuro exam.
   -radiology and heme/onc suggesting MRI/MRA but will hold for now as
   will not change management
   -Echo to eval for endocarditis as source
   -neurology consult
   .
   # Fever: Spiked to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday.  Remains hemodynamically stable.
   Clinical picture is confounded by leukemia which may be responsible for
   the above.
   - f/u cultures
   -New BCx, Ucx, Sputum Cx for 102 temp spike
   - continue antibiotics as above
   - chemotherapy per oncology
   - ATC tylenol for fever, cooling blankets given tachycardia, increase
   in metabolic demand
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis
 Pt received bicarb as part of tumor lysis
   protocol per Oncology but was d/c yesterday as pt is past tumor lysis
   stage (tumor has been lysed).  [**Month (only) 11**] have component of contraction
   alkalosis as well given great response (8.8L of UOP) to lasix
   yesterday.
   .
   # Leukemia: With likely AML- cytogenetics completed.  Heme/onc is
   following.
   - continue dexamethasone, idarubacin, cytarabine as per heme onc
   -Continue q12h CBC/aPTT/INR/Fibrinogen; can stop checking FDP, D-dimer,
   uric acid as pt is past tumor lysis stage
   -received vitamin K 5mg PO for elevated INR (1.7), nl aPTT
   -if INR continues to rise, give FFP
   -If fibrinogen <100, give cryoprecipitate
   - monitor Hct and platelets and transfuse to goal of hct >21, plt> 20K

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient presents with continued hypoxia, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT, and CXR concerning for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate. The differential includes infectious etiologies (viral/bacterial including superimposing nosocomial infection) vs pulmonary edema as the patient appears volume overloaded on exam. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 86/30 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 40%. 

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. Lasix has been given to address fluid overload. Blood cultures, sputum cultures, and other tests are pending.

The patient also has a small cerebellar lesion consistent with an acute infarct, but no acute hemorrhage. An echocardiogram is planned to evaluate for endocarditis as a potential source of the embolic cerebellar lesion. 

Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with leukemia, and cytogenetics are completed. The patient is receiving chemotherapy as per oncology recommendations. 

The patient's metabolic alkalosis is attributed to bicarbonate administration as part of the tumor lysis protocol, which has been discontinued. 

Overall, the patient's main concerns include hypoxic respiratory distress, potential infectious etiologies, pulmonary edema, cerebellar lesion, fever, and leukemia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presenting with hypoxia, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT, and CXR concerning for pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate. The patient is currently intubated and receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with minimal oxygenation requirements and good minute ventilations. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note are as follows:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's continued hypoxia indicates ongoing respiratory distress, which may require further interventions such as tracheostomy or mechanical ventilation.

2. Infection: The presence of fever and diffuse interstitial infiltrates suggests a possible infectious etiology. Broad spectrum antibiotics have already been initiated, but the patient may require additional or alternative antibiotics if the infection persists or worsens.

3. Pleural effusion: The CXR findings suggest the possibility of a pleural effusion, which can impair lung expansion and compromise oxygenation. Further evaluation with thoracentesis or repeat imaging may be necessary.

4. Alveolar infiltrate: The alveolar infiltrate seen on the CT scan could indicate pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Additional diagnostic tests such as bronchoscopy and BAL analysis may be needed to determine the exact cause and guide treatment.

5. Leukemia-related complications: Given the new diagnosis of AML, the patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. The chief complaint includes respiratory failure, pneumonia, leukemia, pancytopenia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. They have received transfusions of red blood cells and platelets. The patient's blood pressure has been low and resistant to fluids, necessitating the use of levophed. Oxygenation remains good on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient has a fever and is on multiple antibiotics. They are sedated and unable to provide a history. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever. Vital signs include a temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 122/47 mmHg, heart rate of 56 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on PSV. The patient's weight has increased since admission. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are ongoing. The patient's extremities are warm and without edema or cyanosis. Neurological assessment shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented, and purposeful movements. Laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leukemia, hypoxemia, and fever of unknown origin. The assessment and plan include addressing acidosis, anemia, thromboc"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and various medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient continues to experience hypoxia despite being on CPAP/PS. This could indicate a worsening of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary edema, or an infectious etiology.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which increases the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage. Close monitoring and timely intervention may be necessary to prevent complications related to bleeding.

3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient is showing signs of metabolic acidosis, which can be caused by various factors such as poor tissue perfusion, sepsis, or respiratory failure. Monitoring and correcting electrolyte imbalances and acid-base status will be important.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and inadequate tissue perfusion. Blood transfusions may be required to maintain adequate oxygenation and hemodynamic stability.

5. Leukemia: The patient has a diagnosis of likely AML. Complications related to leukemia can include bone marrow suppression, increased risk of infections, bleeding, and organ dysfunction.

6. Fever, unknown origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. This"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently in the ICU. She has been experiencing hypoxia, fever, and diffuse interstitial infiltrates on CT and CXR, suggesting a possible pleural effusion and alveolar infiltrate. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PS with minimal oxygenation requirements. The differential diagnosis includes infectious etiologies, pulmonary edema, and infiltrative leukemia. The patient's medical history includes a cerebellar infarct, leukemia, and a positive Galactomannan test indicating aspergillus infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxia, fever, and diffuse interstitial infiltrates on imaging raise concern for ARDS. This condition can lead to severe respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and positive cultures suggest an ongoing infection, which could progress to sepsis. Early recognition and aggressive management are crucial to prevent further complications.
3. Bleeding: The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 11K/UL, increasing the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions, such as platelet transfusions, should be considered.
4. Thromboembolic events: Due to immobilization and the presence of central lines, the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She presented with hypoxic respiratory distress but responded well to synchronized breaths and non-invasive ventilation. The patient tolerated pressure support well and was placed on assist-control ventilation (AC) with FiO2 40% and PEEP 5 overnight. The goal is to extubate her on [**8-22**] after readiness is confirmed by respiratory therapy. Transesophageal echo was performed at [**2153-8-21**] 12:32 PM. 

The patient has a cerebellar infarct seen on CT scan, but no source or thrombus was seen on CTA head and neck. Her leukemia cytogenetics have been completed, and she will be followed by hematology/oncology. Broad-spectrum coverage will continue, along with monitoring of CBC, Hct, and platelets. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is at risk for ARDS due to hypoxic respiratory distress and requires careful monitoring and management.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive beta-galactomannan, suggesting a possible aspergillus infection. Blood galactomannan is pending, and a CT chest will be done to evaluate for aspergillus. Voriconazole should be continued, and the patient should be"

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She has been admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory distress, which has improved with supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She is also being treated for a suspected aspergillus infection, as indicated by a positive galactomannan test, but blood cultures have not grown the organism. The patient also has a cerebellar lesion, and imaging studies are pending to further evaluate the cause. She is at high risk for infections due to neutropenia and requires broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's laboratory results show thrombocytopenia and anemia. Her vital signs are stable, but she requires ongoing monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential medical complications:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxic respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation indicate a possible development of ARDS. This condition is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange.

2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to neutropenia puts her at a higher risk for infections. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being monitored closely for any signs of infection.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of platelet levels and appropriate transfusion if necessary is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed pneumonia, which could worsen and lead to further respiratory complications.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient has low blood counts across all cell lines (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets). This condition, known as pancytopenia, can increase the risk of infection, anemia, and bleeding.

4. Leukemia: The patient has been diagnosed with acute leukemia, which is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. This can lead to further complications related to bone marrow function.

5. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA): The patient has a CNS lesion, suggesting a possible stroke or other neurological event. This could result in neurological deficits or long-term disability.

6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient initially had metabolic acidosis, which can be a sign of poor tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute thrombocytopenia, indicating a low platelet count. This increases the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.

8. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient's hypoxia has improved, and she is maintaining good oxygen saturation on 2 liters of nasal cannula with slight shortness of breath when using the commode. She continues to receive nebulizers for wheezing and is being weaned off oxygen as tolerated.

The patient has a positive galactomannan test, which is concerning for aspergillus infection. However, her blood galactomannan results are pending. The patient will continue on voriconazole and a CT chest will be deferred at this time.

An L cerebellar infarct was seen on CT, but no source or thrombus was found on a CT angiography of the head and neck. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was negative for vegetations. An MRI/MRA will be done today to further evaluate the cerebellar lesion.

The patient also has leukemia with likely AML, and cytogenetics have been completed. The hematology/oncology team is following up with the patient. The patient is at high risk for infection due to neutropenia, and broad-spectrum coverage will be continued. Frequent blood counts will be monitored, and the patient will be transfused to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) greater than 21%"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), metabolic acidosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypoxemia, and fever of unknown origin. Her condition has improved with diuresis and oxygen therapy. She is currently extubated and maintaining good oxygen saturation on 2 liters nasal cannula. A brain MRI showed a concerning mass rather than infarct. She has a positive galactomannan result, indicating a possible aspergillus infection, but her BAL culture did not grow aspergillus. She is being treated with voriconazole and will continue it regardless of CT chest findings. Her leukemia is being managed by hematology/oncology, and she is at high risk for infection due to neutropenia. She will be followed by hematology/oncology and will have a lumbar puncture to evaluate for leukemic infiltration to the brain. Her ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's disposition will be determined after further consultation and evaluation."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, leukemia, pancytopenia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient was extubated yesterday and has been stable overnight. An MRI this morning suggests a possible mass rather than CVA.

The patient has a history of allergies to no known drugs and has received antibiotics such as voriconazole, cefipime, and vancomycin. The patient is currently on ICU medications including protonix and insulin.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 159/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is 77.7 kg, and height is 62 inches.

The physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress, overweight, and thin. The patient has pale conjunctiva but no scleral edema, normocephalic head, no poor dentition, no endotracheal or NG tube, normal heart sounds with no murmurs, and symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds. The patient has soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin without rash or jaundice, attentive and oriented neurologic examination, and no muscle wasting.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who presented with improved hypoxia. She has an ineffective coping mechanism, anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute leukemia, fever of unknown origin, and a ring-enhancing lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere. The lesion could be due to infection or a mass, and further tests are pending to confirm the diagnosis. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal treatment with voriconazole. She also requires close monitoring for infections due to neutropenia and will need frequent blood transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to AML and neutropenia increases the risk of infections. There is a need for continued broad-spectrum coverage and close monitoring for signs of infection.
2. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) puts her at risk for bleeding complications. Close monitoring of platelet levels and transfusion to maintain a goal of >20K is necessary.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient initially presented with hypoxia but has shown improvement. Continued use of nebulizers as needed and weaning off supplemental oxygen may be necessary.
4. Neurological complications: The ring-enhancing lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere needs further evaluation to determine if it is due to an infection or a mass"

","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a new diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). She presents with hypoxia, which has improved, and a left cerebellar lesion that is concerning for mass or infection. The MRI results show a ring-enhancing lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere with small foci of low intensity on susceptibility and surrounding edema. The differential diagnosis includes fungal disease such as Aspergillosis, abscess, lymphoma, or solitary metastasis.

The patient's lab results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated white blood cell count. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, but she has an elevated D-dimer level. The CSF analysis shows elevated protein and glucose levels, with no significant findings in terms of white blood cell count or presence of microorganisms.

The patient has been treated with various medications including voriconazole, cefepime, vancomycin, and lorazepam. She has received a blood transfusion and platelet transfusion to address her anemia and thrombocytopenia.

The assessment and plan include ineffective coping, anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute leukemia, fever of unknown origin, and hypoxia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61.5 kg individual who presented with respiratory failure, pancytopenia, leukemia, and a CNS mass. They underwent platelet transfusion and lumbar puncture, which showed no WBCs. An MRI revealed a cerebellar, ring-enhancing mass. The patient's respiratory status is stable post-extubation, and they have been ambulating as tolerated with small amounts of supplemental oxygen. 

24-hour events include magnetic resonance imaging of the head and lumbar puncture. The patient's allergies are not known, and their last doses of antibiotics were Voriconazole on 08/23/2153 at 06:23 AM, Vancomycin on 08/24/2153 at 09:07 AM, and Cefepime on 08/24/2153 at 09:07 AM. 

Infusions include Lorazepam (Ativan) on 08/23/2153 at 05:50 PM, and other medications are unchanged from admission except as noted above. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Flow sheet data shows vital signs within normal ranges, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and oxygen delivery device. 

Physical examination reveals the patient to be well-nourished, overweight, and not in acute distress. Eyes, head, ears, nose, throat, cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, respiratory/chest, abdominal, extremities, mus"
