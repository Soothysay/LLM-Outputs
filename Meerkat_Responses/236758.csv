   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD, anoxic brain injury after
   asystolic cardiac arrest, currently ventilator dependent, presents from
   [**Hospital3 **] with bradycardia, hypotension and hyperkalemia.
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt was initially hypotensive in the ED with BP of
   70/30's.  Pt with known systolic CHF, with EF ~ 30%.  However, BP
   improved after receiving atropine and treatment for his hyperkalemia
   while in the ED up to 120's. BP on arrival to CCU 92/43, HR 53.  Pt is
   s/p ~3L IVF in ED.  Possible that hypotension is related to
   distributive shock physiology given fever in ED, or related to on-going
   bradycardia/junctional rhythm.
   - Hold Carvedilol
   - Hold Lasix
   - Goal MAP >55
   .
   # Bradycardia:  The patient was noted to be bradycardic in the ED tp
   the 40's on arrival.  12-lead EKG showed slow atrial fib vs. a
   junctional rhythm, however his bradycardia improved after treatment of
   his hyperkalemia.  The etiology of this patient's bradycardia is likely
   related to his metabolic derangements in the setting of conduction
   system disease, or an active infection as the patient did spike a fever
   to 102 on arrival.  A temporary pacer was considered but felt to be not
   ideal for this patient at this time given his fevers and likely
   infection.
   - Hold Carvedilol for now
   - EP consult in AM to evaluate for possible PPM placement
   - Pacer pads in place as needed
   - Atropine prn
   .
   # Fevers: Up to 102 in ED. Lactate of 2.3.  UA with mod leuks, several
   WBCs, and many bacteria, with possible source of infection being
   urine.  CXR on [**4-30**] at [**Hospital3 **] suspicious for LLL infiltrate
   and patient was started on Vanc 1gm IV daily on [**5-1**] for MRSA positive
   sputum.
   - Continue empiric ABx coverage for now with Vanc/Zosyn until better
   idea of source given hypotension in ED
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u Blood, Urine cultures
   - pt with no indwelling lines on admission; dirty fem line placed in ED
   to be pulled
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: s/p Kayexalate, IVF and calcium gluconate in ED. Repeat
   K still 5.5, treat as needed w/Kayexalate and insulin, d50, and calcium
   gluconate. Elevated K+ may be related to rising creatnine and worsening
   renal function.
   - f/u K+
   - Kayexalate PRN
   .
   # Type II Resp Failure: Patient is ventilatory dependent, likely due to
   his poor neurologic status. Tracheostomy in place, and patient
   comfortable on CIMV.
   - Continue vent
   - Wean O2 to 40% if possible today
   .
   # CKD: Cr 2.3 on admission within range of prior renal function.
   However, pt with rising Cr (was 1.0 at [**Hospital3 **] several days
   ago), and although Cr within range of previous Creatinines here, pt may
   be in ARF.  BUN noted to be elevated to 160 on admission labs, elevated
   out of proportion to Creatinine.
   - monitor Cr after IVF
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR:  Patient on coumadin for history of St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 1930**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as well as AFib with INR on admission of 5.6 and PTT of 65.5.  INR
   was 2.0 on [**4-26**] at [**Hospital3 **].  Hct of 25 on admission within
   range of prior Hct's/anemia with no signs of active bleeding other than
   hematuria.
   - Hold coumadin
   - 2mg oral Vitamin K for now
   - FFP if more signs of active bleeding, though not ideal given
   patient's history of CHF and [**Hospital3 **]
   - Follow INR closely with goal 2.5-3.5
   .
   # Hematuria: Supratherapeutic INR on admission as above. Possible
   traumatic foley placement given history of difficult foley placement in
   the past.
   - [**Hospital3 227**] if hematuria continues
   - Reversal of supratherapeutic INR as above
   .
   # CAD: Troponin 0.15 in ED, CK-MB 3. EKG with no ischemic changes.
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: Patient previously on Keppra but no longer on
   anti-epileptic medication while at [**Hospital1 997**].
   - Monitor off anti-epileptics
   .
   # DM2:
   - Lantus, Lispro insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now in case of EP procedure
   # ACCESS: RIJ
   # PROPHYLAXIS: Pneumoboots; hold on SQ Heparin for now given
   supratherapeutic INR
   # CODE: Full.
   # COMMUNICATION: [**Doctor First Name **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7956**]; unable to be reached from ED.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury following asystolic cardiac arrest. The patient is currently ventilator dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. 

1. Hypotension: The patient initially had a low blood pressure of 70/30's, which improved after receiving atropine and treatment for hyperkalemia. The current blood pressure is 92/43, and the goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) is set at >55. It is possible that hypotension is related to distributive shock physiology or ongoing bradycardia/junctional rhythm. Carvedilol has been held, and an electrophysiologist (EP) consult has been scheduled to evaluate for possible pacemaker placement.

2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia improved after treatment of hyperkalemia, but he remains bradycardic in the intensive care unit (ICU). The etiology of this patient's bradycardia is likely related to metabolic derangements or conduction system disease. Atropine has been administered as needed, and EP consult has been arranged for possible permanent pacemaker placement.

3. Fevers: The patient had a fever of up to 102 degrees Fahrenheit in the emergency department (ED). L"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest, and currently ventilator dependent. The patient presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has possible bacteremia with elevated white blood cell count. Possible etiologies include the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, or genitourinary system.

2. Hypotension: The patient required fluid bolus overnight and likely hypotension is related to infection. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure to maintain adequate perfusion.

3. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient has elevated LFTs, which may be related to transient cholangitis, hepatic congestion, or shock liver. Antibiotics should be continued as per above plan, and further evaluation of liver function is needed.

4. Bradycardia: The patient has sinus bradycardia, and the cause is not clear from the provided information. Hold carvedilol for now, and pacer pads should be in place as needed. Atropine should be administered as needed.

5. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, likely due to renal dysfunction. Potassium levels should be followed up, and Kayexalate should be administered"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest, and currently dependent on a ventilator. He presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient has multiple medical complications including bacteremia, hypotension, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), bradycardia, hyperkalemia, type II respiratory failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD), supratherapeutic INR, hematuria, coronary artery disease (CAD), seizure disorder, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has possible bacteremia, which could be caused by lung, gastrointestinal (GI), or genitourinary (GU) infections. Further evaluation and treatment are needed.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to infection. Fluid bolus has already been given, and it is important to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55.

3. Elevated LFTs: The elevated liver function tests may be related to transient cholangitis, hepatic congestion, or shock liver. Antibiotics have been continued as per above, and further follow-up is necessary.

   [**Hospital3 **] with bradycardia, hypotension and hyperkalemia.
   .
   # Bacteremia: Likely sources still include cholangitis and uti.
   Currently growing gram neg rods in blood and proteus in urine. Last
   time he grew proteus in urine it was not ESBL. Per his long term care
   facility there was MRSA in sputum which we were thinking was a
   colonizer.

   # Hypothermia: nl thyroid fct. Will check [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 402**] stim today
   .
   # Hypotension:Pressure have remained stable..
   - Holding Carvedilol
   - Holding Lasix
   - Goal MAP >55
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Obstructive picture given elevated alk phos.
   Obstructive could be from stones or biliary sludge. If WBC ct cont to
   rise on ABX would need to cont work-up of biliary obstruction.
   - cont to trend LFTs

   # CKD: No e/o obstruction on renal u/s.  Most likely ATN [**1-2**]
   hypotension and subsequent ischemia.
   - check urine lytes and eos
   - monitor Cr after IVF
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR:  INR trending down, now 3.3.

   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:

   Medical Decision Making
   Nothing to add
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health
   care proxy.
   DNR status discussed. Other.
   Total time spent on patient care: 80 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Intubated, sepsis, obstructive jaundice, ...
   We have a long family meeting with family and family Rabi.  It was made
   clear that any quality of life should be maintained at any cost.
   However, I indicated that if cardiac arrest occurs with no chance of
   recovery of cardiac function (standstill, PEA, ), than we may not
   institute CPR if chance of restoring rhythm is not there.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 946**] [**Name (NI) **],MD

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed:

1. Bacteremia: The patient is likely to have bacteremia, with potential sources including cholangitis and urinary tract infection (UTI). He is currently growing gram-negative rods in his blood and Proteus in his urine. It is important to continue with the antibiotic Zosyn and resend sputum for culture. The sensitivity results should be followed, and fever curves should be monitored.

2. Hypothermia: The patient's thyroid function is normal, so the hypothermia may be due to another cause. It would be helpful to check the patient's initial thyroid stimulation today.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains stable. Holding Carvedilol and Lasix is recommended, with the goal of maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 mmHg.

4. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The elevated LFTs indicate an obstructive pattern, possibly caused by gallstones or biliary sludge. If the patient's white blood cell count (WBC) continues to rise despite antibiotic treatment, further investigation for biliary obstruction is needed."

","Summary:
- The patient is a 90-year-old man with multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral artery disease, and anoxic brain injury.
- He presented with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.
- He is currently ventilator-dependent and has a history of cardiac arrest.
- The patient has grown gram-negative rods in his blood and Proteus in his urine.
- He has sacral decub ulcers, heel ulcers, and muscle wasting.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 108/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, liver enzymes, and troponin T levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient is likely experiencing bacteremia due to the presence of gram-negative rods in his blood. This increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock.
2. Cholangitis: The patient has a history of gallstones without evidence of biliary ductal dilatation. Cholangitis, an infection of the bile ducts, may develop if there is an obstruction caused by the gallstones.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The growth of Proteus in the patient's urine"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral artery disease, and anoxic brain injury after asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:

1. Bacteremia: The patient is likely to have bacteremia due to the presence of gram-negative rods in the blood and proteus in the urine. This could lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.

2. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature was recorded at 94.9°F (30.5°C) at 2 pm, which indicates hypothermia. It is important to address this issue promptly to prevent further complications.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating ongoing hypotension. This could lead to organ dysfunction and poor perfusion if not managed appropriately.

4. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are elevated, suggesting possible liver dysfunction. This could be due to obstructive jaundice caused by gallstones or biliary sludge.

5. Bradycardia: The patient has persistent bradycardia, which may require intervention such as the use of atropine or a pacemaker.

6. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's elevated creat"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Bacteremia: The patient is likely to have bacteremia due to the presence of gram-negative rods in the blood and proteus in the urine. This indicates a possible infection.

2. Cholangitis: The patient has gallstones without evidence of biliary ductal dilatation. This could lead to cholangitis if there is an obstruction in the bile duct.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The growth of proteus in the urine suggests a UTI.

4. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature has been consistently below normal levels, indicating hypothermia.

5. Bradycardia: The patient has a slow heart rate, which is known as bradycardia. It is necessary to monitor and manage this condition.

6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may indicate hypotension. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55.

7. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are elevated, suggesting liver dysfunction. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.

8. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has signs of CKD, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and urine output. The cause of CKD may be acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hyp"

","The patient is a 24-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury after a cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient has a history of bacteremia, hypothermia, hypotension, elevated liver function tests, bradycardia, chronic kidney disease, supratherapeutic INR, hematuria, coronary artery disease, type II respiratory failure, seizure disorder, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Bacteremia: The patient is likely to have bacteremia with gram-negative rods and proteus in the blood and urine, respectively. This can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not properly managed.
2. Hypothermia: The patient may develop hypothermia due to poor thyroid function and lack of shivering response.
3. Hypotension: The patient's pressure has remained stable, but there is a concern for ongoing hypotension, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure.
4. Elevated liver function tests: The elevated liver function tests indicate an obstructive picture, possibly due to gallstones or biliary sludge. This can lead to cholecystitis or cholangitis if not addressed.
5. Bradycardia: The patient's sinus bradycardia needs to be monitored closely, as it"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral arterial disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He has been in the ICU and has several medical complications including bacteremia, hypothermia, hypotension, elevated liver function tests, bradycardia, chronic kidney disease, supratherapeutic INR, hematuria, coronary artery disease, type II respiratory failure, and seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has a rising white blood cell count and both urine and blood cultures growing Proteus, suggesting a possible urinary tract infection or bacteremia.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is below normal, which can be secondary to infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, requiring close monitoring and management.
4. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are elevated, indicating possible obstructive liver disease, possibly from stones or biliary sludge.
5. Bradycardia: The patient has a slow heart rate, which may require pacemaker placement or atropine administration.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due to hypotension and subsequent ischemia to the kidneys.
7. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is higher than normal, likely due to recent restart of warfarin therapy.

","The patient is a 90-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury. He presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient is currently ventilator dependent and has a history of cardiac arrest. He has an elevated temperature, indicating fever of unknown origin. The patient has impaired skin integrity with heel ulcers and a stage II decubitus ulcer.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, platelets, creatinine, and liver enzymes. His electrolytes are abnormal with high potassium and low calcium levels. The patient has proteus bacteria growing in his urine and blood, suggesting a possible urinary tract infection as the source of bacteremia. There is also growth of gram-positive cocci in the blood culture.

The patient has several ongoing issues that need to be addressed. He has bradycardia, hypotension, and elevated liver function tests. His renal function is impaired, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis from hypotension and subsequent ischemia. The patient's INR is elevated, but trending down, and he has hematuria likely due to traumatic Foley placement. There are concerns about his respiratory function, as he is ventilator dependent and has type II respiratory failure. The patient has a history of seizures, but is currently not on anti-epileptic medication.

In terms of management, the patient is already on several"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an elderly man with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and anoxic brain injury after asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the assessment and plan include:

1. Bacteremia: The patient is growing proteus in urine and blood, indicating a possible urinary tract infection. He also has enterococcus in his blood. This suggests that the patient may develop sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.

2. Hypothermia: The patient has a normal thyroid function and cortisol levels are elevated in the morning. This could be due to infection or another underlying cause. Monitoring body temperature and managing it accordingly is important.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains stable. However, there is a concern for potential hypotension due to his condition. Holding carvedilol and lasix, maintaining a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 55, and considering further interventions if necessary are part of the management plan.

4. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient has an obstructive picture on LFTs, but the root cause is not specified. It could be due to gallstones or biliary sludge. Monitoring LFT trends and considering repeat"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), anoxic brain injury, and ventilator dependence. The patient presented with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient's urine and blood cultures are growing proteus, indicating a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). Additionally, the patient has bacteremia with gram-positive cocci in pairs/chains/clusters, suggesting a possible bacterial infection from open wounds or pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure but low heart rate (bradycardia) within the normal range. The patient's respiratory status is critically dependent on the ventilator due to poor neurological status. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelets (Plt). The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine (Cr) levels.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia with proteus in the urine and blood. The source is likely the urinary tract. The patient was changed to vancomycin due to growing gram-positive cocci on the previous antibiotic. Continue with Zosyn and follow culture sensitivities.

2. Hypothermia: The patient has normal thyroid function but elevated cortisol levels in the morning. Continue monitoring.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral artery disease, and anoxic brain injury following cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient has multiple infections, including bacteremia caused by proteus and enterococcus, as well as MRSA in his sputum. He also has open sores. His liver function tests show an obstructive pattern, but the right upper quadrant ultrasound is negative. The patient has hypothermia, hypotension, elevated liver enzymes, bradycardia, acute kidney injury, supratherapeutic INR, hematuria, coronary artery disease, type II respiratory failure, and a seizure disorder. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient is currently growing proteus in urine and blood. The likely source is the urine. He also has enterococcus in his blood. The open sores and previous MRSA in his sputum suggest potential sources of infection. The patient has been changed to linezolid. He should continue on Zosyn, linezolid, and follow culture sensitivities. Fever curves should also be monitored.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's thyroid function is normal, and cortisol levels are high in the morning. Infection is likely contributing to the hypothermia. Management should include removing unnecessary blankets,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. He has bacteremia with Proteus in urine and blood, likely from the urine source, as well as VRE in blood. He also has hypothermia, hypotension, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), sinus bradycardia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), supratherapeutic INR, anemia, hematuria, coronary artery disease (CAD), type II respiratory failure, seizure disorder, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has bacteremia with Proteus and VRE, which can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
2. Hypothermia: The patient is likely experiencing hypothermia due to infection, which can affect multiple organ systems.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may indicate poor perfusion to vital organs and can lead to organ failure.
4. Elevated LFTs: The elevated liver enzymes may suggest liver dysfunction, which could progress to hepatic failure if not managed properly.
5. Bradycardia: The patient's sinus bradycardia needs to be monitored closely, as it can affect cardiac output and lead to cardiovascular collapse"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly man with multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral artery disease, and anoxic brain injury. He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, hypothermia, hypotension, elevated liver function tests, bradycardia, chronic kidney disease, supratherapeutic INR, hematuria, coronary artery disease, type II respiratory failure, seizure disorder, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has bacteremia, which is an infection in the bloodstream. This can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not treated promptly.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can result in inadequate tissue perfusion, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Elevated Liver Function Tests: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver injury or dysfunction. This could be due to various factors, including infection or medication toxicity.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. If left untreated, this can progress to end-stage renal disease.
5. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's elevated INR indicates a prolonged blood clotting time. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Hematuria: The presence of blood in the urine may indicate urinary tract injury or"

   Assessment and Plan
","Summary:
The patient is an elderly man with no known drug allergies. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving multiple medications including Vancomycin, Linezolid, and Pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs show sinus bradycardia, low blood pressure, and normal oxygen saturation. He has a tracheostomy tube in place for respiratory support, and his lungs have mechanical breath sounds bilaterally without wheeze or rales. The patient also has hypoactive bowel sounds, 2+ pitting edema in the left lower extremity, and a stage II decubitus ulcer on each foot. Laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels and a low platelet count. The patient's WBC count has been fluctuating, with a recent increase. 

Potential Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing further infections due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of a tracheostomy tube.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating potential fluid overload. This could lead to pulmonary edema or worsening of his cardiovascular status.
3. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels suggest kidney dysfunction, which may require further evaluation and management.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is below normal, indicating thrombocytopenia. This condition can increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Pressure ulcers: The"

","The patient is an elderly man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), peripheral artery disease (PAD), anoxic brain injury after asystolic cardiac arrest, currently ventilator dependent, presents from Hospital3 with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. 

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Bacteremia: The patient is currently growing Proteus in urine and blood. The urine is likely the source. Additionally, the patient is growing vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in the blood. ID (infection diseases) is following up with the patient.

2. Hypothermia: The patient is likely experiencing infection in an already immunocompromised individual.

3. Hypotension: The patient's pressure has remained stable. The Carvedilol medication is being held, and the goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) is >55.

4. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs appear slightly improved today. There is an obstructive picture given elevated alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), though LFTs appear slightly improved today. Repeat liver ultrasound (US) on [**5-6**] showed persistent cholelithiasis without cholecystitis or evidence of ductal dilation. Very possible there was transient cholangitis vs shock liver.

","The patient is a 90-year-old man with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury after a cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including anemia, renal failure, fever of unknown origin, bacteremia with growth of Proteus in urine and blood, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in blood. He also has hypothermia, hypotension, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), bradycardia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), subtherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR), anemia of chronic inflammation, hematuria, coronary artery disease (CAD), type II respiratory failure, seizure disorder, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

The patient's current medications include piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), linezolid, furosemide (Lasix), and insulin for diabetes management. He has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and has been given lasix 80 mg IV for diuresis to prevent volume overload.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), a heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 91/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator support. His weight is 100.7 kg, and he has 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. He has stage II decubitus ulcers on his heels.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), creatinine (Cr), liver enzymes, and C-reactive protein (CRP). His electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing Zosyn and linezolid, serial cultures, fever curve monitoring, consideration of an echocardiogram and/or line change, and an infectious disease consultation. He is being closely monitored for hypothermia, hypotension, elevated LFTs, bradycardia, and CKD. The healthcare team is also addressing his anemia, hematuria, CAD, type II respiratory failure, seizure disorder, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

The patient's family has been educated about his poor prognosis but still prefers full code status. Ethics has been consulted and met with the family."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly man with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), anoxic brain injury, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient presented with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently ventilator dependent.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient has anoxic brain injury, which can lead to long-term neurological deficits and impaired cognitive function.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output). This can further worsen his pre-existing CKD.

3. Infection: The patient is currently growing Proteus in urine and blood, indicating a possible urinary tract infection. Additionally, he has multiple skin sores, which increases his risk for developing infections.

4. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently low, which may require pacemaker insertion or atropine administration to maintain adequate cardiac output.

5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating ongoing hypotension. This could be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or other factors. It is important to monitor and manage his blood pressure to ensure adequate organ perfusion.

6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient"

","The patient is an elderly man with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and anoxic brain injury after asystolic cardiac arrest. He presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient is currently ventilator-dependent and has been admitted to the ICU for septicemia caused by Proteus and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in the blood and urine. He also has a decubitus ulcer and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver function tests (LFTs), elevated creatinine levels indicating acute renal failure, subtherapeutic INR, and anemia of chronic inflammation. He has a history of type II respiratory failure and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is also evidence of hypothermia, hypotension, and elevated troponin levels suggestive of possible cardiac damage.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various complications. These include septicemia and infection, renal failure, impaired skin integrity and decubitus ulcer, hypothermia, hypotension, elevated LFTs, bradycardia, and anemia. The patient's family has been informed about his poor prognosis and has chosen to maintain full code status.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening septicemia, progression of renal failure, development of further skin breakdown and decubitus"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury after asystolic cardiac arrest. The patient is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a growing Proteus infection in the urine and blood, as well as Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) in the blood. These infections indicate a possible systemic infection, which could progress to sepsis if not appropriately managed.

2. Osteomyelitis: The X-ray of the patient's foot shows concerning findings for osteomyelitis involving the base of the fifth metatarsal head and cuboid. Further evaluation with an MRI is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate antibiotic course.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are worsening, indicating impaired renal function. The cause of AKI may be due to hypotension and subsequent ischemia. The goal is to maintain adequate urine output and continue with lasix to promote diuresis.

4. Anemia: The patient has elevated ferritin levels, indicating anemia of chronic inflammation. Hemolysis labs are unremarkable, but the patient has been transfused with one unit of"

","Summary:
- The patient is an elderly man with multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury.
- He presented with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.
- He has been diagnosed with septicemia caused by Proteus and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).
- His renal function has worsened, with a creatinine level of 4.0.
- He has a heel ulcer with signs of osteomyelitis and a possible decubitus ulcer.
- His INR is subtherapeutic, and he is at risk for both bleeding and thrombosis.
- His cardiac status shows a sinus bradycardia, and his respiratory function is compromised, requiring ventilatory support.
- He has anemia, possibly due to chronic kidney disease, and elevated liver function tests.
- The family has been educated about the patient's poor prognosis, and they still prefer full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Osteomyelitis: The patient's foot X-ray suggests osteomyelitis involving the base of the fifth metatarsal head and cuboid. Further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
2. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a stage II decubitus ulcer, which requires careful wound management and may require surgical intervention.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a creatinine level of"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an elderly man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury. He presented with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient has been ventilator-dependent since admission and has a tracheostomy in place. He also has a urinary tract infection caused by Proteus and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).

The patient's renal function has worsened, with a creatinine level of 4.0. He has been given Phoslo to manage hyperphosphatemia. The patient's INR is subtherapeutic, and he has been started on Coumadin. Heparin has been withheld due to the ongoing bleeding risk and small risk for thrombosis.

The patient's foot X-ray shows signs of osteomyelitis involving the base of the fifth metatarsal head and cuboid. An MRI is recommended for further evaluation.

The patient's blood cultures have been negative since May 5th. He is currently receiving Zosyn and Linezolid for his infections. 

The patient's anemia is likely due to worsening chronic kidney disease. He has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells and will require further transfusions as needed.

Other medical complications include elevated liver function tests, hypothermia, hypotension, elevated lactate levels, and hypothy"

","The patient is a 90-year-old man with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.

The patient has been diagnosed with septicemia caused by proteus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). His white blood cell count is elevated, and he is experiencing a rise in creatinine levels, indicating possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension and subsequent ischemia.

The patient also has osteomyelitis involving the base of the fifth metatarsal head and cuboid, as indicated by X-ray findings. Further evaluation with an MRI is recommended.

His INR is subtherapeutic, and he has a history of St. [Initials] [Last Name]. The goal INR is 2.5-3.5 with warfarin. Due to the patient's risk of bleeding and small risk for thrombosis, heparin is being held off.

The patient has anemia, likely a manifestation of worsening chronic kidney disease. His hemoglobin concentration is trending down, and he has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells. Further evaluation of hemolysis labs is needed, and he may require additional transfusions with a hematocrit level below 21. Erythropo"

","The patient is an elderly man with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury after a cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including septicemia, chronic osteomyelitis, renal failure, anemia, and hypothermia. The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection. The presence of proteus in urine and blood indicates a urinary tract infection. Additionally, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) has been identified in the blood culture. 

The patient's chronic kidney disease (CKD) is worsening, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels. The patient is on lasix to promote diuresis and improve fluid balance. 

The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic kidney disease and active bleeding from the tissue biopsy site. The patient has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells. 

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have improved, but there is evidence of transient cholangitis or shock liver. 

The patient has bradycardia, which is stable in the range of 50-60 beats per minute. 

The patient's Foley catheter is in place for hematuria. 

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to poor neurological status. He is currently on"

","The patient is a 90-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury after a cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient has a history of septicemia with rising WBC count, growth of proteus in urine and blood, and VRE in blood. He also has osteomyelitis in his right foot, which is not a surgical candidate. The patient's INR is subtherapeutic at 2.0, indicating a coagulopathy. His creatinine level continues to rise, suggesting acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis from hypotension and subsequent ischemia. The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 20.9, and he has been actively bleeding from a tissue biopsy site. He has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells. The patient's liver function tests show elevated levels, which may be related to transient cholangitis or shock liver. He has sinus bradycardia with a heart rate stable in the 50-60 range. The patient continues to require intermittent catheterization for hematuria. He has a history of coronary artery disease, but no further workup has been done due to renal insufficiency. The patient is ventilator dependent due to poor neurological status. He was previously on Ke"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury after a cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient has a history of St. [Initials (NamePattern4)] [Last Name (NamePattern4)]. He is on coumadin and his INR is down to 2.0. The patient also has renal failure, anemia, UTI, CKD, hypothermia, hypotension, elevated LFTs, bradycardia, hematuria, CAD, type II respiratory failure, seizure disorder, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential medical complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's Hct is low at 21%, indicating anemia. This could be due to active bleeding from the biopsy site or worsening chronic kidney disease.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating renal failure. This could be due to hypotension and subsequent ischemia.
3. UTI: The patient has a growing Proteus infection in his urine and blood. He is currently on day 8 of Zosyn.
4. CKD: The patient's Cr is at 4.2, suggesting chronic kidney disease.
5. Hypothermia: The patient had resolved hypothermia but may still be at"

","The patient is an elderly man with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), anoxic brain injury after asystolic cardiac arrest, and currently ventilator-dependent. He presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. 

The patient has a history of St. [Initials (NamePattern4)] [Last Name (NamePattern4)]. He is on coumadin with a goal INR of 2.5-3.5 due to a valve, but his INR is currently down to 2.0. 

He has chronic kidney disease (CKD) with rising creatinine levels, most likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension and subsequent ischemia. 

The patient also has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 20.9, which is likely secondary to blood loss from the tissue biopsy. He has been transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC). 

His liver function tests (LFTs) have improved, but he still has elevated liver enzymes. 

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and he is ventilator-dependent due to poor neurological status. 

He has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and is being managed with long-acting and rapid-acting insulin. 

The patient's family has been educated about his poor prognosis and"

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury after a cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including septicemia with a rising white blood cell count, chronic osteomyelitis of the right foot, renal failure with acute kidney injury (likely secondary to hypotension and subsequent ischemia), anemia, fever of unknown origin, and hypothermia. Other noted issues include elevated liver function tests, hypotension, elevated creatinine kinase, urinary tract infection (growing Proteus), and type II respiratory failure.

The patient is currently being treated with various medications, including furosemide (Lasix), linezolid, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), lansoprazole (Prevacid), morphine sulfate, and metolazone. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure of 103/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator.

The patient's physical examination reveals a tracheostomy collar in place, with clean and without erythema or drainage. He also has mechanical breath sounds bil"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly man with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral artery disease, and anoxic brain injury. He was admitted to the ICU with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient is ventilator-dependent and has a history of asystolic cardiac arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a rising white blood cell count and positive cultures for Proteus and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). He is currently being treated with antibiotics, but the infection is not yet under control.
2. Chronic Osteomyelitis: The patient has a heel ulcer that is suggestive of chronic osteomyelitis. This condition may not require surgical intervention.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating possible acute tubular necrosis, likely due to hypotension and subsequent ischemia.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased to 23, indicating anemia. This could be due to active bleeding from a biopsy site or worsening chronic kidney disease.
5. Hypothermia: The patient is requiring intermittent bear hugs to maintain body temperature, indicating possible hypothermia.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and his goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) is above 55.
7. Elevated Liver Function Tests ("

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD, anoxic brain injury after asystolic cardiac
   arrest, currently ventilator dependent, presents from [**Hospital3 **]
   with bradycardia, hypotension and hyperkalemia.
   .
   # Septicemia Rising WBC 18.3. Grew proteus in urine and blood. Also
   grew VRE in blood. All Survey cultures have been NGTD since [**5-4**].. TTE
   negative for endocarditis. Podiatry and ID saw pt regarding R foot XR
   highly suggestive of osteo (unlikely current source of bacteremia.
   Given TTE negative will likely treat for 2 weeks antibiotics  and f/u
   with ID at that point
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Appreciate Podiatry recs
   -  cont Zosyn day# 9
   -  Cont PO linezolid day# 6
   -  continue serial blood cx
   - ideally would change line, although patient is currently bleeding and
   would be high risk and hold off for now
   .
   #. Chronic Osteo: Pt seen by podiatry.  Not surgical candidate.
   Unlikely acute infection.
   -   appreciate pod recs
   -    compressive dressing changes
   -    antibiotic management as above
   # Subtherapeutic INR:  history of St. [**Initials (NamePattern4) 1930**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. INR trending up to
   2.3. Pt coumadin held [**1-2**] to bleeding.  Goal INR 2.5-3.5 w/ valve.
   Since pt is bleeding and small risk for thrombosis, and being
   coagulopathic likely [**1-2**] liver failure benefit of heparin is marginal
   and risk is great.  PTT still 52
   - holding coumadin for now given
   - trend Hct and coags
   .
   # UTI- growing proteus. Day #9 of Zosyn. Treatment for bacteremia will
   determine course of abx.
   # CKD: Cr 4.2. Most likely ATN [**1-2**] hypotension and subsequent
   ischemia.  Contlasix gtt and given lasix bolus, but still 1.5l
   positive. Pt anuric
   - continuing to hold off on dialysis per renal
   - goal I/O even
 increase bolus to 240mg IV lasix, cont lasix drip
   with titration
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anemia: Hct down to 23.  Pt actively bleeding from biopsy side.
   Additionally,  worsening chronic kidney disease (was started on epo).
   Stools have been guaiac positive but this could be related to known
   hemorrhoids
no gross bleeding or melana. Pt also bleeding from bladder
   on intermittent CBI.  Hemolysis labs unremarkable. Pt transfused 1U
   [**5-10**]
   - recheck PM Hct
   - transfuse Hct < 21

","The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury following cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. 

The patient has been diagnosed with septicemia caused by Proteus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in his blood culture. The source of bacteremia is unlikely to be the chronic osteomyelitis in his right foot, as indicated by a negative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). 

The patient's INR is subtherapeutic, likely due to liver failure. His PTT is elevated, and he is at a high risk of bleeding. The goal INR is 2.5-3.5 with valve therapy, but the patient's small risk for thrombosis and coagulopathy make the use of heparin questionable.

The patient has acute kidney injury (ATN) with a creatinine level of 4.2 mg/dL, likely secondary to hypotension and subsequent ischemia. He is anuric and has a positive fluid balance. The goal is to increase fluid output and continue lasix drip with titration.

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 575**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Urine output very poor despite high dose diuretics, BUN 230, Cr 2.4
   TTE shows no evidence of endocarditis so plan 2 wk course of
   antibiotics.
   Bleeding from right foot less after cautery by podiatry.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury. He presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia, and is currently ventilator dependent. He has a history of St. [Initials (NamePattern4)] [Last Name (NamePattern4)]. The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a rising white blood cell count and grew Proteus in both urine and blood cultures. Additionally, Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were also found in the blood culture. The patient's infection is not localized to the right foot, as initially thought, since the transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) is negative for endocarditis. The treatment plan includes continuing antibiotics, preferably in a line that is not currently causing bleeding, and serial blood cultures.

2. Chronic Osteomyelitis: The patient has a heel ulcer with a stage II decubitus ulcer. Although the foot x-ray suggests osteomyelitis, it is unlikely to be the current source of bacteremia. The treatment plan includes compressive dressing changes and antibiotic management as mentioned above.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a subtherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.3, indicating a coagulopathic state. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury following a cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient has several medical problems including anemia, renal failure, fever of unknown origin, chronic osteomyelitis, and subtherapeutic INR. He also has a urinary tract infection, chronic kidney disease, and hypothermia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss and chronic anemia due to other causes. This could lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure likely due to acute tubular necrosis caused by hypotension and ischemia. This can result in fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and decreased urine output.

3. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient has been experiencing fever without a known source. This can indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process.

4. Chronic Osteomyelitis: The patient has chronic osteomyelitis, which is an infection of the bone. This can lead to local pain, swelling, and systemic symptoms if the infection spreads.

5. Subtherapeutic INR: The patient's INR levels are subtherapeutic, indicating a potential risk for blood clots"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral artery disease, and anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient has several medical problems, including septicemia, chronic osteomyelitis, subtherapeutic INR, urinary tract infection, chronic kidney disease, anemia, hypothermia, hypotension, elevated liver function tests, bradycardia, hematuria, coronary artery disease, type II respiratory failure, seizure disorder, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and low urine output indicate possible acute renal failure, which may be due to hypotension and subsequent ischemia.
2. Infection: The patient has ongoing infections, including septicemia, urinary tract infection, and chronic osteomyelitis. These infections can lead to further complications if not appropriately managed.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding and hematuria. This increases the risk of hemorrhage and anemia.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient has coronary artery disease and may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
5. Respiratory issues: The patient is ventilator-dependent and has type II respiratory"

1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure due to ischemia from hypotension. He is oliguric with a urine output of 260 mL over 24 hours and has a creatinine level of 4.8 mg/dL. His renal function is further compromised by chronic kidney disease (CKD).

2. Anemia: The patient has a decreased hematocrit (Hct) level of 24.6% and is actively bleeding from a biopsy site. He is transfused with packed red blood cells (pRBCs) overnight but continues to bleed from known hemorrhoids and bladder on intermittent catheterization.

3. Bradycardia: The patient has sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 61 bpm. His"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly man with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest, and chronic kidney disease. He presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient has been diagnosed with septicemia, chronic osteomyelitis, subtherapeutic INR, urinary tract infection (UTI), and acute renal failure (ATN). Other issues include anemia, impaired skin integrity, fever of unknown origin, hypothermia, hypotension, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), bradycardia, hematuria, coronary artery disease (CAD), type II respiratory failure, seizure disorder, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and low urine output indicate renal failure. Continued monitoring and management of fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and renal function are crucial.

2. Infection: The patient's septicemia and UTI suggest an ongoing infection. It is important to continue antibiotic therapy as prescribed and monitor for any signs of infection or sepsis.

3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. Blood transfusion may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation. The underlying cause of anemia, such as chronic kidney disease or gastrointestinal bleeding, should be addressed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, an elderly man, has been experiencing hemoptysis and worsening pleural effusions on the right side.
- The patient's foot is still bleeding, and there is no pulmonary hemorrhage seen on the chest X-ray.
- The patient's hematocrit level is 23.1, but no transfusion was given.
- The patient has an infection identified as Proteus, and the doctor is considering adding tetracycline sensitivity.
- The patient underwent dialysis, but it was deemed futile.
- The patient's serum osmolarity is 355.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- The patient has been receiving various medications, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Linezolid, Ceftriaxone, and Morphine sulfate.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/37 to 117/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
- The patient has a first-degree AV block.
- The patient's weight is 100.7 kg, with a height of 69 inches.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,371 mL (466 mL PO, 841 mL TF, 170 mL IVF) and an output of 225 mL (25 mL blood products, 200 mL urine).
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and ABG results of ///18/.
- Physical examination reveals an elderly man who is not sedated, with normal heart sounds and no wheezes or rales in the lungs.
- The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema and a stage II decubitus ulcer on the heel.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, along with elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's worsening pleural effusions and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and signs of infection may indicate sepsis.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and lower extremity edema put him at risk for DVT.
4. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding foot and elevated hematocrit level indicate a risk of bleeding complications.
5. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest possible kidney dysfunction.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's stage II decubitus ulcer on the heel indicates a risk for developing further pressure ulcers.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury. He presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. He is currently ventilator-dependent and has a history of asystolic cardiac arrest. The patient's condition includes septicemia, chronic osteomyelitis, subtherapeutic INR, urinary tract infection (UTI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), anemia, hypothermia, hypotension, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), bradycardia, hematuria, coronary artery disease (CAD), type II respiratory failure, seizure disorder, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient has septicemia, which indicates a systemic infection. If not appropriately managed, it can progress to sepsis, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Kidney injury: The patient has CKD with a creatinine level of 4.8 mg/dL, suggesting impaired renal function. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's fluid balance, electrolytes, and medication dosages to prevent further kidney damage.
3. Bleeding: The patient's INR is subtherapeutic, indicating an increased risk of bleeding. Any surgical procedures or interventions should be carefully evaluated considering the patient's bleeding risk.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral artery disease, and anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. He has multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney disease, anemia, hypothermia, septicemia caused by Proteus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), chronic osteomyelitis, subtherapeutic INR, urinary tract infection (UTI) with growing Proteus, and type II respiratory failure. The patient's overall condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing infections, including septicemia caused by Proteus and VRE. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to manage and prevent further complications.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function. Continuing to monitor renal parameters and considering dialysis if indicated may be necessary to prevent worsening of kidney function.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels remain stable at 24%. Transfusion may be required if the hemoglobin drops below 21%. Additionally, managing the underlying causes of anemia, such as chronic inflammation and blood loss from the foot wound, should"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and anoxic brain injury. He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture for Proteus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Despite serial negative cultures, the patient continues to show signs of infection and sepsis. Continuous antibiotic therapy is being administered.

2. Chronic Osteomyelitis: The patient has a non-surgical foot wound that is not likely to be an acute infection. The plan is to continue compressive dressing changes and manage antibiotics as previously discussed.

3. Subtherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is trending up to 1.9, indicating an increased risk of bleeding. Coumadin has been held due to bleeding concerns, and the use of heparin is being considered, but the risk-benefit ratio needs to be evaluated.

4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a growing colony count of Proteus in the urine. Antibiotic therapy has been changed to ceftriaxone per Infectious Disease consultation.

5. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's serum"

The patient's Hct remains stable at 24%, indicating anemia. He is hypothermic and requires intermittent bear hugging. His blood pressure remains stable, but he is not a candidate for dialysis due to septicemia with Proteus Mirabilis. The patient's elevated liver enzymes are likely recovering from shock liver. He has sinus bradycardia and requires monitoring for seizures. The patient's goals of care are to continue full code status as per family wishes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of septicemia with Proteus Mirabilis and VRE. There is a potential risk of further infections due to his compromised immune system.
2. Chronic Osteomyelitis: The patient has chronic osteomyelitis in his right foot, which may lead to recurrent infections and non-healing wounds.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct remains stable at 24%, indicating an"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an elderly man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including:

1. Sepsis: Blood cultures have been positive for Proteus and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Serial cultures remain negative since May 3rd. The patient continues to have rising white blood cell count and remains hypothermic.

2. Chronic Osteomyelitis: The patient's foot wound is not considered an acute infection and is managed with compressive dressing changes and antibiotic therapy.

3. Subtherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is trending down to 1.6, and Coumadin has been held due to bleeding risk. The patient may also have liver failure.

4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a growing Proteus infection, and antibiotics have been changed from Zosyn to Ceftriaxone per Infectious Disease consultation.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is 5.1, indicating possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to hypotension and subsequent ischemia."

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. These include:

1. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 5.1 mg/dL, indicating impaired kidney function. This could be due to hypotension and subsequent ischemia, leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient is not a candidate for dialysis.

2. Sepsis: The patient has positive blood cultures for Proteus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), suggesting a bacterial infection. Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, the patient remains hypothermic and has a rising white blood cell count, indicating ongoing infection.

3. Anoxic brain injury: The patient experienced an asystolic cardiac arrest, resulting in oxygen deprivation to the brain. This has led to anoxic encephalopathy and impaired neurological status.

4. Bradycardia: The patient presents with bradycardia, which is a slow heart rate. This can be attributed to medications such as carvedilol and the patient's overall condition.

5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a heel ulcer with a bloody dressing, indicating impaired skin integrity. This could be due to prolonged immobility and pressure on the heel.

6. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has had persistent fever despite antibiotic therapy, suggesting an underlying infection or inflammatory process.

7. Chronic osteomyel"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest, and chronic kidney disease. He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.

The patient has a history of septicemia with positive blood cultures for Proteus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). He is being treated with linezolid, and the ID plan is to continue it through day 14 then switch to doxycycline 100 mg. The patient also has chronic osteomyelitis in his foot and a subtherapeutic INR, which is trending down to 1.5. His Coumadin has been held due to bleeding.

The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 5.0 mg/dL, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension and subsequent ischemia. He is not a candidate for dialysis. The patient's anemia is likely due to dilutional effects, chronic inflammation, and ongoing blood loss from his foot wound.

The patient is also experiencing hypothermia, requiring intermittent bear hugs, and his blood pressure remains stable. His liver function tests are improving, suggesting recovery from shock liver. He has bradycardia with a stable heart rate in the 50-60"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury after a cardiac arrest.
- He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.
- The patient has a history of sepsis with positive blood cultures for Proteus and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).
- Serial blood cultures remain negative since May 3rd, but the patient continues to have a rising white blood cell count and remains hypothermic.
- The patient's anemia is likely due to blood loss from a foot wound and chronic inflammation.
- His renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 5.0, indicating acute kidney injury (ATN) possibly secondary to hypotension and subsequent ischemia.
- The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating a recovering ""shock liver.""
- He has a fever of unknown origin and maculopapular lesions on his face, which are likely drug rashes from ceftriaxone.
- The patient's blood pressure remains stable, but he is hypotensive. Carvedilol is held, and pacer pads are in place as needed.
- His brain injury is severe, and he is dependent on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, and his blood sugars remain stable on insulin therapy"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. This could be due to chronic inflammation, blood loss from the foot wound, or dilutional effects.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has a high creatinine level, suggesting renal failure. This could be a result of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) caused by hypotension and subsequent ischemia.

3. Bradycardia: The patient has a low heart rate, which is classified as bradycardia. This could be secondary to medication (such as carvedilol) or an underlying condition.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating hypotension. This may be due to sepsis, poor cardiac function, or volume depletion.

5. Fever, Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had intermittent fevers, which could be attributed to an underlying infection or inflammatory process.

6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a heel ulcer and a decubitus ulcer, indicating impaired skin integrity. These ulcers may lead to further complications such as infection or pressure ulcers.

7. Type II Respiratory Failure: The patient is ventilator-dependent and has poor neurological status, leading to type II respiratory failure.

8. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which can"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury following cardiac arrest.
- He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.
- He has a history of septicemia, chronic osteomyelitis, urinary tract infection, chronic kidney disease, anemia, hypothermia, hypotension, elevated liver function tests, and seizure disorder.
- The patient's family is in favor of full code status.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a low heart rate (63 bpm), low blood pressure (113/39 mmHg), and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support.
- His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine level of 5.1 mg/dL, and liver enzymes.
- The patient has a tracheostomy in place, Foley catheter, and central venous line.
- He is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, analgesics, and nutritional supplements.
- The patient's prognosis is poor, but the family prefers full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level of 5.1 mg/dL indicates possible acute renal failure. This could be due to hypotension and subsequent ischemia.
2. Sepsis:"

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. However, the 24-hour events include discontinuing epo (likely erythropoietin), screening for rehab, and final ID recommendations to stop CTX after a full 14-day course, continue linezolid through day 14, and then switch to doxycycline 100mg.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was ceftriaxone on [**2108-5-14**] at 09:00 PM.

The patient is receiving various ICU medications, including lansoprazole, famotidine, and others. There are also changes to medical and family history, as well as a review of systems.

The vital signs show a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), a heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/39 mmHg to 122/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support.

The physical examination reveals an elderly man who is not responding to commands, with no signs of scleral edema or drainage at the tracheostomy site. There is a systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, and bilateral 1-3+ lower extremity edema.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and anoxic brain injury following a cardiac arrest. He is currently ventilator-dependent and presents with bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.

The patient has multiple medical complications including:
1. Anemia: The patient has a stable hematocrit level of 22.8%, indicating chronic anemia likely due to blood loss from his foot wound and chronic inflammation.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 5.0 mg/dL, likely secondary to hypotension and subsequent ischemia. He is not a candidate for dialysis.
3. Fever, unknown origin: The patient has been hypothermic and has had a rising white blood cell count, suggesting an ongoing infection despite negative blood cultures since May 3rd.
4. Bradycardia: The patient has sinus bradycardia with a heart rate in the 50-60 range. Carvedilol has been held, and atropine is given as needed.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has remained stable, and carvedilol has been withheld.
6. Elevated liver function tests: The patient's liver function tests continue to improve, indicating recovery from shock liver.
7. Type II respiratory failure: The patient is ventilator-dependent due to poor neuro"
