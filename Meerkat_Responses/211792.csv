   Assessment and Plan
   65 F with metastatic breast CA to brain and lung, on steroid taper, DM
   II, CAD s/p CABG, CHF with preserved EF, HTN, hypothyroidism, recent
   admission for right biceps tendon partial rupture vs. tumor who
   presents with DKA.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia. Glucose in 400s with AG 19, ketones in urine c/w DKA.
   Patient has h/o DKA in the past while not on steroids, patient also
   with elevated FS during recent admission with increase in SS insulin.
   - IVF hydration ---has received 2 L in ED (careful monitoring in
   setting of pulmonary edema in the past), NS x 4 hrs then 1/2NS then
   D51/2 NS when FS ~250
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion
   - q 2 hrs electrolytes
   - FS q 1 hr
   - Insulin gtt at 0.1U/kg/hr and titrate as necessary
   - Continue long acting insulin tomorrow PM
   - r/out infection--send blood cultures x 2, U/A incomplete, resend,
   culture pending, CXR concerning for cavitation with infection vs.
   expanding mass
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult in AM
   .
   # Hypotension. Patient noted to have low SBP on last admission and CCB
   held in that setting. Concern for infection given CXR findings c/w mass
   vs. cavitation/infection. No clear source however.
   - hold BP meds/lasix
   - IVF --bolus per DKA protocol above
   - Monitor resp status in setting of CHF and diastolic dsyfunction
   - CIS
   - If persistently hypotensive or spikes would consider broad spectrum
   antx (vanco/zosyn)
   - obtain sputum if possible
   - Bl cultures x 2
   - repeat U/A, f/up cultures
   - likely needs chest CT to better characterize mass
   - 2 PIVs for now, consider A-line and CVL
   .
   # Leukocytosis w/L shift. Down to 11 with IVF alone. Patient reports
   high grade fever x 1 at home.
   - Bl Cx x 2, U Cx pending
   - ?CT chest to eval mass vs. infection however no cough/sputum
   production, ?abscess formation
   - hold off on empiric antibitics for now pending above
   - trend WBC
   - CIS
   .
   # Anemia. Pt trace guaiac positive stool in ED. Hct down from 29 to 23
   with IVF, baseline low 30s. Colonoscopy/EGD [**2151-4-27**] showing
   gastritis/duodenitis.
   - T&C
   - hemolysis labs
   - check coags/LFTs
   - trend Hct
   - transfuse if hct trending down further (Hct <21), evidence of
   bleeding
   .
   # CAD. s/p CABG with progressive angina, now medically managed.
   Currently w/out CP. Recieved ASA in ED. ECG with stable ST-T changes.
   - ASA, Statin
   - hold BB/ACEI given hypotension
   .
   # CHF. Preserved EF but with diastolic dysfunction. H/o pulmonary edema
   and intubation in the past. Monitor resp status in setting of IVF
   hydration.
   - hold lasix
   - I/Os
   - follow clinically
   .
   # Metastatic Breast CA to lung and brain. CXR showing evidence of rapid
   growth of likely metastatic mass in lung. Suggest CT when stable.
   - touch base with Oncology
   - at end of steroid taper --hold further steroids given severe
   hyperglycemia
   - consider CT chest to better evaluate chest mass
   .
   # HTN. Recently has been on low side, holding BP meds and lasix.
   .
   # Hypothyroid. Continue synthroid.
   .
   # Gout. Cont Allopurinol and cholchicine.
   .
   # GERD. Cont PPI
   .
   # PPx. Hep SC, PPI, bowel reg
   .
   # FEN. IVF per DKA [**Last Name (un) 276**] protocol, replete lytes q 2 hrs, NPO for now.
   .
   # Access: PIV and EJ for now, may need CVL for electrolyte repletion,
   A-line for BP monitoring and ABG's

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer to the brain and lung, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with preserved ejection fraction, hypertension (HTN), hypothyroidism, gout, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and familial epithelial nevus (FEN).

The patient presented to the ICU with sepsis and was found to have an elevated temperature of 104.4°F (40.2°C), tachycardia, hypertension, and chest pain. Blood cultures were drawn, and she was started on IV Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from her condition. These include:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. This is likely due to the stress of sepsis and her underlying diabetes mellitus type II. Insulin infusion has been started to manage her blood sugar levels.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires close monitoring and aggressive fluid resuscitation. The possibility of infection, especially given the CXR findings, should be considered. Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be considered if the patient remains hypot"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer to the brain and lung, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (CHF), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a recent admission for a partial rupture of the right biceps tendon versus tumor. The patient presents with sepsis, hyperglycemia, hypotension, leukocytosis with a left shift, anemia, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis with a left shift suggest an ongoing infection. The CXR findings of cavitation with infection versus expanding mass raise concerns for a possible lung abscess or pneumonia. Blood cultures have been sent, but sputum culture is pending.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and is currently experiencing severe hyperglycemia with a glucose level in the 400s. This could lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS).
3. Hypotension: The patient's low systolic blood pressure may indicate septic shock, especially considering the presence of fever and leukocytosis. It is important to monitor the patient closely and consider broad-spectrum antibiotics if hypot"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the brain and lung, diabetes type II, and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). She was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and is now presenting with fever, hypotension, and sepsis. The patient has several comorbidities including congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), hypothyroidism, gout, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and peptic ulcer disease (PUD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggests sepsis. It is crucial to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor vital signs closely.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's history of DKA, hyperglycemia, ketones in urine, and the need for aggressive electrolyte repletion indicate the possibility of DKA. Insulin infusion and careful monitoring of blood glucose levels are necessary.
3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels and trace guaiac positive stool indicate possible bleeding. Further investigation through colonoscopy/EGD is required to identify the source of bleeding. Blood transfusion may be needed if the hemoglobin levels continue to decrease.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient's history of CAD and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer to the brain and lung, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and other medical conditions. She was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and now presents with fever and hypotension consistent with sepsis. She has been weaned off pressors and is receiving vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and clindamycin for a presumed pulmonary source. Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending. The patient's white blood cell count has increased with a left shift, indicating an infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for presumed pulmonary sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not properly managed.
2. Leukocytosis with left shift: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection, and the presence of immature cells indicates a more severe response to the infection.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient initially presented with DKA and has elevated glucose levels despite receiving insulin. Close monitoring and tight glycemic control are necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a declining platelet count and a low hemoglobin level, which may be due to bleeding into the lung mass or abscess. Further investigation is needed to identify the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer to the brain and lung, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and other medical conditions. She was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and now presents with fever and hypotension, suggestive of sepsis with a likely pulmonary source. The patient has been on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and clindamycin for presumed pneumonia, but remains febrile. Blood cultures are pending, and urine cultures show yeast with a high colony count.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: Continue with the current antibiotics and consider adding fungal coverage if the patient continues to spike fevers.
2. Hyperglycemia: Restart insulin gtt as the patient's glucose levels are elevated due to receiving steroids.
3. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Evaluate the cause of bleeding and consider colonoscopy/EGD to assess gastritis/duodenitis. Hold heparin and ASA, send HIT panel, and stabilize platelet count in the 90s.
4. CAD: Hold beta-blockers/ACE inhibitors given hypotension.
5. CHF: Monitor respiratory status in the setting of IVF hydration and hold lasix.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer to the brain and lung, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting (CAD s/p CABG), admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and now presenting with fever and hypotension consistent with sepsis likely of a pulmonary source. She has been receiving vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and clindamycin for presumed pulmonary source, but remains febrile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition suggests sepsis due to the presence of fever, hypotension, and an identified pulmonary source. She is already receiving appropriate antibiotics, but her persistent fever indicates ongoing infection.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, along with the imaging findings of left basal consolidation on chest X-ray, suggest pneumonia as the likely source of infection.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and is currently receiving insulin to manage her blood glucose levels. However, her recent elevated glucose levels indicate uncontrolled hyperglycemia, which can increase the risk of infections and delay wound healing.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been declining over the past three days, indicating a possible bleeding risk. This could be related to her underlying cancer"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer to the brain and lung, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and now presenting with fever and hypotension consistent with sepsis, likely of pulmonary origin. The patient has received vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and clindamycin for presumed pulmonary source. Blood cultures are pending, and urine cultures are also pending.

The patient initially had elevated blood glucose levels but now has closed the gap. Insulin infusion has been restarted. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 17 with a left shift. The patient's hemoglobin and platelet count are low, and she has had a positive guaiac test indicating possible bleeding. A colonoscopy/EGD revealed gastritis/duodenitis, and there is a possibility of bleeding into the lung mass or abscess. The patient's cardiac history includes progressive angina, now medically managed, with stable ST-T changes on ECG. She has preserved ejection fraction but with diastolic dysfunction. 

The patient has several other medical conditions including hypertension, hypothyroidism, gout, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and poor oral intake. She is currently on multiple medications including steroids, insulin, statin, allopur"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the brain and lung, on steroid taper, diabetes mellitus type II, and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and is now presenting with fever and hypotension, consistent with sepsis likely originating from the lungs. The patient has multiple comorbidities including heart failure, renal failure, hyperglycemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and metastatic breast cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and hypotension indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Pulmonary complications: Given the presence of a necrotic area on the CT scan of the lungs, there is a risk of further lung infections or pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory function.
3. Heart failure: The patient's diastolic dysfunction and history of CAD/CABG put her at risk for heart failure exacerbation. Aggressive fluid management is crucial to avoid fluid overload.
4. Renal failure: Hypotension and sepsis can compromise renal perfusion, leading to acute kidney injury or worsening of pre-existing renal failure.
5. Metastatic disease progression: The rapidly growing mass in the lung suggests possible progression of metastatic breast"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer to the brain and lung, diabetes mellitus type II, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
- The patient was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and is now presenting with fever and hypotension, suggesting sepsis likely of pulmonary origin.
- The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole) for presumed pulmonary source given the presence of a necrotic lung mass.
- The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and elevated lactate levels indicating poor tissue perfusion.
- The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with severe pulmonary edema seen on chest X-ray.
- The patient has been given stress dose steroids due to steroid taper and hypotension.
- Other findings include leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, hyperglycemia, and anemia of chronic disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and elevated lactate levels suggest ongoing sepsis. If not adequately managed, sepsis can progress to septic shock and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe pulmonary edema and"

","The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, currently in the ICU for sepsis and other complications. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole. The patient is still on a low dose pressor and hydrocortisone. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/48 to 117/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. She has diminished breath sounds at the bases but no wheezes or rales. The patient's lab results show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and elevated lactate levels. Her electrolytes are within normal range, except for a low potassium level. The patient's blood glucose levels have been well-controlled since switching to glargine insulin. The plan includes weaning off Levophed, repeating a CT scan to differentiate between metastases, infection, or abscess in the lung, and adjusting medications based on follow-up cultures. The patient's code status remains DNR/DNI, and she will continue to be monitored in the ICU until she can be weaned off pressors."

   Assessment and Plan
   1.       Sepsis: ? lung etiology, no pos cx, Rxing broadly with Vanco,
   Zosyn, Flagyl. Continues on low dose pressor and Hydrocort.  Follow up
   cultures and adjust accordingly.
   2.        Lung mass : rapid increase in size : repeat CT to try to
   differentiate mets vs infection/abscess and determine whether drainage
   may be helpful and feasible
   3.       Arf: likely Atn from hypotension, Cr improving, readjust meds
   4.       DM: switched to glargine and off insulin gtts
   5.       Anemia: s/p Tx with lasix with good Hct.
   6.       Breast ca with brain mets, likely right arm mets, possible
   lung mets- repeat CT to better characterize.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a chief complaint of sepsis. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco, Zosyn, Flagyl) and is on low-dose norepinephrine for hemodynamic support. The patient's lung mass has rapidly increased in size, and a repeat CT scan is needed to differentiate between metastasis, infection, or abscess. The patient's acute kidney injury (ARF) is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension, and her creatinine levels are improving. The patient has diabetes mellitus (DM) and was switched from insulin gtt to glargine. She also has anemia, which was treated with Lasix and resulted in a good hematocrit (Hct) level. The patient has a history of breast cancer with brain metastases, and there may be right arm and lung metastases. A repeat CT scan is planned to better characterize these findings. The patient is currently on ICU care, receiving oral nutrition and glycemic control with glargine. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she will remain in the ICU until she can be weaned off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already being treated for sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic status, and laboratory values is essential to assess the effectiveness of treatment"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, diabetes, and acute kidney injury. She was admitted to the ICU with sepsis, likely secondary to lung etiology, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her vital signs are stable, and she has shown improvement in her overall condition. She is still requiring low-dose vasopressor support and continues to receive nutritional support through the enteral route. Her blood glucose levels are well-controlled with glargine insulin. The patient has a code status of DNR/DNI and is expected to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, and there is a risk of complications related to infection, such as organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Lung mass: The patient has a rapidly increasing lung mass, which could potentially be an abscess or metastasis from her breast cancer. Further evaluation with repeat CT scans is planned to differentiate between these possibilities and determine if drainage is necessary.
3. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient's creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury, likely secondary to hypotension. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications are required to ensure proper renal function.
4. Diabetes mellitus (DM): The patient has diabetes, and her glucose levels need to be monitored closely to maintain glycemic control.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may require further"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer to the brain and lung, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and now presenting with fever and hypotension consistent with sepsis likely of a pulmonary source. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, stress dose steroids, and being managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient has a history of metastatic breast cancer to the brain and lung. This can lead to various complications such as neurological symptoms due to brain metastases, respiratory distress due to lung metastases, and pain management challenges.

2. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by an overwhelming immune response to infection. If not properly managed, it can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient was initially admitted with DKA, a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones. If not treated promptly, DKA can progress to diabetic coma or even death.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which increases the risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack) or unstable angina. In the setting of sepsis"

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole for the presumed pulmonary source given the large left lower lobe mass with necrotic areas on the CT scan. She is also receiving hydrocortisone as stress dose steroids due to hypotension and being on steroid taper.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer presenting with septic shock and a history of necrotic chest lesion. She has been treated for pneumonia and has improved, but remains critically ill. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and Clindamycin. She also receives other medications such as Furosemide, Morphine sulfate, Pantoprazole, Heparin sodium, and various others. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/63 to 134/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is intubated and receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Physical examination findings include crackles at the lung bases and the patient appearing lethargic with occasional confusion. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient has a history of delirium, which could be due to ICU stay, medication, or metastatic disease. The plan is to obtain a head CT to further evaluate this. The patient's sepsis has improved, and the pressors can be weaned off. Leukocytosis is also present, and further investigation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer to the brain and lung, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and is now showing signs of sepsis. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and receiving aggressive treatment for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status (MS): The patient has increased somnolence and difficulty answering questions, which could be due to narcotics for pain management, infections, or known metastatic breast cancer.
2. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis with a pulmonary source, likely from a necrotic area in the left lower lobe mass seen on the CT scan. She is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is at 95% on 5 liters of nasal cannula, and she has severe pulmonary edema on the chest X-ray. Lasix has been given to address this issue.
4. Acidosis: The patient has an elevated Gap of 14, and if she has positive urine ketones, insulin will be restarted.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is trending down, suggesting improvement. It is believed to be related to hypotension and sepsis.

   c/w sepsis likely pulmonary source now HD stable.
   .
   # Altered MS
 pt with increased somnolence this am, difficulty
   answering questions.
 Possibly  due to narcotics for pain, vs
   infections vs know metastatic breast ca.
 Will obtain CT Head to r/o
   bleed due to known mets. Will repeat AGB
 monitor for CO2 retention.
   Continue opiates to adequately treat pain, monitor for sedation
   - CT Head negative
   - Likely secondary to ....
   # Sepsis. Pt on vanc/zosyn/flagyl for presumed pulmonary source given
   LLL mass with necrotic area on CT scan.
   - hypotensive and on steroid taper so stress dose steroids started
   hydrocort 50q6, when stable off pressors can begin to taper antibiotics
   - no culture data yet but on broad spectrum antibiotics
   - hold all standing fluids, bolus prn (w/ consideration for respiratory
   status) and start pressors (neosynephrine) for MAP < 65
   - CVP 10-11, tolerate slightly lower CVP ([**6-4**]) given respiratory status
   if only requiring low dose pressor
   - Glucan and Galactomannan [**6-4**]
 negative
   -denies diarrhea, if diarrhea send c diff
   -leukocytosis improving, no bandemia, in setting of steroids in
   addition to sepsis
   -switched clinda to flagyl for anaerobic coverage given possibility of
   C diff
   # hypoxia:
   -O2 sat 95%. on 5 L NC, diastolic CHF, severe pulmonary edema on CXR
   -attempt to use fluids gingerly and start standing nebs - atrovent and
   albuterol
   - give lasix 10mg IV
   # Acidosis: Gap 11 down from 15.
   -continue to trend, lactate elevated
   -urine ketones negative
   # Renal Failure: possibly related to hypotension and sepsis.
   -urine lytes- c/w pre renal etiology, likely low bp / sepsis
   -improving with better controlled bp
   -re-renally dose medications, check vanc level in a.m.
   -f/u this a.m. vanc level and q am until renal function stabilizes
   -may need to adjust zosyn dose with improved renal function
   # Hyperglycemia. Pt initially in DKA on admission
   - will continue insulin SC
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia -
   -transfuse 1 U PRB for HCT 19
   -thrombocytopenia- HIT negative
   -restart sc heparin, possibly due to sepsis
   -DIC negative
   -f/u this a.m. platelets
   # CAD. s/p CABG with progressive angina, now medically managed.
   Currently w/out CP.
   - Statin
   - hold BB/ACEI given hypotension
   # Metastatic Breast CA to lung and brain.
   - CXR showing evidence of rapid growth of likely metastatic mass in
   lung. Suggest CT when stable.
   - continue medial treatment for above prior to possible chemo
   -pain: continue lidocaine patch, oxycodone prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer to the brain and lung, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and previously admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient is currently in the ICU with fever and hypotension consistent with sepsis, likely of a pulmonary source. The patient has also been experiencing altered mental status (MS), increased somnolence, and difficulty answering questions, possibly due to narcotics for pain, infections, or metastatic breast cancer. 

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Metronidazole) for presumed pulmonary source given the LLL mass with necrotic area on CT scan. Hypotension and on steroid taper so stress dose steroids started. 
2. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on 5 liters of nasal cannula. Diastolic CHF and severe pulmonary edema observed on chest X-ray. 
3. Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is improving, with a decreasing gap.
4. Renal Failure: Possible pre-renal etiology due to hypotension and sepsis. Improving with better controlled blood pressure.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient initially presented with DKA"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer who is experiencing septic shock, likely due to a necrotic lung lesion. She has been in the ICU since 06/10/2152 and has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain relief, and blood thinners. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/65mmHg to 153/72mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. She remains confused but recognizes her location at [**Hospital3**]. She is unable to take oral medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's underlying condition of sepsis continues to be a concern. It is crucial to monitor her vital signs and respond promptly to any changes in her condition.
2. Delirium: The patient remains slightly confused and not completely oriented, possibly due to hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, and steroid use. Close monitoring of mental status and addressing potential contributing factors is necessary.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient's elevated calcium levels may require further investigation and management to prevent complications such as renal dysfunction or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be addressed to prevent dehydration and neurological complications.

   c/w sepsis likely pulmonary source now HD stable.
    .
   # Altered MS
 pt with increased somnolence, difficulty answering
   questions.
 Possibly  due to narcotics for pain, vs infections vs
   known metastatic breast ca.
CT Head yesterday to r/o  bleed due to
   known mets was negative. Continue opiates to adequately treat pain,
   monitor for sedation.
   - CT Head negative
   # Sepsis. Pt on vanc/zosyn/flagyl for presumed pulmonary source given
   LLL mass with necrotic area on CT scan.
   - hypotensive and on steroid taper so stress dose steroids started
   hydrocort 50q6, when stable off pressors can begin to taper antibiotics
   - no culture data yet but on broad spectrum antibiotics
   - hold all standing fluids, bolus prn (w/ consideration for respiratory
   status) and start pressors (neosynephrine) for MAP < 65
   - CVP 10-11, tolerate slightly lower CVP ([**6-4**]) given respiratory status
   if only requiring low dose pressor
   - Glucan and Galactomannan [**6-4**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the brain and lung, on steroid taper, diabetes mellitus type II, and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and is now presenting with fever and hypotension, consistent with sepsis likely of a pulmonary source. The patient is hemodynamically stable overnight but has become less interactive and stopped taking oral medications.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole) for presumed pulmonary source given the left lower lobe mass with necrotic area on CT scan. Stress dose steroids have been started due to hypotension and steroid taper.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on 5 liters of nasal cannula, but there is diastolic congestive heart failure and severe pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. Lasix has been given intravenously.
3. Acidosis: The patient's gap is elevated to 14, and if positive for urine ketones, insulin will be restarted. Lactate levels are being trended, and urine ketones are being checked.
4. Renal Failure: The patient may have renal failure related to hypotension and se"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer to the brain and lung, diabetes type II, and coronary artery disease who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and sepsis. She is currently hemodynamically stable but has shown clinical decline, including altered mental status. Her condition is complicated by multiple medical issues such as hypoxia, hypercalcemia, acidosis, renal failure, hyperglycemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and possible pulmonary embolism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient has metastatic breast cancer to the brain and lung, which is likely contributing to her overall clinical decline.
2. Sepsis: The patient was admitted with sepsis and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for a presumed pulmonary source. There is a concern for persistent leukocytosis, possibly secondary to steroids.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to narcotics for pain, infections, known metastatic breast cancer, or toxic metabolic encephalopathy. A CT head was negative for bleeds or worsening metastasis.
4. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia despite being on 5 L NC. She has diastolic CHF and severe pulmonary edema on CXR.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia, which is likely secondary to bone metast"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer, who was admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and sepsis. The patient's current chief complaints are respiratory failure and altered mental status. She has developed lethargy and minimal communication since admission. She continues to experience some pain, particularly in her right arm and abdomen. The patient's poor oral intake throughout hospitalization has contributed to her overall condition.

The patient's medical history is significant for breast cancer, which has progressed aggressively and rapidly. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/56 to 147/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus tachycardia.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,923 mL and output of 2,080 mL since midnight, with a negative balance of 157 mL. She is receiving multiple medications, including furosemide, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 30.2 K/uL"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and subsequently developed sepsis. The patient's altered mental status is a concern, and she has shown aggressive behavior. 

From the vital signs, it appears that the patient's temperature is within normal range, but her heart rate is slightly elevated. Her blood pressure is stable, and her respiratory rate is within normal limits. However, her oxygen saturation is 92%, indicating possible impaired oxygenation.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,923 mL and output of 2,080 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of 157 mL. This could indicate ongoing fluid losses or inadequate fluid resuscitation.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (metronidazole, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam), pain management (morphine sulfate), gastric protection (pantoprazole), and anticoagulation (heparin sodium).

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, suggesting an ongoing infection. The patient also has an elevated lactate level of 1.9 mmol/L, which may indicate tissue hypoperfusion or poor oxygenation. Other lab results show normal hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electroly"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 59-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is worsening somnolence and tachycardia with a heart rate of 140 beats per minute. The patient also has hypoxia with an oxygen saturation level of 89% on 6 liters of oxygen. The patient's blood pressure is within normal range, and there are concerns about possible pulmonary embolism (PE) and cardiac tamponade due to pulsus paradoxus observed on the monitor.

The patient has a history of allergies to Imdur (Oral) and experiences nausea/vomiting as a side effect. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, lorazepam, and others. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted worsening somnolence and tachycardia.

Vital signs show the patient to have a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), a current temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), a heart rate of 137 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/41 mmHg to 138/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished"
