","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) since December 12th. He has had multiple pneumonias caused by multi-drug resistant organisms. The patient presents with fever and respiratory distress.

Assessment and plan:
1. Fever: Multiple sources are possible, including respiratory and line infection. Also consider urine, biliary, or stool infection. Be cautious in treating sputum pathogens that may be colonizers and breed further resistance. Follow up with bronchoscopy and quantitative BAL culture.
2. Respiratory failure: Unclear about the clinical scenario that resulted in his return to mechanical ventilation. The ABG indicates good ventilation. Continue airway pressure control for now, wean FiO2, and follow up with cultures (BAL) as well as Hebr Reb cultures.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: Etiology unclear, could be due to contraction alkalosis secondary to hypovolemia. Has respiratory compensation. Received fluids in the emergency department. Bolused 500 cc, repeat labs stable, and monitor.
4. Hypotension: Transient in the emergency department, responded to IV fluid bolus. If hypotensive again, bolus to CVP 8-12 and then start a pressor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) since December 12th. He has had multiple pneumonias with multi-drug resistant organisms. The patient presents with fever and respiratory distress. His vital signs show elevated body temperature, slightly elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and high oxygen saturation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with controlled mandatory ventilation mode. His chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. The patient has several comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, reactive airway disease, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, anemia, Parkinson's disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and pneumonia suggest a possible infection. The culture results show sensitivity to certain antibiotics, indicating the need for targeted treatment.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's elevated bicarbonate levels may indicate metabolic alkalosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to hypovolemia or other underlying causes. Fluid resuscitation and pressor support may be necessary.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple admissions since [Month] for various conditions. He initially presented with subdural hematoma and subsequent admissions have been complicated by streptococcal bovis bacteremia, enterococcal aortic endocarditis, MRSA bacteremia, respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia requiring intubation and tracheostomy. Most recently, he was admitted to MICU in early [Month] with ESBL klebsiella and Acinetobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is now admitted with new fevers and left lower lobe infiltrate with pus in the bronchus.

The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress, and he has been on the ventilator since his admission to the MICU. His vital signs show a temperature of 38.7°C (101.7°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/66 mmHg to 143/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator.

His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the new onset of fevers and respiratory distress. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally, more pronounced on the left lower lobe, along with rhonchi. Other findings include a tracheostomy, soft and non-tender abdomen, and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and peg since December 12th. He has had multiple pneumonias with multi-drug resistant organisms. He presents with fever and respiratory distress. The patient's current condition includes fever, respiratory failure, metabolic alkalosis, hypotension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, reactive airway disease, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, anemia, Parkinson's disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of multiple pneumonias with multi-drug resistant organisms. There is a risk of worsening pneumonia or developing new infections due to the resistant organisms.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is unclear, but he has been placed back on ventilatory support. This indicates a potential complication related to his lungs or respiratory system.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which could be due to various factors such as hyperventilation or contractures. Monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent complications.

4. Hypotension: The patient experienced transient hypotension in the emergency department and responded to intravenous fluid bolus. If hypotension occurs again, further evaluation and management are required to maintain adequate blood pressure.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) since December 12th. He has had multiple pneumonias with multi-drug resistant organisms. The patient presents with fever and respiratory distress, and has been diagnosed with pneumonia. He is currently on ventilatory support and receiving treatment for multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter with amikacin and IV colistin. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, likely due to multi-drug resistant organisms. It is important to monitor his response to the antibiotics and assess for any worsening respiratory symptoms.

2. Ventilatory Failure: The patient is currently back on ventilatory support after being extubated during the day. His ABG indicates good ventilation, but he may require close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, with an unclear etiology. It is important to monitor his electrolyte levels and pH, and make appropriate adjustments to his treatment regimen.

4. Hypotension: The patient had transient hypotension in the emergency department but responded to IV fluid bolus. If he experiences hypotension again, further interventions such as bolus administration of fluids to target CVP 8-12 or initiation of pressors may be necessary.

5. Diabetes Mellitus"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of multiple admissions since [Month] for various conditions including subdural hematoma, strep bovis bacteremia, enterococcal aortic endocarditis, MRSA bacteremia, respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, and intubation requiring tracheostomy. Most recently, he was admitted to the MICU with ESBL klebs and acinetobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Now admitted with new fevers and left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate with pus in LLL on bronch. The patient is currently on amikacin and colistin IV for suspected infection. His vital signs include a temperature of 39.6 C (103.2 F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 126/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's presentation with new fevers and LLL infiltrate with pus suggests a possible pneumonia. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it can progress to severe respiratory failure and sepsis.
2. Line infection: Given the patient's multiple lines and IV access, there is a risk of developing a line infection. This can lead to localized infection and potentially systemic infection if the organisms are able to enter"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy since December 12th. He has had multiple pneumonias with multi-drug resistant organisms and presents with fever and respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and elevated respiratory rate. His oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and bronchoscopy findings suggest an ongoing pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued based on culture sensitivity results. Regular reassessment of the patient's clinical condition and follow-up cultures are essential.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's ABG results indicate metabolic alkalosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.
4. Hypotension: The patient's episodes of hypotension require careful monitoring and prompt intervention with intravenous fluid boluses or vasopressor therapy as needed.
5. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia needs close monitoring, and transfusion should be considered if the hematocrit level falls below 21 or in the presence of evidence of bleeding or end organ ischem"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) since December 12th. He has had multiple pneumonias caused by multi-drug resistant organisms. The patient presents with fever and respiratory distress.

Assessment:
1. Fever - likely due to pneumonia, given the presence of pus in the left lower lobe on bronchoscopy.
2. Respiratory failure - unclear how he ended up back on ventilatory support. ABG indicates good ventilation, but the patient appears uncomfortable with high respiratory rate.
3. Metabolic alkalosis - etiology unclear, possibly due to contraction alkalosis secondary to hypovolemia. Improving.
4. Hypotension - occurred in the emergency department and overnight, responded to intravenous fluid bolus. If hypotensive again, will bolus to central venous pressure (CVP) 8-12 and then start a pressor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and peg tube since December 12th, multiple pneumonias with multi-drug resistant organisms. He presents with fever, respiratory distress, and pus found in the left lower lobe during bronchoscopy. The patient has several comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, reactive airway disease, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, anemia, Parkinson's disease, and GERD. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support due to respiratory failure. His recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and platelets, with normal hemoglobin and creatinine levels. The respiratory culture indicates the presence of Gram-negative rods, and the sputum culture shows an overgrowth of Gram-negative rods as well. The patient's blood cultures from previous days show the growth of Acinetobacter, which is sensitive to tobramycin, amikacin, and bactrim. The patient is being treated with amikacin and colistin for the Acinetobacter infection.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. His respiratory rate is also elevated, and he has a fever. The patient's fluid balance is positive, indicating fluid overload.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, further infection due to multi-drug resistant organisms, renal dysfunction from amikacin and col"

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. The patient has been experiencing various medical issues since admission, including a spike in temperature to 102 degrees, intolerance to pressure support (PS) ventilation, hypotension, and hypotensive episodes requiring NS boluses. The patient's BAL culture grew Acinetobacter, which is sensitive to tobramycin. The patient's antibiotics have been changed multiple times, with the last dose of meropenem on 01/12/2169 at 04:14 PM. The patient is currently on lorazepam for sedation and has allergies to several medications. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension, with a blood pressure reading of 80/40 mmHg. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is receiving supplemental oxygen. The respiratory support settings include a set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%, and a respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.4, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 31 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 27 mEq/L. The patient's blood gas analysis also shows"

","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and peg since 2012, multiple pneumonias with multi-drug resistant organisms, presenting with fever and respiratory distress. The patient has been treated for multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter with amikacin and IV colistin. 

The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, requiring ventilatory support. He was previously weaned off the ventilator but had to be reintubated due to elevated CO2 levels and respiratory distress. An ABG indicates good ventilation, but the patient appears uncomfortable with a high respiratory rate.

The patient's metabolic alkalosis is improving, and he is being monitored closely. He has also experienced episodes of hypotension, which responded to intravenous fluid boluses. 

The patient has several chronic conditions, including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, reactive airway disease, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, anemia, and Parkinson's disease. These conditions are being managed accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient already has pneumonia caused by multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter, and there is a risk of developing new infections due to prolonged ventilatory support.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require continued ventilatory support, which carries its own risks.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: Although improving, the patient's metabolic alkal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and peg since December 2012, multiple pneumonias with multi-drug resistant organisms. He presents with fever, respiratory distress, and is found to have pseudomonal and acinetobacter pneumonia. The patient is currently on ventilatory support, antibiotics for multi-drug resistant acinetobacter and pseudomonas, and IV colistin. He also has a history of anemia, acute kidney injury (likely due to drug toxicity from antibiotics), diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypothyroidism, Parkinson's disease, GERD, and a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonal and acinetobacter pneumonia, which are both multi-drug resistant organisms. There is a concern for continued infection and potential worsening of respiratory distress.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. The patient appears uncomfortable with high respiratory rates, indicating inadequate ventilation.
3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension in the past, which have responded to intravenous fluid boluses. Further evaluation and management of hypotension are required.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute kidney injury, likely due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory Failure:  Secondary to pneumonia on top of multiple
   recent critical illnesses.
     -Will discuss with ID new dosing for colistin/amikacin given new
   acute renal failure.
     -PSV trial today
   2) Fever:  Pneumonia vs alternative infection vs drug fever.  No
   evidence of effusions on U/s yesterday

     -Check LFTs
     -Pneumonia treatment as above.
     -If fevers persist and no clear source, will change CVL.
   3) CKD:  Creatinie up today. Most likely etiologies amikacin/colistin
   vs hypotension
     -Avoid hypotension
     -Adjusting doses of antibiotics
     -Renally dose meds
     -Check urine eos.
   4) Anemia:
   No clinical evidence of blood loss.
   Guiac stools
   Transfuse PRBC for Hct 21.
   5) GOC:  Will continue ongoing discussions with wife, daughter
   regarding long-term plans

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory Failure:  Secondary to pneumonia on top of multiple
   recent critical illnesses.
     -Will discuss with ID new dosing for colistin/amikacin given new
   acute renal failure.
     -PSV trial today
   2) Fever:  Pneumonia vs alternative infection vs drug fever.  No
   evidence of effusions on U/s yesterday
     -Check Diff on CBC for eos
     -Check LFTs
     -Pneumonia treatment as above.
     -If fevers persist and no clear source, will change CVL.
   3) CKD:  Creatinie up today. Most likely etiologies amikacin/colistin
   vs hypotension
     -Avoid hypotension
     -Adjusting doses of antibiotics
     -Renally dose meds
     -Check urine eos.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several ongoing medical issues. Here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia on top of multiple recent critical illnesses. There are plans to discuss with the ID (infectious disease) new dosing for colistin/amikacin given the patient's acute renal failure. A PSV (pressure support ventilation) trial will be conducted today.

Potential complications: Respiratory failure may lead to worsening hypoxia, increased work of breathing, and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

2. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers, which could be due to pneumonia, alternative infection, or drug fever. No evidence of effusions on ultrasound was observed yesterday. Further investigations such as checking Diff on CBC for eos, checking LFTs, and pneumonia treatment as above will be pursued. If fevers persist and no clear source is identified, the CVL (central venous line) may be changed.

Potential complications: Persistent fever could indicate an ongoing infection or drug reaction. If left untreated, it may lead to sepsis or septic shock.

3. CKD (chronic kidney disease): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated today, most likely due to amikacin/colistin or hypotension. Measures to avoid hypotension, adjust antibiotic doses, reneal dose medications, and check urine"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and peg tube since December 12th. He has had multiple pneumonias with multi-drug resistant organisms and presents with fever, respiratory distress, and pseudomonal and acinetobacter pneumonia. The patient continues to spike fevers and has been experiencing respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support. He also has intermittent hypotension, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypothyroidism, Parkinson's disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonal and acinetobacter pneumonia, which are both multi-drug resistant. This increases the risk of treatment failure and possible progression of the infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires ventilatory support, indicating severe lung dysfunction. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
3. Hypotension: The patient's intermittent hypotension may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion and increased risk of organ damage.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to drug toxicity from antibiotics, as indicated by urine eosinophils. This condition requires close monitoring and potential adjustment of medications.
5. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia needs ongoing management, and transfusion criteria should be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) since December 2012, multiple pneumonias with multi-drug resistant organisms, and current presentation with fever, respiratory distress, and positive cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.

The patient's condition is summarized as follows:
1. Fever: The patient continues to spike fevers, which could be due to pneumonia (PNA) or drug fever. Further discussion with the Infectious Disease (ID) team is planned.
2. Pneumonia: There is evidence of pus in the left lower lobe (LLL) on bronchoscopy. The patient will continue treatment for multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas with amikacin and IV colistin.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient appears uncomfortable with a high respiratory rate (RR) and is receiving ventilatory support. A trial of pressure support (PS) is planned.
4. Hypotension: The patient has intermittent episodes of hypotension, which respond to intravenous fluid (IVF) bolus. A plan to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) between 8-12 and start a pressor if necessary is in place.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has acute-on-chronic"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory Failure:  Secondary to pneumonia on top of multiple
   recent critical illnesses.  Failed PSV trial this morning.
     -Appreciate ID input regarding new amikacin dose.
   2) Fever:  Pneumonia vs alternative infection vs drug fever.  Mild
   peripheral eosinophilia could argue for drug fever. LFTs nml.
     -Pneumonia treatment as above.
   3) CKD:  Creatinine up today. Most likely etiologies amikacin/colistin
   vs hypotension.  Urine eos positive.  Renal U/S without clear
   obstruction.
     -Avoid hypotension
     -Adjusting doses of antibiotics
     -Renally dose meds
   4.) Hypotension:  Intermittent, fluid responsive
     -Check CVP
   5) Anemia:  No clinical evidence of blood loss.
     -Transfuse PRBC for Hct 21.
   6) GOC:  Appreciate Palliative care input.  After multiple discussions,
   plan at present is to attempt to aggressively try to treat PNA with
   goal of getting him back to rehab with ultimate goal of vent weaning
   and going home (likely to pass away). If/when he makes it to rehab, the
   family would prefer to not rehospitalize him if he worsens.

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory Failure:  Secondary to pneumonia on top of multiple
   recent critical illnesses.  Failed PSV trial this morning.
     -Appreciate ID input regarding new amikacin dose.
   2) Fever:  Pneumonia vs alternative infection vs drug fever.  Mild
   peripheral eosinophilia could argue for drug fever. LFTs nml.
     -Pneumonia treatment as above.
   3) CKD:  Creatinine up today. Most likely etiologies amikacin/colistin
   vs hypotension.  Urine eos positive.  Renal U/S without clear
   obstruction.
     -Avoid hypotension
     -Adjusting doses of antibiotics
     -Renally dose meds
   4.) Hypotension:  Intermittent, fluid responsive
     -IVF bolus as required
     -Check CVP
   5) Anemia:  No clinical evidence of blood loss.
     -Transfuse PRBC for Hct 21.
   6) GOC:  Appreciate Palliative care input.  After multiple discussions,
   plan at present is to attempt to aggressively try to treat PNA with
   goal of getting him back to rehab with ultimate goal of vent weaning
   and going home (likely to pass away). If/when he makes it to rehab, the
   family would prefer to not rehospitalize him if he worsens.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. They have a history of encephalopathy, tracheostomy, and multiple allergies. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, fever of unknown origin, chronic kidney disease (CKD), intermittent hypotension, anemia, and gastrointestinal obstruction (GOC).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to pneumonia on top of multiple critical illnesses. They failed a pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial this morning. The treatment plan includes pneumonia treatment as mentioned above and may require additional respiratory support.

2. Fever: The patient has an ongoing fever of unknown origin, which could be due to pneumonia, alternative infection, or drug fever. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the fever, and appropriate treatment should be initiated accordingly.

3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated today, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. The likely causes could be amikacin/colistin antibiotics or hypotension. The treatment plan involves avoiding hypotension, adjusting doses of antibiotics, and considering renal dosing of medications.

4. Hypotension: The patient experiences intermittent hypotension, which is responsive to fluid administration. Intravenous fluid boluses may be given as required, and central venous pressure (CVP) should be monitored.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) since December 12th. He has had multiple pneumonias caused by multi-drug resistant organisms and presents with fever, respiratory distress, and positive cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. He continues to spike fevers despite antibiotic treatment.

Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia with pus found in the left lower lobe during bronchoscopy. He is being treated with antibiotics targeting multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas species.

2. Hypotension: The patient experiences intermittent hypotension, which responds to intravenous fluid boluses. He received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) on January 18th, with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure on top of chronic kidney disease, with a baseline creatinine level of 1.3. Drug toxicity from antibiotics is suspected as the cause, as evidenced by eosinophilia in the urine. Renal ultrasound, urine electrolytes, and discussion about goals of care, including dialysis, are needed.

4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia but is stable, receiving one unit of PRBC"

   66 y.o. man with complicated history, trach/peg since [**12-12**], multiple
   pneumonias with multi-drug resistent organisms, presents with fever,
   respiratory distress, found to have pseudomonal and acenitobacter
   PNAs.  Continues to spike fevers.
   # Fever.  Continues to spike.  102 on [**1-18**].  Could be due to PNA (see
   plan below) vs drug fever (+ urinary and peripheral EOS)
   - may need to consider gram + coverage (will speak to ID)
   - cont colistin/amikacin; we are limited in our choices given the
   resistant organisms
   - f/u sensitivities (asked micro to run amikacin)
   - monitor
   - CIS
   # Pneumonia - pus in LLL on bronchoscopy
 no evidence for other
   sources on lab/micro data.
   - continue treatment for multi-drug resistent acinetobacter and
   pseudomonas with amikacin/IV colistin ([**2169-1-12**] - )
   - changed amikacin dosing interval due to renal function
   - our lab will run the BAL specimen for amikacin sensitivity
   - [**Hospital 858**] Rehab culture data is final , ph [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3918**]
   - ventilatory support as below
   - f/u amikacin peak and trough (send out)
   # Respiratory failure: On AC/vol control ventilation
   - VBG on [**1-15**] indicated good ventilation, correlated well with prior
   ABGs
   - started Ativan on [**2169-1-13**] -  1mg IV Q4H PRN for anxiety and comfort,
   although family requests limiting it
   - trial of PS daily
   - antibiotics as above for PNA
   # Hypotension: Intermittent.  Responds to IVF bolus.  [**1-18**] - got 1 unit
   PRBCs, CVP was 10
   - bolus to CVP 8-12 prn hypotension, and then start pressor if c/w

   # ARF  acute on chronic failure,with baseline creatinine 1.3. Etiology
   is likely due to drug toxicity from antiobiotics - urine eos +
   -- f/u renal u/s
 no hydro
   -- urine lytes, not pre-renal
   -- changed interval of amikacin; to consider changing colistin to
   inhaled per ID
   -- continue hydration, TFs
   -- need to discuss goals of care with family; ie dialysis etc
   # Anemia: Chronic per records but below baseline.  Stable.    Got 1
   unit PRBCs [**2169-1-18**] for borderline BPs
   - guaiac negative

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy since December 12th. He has had multiple pneumonias caused by multi-drug resistant organisms and presents with fever, respiratory distress, and pseudomonal and acinetobacter pneumonia. The patient continues to spike fevers, which may be due to pneumonia or drug fever. He is being treated with colistin/amikacin for the multi-drug resistant acinetobacter and pseudomonas infections. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely due to drug toxicity from antibiotics, and requires close monitoring of renal function. Other medical conditions include chronic anemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypothyroidism, Parkinson's disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient has a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has pseudomonal and acinetobacter pneumonia, and his fever spikes indicate an ongoing infection. This requires continuous treatment with appropriate antibiotics.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on assisted ventilation and requires careful monitoring and adjustment of ventilatory support to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Hypotension: The patient has intermittent hypotension, which responds to intravenous fluid bolus. Close monitoring and prompt treatment are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory Failure:  Secondary to pneumonia on top of multiple
   recent critical illnesses.  Failed PSV trial this morning.
     -Aim for volume status/CVP of 8 given rising Cr, no plans for
   diuresis at present
     -Continue PSV challenges
    2) Fever:  Pneumonia vs alternative infection vs drug fever.  Mild
   peripheral eosinophilia could argue for drug fever. LFTs nml.
     -Add empiric vancomycin for now given CVC.  If positive blood
   cultures will pull, but plan is to leave for now given low suspicion of
   line infection.
     -Given rising creatinine, ID recommending to change IV colistin to
   nebs.
    3) CKD:  Creatinine up again today. Most likely etiologies
   amikacin/colistin vs hypotension.  Urine eos positive.  Renal U/S
   without clear obstruction.
     -Avoid hypotension
     -Adjusting doses of antibiotics
     -Renally dose meds
    4.) Hypotension:  Intermittent, fluid responsive
     -IVF bolus as required
     -CVP goal [**8-16**]
    5) Anemia:  No clinical evidence of blood loss.  Bumped appropriately
   to 1 unit PRBC overnight.
   6) GOC:  Appreciate Palliative care input.  After multiple discussions,
   plan at present is to attempt to aggressively try to treat PNA with
   goal of getting him back to rehab with ultimate goal of vent weaning
   and going home (likely to pass away). If/when he makes it to rehab, the
   family would prefer to not rehospitalize him if he worsens.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, on top of previous critical illnesses. The patient's fever is suspected to be caused by pneumonia, drug fever, or an alternative infection. The patient also has acute kidney injury with rising creatinine levels, possibly due to amikacin/colistin or hypotension. Urine eosinophilia is positive, and there is no clear obstruction on renal ultrasound. The patient has intermittent hypotension that is fluid-responsive. Anemia has been identified, but there is no clinical evidence of blood loss. The patient's goal of care is to aggressively treat pneumonia with the aim of getting back to rehab and eventually going home. However, the family prefers not to rehospitalize the patient if they worsen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to pneumonia, which may worsen if the infection progresses or if the patient's underlying critical condition deteriorates.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia needs to be managed aggressively with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care to prevent further deterioration of respiratory function.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury, which can be caused by amikacin/colistin or hypotension. Adjusting antibiotic doses and avoiding hypotension are important to prevent further renal damage.

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory Failure:  Secondary to pneumonia on top of multiple
   recent critical illnesses.  Failed PSV trial this morning.
     -Aim for volume status/CVP of 8 given rising Cr, no plans for
   diuresis at present
     -Continue PSV challenges
    2) Fever:  Pneumonia vs alternative infection vs drug fever.  Mild
   peripheral eosinophilia could argue for drug fever. LFTs nml.
     -Add empiric vancomycin for now given CVC.  If positive blood
   cultures will pull, but plan is to leave for now given low suspicion of
   line infection.
     -Given rising creatinine, ID recommending to change IV colistin to
   nebs.
    3) CKD:  Creatinine up again today. Most likely etiologies
   amikacin/colistin vs hypotension.  Urine eos positive.  Renal U/S
   without clear obstruction.
     -Avoid hypotension
     -Adjusting doses of antibiotics
     -Renally dose meds
    4.) Hypotension:  Intermittent, fluid responsive
     -IVF bolus as required
     -CVP goal [**8-16**]
    5) Anemia:  No clinical evidence of blood loss.  Bumped appropriately
   to 1 unit PRBC overnight.
   6) GOC:  Appreciate Palliative care input.  After multiple discussions,
   plan at present is to attempt to aggressively try to treat PNA with
   goal of getting him back to rehab with ultimate goal of vent weaning
   and going home (likely to pass away). If/when he makes it to rehab, the
   family would prefer to not rehospitalize him if he worsens.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of multiple recent critical illnesses. They are currently experiencing respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, fever, acute kidney injury (CKD), intermittent hypotension, anemia, and goal of care (GOC) discussions. The patient has a tracheostomy, is on mechanical ventilation, and has been diagnosed with pneumonia that is resistant to penicillins. They have an elevated creatinine level and positive urine eosinophilia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/73 to 128/92 mmHg, respiratory rate in the high 30s, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to pneumonia on top of multiple recent critical illnesses. They failed a partial spontaneous ventilation (PSV) trial this morning. The aim is to maintain volume status/CVP of 8 given rising creatinine, without plans for diuresis at present. Continuous PSV challenges will be continued.

2. Fever: The patient has a fever, which could be due to pneumonia, alternative infection, or drug fever. Mild peripheral eosinophilia could argue for drug fever. LFTs are normal. Empiric vancomycin has been added given central venous catheter (CVC). If positive blood cultures are obtained, it will"

   66 y.o. man with complicated history, trach/peg since [**12-12**], multiple
   pneumonias with multi-drug resistent organisms, presents with fever,
   respiratory distress, found to have pseudomonal and acenitobacter
   PNAs.  Continues to spike fevers.
   # Fever.  Continues to spike.  Could be due to PNA (see plan below) vs
   drug fever (+ urinary and peripheral EOS) vs alternative source
   (line).  Less likely due to the line as it was new upon admission and
   he never defervesced.
   - added  Vanco [**1-18**]  for gram + coverage
   - cultured from the line [**1-18**]; f/u all other cultures
   - remove and replace CVL
   - ABX: we are limited in our choices given the resistant organisms - on

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) since December 2012, multiple pneumonias caused by multi-drug resistant organisms, and current symptoms of fever, respiratory distress, and positive cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The patient is admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, hypotension, acute kidney injury, anemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypothyroidism, Parkinson's disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He is being treated with various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and blood pressure medications. The patient's condition is complex and requires careful monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has multiple positive cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, indicating ongoing infection. The choice of antibiotics may need to be adjusted based on the sensitivities of the organisms.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on assisted ventilation due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. Adjustments in ventilator settings may be required based on the patient's response.
3. Hypotension: The patient experiences intermittent hypotension that responds to intravenous fluid boluses. If the hypotension persists, vasopressor support may be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and peg tube since December 12th, multiple pneumonias with multi-drug resistant organisms, and current presentation of fever, respiratory distress, and positive cultures for pseudomonal and acinetobacter pneumonia.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already on AC/vol control ventilation due to respiratory distress. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilatory support may be necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has ongoing fevers and positive cultures for multi-drug resistant organisms (pseudomonal and acinetobacter). It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy as per sensitivities.
3. Hypotension: The patient has intermittent hypotension which responds to IV fluid bolus. Further evaluation and management may be required, including consideration of pressor support if necessary.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure on top of chronic kidney disease. Drug toxicity from antibiotics is suspected, and renal function should be closely monitored. Renal ultrasonography, urine electrolytes, and discussion about goals of care, including dialysis, are needed.
5. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia which is stable but below baseline. Blood transfusion may be required for borderline blood pressures or evidence of bleeding or end organ ischemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory Failure:  Secondary to pneumonia on top of multiple
   recent critical illnesses.  Failed PSV trial again this morning.
   Difficult to optimize volume status given developing renal failure
   although he appears to be auto-diuresing today in the setting of
   non-oliguric renal failure
     -Holding on diuresis for now
     -Continue PSV challenges
    2) Fever:  Pneumonia vs alternative infection vs drug fever.  Mild
   peripheral eosinophilia could argue for drug fever. LFTs nml.
     -Add empiric vancomycin for now given CVC.  Will change CVC today.
     -Given new resistance pattern of PSA, will discuss with ID regarding
   ?changing amikacin to tobramcyin.
    3) CKD:  Creatinine up again today. Most likely etiologies
   amikacin/colistin vs hypotension.  Urine eos positive.  Renal U/S
   without clear obstruction.
     -Avoid hypotension
     -Adjusting doses of antibiotics
     -Renally dose meds
    4.) Hypotension:  Intermittent, fluid responsive
     -IVF bolus as required
     -CVP goal [**8-16**]
    5) Anemia:  No clinical evidence of blood loss.
     -Transfusion goal >21%.
    6) GOC:  Appreciate Palliative care input.  After multiple
   discussions, plan at present is to attempt to aggressively try to treat
   PNA with goal of getting him back to rehab with ultimate goal of vent
   weaning and going home (likely to pass away). If/when he makes it to
   rehab, the family would prefer to not rehospitalize him if he worsens.
   This may need to be readdressed soon as he does not appear to be
   improving.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, developing renal failure, fever of unknown origin, anemia, and gastrointestinal obstruction. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications and is currently receiving multiple intravenous infusions. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated body temperature. The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's condition requires aggressive treatment and close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to pneumonia, and there is a concern about optimizing volume status due to developing renal failure. The patient has already failed a pressure support ventilation trial.
2. Fever: The patient has a fever of unknown origin, which could be due to pneumonia, alternative infection, or drug fever. Empiric vancomycin has been added given the central venous catheter, and the possibility of changing amikacin to tobramycin is being considered.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, suggesting renal impairment. The most likely etiologies are amikacin/colistin toxicity or hypotension. Urine eosinophilia is positive, and a renal ultrasound has shown no clear obstruction.
4. Hypotension: The patient experiences intermittent hypotension, which is potentially fluid responsive"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition has been worsening, with fever reaching 101.4 degrees overnight. The patient failed a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to tachypnea. The patient's history is obtained from medical records as they are unable to provide a history due to encephalopathy and tracheostomy.

The patient has several medical allergies, including anaphylaxis to penicillins, hives from heparin agents, and unknown reactions to Lisinopril and cimetidine. The patient received amikacin, colistin, and vancomycin, which were discontinued on 01/17, 01/18, and 01/18 respectively. The patient is currently on fentanyl and lorazepam infusions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 100/57 to 133/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the new development of fever.

The patient's flow sheet data shows ongoing fluid imbalance with a total input of 2,766 mL and total output of 3,214 mL since 12 AM. The patient's respiratory support consists of a tracheostomy tube with"

   Sputum [**1-15**]: Pseudomonas resistent to amikacin

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y.o. man with complicated history, trach/peg since [**12-12**], multiple
   pneumonias with multi-drug resistent organisms, presents with fever,
   respiratory distress, found to have pseudomonal and acenitobacter
   PNAs.  Continues to spike fevers.
   # Fever.  Continues to spike although low grad.  Could be due to PNA
   (see plan below) vs drug fever (+ urinary and peripheral EOS) vs
   alternative source (line).  Less likely due to the line as it was new
   upon admission and he never defervesced.
   - pulled CVL [**1-19**]
   - added  Vanco [**1-18**]  for gram + coverage
   - f/u cultures, esp blood
   - ABX: we are limited in our choices given the resistant organisms - on
   Colistin IH/Amikacin since [**2169-1-12**], and Vanco since [**1-18**]
   - check vanco level in AM [**1-21**]; amikacin level good
   - CIS
   # Pneumonia - pus in LLL on bronchoscopy
 no evidence for other
   sources on lab/micro data.   ID recs appreciated.
   - continue treatment for multi-drug resistent acinetobacter and
   pseudomonas with Amikacin/Colistin ([**2169-1-12**] - ); vanco([**1-18**] -)
   - f/u micor and sensitivities - some of the pseudomonas spp are
   resistent to amikacin but sensitive to tobramycin- no ABX change per ID
   - [**Hospital 858**] Rehab culture data is final , ph [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3918**]
   - ventilatory support as below
   - amikacin trough was appropriate
   # Respiratory failure: On AC/vol control ventilation
   - VBG on [**1-15**] indicated good ventilation, correlated well with prior
   ABGs
   - started Ativan on [**2169-1-13**] -  change dose given renal failure - for
   anxiety and comfort, although family requests limiting it
   - trial of PS daily
 did not tolerate on [**1-19**] (tachypneic)
   - antibiotics as above for PNA
   # Hypotension: Intermittent.  Responds to IVF bolus.  [**1-18**] - got 1 unit
   PRBCs
   - bolus to CVP 8-12 prn hypotension, and then start pressor if c/w
   family goals
   # ARF  Creatinine is rising - acute on chronic failure,with baseline
   creatinine 1.3. Etiology is likely due to drug toxicity from
   antiobiotics - urine eos +
   -- Cr continues to rise
   -- f/u renal u/s
 no hydro
   -- urine lytes, not pre-renal
   -- changed interval of amikacin; trough was good;  changed colistin to
   inhaled per ID
   -- continue hydration (bolus prn), TFs
   -- Dialysis NOT within patient/family's wishes/goal of care
   # Anemia: Chronic per records but below baseline.  Stable.    Got 1
   unit PRBCs [**2169-1-18**] for borderline BPs
   - guaiac negative
   - trend HCT daily
   - transfuse for Hct < 21, or for evidence bleeding or end organ
   ischemia
    # DM2:
   -- continue Glargine and ISS.  FS but change to [**Hospital1 **]
   # HTN:
   -- Hold antihypertensives while BP borderline
   # Hypothyroidism:
   -- continue synthroid
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue Sinemet, Ropinirole, no Artain per
   neuron as mayy worsen delirium
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   # h/o HIT:  Avoid all heparin products

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) since December 2012. He has had multiple pneumonias with multi-drug resistant organisms. The patient presents with fever, respiratory distress, and is found to have Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia. He continues to spike fevers.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Fever: The patient's fever is likely due to pneumonia but could also be caused by drug fever or an alternative source. It is less likely to be caused by the central venous line as it was new upon admission and he never defervesced. The plan is to pull the CVL, add vancomycin for gram-positive coverage, follow up with cultures, especially blood, and continue antibiotic therapy with colistin and amikacin.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia with pus in the left lower lobe on bronchoscopy. There is no evidence of other sources on lab/micro data. The Infectious Disease recommendations are appreciated. The plan is to continue treatment for multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas with amikacin/colistin and vancomycin.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on assisted ventilation control due to respiratory failure. The plan is to monitor ventilation and adjust settings as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y.o. man with complicated history, trach/peg since [**12-12**], multiple
   pneumonias with multi-drug resistent organisms, presents with fever,
   respiratory distress, found to have pseudomonal and acenitobacter
   PNAs.  Continues to spike fevers.
   # Fever.  Continues to spike although low grad.  Could be due to PNA
   (see plan below) vs drug fever (+ urinary and peripheral EOS) vs
   alternative source (line).  Less likely due to the line as it was new
   upon admission and he never defervesced.
   - pulled CVL [**1-19**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy since December 12th. He has had multiple pneumonias caused by multi-drug resistant organisms and currently presents with fever, respiratory distress, and pseudomonal and acinetobacter pneumonia. The patient continues to spike fevers, which could be due to pneumonia or drug fever. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fever: Continue to monitor and evaluate the cause of the fever, considering pneumonia, drug fever, or alternative sources such as a line infection.
   - Pulled CVL on 1/19.
   - Added Vancomycin for gram+ coverage on 1/18.
   - Follow-up cultures, especially blood.
   - Antibiotics: Limited options due to resistant organisms; continue with Colistin IH/Amikacin since 1/12, and Vancomycin since 1/18.
   - Check vancomycin and amikacin levels.
   - Consider CIS.

2. Pneumonia: Continue treatment for multi-drug resistant acinetobacter and pseudomonas with Amikacin/Colistin since 1/12; vancomycin since 1/18.
   - Follow-up microbiology and sensitivities.
   - Some pseudomonas spp. are resistant to amikacin but sensitive to tobramycin - no ABX change"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory Failure:  Secondary to pneumonia on top of multiple
   recent critical illnesses.  Failed PSV trial again this morning.
   Difficult to optimize volume status given developing renal failure
   although he appears to be auto-diuresing today in the setting of
   non-oliguric renal failure
     -Holding on diuresis for now, will shoot for even fluid balance given
   progressive renal failure
     -Continue PSV challenges
    2) Fever:  Pneumonia vs alternative infection vs drug fever. CVC now
   removed.  At this point, this seems most likely related to
   un([**Doctor Last Name **])treated PNA
      -Monitor fever curve with CVC out and on PNA abx.
      -Per ID, they would not recommend changing amikacin to tobramycin
    3) CKD:  Creatinine up again today. Most likely etiologies
   amikacin/colistin vs hypotension.  Urine eos positive.  Renal U/S
   without clear obstruction.
     -Avoid hypotension
     -Adjusting doses of antibiotics
     -Renally dose meds
    4.) Hypotension:  Intermittent, fluid responsive
      -IVF bolus as required
      -CVP goal [**8-16**]
    5) Anemia:  No clinical evidence of blood loss.
     -Transfusion goal >21%.
    6) GOC:  Appreciate Palliative care input.  Medical team met with
   family again [**1-19**].  They would prefere to keep attempting to treat PNA
   for now, but do not want to consider RRT if renal function
   progressively worsens.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history includes obesity, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient has undergone various interventions and treatments, including tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation, and antibiotic therapy. The patient's current condition is complicated by respiratory failure, fever, anemia, and worsening renal function. The medical team is working to manage the patient's condition and provide appropriate care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to pneumonia and multiple critical illnesses. The patient failed a partial spontaneous ventilation (PSV) trial again, indicating ongoing respiratory distress. Optimizing volume status is challenging due to developing renal failure, and the patient appears to be auto-diuresing. Diuretic therapy will be continued, and efforts will be made to achieve an even fluid balance. PSV challenges persist.

2. Fever: The patient has a persistent fever, which could be attributed to pneumonia, alternative infection, or drug fever. The central venous catheter (CVC) has been removed, and the patient is being monitored for fever curve improvement with continued pneumonia antibiotic therapy.

3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating worsening renal function. Eosinophiluria is positive, suggesting possible drug-induced nephrotoxicity from amikacin or colistin. Renal ultrasound shows no clear obstruction. Measures will be taken to avoid"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory Failure:  Secondary to pneumonia on top of multiple
   recent critical illnesses.  Failed PSV trial again this morning.
   Difficult to optimize volume status given developing renal failure
   although he appears to be auto-diuresing today in the setting of
   non-oliguric renal failure
     -Holding on diuresis for now, will shoot for even fluid balance given
   progressive renal failure
     -Continue PSV challenges
    2) Fever:  Pneumonia vs alternative infection vs drug fever. CVC now
   removed.  At this point, this seems most likely related to
   un([**Doctor Last Name **])treated PNA
      -Monitor fever curve with CVC out and on PNA abx.
      -Per ID, they would not recommend changing amikacin to tobramycin
    3) CKD:  Creatinine up again today. Most likely etiologies
   amikacin/colistin vs hypotension.  Urine eos positive.  Renal U/S
   without clear obstruction.
     -Avoid hypotension
     -Adjusting doses of antibiotics
     -Renally dose meds
    4.) Hypotension:  Intermittent, fluid responsive
      -IVF bolus as required
      -CVP goal [**8-16**]
    5) Anemia:  No clinical evidence of blood loss.
     -Transfusion goal >21%.
    6) GOC:  Appreciate Palliative care input.  Medical team met with
   family again [**1-19**].  They would prefere to keep attempting to treat PNA
   for now, but do not want to consider RRT if renal function
   progressively worsens.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), who presents with fever, respiratory distress, and has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) such as pseudomonas and acinetobacter. He continues to spike fevers despite being on appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient's persistent low-grade fever may be due to pneumonia, drug fever, or an alternative source such as a central venous line (CVL). Further investigation is required to identify the cause.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by multi-drug resistant acinetobacter and pseudomonas. Continued treatment with amikacin and colistin is recommended.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on assisted ventilation due to respiratory failure. Ventilatory support will be continued based on the patient's condition.
4. Hypotension: The patient experiences intermittent hypotension, which responds to intravenous fluid (IVF) bolus. Blood transfusion and pressor therapy may be required if hypotension persists.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, likely due to drug toxicity from antibiotics. Further evaluation of renal function is necessary, including urine analysis, electrolyte levels, and consideration of dialysis"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y.o. man with complicated history, trach/peg since [**12-12**], multiple
   pneumonias with multi-drug resistent organisms, presents with fever,
   respiratory distress, found to have pseudomonal and acenitobacter
   PNAs.  Continues to spike fevers although low grade.
   # Fever.  Low grade.  Could be due to PNA (see plan below) vs drug
   fever (+ urinary and peripheral EOS) vs alternative source (line).
   - pulled CVL [**1-19**]
   - added  Vanco [**1-18**]  for gram + coverage; can stop today as no sig
   growth from line
   - f/u cultures
   - ABX: we are limited in our choices given the resistant organisms - on
   Colistin IH/Amikacin since [**2169-1-12**], and Vanco since [**1-18**] (will stop
   today)
   - check vanco level in AM [**1-21**]; amikacin level good
   - CIS
   # Pneumonia - pus in LLL on bronchoscopy
 no evidence for other
   sources on lab/micro data.   ID recs appreciated.
   - continue treatment for multi-drug resistent acinetobacter and
   pseudomonas with Amikacin/Colistin ([**2169-1-12**] - )
   - f/u micor and sensitivities - some of the pseudomonas spp are
   resistent to amikacin but sensitive to tobramycin- no ABX change per ID
   - [**Hospital 858**] Rehab culture data is final , ph [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3918**]
   - ventilatory support as below
   - amikacin trough was appropriate
   # Respiratory failure: On AC/vol control ventilation
   - VBG on [**1-15**] indicated good ventilation, correlated well with prior
   ABGs
   - started Ativan on [**2169-1-13**] -  change dose given renal failure - for
   anxiety and comfort, although family requests limiting it
   - SBT trial and trach mask if tolerates
   - check NIF
   - repeat CXR today
   - antibiotics as above for PNA
   # Hypnatremia
   - increase free H20 boluses via PEG
   # ARF  Creatinine is rising - acute on chronic failure,with baseline
   creatinine 1.3. Etiology is likely due to drug toxicity from
   antiobiotics - urine eos +
   -- Cr has continued to rise, today's level pending
   -- f/u renal u/s
 no hydro
   -- urine lytes, not pre-renal
   -- changed interval of amikacin; trough was good;  changed colistin to
   inhaled per ID
   -- continue hydration (bolus prn), TFs
   -- Dialysis NOT within patient/family's wishes/goal of care
   # Anemia: Chronic per records but below baseline.  Stable.    Got 1
   unit PRBCs [**2169-1-18**] for borderline BPs
   - guaiac negative
   - trend HCT daily
   - transfuse for Hct < 21, or for evidence bleeding or end organ
   ischemia
    # DM2:
   -- continue Glargine and ISS.  FS but change to [**Hospital1 **]
   # HTN:
   -- Hold antihypertensives while BP borderline
   # Hypothyroidism:
   -- continue synthroid
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue Sinemet, Ropinirole, no Artain per
   neuron as mayy worsen delirium
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   # h/o HIT:  Avoid all heparin products

","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) since December 12th. He has had multiple pneumonias with multi-drug resistant organisms and presents with fever, respiratory distress, and is found to have Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter pneumoniae.

The patient continues to spike fevers, although they are low-grade. The possible causes of fever include pneumonia, drug fever (due to urinary and peripheral eosinophils) or an alternative source (such as a central venous line). The central venous line has been pulled, and Vancomycin has been added for gram-positive coverage, which can be stopped today as there was no significant growth from the line.

The patient is currently being treated with Colistin intravenously and Amikacin since January 12th, and Vancomycin since January 18th (which will be stopped today). The patient's vancomycin level will be checked in the morning, and amikacin level is good.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and pus was found in the left lower lobe on bronchoscopy. There is no evidence of other sources on lab/micro data. The Infectious Disease recommendations are appreciated, and treatment for multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas should continue with Amikacin/Colistin.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure and"

The patient was started on antibiotics including amikacin, colistin, and vancomycin. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 113 beats per minute, hypotension with blood pressure ranging from 68-78 mmHg, and increased respiratory rate at 27 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 100% on supplemental oxygen through the tracheostomy tube.

Fluid balance reveals an intake of 3,103 mL with outputs totaling 1,195 mL through urine, 1,813 mL through TF (possibly tube feeds), and 341 mL through IV fluids. The patient's blood products and stool outputs are within normal range. 

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 229 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels indicating renal impairment, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. The platelet count is within normal range. 

The patient is currently on minimal ventilator settings and is planned for a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, who presented with respiratory failure due to multi-organism ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has undergone a tracheostomy and was placed on mechanical ventilation. Despite treatment with antibiotics, the patient's condition worsened, leading to the current admission with new respiratory failure. Bronchoscopy confirmed pneumonia with purulent secretions, and sputum culture results showed positive for Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella. The patient also developed acute renal failure (ARF) from medications and acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

24-Hour Events:
- Low-grade temperature of 100.6°F
- Thick tan secretions requiring suctioning every 4 hours
- Urine output of 1.1 liters
- Attempted weaning from mechanical ventilation yesterday but did not tolerate

Medications:
- Vancomycin (last dose on 01/18/2169 at 02:00 PM)
- Amikacin (last dose on 01/19/2169 at 04:00 PM)
- Colistin (last dose on 01/20/2169 at 04:00 AM)
- Fentanyl (last dose on 01/20/2169 at 05:06 PM)

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing respiratory failure due to multi-organism ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has undergone tracheostomy and is now on mechanical ventilation. The sputum culture is positive for Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure (ARF) and acute kidney injury (AIN/ATN) from medications. 

The patient has allergies to penicillins, heparin agents, and Lisinopril. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin on 01/18/2169 at 02:00 PM, Amikacin on 01/19/2169 at 04:00 PM, and Colistin on 01/20/2169 at 04:00 AM. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 100.6°F, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/59 mmHg to 119/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a sinus tachycardia rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,103 mL and output of 1,195 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,908 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a tracheostomy tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 12 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 19 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 15 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%, and spontaneous respiratory rate (RR) of 0 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 7.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, sodium level of 139 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.3 mg/dL, glucose level of 81 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, and platelet count of 229 K/uL. The patient's blood cultures were negative.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pulmonary - Pneumonia: The patient is on Amikacin and inhaled Colistin. A follow-up amikacin level will be sent today, and a repeat chest X-ray will be performed today.
2. Pulmonary - Minimal vent settings: The patient will undergo a spontaneous breathing trial today. If tolerated, the patient will be switched to a tracheostomy collar.
3. Renal - Sodium level is high, so the patient's fluid warmers will be increased to 200cc q4h. Sodium levels will be followed every 6 hours.
4. Infectious Disease - Continue Amikacin and Colistin nebulizations. Vancomycin will be discontinued since blood cultures were negative.
5. Hematology - Crit goal >21%. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis will be given with Fondaparinux.
6. Endocrinology - Sugars were stable on glargine. Insulin SS will be used.
7. ICU - Access: Consider IR-guided PICC on Tuesday if access remains a problem. DNR status will be maintained. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) will be continued.
8. Disposition - The patient will be set up for rehabilitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's underlying respiratory failure and VAP put him at risk for further pulmonary complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and lung abscess.
2. Renal Complications: The patient's acute kidney injury (AIN/ATN) from medications may worsen, leading to renal failure.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's unstable blood pressure and potential for hypotension during weaning off mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications like septic shock.
4. Infectious Disease Complications: Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, the patient may develop resistance or a new infection, increasing the risk of healthcare-associated infections.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness may predispose the patient to gastrointestinal complications such as stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Thromboembolic Complications: The patient's immob"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of subdural hematoma, fall, presumed enterococcus aortic endocarditis, and tracheostomy. He was admitted to the hospital due to fever and respiratory failure, requiring re-initiation of mechanical ventilation. The patient developed multi-organism ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and was started on antibiotics (Amikacin and Colistin) via nebulizer. He remains febrile and is still on mechanical ventilation. The patient has Parkinson's disease and is weak, likely due to critical illness myopathy or neuropathy. His renal function has declined, possibly from drug toxicity, and he has acute kidney injury (AIN). The patient is receiving tube feeds through a gastrostomy tube and is being managed for his endocrine and neurological conditions. His code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and he is awaiting evaluation by rehabilitation services.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Febrile: The patient's ongoing fever indicates an unresolved infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, requiring continued mechanical ventilation.
3. Multi-organism ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed a multi-organism infection, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially spread to other organs.
4. Acute kidney injury (AIN): The patient's renal function has declined, possibly from drug toxicity, which can lead"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of subdural hematoma, presumed enterococcus aortic endocarditis, and tracheostomy due to respiratory failure. The patient was admitted to the hospital after developing fever and respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. Bronchoscopy with BAL grew ESBL Klebsiella, Acinetobacter x 2 species, and Pseudomonas. The patient was started on Colistin and Amikacin, but developed acute renal failure and is now on Amikacin and Colistin nebs. The patient has a fever of 38.6C overnight and has been tolerating the tracheostomy collar for part of the day. The patient has allergies to penicillins and heparin agents. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on 01/19/2169 at 04:00 PM for Amikacin and 01/20/2169 at 04:00 AM for Colistin. The patient is currently receiving Furosemide and Morphine sulfate infusions. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the fever. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.6C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/59 mmHg to 128/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

   PNAs.  Continues to spike fevers.
   # Fever
 most likely due to multiple organisms causing resistant PNAs.
   - pulled all lines, cultures without growth
   - stopped vanco ([**Date range (1) 4123**]) as no sig growth from line
   - f/u [**1-22**] cultures

   Colistin IH/Amikacin since [**2169-1-12**]
   - amikacin levels from [**1-19**] = 5.1 (within acceptable range)
   - continue to culture with high spikes
   # Pneumonia - had pus in LLL on admission bronchoscopy
 there is no
   evidence for other sources on lab/micro data.
   - continue treatment for multi-drug resistent acinetobacter and
   pseudomonas with Amikacin/Colistin ([**2169-1-12**] - )
   - f/u micro and sensitivities - some of the pseudomonas spp are
   resistent to amikacin but sensitive to tobramycin- no ABX change per ID
   - repeat cultures 1/18 with ngtd
   - [**Hospital 858**] Rehab culture data is final , ph [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3918**]
   - on trach collar, vent support as needed

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and peg since December 12th. He has had multiple pneumonias with multi-drug resistant organisms. The patient presents with fever, respiratory distress, and is found to have pseudomonal and acinetobacter pneumonia. He continues to spike fevers. 

The patient's current medications include Colistin IV and Amikacin since January 12th. Amikacin levels from January 19th are within an acceptable range. The patient is being treated for multi-drug resistant acinetobacter and pseudomonas with Amikacin/Colistin. Repeat cultures on January 18th were negative for growth.

The patient has respiratory failure and is being weaned steadily. He spent most of January 21st on tracheal collar support. His negative inspiratory force (NIF) is -17, and he will continue to receive standing nebs. 

The patient has hypernatremia and is receiving free water boluses via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). He also has acute renal failure (ARF) with a stable glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The etiology of ARF is likely due to drug toxicity from antibiotics, as indicated by urine eosinophils. 

The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) on January 18th for borderline"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y.o. man with complicated history, trach/peg since [**12-12**], multiple
   pneumonias with multi-drug resistent organisms, presents with fever,
   respiratory distress, found to have pseudomonal and acenitobacter
   PNAs.  Continues to spike fevers.
   # Fever
 most likely due to multiple organisms causing resistant PNAs.
   - pulled all lines, cultures without growth
   - stopped vanco ([**Date range (1) 4123**]) as no sig growth from line
   - f/u [**1-22**] cultures
   - ABX: we are limited in our choices given the resistant organisms - on
   Colistin IH/Amikacin since [**2169-1-12**]
   - amikacin levels from [**1-19**] = 5.1 (within acceptable range)
   - continue to culture with high spikes
   # Pneumonia - had pus in LLL on admission bronchoscopy
 there is no
   evidence for other sources on lab/micro data.
   - continue treatment for multi-drug resistent acinetobacter and
   pseudomonas with Amikacin/Colistin  x 21 days ([**2169-1-12**] -[**2169-2-2**] )
   - f/u micro and sensitivities - some of the pseudomonas spp are
   resistent to amikacin but sensitive to tobramycin- no ABX change per ID
   - repeat cultures 1/18 with ngtd
   - [**Hospital 858**] Rehab culture data is final , ph [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3918**]
   - on trach collar, vent support as needed
   - CXR [**1-21**] without significant change
   # Respiratory failure: weaning steadily, spent most of [**1-21**] on trach
   collar
   - continue on trach collar today; wean FIO2
   - diurese as tolerated (goal  1L neg)
   - NIF is poor ; repeat on [**1-23**] = -22
   - MIE every 4-6 hours
   - continue standing nebs
   - antibiotics as above for PNA
   # Hypernatremia
   - free H20 boluses via PEG
   # ARF
 GFR now stable.- acute on chronic failure,with baseline
   creatinine 1.3. Etiology is likely due to drug toxicity from
   antiobiotics - urine eos +
   -- renal u/s
 no hydro
   -- urine lytes, not pre-renal
   -- changed interval of amikacin; trough was good;  changed colistin to
   inhaled per ID
   -- continue hydration (bolus prn), TFs
   -- Dialysis NOT within patient/family's wishes/goal of care
   # Anemia: Chronic per records but below baseline.  Stable.   Got 1 unit
   PRBCs [**2169-1-18**] for borderline BPs
   - guaiac negative
   - trend HCT daily
   - transfuse for Hct < 21, or for evidence bleeding or end organ
   ischemia
   # Intermittent hypotension
 likely med related as got morphine and
   lasix close together. Resolved spontaneously
   - monitor, prn boluses
   # DM2:
   - continue Glargine and ISS.  FS but change to [**Hospital1 **]
    # HTN:
   - Hold antihypertensives while BP borderline
    # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue synthroid
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue Sinemet, Ropinirole, no Artain per
   neuron as mayy worsen delirium
   # GERD: Continue PPI
    # h/o HIT:  Avoid all heparin products

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and peg tube since December 12th. He has had multiple pneumonias with multi-drug resistant organisms and is currently presenting with fever, respiratory distress, and pseudomonal and acinetobacter pneumonia. The patient's fever is likely due to the multiple organisms causing resistant PNAs. All lines have been pulled, cultures without growth, and vancomycin has been stopped as there was no significant growth from the line. The patient is being treated with Colistin IV/Amikacin since January 12th, and amikacin levels from January 19th were within an acceptable range. 

The patient also has anemia, which is chronic but below baseline. He received one unit of packed red blood cells on January 18th for borderline blood pressures. The patient's renal function is compromised, with acute on chronic renal failure, likely due to drug toxicity from antibiotics, as evidenced by urine eosinophils. His sodium levels are high, and he is being managed with free water boluses via PEG. 

The patient's respiratory status is improving, and he is weaning steadily from ventilator support. However, his fluid balance is positive, and he is still requiring MIE every 4-6 hours and standing nebs. The patient's blood pressure has been borderline, and his thyroid hormone levels are within normal range. He is"

   66 y.o. man with complicated history, trach/peg since [**12-12**], multiple
   pneumonias with multi-drug resistent organisms, presents with fever,
   respiratory distress, found to have pseudomonal and acenitobacter
   PNAs.  Continues to spike fevers.
   # Fever
 most likely due to multiple organisms causing resistant PNAs.
   - pulled all lines, cultures without growth
   - stopped vanco ([**Date range (1) 4123**]) as no sig growth from line
   - f/u [**1-22**] cultures
   - ABX: we are limited in our choices given the resistant organisms - on
   Colistin IH/Amikacin since [**2169-1-12**]
   - amikacin levels from [**1-19**] = 5.1 (within acceptable range)
   - continue to culture with high spikes
   # Pneumonia - had pus in LLL on admission bronchoscopy
 there is no
   evidence for other sources on lab/micro data.
   - continue treatment for multi-drug resistent acinetobacter and
   pseudomonas with Amikacin/Colistin  x 21 days ([**2169-1-12**] -[**2169-2-2**] )
   - f/u micro and sensitivities - some of the pseudomonas spp are
   resistent to amikacin but sensitive to tobramycin- no ABX change per ID
   - repeat cultures 1/18 with ngtd
   - [**Hospital 858**] Rehab culture data is final , ph [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3918**]
   - on trach collar, vent support as needed
   - CXR [**1-21**] without significant change
   # Respiratory failure: weaning steadily, spent most of [**1-21**] on trach
   collar
   - continue on trach collar today; wean FIO2
   - diurese as tolerated (goal  1L neg)
   - NIF is poor ; repeat on [**1-23**] = -22
   - MIE every 4-6 hours
   - continue standing nebs
   - antibiotics as above for PNA

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including tracheostomy and peg tube since December 12th, multiple pneumonias with multi-drug resistant organisms, and current presentation of fever, respiratory distress, and pseudomonal and acinetobacter PNAs. The patient continues to spike fevers despite antibiotic therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has resistant PNAs caused by pseudomonas and acinetobacter. Treatment with amikacin and colistin has been initiated, but the patient's condition is not improving, indicating a potential risk for ongoing infection and complications related to pneumonia.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may be due to dehydration or other underlying conditions. Free water boluses via PEG have been given to address this issue, but further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent complications such as cerebral edema or seizures.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has developed acute renal failure, likely due to drug toxicity from antibiotics. Renal ultrasound, urine electrolytes, and eosinophilic presence in the urine indicate acute on chronic renal failure. Appropriate management strategies, including hydration and medication adjustments, are being implemented.

4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia that is below his baseline level. One unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) was transfused on January 18th for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas, ESBL Klebsiella, and Acinetobacter. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/64 to 133/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a FiO2 of 40%. The patient has a history of subdural hematoma, and his allergies include anaphylaxis to penicillins and hives from heparin agents. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, Parkinson's disease, and an unknown allergy to lisinopril. The patient is receiving several medications including antibiotics (amikacin and inhaled colistin), bronchodilators, and insulin. The patient's blood glucose levels have been ranging from 87 to 159 mg/dL. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's urine output has been 2,594 mL over the past 24 hours. Imaging and microbiology reports are pending. The patient's assessment"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of obesity, who is currently admitted to the ICU for multiorganism pneumonia with respiratory failure and acute renal failure (ARF). He has been intubated and placed on a tracheostomy collar. The patient's fever curve has improved, indicating that he is slowly improving. He is tolerating the tracheostomy mask well, with reduced secretions. The medical team plans to continue antibiotics, wean FiO2 as able, provide PRN MIE, attempt a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) trial, and target even slightly negative volume status to control edema while avoiding further renal insult. The patient's renal function seems to have plateaued, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from amikacin/colistin. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38.0 C (100.4 F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/72 mmHg to 129/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on the tracheostomy mask. His lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 263 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's chest X-ray shows low lung volumes with unchanged bilateral opacities, and he has a pending urine culture"
