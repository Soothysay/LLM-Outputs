","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 32-year-old male who presented to the ICU with complaints of back pain. He has a history of being hit from behind and sustained multiple injuries, including an unstable three-column burst fracture with perched right facet at T11, and an anterosuperior end plate fracture at T6. The patient is currently in the operating room for further management of his spine injury.

Medical Complications:
1. Unstable three-column burst fracture with perched right facet at T11: This is a serious spinal injury that can cause neurological deficits, paralysis, and chronic pain.
2. Anterosuperior end plate fracture at T6: This fracture may result in instability of the vertebral column and could potentially affect the spinal cord.
3. Thoracic epidural hematoma: This condition can compress the spinal cord and lead to neurological symptoms such as weakness, numbness, or paralysis.
4. Right pneumothorax: Although minimal and likely clinically insignificant, it should still be monitored closely for any signs of worsening respiratory status.

Plan:
The patient will be closely monitored in the ICU with regular neurologic checks every four hours. Strict logroll precautions will be implemented to prevent further injury. Pain will be controlled with fentanyl PCA, and a lidocaine patch will be used for pain relief. The patient will be taken to the operating room for definitive management of his spine injury. Other aspects of care, such as cardiovascular stability, pulmonary function, gastrointestinal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old male who presented to the ICU with back pain. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and has been receiving various medications, including lidocaine patch, famotidine, lorazepam, potassium chloride, calcium gluconate, fentanyl PCA, insulin, magnesium sulfate, metoclopramide, and ondansetron.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), blood pressure ranging from 119/67 mmHg to 131/75 mmHg, heart rate between 65 and 76 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is hemodynamically stable and has been monitored with hemodynamic monitoring.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,842 mL, including 658 mL through intravenous fluids, and an output of 1,725 mL, with 790 mL through urine. The patient is not receiving respiratory support, and their ABG results are within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. There are no abnormalities noted in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems. Neurological examination is nonfocal, with the patient being attentive and oriented.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.0 K/uL, hem"

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 32-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of back pain. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and has experienced a medical condition known as a thoracic epidural hematoma. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/67 mmHg to 131/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, pain management with fentanyl PCA, and a lidocaine patch.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unstable three-column burst fracture with perched right facet at T11.
2. T6 anterosuperior endplate fracture.
3. Thoracic epidural hematoma.
4. Chance fracture of T11 with disruption of the anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) and edema in the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) at T11.
5. Indentation of the cord at T11 without signal abnormalities.
6. Tiny right pulmonary lacerations with minimal, likely clinically insignificant right pneumothorax.
7. Acute endplate fracture at T6.
8. Uncontrolled pain.
9. Nausea and vomiting.
10. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility.
11. Risk of stress ulcers due to ICU stay.
12. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."
