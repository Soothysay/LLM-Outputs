   1) Hypoxia: likely related to underlying CAP now acutely exacerbated by
   fluid resusitation. pathogen differential still broad given immune
   status. more likely typical pathogen given focality to infiltrate.
   however atypical, viral possible as well. less likely fungal.

   - consider TTE to eval for effusion given hx of TB
   - bolus IVF for decreased UOP

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of CLL who is currently in the ICU. She initially presented with febrile neutropenia and was found to have a right lower lobe infiltrate and neck pain. She is now experiencing hypotension followed by hypoxia. The patient has completed only 6 months of TB therapy and has a history of reactivation TB. Her vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F, heart rate of 129 bpm, blood pressure of 117/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be related to an underlying CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) that has been exacerbated by fluid resuscitation. The pathogen differential is still broad, but more likely typical pathogens are suspected given the focus on the infiltrate. However, atypical, viral, or fungal infections are also possible. Further investigations such as repeating viral screens, checking BNP levels, obtaining sputum cultures, following up on glucan/galactomannan results, and waiting for BAL results are recommended. Empiric antibiotic coverage for CAP in febrile neutropenic patients should be continued.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to sepsis from an unclear source. There is no evidence of blood loss or ischem"

   65 year old woman with history of CLL now ~25 days s/p FCR intially
   presenting with febrile neutropenia found to have RLL infiltrate and
   neck pain now complicated by hypotension followed by hypoxia.
   #Febrile neutropenia.  Most likely source PNA given absence of other
   localizing findings besides new RLL lobar infiltrate.  So far no
   informative culture or gram stain data. Pt has history of partially
   treated extrapulmonary TB, lobar appearance of CXR not really
   suggestive of reactivated TB.
   -cover broadly for neutropenic CAP with vanc/cefepime/azithromycin with
   flagyl for anaerobes, voriconazole for funal coverage.  Peel back
   coverage if no GPCs on sputum from BAL.
   -follow up all cultures, call micro lab to ensure AFB smear for r/o TB
   being processed.
   -Tylenol prn fevers
   -continue neutropenic and negative pressure respiratory isolation for
   r/o TB.
   .
   #Hypoxia: likely related to underlying CAP now acutely exacerbated by
   fluid resusitation. Has resolved overnight, satting well on 2L NC.  CXR
   appears less fluid overloaded today.  Pulmonary edema likely from
   aggressive fluid rescusitation. No history of heart failure.
   -TTE on Monday
   -Caution with IVF, may bolus as needed but should go first to NIPPV if
   develops further hypoxia.
   # Hypotension: likely related to sepsis from unclear source. no
   evidence of blood loss or ischemic cause.  pericardial effusion with
   tamponade is possible given hx of TB but would be unlikely. currently
   lactate normal and normal mentation to perfusion adequate.
   - TTE as above
   - bolus IVF for decreased UOP, tachycardia or hypotension. Responded
   very well to 1L NS this am.  Would use LR in future as is becoming
   hyperchloremic.
   .
   3) Hx of Extra-pulmonary TB: patient completed only 6 months of therapy
   so would be at risk for relapse.  currently without other significant
   constitutional symptoms that had featured prominently before. would
   expect low probability for pulmonary TB.
   - continue airborne precautions for now pending AFB from bronch
   - ID recs
   -azithromycin instead of levo for atypical PNA coverage to avoid TB
   partial treatment.
   .
   4) Neck pain: patient developed pain and soreness after being in the
   hospital w/o other sign of meningitis except for fever.  would have low
   probability for meningitis but given immune suppressed status it would
   be difficult to entirely exclude.  alternatively could be benign muscle
   ache. LP yesterday, normal, no evidence of meningitis.
   - Reduce cevepime from meningitis to PNA doses.
   - tylenol, percocet prn pain.
   .
   5) CLL: ANC >500 so perhaps could be start of trend. would still be
   immune suppressed due to lymphocyte dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who is currently in the ICU. She has been experiencing febrile neutropenia for the past 25 days and was found to have a right lower lobe infiltrate and neck pain. She also developed hypotension and hypoxia. The patient is now on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for neutropenic sepsis and pneumonia. Her condition has improved, but she remains critically ill.

1. Febrile neutropenia: The patient initially presented with febrile neutropenia, which is a medical emergency characterized by a fever in patients with compromised immune systems (neutropenia). This condition requires immediate medical attention to prevent further complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a right lower lobe infiltrate, indicating a possible lung infection. This can lead to respiratory distress and respiratory failure if not promptly treated.
3. Hypotension: The patient developed hypotension, which may be due to sepsis from an unclear source. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
4. Hypoxia: The patient experienced hypoxia, which is low oxygen levels in the blood. This can result from severe pneumonia or fluid overload. Adequate oxygenation is crucial for maintaining organ function and preventing tissue damage"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old woman with history of CLL now ~25 days s/p FCR intially
   presenting with febrile neutropenia found to have RLL infiltrate and
   neck pain now complicated by hypotension followed by hypoxia and
   continued fevers.
   # Febrile neutropenia.  Most likely source PNA given RLL lobar
   infiltrate.  So far no informative culture or gram stain data. Pt has
   history of partially treated extrapulmonary TB, lobar appearance of CXR
   not really suggestive of reactivated TB.  Patient with continued fevers
   (102 axillary) overnight.
   -Covering broadly for neutropenic CAP with vanc/cefepime/azithromycin
   with flagyl for anaerobes, voriconazole for fungal coverage.  Could
   consider peeling back coverage pending culture results, though would
   continue for now given persistent fevers and relative neutropenia
   -Follow up all cultures, AFB smears negative, but awaiting concentrated
   smear and cultures likely on Monday
   -Tylenol prn fevers, cooling blanket prn
   -Continue neutropenic and negative pressure respiratory isolation for
   r/o TB
   - DFA for influenza negative, will dc droplet isolation, though still
   requires resp isolation as above
   # Hypoxia: Stable and resolving. Likely related to underlying CAP and
   acutely exacerbated by fluid resusitation. Has resolved.  Patient was
   able to tolerate small fluid boluses during fevers with continued sats
   in the mid-high 90s on 2L NC.
   - Continue to follow CXR, has appeared less fluid overloaded, though
   e/o edema on CXR this am.  Pulmonary edema likely from aggressive fluid
   rescusitation. No history of heart failure.
   - Caution with IVF, may bolus as needed but should go first to NIPPV if
   develops further hypoxia.
   # Hypotension: Stable. Likely related to sepsis from unclear source. No
   evidence of blood loss or ischemic cause.  Patient also with some
   question of mediastinal widening on AP film as compared to PA/Lat.  Per
   radiology, recommended repeat PA/Lat which showed no further widening
   and was not concerning for hematoma as no recent
   intervention/procedure.  Pericardial effusion with tamponade is
   possible given hx of TB but not clinically likely.   Lactate continues
   to be normal (1.0 this am) and normal mentation so perfusion adequate.
   - Follow up final read on PA/Lat
   - Can consider TTE on Monday as not able to get one on the weekend.
   - Bolus IVF for decreased UOP, tachycardia or hypotension as has
   responded well, though would be careful given hypoxia and pulmonary
   edema.  Would alternate NS and LR given concern for hyperchloremia.
   # Hx of Extra-pulmonary TB: Patient completed only 6 months of therapy
   so would be at risk for relapse.  Currently without other significant
   constitutional symptoms that had featured prominently before. Would
   expect low probability for pulmonary TB.
   - Continue airborne precautions for now pending AFB concentrated smear
   from bronch on Monday
   - ID recs
   -Azithromycin instead of levo for atypical PNA coverage to avoid TB
   partial treatment.
   # Neck pain: Resolved. Patient developed pain and soreness after being
   in the hospital w/o other sign of meningitis except for fever.  LP
   without evidence of meningitis.  Likely benign muscle ache/spasm.
   - Reduced cevepime from meningitis to PNA doses.
   - Tylenol, percocet prn pain.
   # CLL: ANC >500 so perhaps could be start of trend. Would still be
   immune suppressed due to lymphocyte dysfunction.
   - BMT recs
   - Continue prophy: bactrim and acyclovir
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue current dose levothyroxine
   # FEN: Bowel regimen, Nutrition consult

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of CLL who is currently in the ICU. She was admitted approximately 25 days ago with febrile neutropenia and was found to have a right lower lobe infiltrate and neck pain. She has since developed hypotension, hypoxia, and continued fevers. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 111/58 mmHg, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal coverage. Imaging studies show no increased mediastinal widening. Laboratory results indicate leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The patient's condition is complicated by potential medical complications such as sepsis, pulmonary edema, and hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers and hypotension may indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis. It is important to monitor her blood pressure and provide appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory symptoms, including hypoxia and crackles on lung auscultation, suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema. This could be related to fluid resuscitation or underlying CAP. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and fluid balance is essential.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels below the normal range indicate hypoxia. It is important to maintain adequate oxygenation through appropriate respiratory support and careful fluid management.
4. Extrapulmonary TB: The patient has a history of partially treated extrapulmonary TB, which increases the risk of relapse. Monitoring for any signs or symptoms of TB reinfection is necessary.
5. CLL-related Immune Suppression: The patient's history of CLL puts her at risk for immune suppression, making her more susceptible to infections. Prophylactic measures, such as antivirals and antibacterials, should be continued.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

   65 year old woman with history of CLL now ~25 days s/p FCR intially
   presenting with febrile neutropenia found to have RLL infiltrate and
   neck pain now complicated by hypotension followed by hypoxia.
   #Febrile neutropenia.  Most likely source PNA given absence of other
   localizing findings besides new RLL lobar infiltrate.  So far no
   informative culture or gram stain data. Pt has history of partially
   treated extrapulmonary TB, lobar appearance of CXR not really
   suggestive of reactivated TB.
   -cover broadly for neutropenic CAP with vanc/cefepime/azithromycin with
   flagyl for anaerobes, voriconazole for funal coverage.  Peel back
   coverage if no GPCs on sputum from BAL.
   -follow up all cultures, call micro lab to ensure AFB smear for r/o TB
   being processed.
   -Tylenol prn fevers
   -continue neutropenic and negative pressure respiratory isolation for
   r/o TB.
   #Hypoxia: likely related to underlying CAP now acutely exacerbated by
   fluid resusitation. Has resolved overnight, satting well on 2L NC.  CXR
   appears less fluid overloaded today.  Pulmonary edema likely from
   aggressive fluid rescusitation. No history of heart failure.
   -TTE on Monday
   -Caution with IVF, may bolus as needed but should go first to NIPPV if
   develops further hypoxia.
   # Hypotension: likely related to sepsis from unclear source. no
   evidence of blood loss or ischemic cause.  pericardial effusion with
   tamponade is possible given hx of TB but would be unlikely. currently
   lactate normal and normal mentation to perfusion adequate.
   - TTE as above
   - bolus IVF for decreased UOP, tachycardia or hypotension. Responded
   very well to 1L NS this am.  Would use LR in future as is becoming
   hyperchloremic.
   3) Hx of Extra-pulmonary TB: patient completed only 6 months of therapy
   so would be at risk for relapse.  currently without other significant
   constitutional symptoms that had featured prominently before. would
   expect low probability for pulmonary TB.
   - continue airborne precautions for now pending AFB from bronch
   - ID recs
   -azithromycin instead of levo for atypical PNA coverage to avoid TB
   partial treatment.
   4) Neck pain: patient developed pain and soreness after being in the
   hospital w/o other sign of meningitis except for fever.  would have low
   probability for meningitis but given immune suppressed status it would
   be difficult to entirely exclude.  alternatively could be benign muscle
   ache. LP yesterday, normal, no evidence of meningitis.
   - Reduce cevepime from meningitis to PNA doses.
   - tylenol, percocet prn pain.
   5) CLL: ANC >500 so perhaps could be start of trend. would still be
   immune suppressed due to lymphocyte dysfunction.
   - BMT recs
   - follow
   - continue prophy: bactrim and acyclovir
   6) Hypothyroidism: continue current dose

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of CLL who presented with febrile neutropenia, RLL infiltrate, and neck pain. She was initially treated for PNA but now has hypotension and hypoxia. The patient has a history of partially treated extrapulmonary TB, lobar appearance of CXR not suggestive of reactivated TB, and hypothyroidism. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C (102°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/58 to 118/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula, and sinus tachycardia on ECG.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Febrile neutropenia: The patient initially presented with febrile neutropenia, which is a medical emergency characterized by fever in the setting of neutropenia (low neutrophil count). This condition can be caused by various infections, including bacterial pneumonia, which seems to be the most likely source given the absence of other localizing findings besides the new RLL lobar infiltrate.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has experienced acute exacerbation of underlying CAP, leading to hypoxia. This condition is likely due to fluid resuscitation, which has resolved overnight with the use of 2L NC.
3. Pulmonary edema:"

   axillary) overnight.
   -Covering broadly for neutropenic CAP with vanc/cefepime/azithromycin
   with flagyl for anaerobes, voriconazole for funal coverage.  Could
   consider peeling back coverage pending culture results, though would
   continue for now given persistent fevers and relative neutropenia
   -Follow up all cultures, AFB smears negative, but awaiting concentrated
   smear and cultures likely on Monday
   -Tylenol prn fevers, cooling blanket prn
   -Continue neutropenic and negative pressure respiratory isolation for
   r/o TB.
   - Re-ordered DFA for influenza as high on differential given broad abx
   coverage with continued fevers.  Sample from BAL and prior nasal
   aspirate had been cancelled.
   # Hypoxia: Stable and resolving. Likely related to underlying CAP and
   acutely exacerbated by fluid resusitation. Has resolved.  Patient was
   able to tolerate small fluid boluses during fevers with continued sats
   in the mid-high 90s on 2L NC.
   - Continue to follow CXR, has appeared less fluid overloaded.
   Pulmonary edema likely from aggressive fluid rescusitation. No history
   of heart failure.
   - Caution with IVF, may bolus as needed but should go first to NIPPV if
   develops further hypoxia.
   # Hypotension: Stable. Likely related to sepsis from unclear source. No
   evidence of blood loss or ischemic cause.  Patient also with some
   question of mediastinal widening on AP film as compared to PA/Lat.  Per
   radiology, recommended repeat PA/Lat which showed no further widening
   and was not concerning for hematoma as no recent
   intervention/procedure.  Pericardial effusion with tamponade is
   possible given hx of TB but not clinically likely.   Lactate continues
   to be normal (1.0 this am) and normal mentation so perfusion adequate.
   - Can consider TTE on Monday as not able to get one on the weekend.
   - Bolus IVF for decreased UOP, tachycardia or hypotension as has
   responded well, though would be careful given hypoxia and pulmonary
   edema.  Would alternate NS and LR given hyperchloremia.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old woman with history of CLL now ~25 days s/p FCR intially
   presenting with febrile neutropenia found to have RLL infiltrate and
   neck pain now complicated by hypotension followed by hypoxia and
   continued fevers.
   # Febrile neutropenia.  Most likely source PNA given RLL lobar
   infiltrate.  So far no informative culture or gram stain data. Pt has
   history of partially treated extrapulmonary TB, lobar appearance of CXR
   not really suggestive of reactivated TB.  Patient with continued fevers
   (102 axillary) overnight.
   -Covering broadly for neutropenic CAP with vanc/cefepime/azithromycin
   with flagyl for anaerobes, voriconazole for funal coverage.  Could
   consider peeling back coverage pending culture results, though would
   continue for now given persistent fevers and relative neutropenia
   -Follow up all cultures, AFB smears negative, but awaiting concentrated
   smear and cultures likely on Monday
   -Tylenol prn fevers, cooling blanket prn
   -Continue neutropenic and negative pressure respiratory isolation for
   r/o TB.
   - Re-ordered DFA for influenza as high on differential given broad abx
   coverage with continued fevers.  Sample from BAL and prior nasal
   aspirate had been cancelled.
   # Hypoxia: Stable and resolving. Likely related to underlying CAP and
   acutely exacerbated by fluid resusitation. Has resolved.  Patient was
   able to tolerate small fluid boluses during fevers with continued sats
   in the mid-high 90s on 2L NC.
   - Continue to follow CXR, has appeared less fluid overloaded.
   Pulmonary edema likely from aggressive fluid rescusitation. No history
   of heart failure.
   - Caution with IVF, may bolus as needed but should go first to NIPPV if
   develops further hypoxia.
   # Hypotension: Stable. Likely related to sepsis from unclear source. No
   evidence of blood loss or ischemic cause.  Patient also with some
   question of mediastinal widening on AP film as compared to PA/Lat.  Per
   radiology, recommended repeat PA/Lat which showed no further widening
   and was not concerning for hematoma as no recent
   intervention/procedure.  Pericardial effusion with tamponade is
   possible given hx of TB but not clinically likely.   Lactate continues
   to be normal (1.0 this am) and normal mentation so perfusion adequate.
   - Can consider TTE on Monday as not able to get one on the weekend.
   - Bolus IVF for decreased UOP, tachycardia or hypotension as has
   responded well, though would be careful given hypoxia and pulmonary
   edema.  Would alternate NS and LR given hyperchloremia.
   # Hx of Extra-pulmonary TB: patient completed only 6 months of therapy
   so would be at risk for relapse.  Currently without other significant
   constitutional symptoms that had featured prominently before. Would
   expect low probability for pulmonary TB.
   - Continue airborne precautions for now pending AFB concentrated smear
   from bronch on Monday
   - ID recs
   -Azithromycin instead of levo for atypical PNA coverage to avoid TB
   partial treatment.
   # Neck pain: Resolved. Patient developed pain and soreness after being
   in the hospital w/o other sign of meningitis except for fever.  LP
   without evidence of meningitis.  Likely benign muscle ache/spasm.
   - Reduced cevepime from meningitis to PNA doses.
   - Tylenol, percocet prn pain.
   # CLL: ANC >500 so perhaps could be start of trend. would still be
   immune suppressed due to lymphocyte dysfunction.
   - BMT recs
   - Continue prophy: bactrim and acyclovir
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue current dose levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who presented to the ICU with febrile neutropenia, right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate, and neck pain. She is now experiencing hypotension and hypoxia. The patient's fever persists despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, and there are ongoing efforts to identify the source of infection. Imaging studies have not shown significant mediastinal widening, and cultures are pending. The patient is being treated with a combination of antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals while awaiting culture results. Supportive care measures include Tylenol for fever management and a cooling blanket. The patient is also receiving negative pressure respiratory isolation due to the possibility of tuberculosis (TB). Other issues include resolving hypoxia, stable hypotension, and resolved neck pain. The patient's CLL and history of partially treated extrapulmonary TB are also noted. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing fevers and relative neutropenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Febrile neutropenia: The patient initially presented with febrile neutropenia, which is a medical emergency in immunocompromised patients. It requires immediate broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.
2. Right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate: The presence of an RLL infiltrate indicates a potential bacterial pneumonia. This could be the source of the ongoing"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old woman with history of CLL now ~25 days s/p FCR intially
   presenting with febrile neutropenia found to have RLL infiltrate and
   neck pain now complicated by hypotension followed by hypoxia and
   continued fevers.
   # Febrile neutropenia.  Most likely source PNA given RLL lobar
   infiltrate.  So far no informative culture or gram stain data. Pt has
   history of partially treated extrapulmonary TB, lobar appearance of CXR
   not really suggestive of reactivated TB.  Patient with continued fevers
   (102 axillary) overnight.
   -Covering broadly for neutropenic CAP with vanc/cefepime/azithromycin
   with flagyl for anaerobes, voriconazole for fungal coverage.  Could
   consider peeling back coverage pending culture results, though would
   continue for now given persistent fevers and relative neutropenia.  ?
   d/c vancomycin given culture data
   -Follow up all cultures, AFB smears negative, but awaiting concentrated
   smear and cultures likely on Monday
   -Tylenol prn fevers, cooling blanket prn
   -Continue neutropenic and negative pressure respiratory isolation for
   r/o TB
   - DFA for influenza negative, will dc droplet isolation, though still
   requires resp isolation as above
   # Hypoxia: Stable and resolving. Likely related to underlying CAP and
   acutely exacerbated by fluid resusitation. Has resolved.  Patient was
   able to tolerate small fluid boluses during fevers with continued sats
   in the mid-high 90s on 2L NC.
   - Continue to follow CXR, has appeared less fluid overloaded, though
   e/o edema on CXR this am.  Pulmonary edema likely from aggressive fluid
   rescusitation. No history of heart failure.
   - Caution with IVF, may bolus as needed but should go first to NIPPV if
   develops further hypoxia.
   # Hypotension: Stable. Likely related to sepsis from unclear source. No
   evidence of blood loss or ischemic cause.  Patient also with some
   question of mediastinal widening on AP film as compared to PA/Lat.  Per
   radiology, recommended repeat PA/Lat which showed no further widening
   and was not concerning for hematoma as no recent
   intervention/procedure.  Pericardial effusion with tamponade is
   possible given hx of TB but not clinically likely.   Lactate continues
   to be normal (1.0 this am) and normal mentation so perfusion adequate.
   Resolved
   - Bolus IVF for decreased UOP, tachycardia or hypotension as has
   responded well, though would be careful given hypoxia and pulmonary
   edema.  Would alternate NS and LR given concern for hyperchloremia.
   # Hx of Extra-pulmonary TB: Patient completed only 6 months of therapy
   so would be at risk for relapse.  Currently without other significant
   constitutional symptoms that had featured prominently before. Would
   expect low probability for pulmonary TB.
   - Continue airborne precautions for now pending AFB concentrated smear
   from bronch, should be done on today
   - ID recs
   -Azithromycin instead of levo for atypical PNA coverage to avoid TB
   partial treatment.
   # Neck pain: Resolved. Patient developed pain and soreness after being
   in the hospital w/o other sign of meningitis except for fever.  LP
   without evidence of meningitis.  Likely benign muscle ache/spasm.
   - Reduced cefepime from meningitis to PNA doses.
   - Tylenol, percocet prn pain.
   # CLL: ANC >500 so perhaps could be start of trend. Would still be
   immune suppressed due to lymphocyte dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who has been admitted to the ICU for 25 days. She initially presented with febrile neutropenia and was found to have a right lower lobe infiltrate and neck pain. The patient has experienced hypotension, hypoxia, and continued fevers. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. Her laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. An echocardiogram revealed no pericardial effusion or signs of tamponade. The patient's respiratory isolation precautions have been modified based on DFA results for influenza being negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Febrile neutropenia: The patient's initial presentation of febrile neutropenia indicates a severe infection, likely caused by an underlying pneumonia. This condition is a medical emergency requiring prompt treatment to prevent further complications.

2. Right lower lobe infiltrate: The presence of an infiltrate in the right lower lobe suggests a bacterial or viral pneumonia. If left untreated, this infection could progress and potentially lead to septicemia.

3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be indicative of septic shock caused by an underlying infection. This condition requires immediate intervention to restore adequate blood pressure and perfusion.

4. Hypoxia:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of CLL who presented with febrile neutropenia. She was initially treated for right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate and neck pain, but subsequently developed hypotension followed by hypoxia. 

The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, and metronidazole, for presumed neutropenic pneumonia (CAP). However, there is a concern for reactivated tuberculosis (TB) due to her partially treated extrapulmonary TB and the presence of lobar infiltrate on the chest X-ray. The preliminary AFB smear from bronchial samples is negative, but the concentrated smear results are pending.

The patient's hypotension and hypoxia have resolved after fluid resuscitation. She is currently stable with minimal supplemental oxygen. The respiratory isolation precautions are in place due to the suspicion of TB.

Neck pain, which was initially present, has resolved. It was initially suspected to be meningitis, but a lumbar puncture did not show any evidence of infection.

The patient's CLL is improving, and she is no longer neutropenic. The ANC (absolute neutrophil count) is greater than 1000. She is receiving prophylactic antibiotics and antivirals.

She also has hypothyroidism and is on levothyroxine. The patient"

","The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), who recently underwent chemotherapy and is now presenting with febrile neutropenia. She also has a history of respiratory distress, hypotension, and hypoxemia. The patient has been bronched in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and continues to have fevers. Her vital signs include a maximum temperature of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, a current temperature of 98.3 degrees Fahrenheit, a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 115/73 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is well-nourished, with symmetric chest expansion and crackles bilaterally at the lung bases. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. She has absent pulses in both radial and dorsal pedis arteries. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, and has normal movement and tone.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 1.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL, platelet count of 67,000/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 15 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.7, and glucose of 94 mg/dL"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old woman with CLL s/p recent treatment, now neutropenic with
   fevers of unclear etiology and history notable for probable TB
   lymphadenitis which was treated for 6 months.
   Neutropenic Fever: multiple sources of concern in this neutropenic host
   though PNA is leading candidate.
   All cx have thus far been negative
   RLL PNA: BAL pending
   Hx of TB adenitis, Bal pending (prelim smear neg)
   Meningitis: LP unrevealing
   - Bronch done to eval RLL lesion:   (PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2086**], [**Name11 (NameIs) 2087**], viral,
   bacterial clx)
   - Continue broad coverage Vanco and Cefepime vori, azithro, and flagyl
   (given poor dentition and location of infiltrate concern for aspiration
   Hypoxemia PNA in the RLL, with volume overload and weaning O2 as
   tolerated
   - supportive O2 for now
   - plan for NIPPV if needed
   Hypotension:resolved.
   Tachycardia: in setting of fevers, now improved. Echo in AM pre BMT -
   can look for veg, no evidence of increased cardiac siloutte by plain
   films or on recent CT but can also look for small pericard eff.
   Widened mediastinum
 stable by PA/lat- likely swollen nodes due to
   volume resucitation. Hol doff on repeat CT as just had on [**4-11**].
   H/O TB lymphadenitis: if remains febrile without a source for many more
   days, may need repeat node bx to r/o TB or lymphoma
   CLL: s/p recent treatment. Manage per BMT.

","The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of CLL, who recently underwent chemotherapy and is now presenting with febrile neutropenia and hypoxemia. She has a history of probable TB lymphadenitis and has been treated for it. The patient's current assessment and plan include multiple potential sources of concern, with pneumonia (PNA) being a leading candidate. All cultures have been negative so far. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, as well as antifungals and antivirals.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure within normal range, heart rate slightly elevated, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is well-nourished and alert, with no rash or jaundice. Neurologic examination is also normal.

The patient's lab results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 1.8 K/uL and a platelet count of 67. Other lab values are within normal range. Imaging studies show a normal ejection fraction on echo and mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.

The potential medical complications that can arise include but are not limited to:
1. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has a history of CLL and recent chemotherapy, which puts her at risk for infections. PNA is a leading candidate, and further investigation through BAL"
