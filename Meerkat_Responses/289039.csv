   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6621**] is an 87 year old gentleman with recent stroke now admitted to
   the ICU with a UTI and hypernatremia.  Overnight his hypernatremia has
   been correcting and he remained hemodynamically stable overnight
   despite atrial fibrillation and low-normal blood pressure.
   # Urosepsis:  The patient demonstrated signs of hypotension and shock
   prior to transfer.  His initial work-up is now positive for E. Coli
   Bacteruria.  Overnight his blood pressures remained low-normal but
   stable. He had some episodes of rapid rate but averaged below 100bpm in
   atrial fibrillation.
   - Continue Cefepime for E. Coli UTI, narrow as sensitivities return.
   - D/C Vanc for MRSA history and Flagyl given recent aspiration PNA
   - F/U Cultures
   # Hypernatremia:  The patient has corrected slowly overnight from
   155->160 back to 154.  Given his rapidly change glucose his true
   progress is close to a true drop from 165 to 157 overnight.  He has
   received 100mL D5W/hr x ~6 hours thus far and 300mL of free water q6 in
   tube feeds.  The etiology of his hypernatremia appears to be
   hypovolemia given that his serum osm are elevated and he is excreting
   very concetrated urine.
   - Continue to correct free water deficit (currently ~ 4L) at a sodium
   rate of 0.5mEq/hour, 75mL D5W/hr + 300mL q6 over 48 hours
   - Follow Na q6 hours
   # Hyperglycemia/DMII:  The patient was transferred to with a FSBS in
   the 400s, he was rapidly corrected overnight with an insulin drip and
   converted to NPH and sliding scale.  His elevated sugars are likely
   from poor insulin management in the setting of infection and changing
   renal function.
   - Convert NPH [**7-2**] to Lantus 18 tonight
   # Atrial flutter/fibrillation: Chronic, not in RVR
   -          continue on telemetry
   .
   # ARF:  Resolved with fluid hydration
   # History of traumatic subdural:
   - keppra for seizure prophylaxis
   # Decubitus ulcer:
   -          wound nurse consult
   -          consider air mattress, etc
   .
   # Low platelets
   Appears to be chronic, stable. Would defer workup in setting of acute
   illness, does not appear to be c/w DIC, etc.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman admitted to the ICU with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and hypernatremia. Overnight, his hypernatremia has been correcting, and he remained hemodynamically stable. The patient demonstrated signs of hypotension and shock prior to transfer, with positive E. Coli bacterium. His blood pressures remained low-normal but stable overnight. He experienced some episodes of rapid heart rate but averaged below 100 beats per minute in atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient showed signs of hypotension and shock before transfer, indicating a possible severe infection spreading throughout the body from the UTI.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels indicate dehydration, which needs to be corrected slowly to prevent rapid shifts in fluid balance and potential complications.
3. Hyperglycemia/DMII: The patient had significantly elevated blood sugar levels, which were rapidly corrected overnight with an insulin drip. It is essential to maintain tight glycemic control to prevent complications associated with high blood sugar.
4. Atrial Flutter/Fibrillation: The patient has a history of chronic atrial flutter/fibrillation, which requires monitoring and management to prevent cardiac complications.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function needs close monitoring, as ARF can occur due to sepsis, dehydration, or other factors.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6621**] is an 87 year old gentleman with recent stroke now admitted to
   the ICU with a UTI and hypernatremia.  Overnight his hypernatremia has
   been correcting and he remained hemodynamically stable overnight
   despite atrial fibrillation and low-normal blood pressure.
   # Urosepsis:  The patient demonstrated signs of hypotension and shock
   prior to transfer.  His initial work-up reflective of UTI with cultures
   pending.  His recent treatment for PNA could also be a source of
   infection.  Overnight his blood pressures remained low-normal but
   stable. He had some episodes of rapid rate but averaged below 100bpm in
   atrial fibrillation.  His cardiac output appears preserved despite low
   SvO2 and there is no indication for inotropy.
   - Continue Cefepime for urosepsis, Vanc for MRSA history and Flagyl
   given recent aspiration PNA
   - F/U Cultures
   - Continue to support with LR as needed to keep CVP 8-12, no pressor
   requirement at this time
   - Goal UOP >40 mL/hr, MAP >65
   # Hypernatremia:  The patient has corrected slowly overnight from
   155->160 back to 154.  Given his rapidly change glucose his true
   progress is close to a true drop from 165 to 157 overnight.  He has
   received 100mL D5W/hr x ~6 hours thus far and 300mL of free water q6 in
   tube feeds.  The etiology of his hypernatremia appears to be
   hypovolemia given that his serum osm are elevated and he is excreting
   very concetrated urine.
   - Continue to correct free water deficit (currently ~ 4L) at a sodium
   rate of 0.5mEq/hour, 75mL D5W/hr + 300mL q6
   - Follow Na q6 hours
   # Hyperglycemia/DMII:  The patient was transferred to with a FSBS in
   the 400s, he was rapidly corrected overnight with an insulin drip and
   converted to NPH and sliding scale.  His elevated sugars are likely
   from poor insulin management in the setting of infection and changing
   renal function.
   - Convert NPH [**7-2**] to Lantus 14 tonight
   # Atrial flutter/fibrillation: Chronic, not in RVR
   -          continue on telemetry
   .
   # ARF:  Resolved with fluid hydration
   # History of traumatic subdural:
   - keppra for seizure prophylaxis
   # Decubitus ulcer:
   -          wound nurse consult
   -          consider air mattress, etc
   .
   # Low platelets
   Appears to be chronic, stable. Would defer workup in setting of acute
   illness, does not appear to be c/w DIC, etc.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6621**] is an 87 year old gentleman with recent stroke now admitted to
   the ICU with a UTI and hypernatremia.  Overnight his hypernatremia has
   been correcting and he remained hemodynamically stable overnight
   despite atrial fibrillation and low-normal blood pressure.
   # Hypovolemic Hypernatremia:  Corrected to 148.  Free water deficit:
   2.5L , Serum OSM still elevated to 310, but correcting.
   - Continue to correct free water deficit (currently ~ 2.5L) at a sodium
   rate of 0.5mEq/hour, 75mL D5W/hr + 300mL q6 over 12 hours
   - Follow Na q12 hours
   # E. Coli UTI:  WBC resolving, afebrile, not hypotensive.  Continue
   Cefepime until cultures/sensitivities return
   - Continue Cefepime for E. Coli UTI, narrow as sensitivities return.
   - F/U Cultures
   # Hyperglycemia/DMII:  Still 200s overnight, receiving constant sugar
   infusion.  Total sliding scale was 22 units overnight.
   -Uptitrate Lantus from 18 to 25 while receiving D5W
   # History of traumatic subdural:
   - keppra for seizure prophylaxis
   # Decubitus ulcer:
   -          wound nurse consult
   -          consider air mattress, etc
   # Low platelets
   Appears to be chronic, stable. Would defer workup in setting of acute
   illness, does not appear to be c/w DIC, etc.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and hypernatremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, and his hypernatremia is being corrected. The patient has a history of stroke, diabetes mellitus type II, traumatic subdural hematoma, decubitus ulcer, and low platelets. He is receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, insulin, and seizure prophylaxis. The patient's condition appears to be improving overall.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemic Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia has been corrected overnight, but the serum osmolarity is still elevated. It is important to continue correcting the free water deficit at a controlled rate to avoid rapid shifts in fluid balance.
2. E. Coli UTI: The patient's UTI is being treated with cefepime. Cultures and sensitivities should be monitored to guide further treatment and narrow the antibiotic if appropriate.
3. Hyperglycemia/DMII: The patient's blood sugar levels remain in the 200s despite receiving a constant sugar infusion. Adjustments to the insulin regimen may be necessary to maintain glycemic control.
4. History of Traumatic Subdural Hematoma: The patient is receiving antiepileptic medication for seizure prophylaxis due to his history of traumatic brain injury.
5. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, urinary tract infection (presumably due to E. coli), alteration in elimination related to diarrhea, alteration in nutrition, hypotension, decubitus ulcer, dementia, and hypernatremia. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's diabetes management needs to be closely monitored to prevent any further complications related to high blood sugar levels.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Since the patient is already presumptively diagnosed with a UTI caused by E. coli, it is important to monitor for any worsening symptoms or signs of infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued based on sensitivities.
3. Diarrhea and alteration in elimination: The patient's diarrhea may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is crucial to prevent complications.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status needs to be assessed regularly, and appropriate measures should be taken to ensure adequate nutrition while considering the patient's medical conditions.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored, and interventions should be implemented to maintain adequate perfusion and prevent shock.
6. Decubitus ulcer: The patient's decubitus ulcer should be regularly assessed and managed appropriately to prevent further complications such as"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6621**] is an 87 year old gentleman with recent stroke now admitted to
   the ICU with a UTI and hypernatremia.  He is doing well with corrected
   hypernatremia but developed bradycardia with 4 second pauses overnight.
   # Bradycardia: The patient has developed pauses, sinus bradycardia to
   the 50s, and bursts of tachycardia in the high 90s.  This rhythm is
   preliminarily consistent with sick sinus syndrome.  The patient is not
   on any culprit medicines (beta blockers, lithium, digoxin,
   cimetidine).  It may have to due with his underlying illness.  As the
   patient is asymptomatic and the treatment for sick sinus is pacemaker,
   we will consult cardiology, but this will not hold up the patient
   transfer to the medical floor.
   # Hypovolemic Hypernatremia:  Due to on-going insufficient free water
   repletion. Currently corrected to 146 with a free water deficit of
   1.8L  and today
s serum Osm pending.  The patient only required a small
   amount of supplemental D5W but is otherwise managed on tube feed free
   water flushes.
   - Continue to correct free water deficit by increasing free water to
   400mL q4
   - Follow Na q12 hours
   # E. Coli & Staph Aureus UTI:  The sensitivities of the Staph are still
   pending, but the E. Coli is pan-sensitive except for Cipro.  His
   leukocytosis has resolved with stable blood pressures.
   - Vanc/Bactrim x 6days, narrow with further sensitivities
   # Hyperglycemia/DMII:  Still 200-300s overnight in an around the time
   of dextrose infusion. I will monitor his FSBS throughout the day before
   changing his Lantus dose given his decreased D5W intake today.
   # History of traumatic subdural:
   - Continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis
   # Decubitus ulcer:
   -          wound nurse consult
   -          consider air mattress, etc
   # Low platelets
   Appears to be chronic, stable. Would defer workup in setting of acute
   illness, does not appear to be c/w DIC, etc.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman with a recent stroke, admitted to the ICU with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and hypernatremia. He has been doing well with corrected hypernatremia but developed bradycardia with pauses overnight. His current condition includes hypovolemic hypernatremia, E. Coli and Staph Aureus UTI, hyperglycemia/DMII, history of traumatic subdural, decubitus ulcer, and low platelets. The patient's sodium levels are improving, and he is showing signs of overall improvement. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient has developed sinus bradycardia to the 50s and pauses, which may be consistent with sick sinus syndrome. This could lead to reduced cardiac output and inadequate perfusion of vital organs.
2. Hypovolemic hypernatremia: The patient has an ongoing insufficient free water repletion, leading to a free water deficit of 1.8L. If not corrected, this can result in further dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. UTI: The patient has an E. Coli and Staph Aureus UTI, which if left untreated, can lead to sepsis and systemic infection.
4. Hyperglycemia/DMII: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, particularly overnight. Poorly controlled blood glucose levels can increase the risk of infections and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6621**] is an 87 year old gentleman with recent stroke now admitted to
   the ICU with a UTI and hypernatremia.  He is doing well with corrected
   hypernatremia but developed bradycardia with 4 second pauses overnight.
   # Bradycardia: The patient has developed pauses, sinus bradycardia to
   the 50s, and bursts of tachycardia in the high 90s.  This rhythm is
   preliminarily consistent with sick sinus syndrome.  The patient is not
   on any culprit medicines (beta blockers, lithium, digoxin,
   cimetidine).  It may have to due with his underlying illness.  As the
   patient is asymptomatic and the treatment for sick sinus is pacemaker,
   we will consult cardiology, but this will not hold up the patient
   transfer to the medical floor.
   # Hypovolemic Hypernatremia:  Due to on-going insufficient free water
   repletion. Currently corrected to 146 with a free water deficit of
   1.8L  and today
s serum Osm pending.  The patient only required a small
   amount of supplemental D5W but is otherwise managed on tube feed free
   water flushes.
   - Continue to correct free water deficit by increasing free water to
   400mL q4
   - Follow Na q12 hours
   # E. Coli & Staph Aureus UTI:  The sensitivities of the Staph are still
   pending, but the E. Coli is pan-sensitive except for Cipro.  His
   leukocytosis has resolved with stable blood pressures.
   - Vanc/Bactrim x 6days, narrow with further sensitivities
   # Hyperglycemia/DMII:  Still 200-300s overnight in an around the time
   of dextrose infusion. I will monitor his FSBS throughout the day before
   changing his Lantus dose given his decreased D5W intake today.
   # History of traumatic subdural:
   - Continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis
   # Decubitus ulcer:
   -          wound nurse consult
   -          consider air mattress, etc
   # Low platelets
   Appears to be chronic, stable. Would defer workup in setting of acute
   illness, does not appear to be c/w DIC, etc.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman with a recent stroke, admitted to the ICU with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and hypernatremia. He has been doing well with the correction of hypernatremia but developed bradycardia with pauses overnight. The patient's rhythm is consistent with sick sinus syndrome, but he is asymptomatic, and treatment with a pacemaker may not be necessary at this time.

The patient's sodium levels are being closely monitored, and his free water deficit needs to be corrected. He is being managed on tube feed free water flushes, and his serum Osm is pending.

The patient has an E. Coli and Staph Aureus UTI. The sensitivities of the Staph are still pending, but the E. Coli is pan-sensitive except for Cipro. He will be treated with Vancomycin/Bactrim for six days, with further sensitivities to be considered.

The patient's blood glucose levels are still elevated overnight, possibly due to the dextrose infusion. His fasting blood sugar (FBS) will be monitored throughout the day before adjusting his Lantus dose.

The patient has a history of traumatic subdural hematoma and will continue to receive Keppra for seizure prophylaxis. He also has decubitus ulcers, for which a wound nurse consult has been requested, and consideration will be given to using an air mattress, etc.
