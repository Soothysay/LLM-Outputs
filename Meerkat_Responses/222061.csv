   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 ENDOSCOPY - At [**2181-11-6**] 05:23 PM..
   -passed BRBPR x2 small amount o/n
   -trying to climb out of bed, given haldol and then trazodone
   - Hct stable on q4h checks
   - s/p Foley removed at 2pm on [**11-6**], voided 300cc after 12 hour interval
   Colonoscopy;
   Red blood was seen from the rectum extending to the cecum. Scope could
   not be transversed past the cecum due to poor visualization in the
   setting of bleeding. Exact source of bleeding could not be visualized.
   Few diverticuli noted in the left colon.
   Impression:
   Blood in the colon
   Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to cecum
   Recommendations:
   If re-bleeds, will repeat EGD with banding. Will need repeat
   colonoscopy in the next few days.
   Endoscopy:
   Varices at the lower third of the esophagus
   No gastric varices noted.
   Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
   Recommendations:
   Will plan on banding tommorow or earlier if pt rebleeds. Continue to
   monitor closely in ICU. Continue PPI and Octreotide.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of polysubstance abuse and active alcoholism, presenting with altered mental status, leukocytosis, hypertension, impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with EtOH cirrhosis, esophageal varices, peptic ulcer disease, and hypertension. The patient experienced a gastrointestinal bleed and underwent an endoscopy which revealed bleeding from the lower third of the esophagus. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis, altered mental status may be a result of hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient had a significant bleed that required intervention. There is a risk of re-bleeding, and further management is needed to prevent complications.
3. Esophageal varices rupture: The presence of esophageal varices increases the risk of rupture and subsequent bleeding. Close monitoring and potential banding procedure are recommended to prevent this complication.
4. Peptic ulcer disease complications: The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease, which can lead to further bleeding or perforation if not managed appropriately.
5. Hypertension management: The patient's hypertension needs to be monitored and treated to prevent further complications.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of infections or pressure ulcers.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of polysubstance abuse, active alcoholism, and EtOH cirrhosis. She was previously admitted for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and underwent an endoscopy that revealed grades I & II varices and a clot overlying a peptic ulcer. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Endoscopy: The patient underwent an endoscopy which showed blood in the colon, and the scope could not be traversed past the cecum due to poor visualization in the setting of bleeding. A few diverticuli were noted in the left colon. This indicates a lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB).

2. Vital signs: The patient's temperature is within normal range, but her blood pressure is on the higher side (141/85 mmHg). Her heart rate is slightly elevated at 94 bpm. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation is 97% on supplemental oxygen.

3. Physical examination: The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. She denies abdominal pain, lightheadedness, or shortness of breath. Her cardiovascular examination reveals regular heart sounds without murmurs or gallops. Her pulmonary examination shows clear lungs with crackles bilaterally. Her abdomen is distended but soft with no tenderness or guarding. No peripheral edema is noted.

4. Laboratory results: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. She was initially admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, required large-volume packed red blood cell (pRBC) resuscitation, and was intubated. She was later transferred to the medical floor but returned to the ICU with suspected lower GI bleed. The patient has stable hemodynamics and hematocrit levels. She is more encephalopathic overnight and will receive lactulose/rifaximin when restarting oral intake. Varices were identified on endoscopy yesterday, and banding of varices is planned today. The patient's medical team is managing her care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed recurrence: The patient initially presented with an upper GI bleed, which required intervention. There is a risk of recurrence, especially if the underlying causes are not addressed.
2. Lower GI bleed: The patient is now suspected to have a lower GI bleed. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and severity of the bleed.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's increasing encephalopathy indicates worsening liver function. This condition can lead to confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory complications due to prolonged intubation.
5. Variceal bleeding: The presence of varices on endoscopy suggests a high risk of variceal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
6. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or pneumonia.
7. Thromboembolic events: Immobility and hypercoagulability state in critically ill patients increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures are in place to reduce this risk."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of polysubstance abuse, active alcoholism, and cirrhosis due to ethanol (EtOH) use. She presented with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and was found to have esophageal varices (grades I & II) and a clot overlying a peptic ulcer with bloody-ratio-of-borings-per-hour (BRBPR). The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, with a stable hematocrit (Hct) level. She has melena, which indicates ongoing lower GI bleeding. The initial concern was between upper and lower GI bleed, but studies demonstrate that it is a lower GI bleed.

The patient has altered mental status, most likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. Infectious etiology has been ruled out, and she is being given lactulose and held on rifaximin. Fall precautions and reorientation are also being implemented.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and EtOH cirrhosis. Supplements for multivitamins, folate, and thiamine are being administered. Spironolactone is also continued. Esophageal varices have been identified, and nadolol is prescribed daily. Peptic ulcer disease from chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use is present, and sucralfate and IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) are being continued.

Hypertension is also noted, and medications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. She was admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding and was found to have esophageal varices and a peptic ulcer. The patient underwent an endoscopy, which revealed grade II-III varices in the lower third of the esophagus, but no active bleeding. Two bands were successfully placed. The patient's bloody stools have resolved, and she is currently stable with normal vital signs. She is receiving octreotide, carafate, and heparin infusions, as well as other medications. The patient has leukocytosis, altered mental status (likely due to hepatic encephalopathy), hypertension, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure. She is on a PPI IV and will be advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. The plan is to continue monitoring her in the ICU and consider transferring her to the floor if her hemoglobin level remains stable. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, a common complication of cirrhosis. It is important to manage this condition by avoiding constipation, treating infections promptly, and ensuring electrolyte balance.
2. Esophageal varices bleeding: Although the patient's varices were not actively bleeding at the time of the endoscopy, there is still a risk of re-ble"

She required large-volume packed red blood cell (pRBC) resuscitation and intubation. The patient was later transferred to the medical floor but is now back in the ICU with a suspected lower GI bleed. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has improved from 34% to 38.0%. She underwent endoscopic band ligation for esophageal varices. The patient's mental status is still mildly confused. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis. It can lead to confusion, disorientation, and other neurological symptoms.
2. Infection: Prolonged intubation and ICU stay increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum color and odor is important.
3. Upper GI bleed recurrence: Despite the variceal banding procedure, there is a risk of recurrent upper GI bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and gastrointestinal symptoms is necessary.
4. Hepatitis: The patient's liver function tests show elevated ALT and AST levels, indicating possible hepatitis. Further evaluation and management are required.
