   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and subsequently intubated for worsening hypoxia. The patient has been transferred for further management in the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 131/60 to 152/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 20 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%, and an inspired-to-expired ratio (I:E) of 1:2.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 24400 cells/microliter, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.6 g/dL, blood glucose level of 389 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 1.6 mmol/L. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates a pH of 7.48, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 30 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 152 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 95%.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to viral pneumonia, complicated by a suspected MRSA superinfection. The patient has been treated with high-dose steroids and antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and sputum cultures will be necessary to identify any signs of infection.

2. Barotrauma: The high levels of PEEP and positive pressure ventilation may increase the risk of barotrauma, leading to lung injury or pneumothorax. Regular chest radiographs should be performed to assess for any signs of barotrauma.

3. Volatile abuse: Given the patient's history of COPD, there is a potential risk of volatile abuse, especially with the use of high-dose steroids. Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and oxygen requirements"

   at the OSH in the setting of pneumonia and worsening bilateral
   infiltrates.  Her CXR, large A-a gradient, and low PaO2/FiO2 are
   consistent with ARDS/acute lung injury.  MRSA on sputum sample from OSH
   suggestive of superinfection following a viral pneumonia but
   influenza/viral screen was negative.  She will need continued
   management of ARDS with ventilatory support.  We have been able to wean
   down her FiO2 while keeping PEEP at 20.  Bronched on [**6-10**] with neg gram
   stain.  On high dose solumedrol from [**6-6**] to [**6-10**].  Sputum culture with
   GPC in pairs and clusters.  Negative for influenza.
   - continue vanc/zosyn ([**Date range (1) 6279**]) for 10 day course
   - continue solumedrol but begin taper
   - f/u culture data
   - ARDS management with target tidal volumes of 5 cc/kg (ideal body
   weight 45 kg) but overbreathing on vent
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - consider esophageal balloon to optimize PEEP settings though
   oxygenation seems stable on current PEEP

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She presented to OSH with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. Due to worsening hypoxia, she was intubated and is now being transferred for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for worsening hypoxia and has a history of pneumonia with large bilateral infiltrates. She has ARDS/acute lung injury, as indicated by her CXR, large A-a gradient, and low PaO2/FiO2. She requires continued management of ARDS with ventilatory support. Potential complications may include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, or ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Superinfection: The patient's sputum sample showed MRSA, suggesting a superinfection following a viral pneumonia. This increases the risk of antibiotic resistance and requires appropriate antibiotic therapy.

3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's baseline COPD severity is unclear. Management should focus on optimizing respiratory failure management and providing appropriate bronchodilators such as albuterol and ipratropium inhalers.

4. Diabetes Management: The patient has diabetes, and insulin doses have been uptitrated. Glycemic control should be monitored closely to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism.
- She presented to OSH with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics for pneumonia, and intubated for worsening hypoxia.
- The patient has been transferred to further management.
- The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to ARDS/acute lung injury.
- She has a history of MRSA infection and requires continued management of ARDS with ventilatory support.
- The patient is currently on high-dose solumedrol and antibiotics (vanc/zosyn) for a 10-day course.
- She is also being managed for COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism.
- Further plans include weaning PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated, considering esophageal balloon to optimize PEEP settings, repeat bronch for BAL, CTA chest to rule out PE, and check dead space ratio.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's diagnosis of ARDS/acute lung injury, there is a potential for worsening respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or other respiratory complications.
2. Infection: The presence of MRSA infection suggests a potential for superinfection, especially since the patient is immunocompromised due to chronic illnesses and prolonged hospitalization.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old woman with history of asthma, COPD, DM, hypothyroidism
   presenting to OSH with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with
   antibiotics for pneumonia and intubated for worsening hypoxia, now
   transferred for further management.
   # Respiratory failure:  She was intubated for worsening hypoxia on [**6-7**]
   at the OSH in the setting of pneumonia and worsening bilateral
   infiltrates.  Her CXR, large A-a gradient, and low PaO2/FiO2 are
   consistent with ARDS/acute lung injury.  MRSA on sputum sample from OSH
   suggestive of superinfection following a viral pneumonia but
   influenza/viral screen was negative.  She will need continued
   management of ARDS with ventilatory support.  We have been able to wean
   down her FiO2 while keeping PEEP at 20.  Bronched on [**6-10**] with neg gram

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. Due to worsening hypoxia, she was intubated and transferred to the ICU for further management. She has been diagnosed with ARDS and is being managed with ventilatory support. The patient also has an MRSA infection that requires continued treatment. Her COPD status at baseline is unclear. She has other medical conditions such as diabetes and hypothyroidism, which require ongoing management. The patient's husband and son have been informed about her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current condition of ARDS puts her at risk for continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of her ventilatory support are necessary.
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and requires continued antibiotic treatment. There is a possibility of developing new infections while in the ICU, so careful infection control measures should be maintained.
3. COPD exacerbation: Although the severity of the patient's COPD is unclear, she may be at risk for exacerbations during her ICU stay. Monitoring her respiratory status and providing appropriate bronchodilators as needed is important.
4. Diabetes management: The patient's diabetes needs to be closely monitored and managed with insulin therapy to maintain glycemic control.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated for pneumonia. Due to worsening hypoxia, she was intubated and transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient's current condition indicates respiratory failure, possibly due to ARDS or acute lung injury. She also has leukocytosis and a positive MRSA sputum sample, suggesting a superinfection following viral pneumonia. Aspiration may also be a potential cause of respiratory decompensation.

The patient is receiving ventilatory support, and BAL fluid analysis revealed atypical plasma-like cells, which are suspicious for a lymphoproliferative disorder. The pathology resident wants to redo the BAL for confirmation. The patient's antibiotics have been adjusted, and she is being weaned off FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated. Other medical conditions such as COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism are being managed concurrently.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and bilateral infiltrates suggest acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute lung injury. This condition can lead to progressive respiratory failure if not properly managed.

2. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis and a positive MRSA sputum sample indicates the possibility of a superinfection following initial viral pneumonia. Infections can"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of COPD, asthma, and diabetes mellitus (DM), admitted for respiratory distress. They initially had an unremarkable CT scan but later developed widespread infiltrates and required intubation. Bronchoscopy did not reveal any microbes. The patient has multiple allergies, including Levofloxacin, and has been receiving various medications and infusions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.1 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 118/55 mmHg to 144/73 mmHg, heart rate between 60-78 beats per minute, respiratory rate set at 16 with spontaneous rate of 0, oxygen saturation at 95%, and sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1803 mL, with 652 mL given through PO, 779 mL through TF, 844 mL through IVF, and 247 mL through other sources. Total output consists of 1405 mL through total out, 145 mL through blood products, 1005 mL through urine, 400 mL through NG, and 507 mL through drains. The respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with settings such as Vt set at 400 mL, RR set at 16, PEEP at 20 cmH2O, FiO2 at 60%, and ABG results indicating a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 104, HCO3- of 31, Na+ of 146 mEq/L, K+ of 3.7 mEq/L, Cl- of 106 mEq/L, and HbA1c of 8.3%.

Physical examination reveals an obese, intubated, and sedated patient with distant breath sounds, an obese abdomen, and extreme trace edema. Lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and slightly elevated glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
- Type I diabetes mellitus (DM): Continue insulin therapy.
- Respiratory failure: Combination of infection, atelectasis, and edema. Plan includes diuresis, continued antibiotics, bronchodilators, weaning of steroids, and ventilation as tolerated.
- ICU care: Nutrition via tube feeding (TF), glycemic control through subcutaneous insulin (ssi), and ongoing monitoring of lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and VAP precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to ongoing infection, atelectasis, or fluid overload. There is also a risk of diabetic complications due to uncontrolled blood glucose levels. Other possible complications may include thromboembolic events, such as DVT or pulmonary embolism, due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheterization. Additionally, the patient's extreme trace edema and high serum creatinine levels may indicate renal dysfunction, which could further complicate the patient's condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of pneumonia, intubated in the ICU. The patient has a history of COPD, asthma, and diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 20 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. The patient's temperature is elevated at 101 degrees Fahrenheit, and vital signs are relatively stable within normal ranges for the ICU setting. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating possible poorly controlled diabetes. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values show a slightly alkalotic pH of 7.47, elevated partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio of 173, and adequate ventilation with a minute ventilation (Ve) of 7.7 L/min. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and lactate levels, suggesting potential organ dysfunction. The patient has received multiple antibiotic infusions over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever of unknown origin (FUO). They have a history of type I diabetes mellitus (DM) and acute respiratory failure, which is not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, receiving antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. They have multiple IV lines, including a PICC line and an arterial line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever of unknown origin suggests a possible ongoing infection. It is essential to continue monitoring for any signs of infection and adjusting the antibiotic regimen accordingly.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Given the patient's history of type I DM, there is a risk of developing DKA. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and electrolyte imbalances is necessary.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's acute respiratory failure indicates a high risk of respiratory complications. Monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial, and adjustments to the ventilator settings may be required.
4. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing VTE. Prophylactic measures such as early ambulation and DVT prophylaxis should be implemented.
5. Stress ulcer: Prolonged mechanical ventilation and critical illness can increase the risk of stress ulcers."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6228**] is a 66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with
   antibiotics for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory
   failure.
   # Respiratory failure:  She was intubated for worsening hypoxia on [**6-7**]
   at the OSH in the setting of worsening bilateral infiltrates and
   presumptive dx of pneumonia.  Her CXR, large A-a gradient, and low
   PaO2/FiO2 are consistent with ARDS/acute lung injury.  MRSA on sputum
   sample from OSH suggestive of superinfection following a viral
   pneumonia but influenza/viral screen was negative. Although overall
   clinical suspicion for PNA is low, there is some concern for infection
   given leukocytosis.
   - Wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - Consider mini-BAL given atypical plasma-like cells. [**Doctor Last Name **] from
   pathology ([**Pager number 6316**]) wants to repeat BAL sample.
   - Continue vanco and pip/tazo for 8 day course (stop after [**6-15**])
   - Taper solumedrol to 60 mg Q24H
   - Lasix 80 mg iv x1 this AM. Monitor UOP, [**Hospital1 **] lytes. Goal TBB -1-2L
   today.
   - Check serum total protein to albumin ratio.
   # COPD:  Unclear how severe patient's COPD is at baseline.  Asthma is
   well-controlled per pulmonary consult note from OSH.  Will continue
   respiratoy failure management as above.
   - respiratory failure management as above
   - albuterol and ipratropium inhalers
   # Diabetes: Continue ISS, have uptitrated insulin doses
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine.
   FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, regular diet

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. She required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure due to worsening bilateral infiltrates and presumptive diagnosis of pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS/acute lung injury and MRSA on sputum sample. She is currently receiving antibiotics, sedation, and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and bilateral infiltrates indicate a high risk for continued respiratory failure. The ongoing management plan includes weaning PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated, considering mini-BAL given atypical plasma-like cells, and repeating BAL sample.
2. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis raises concern for ongoing infection, despite negative influenza/viral screen. The patient is already on an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for suspected MRSA and bacterial pneumonia.
3. Fluid balance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, which may lead to fluid overload and subsequent complications such as pulmonary edema or heart failure.
4. Kidney function: The patient has received a substantial amount of IV fluids and diuretics (Lasix). Close monitoring of urine output and electrolytes is essential to avoid renal dysfunction.
5. Diabetes management: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to worsening hypoxia and bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS/acute lung injury. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and is currently intubated. She also has leukocytosis, suggesting a possible infection. 

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing severe respiratory distress and required intubation. There is a concern for superinfection following a viral pneumonia, as indicated by MRSA on sputum sample. The patient's condition is being managed by weaning PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated, considering mini-BAL, repeating BAL sample, continuing pip/tazo for an 8-day course, and tapering solumedrol.

2. COPD: The severity of the patient's COPD is unclear at baseline. Management of COPD is ongoing alongside the management of respiratory failure.

3. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is being managed with insulin supplementation.

4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is being treated with levothyroxine.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, superinfection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and complications related to diabetes and hypothyroidism. Close monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and intubated due to worsening hypoxia. The initial assessment revealed bilateral infiltrates consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute lung injury. A sputum sample showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), suggesting a superinfection following viral pneumonia, although influenza/viral screen was negative. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, receiving a low tidal volume ventilation strategy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute hypoxic respiratory failure necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure or deterioration in lung function due to ARDS or other underlying causes.

2. Infection: The presence of MRSA in the sputum sample suggests a potential infection. The patient may be at risk for developing or experiencing complications related to this infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis.

3. COPD Exacerbation: Given the patient's history of COPD, there is a possibility of an exacerbation of her underlying lung disease while she is in the ICU. Close monitoring and management of her respiratory status are essential to prevent further deterioration.

4. Diabetes Management:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient is febrile, still, and has been receiving Lasix. Blood cultures were taken from the PICC line and arterial lines, urine culture was taken, and stool culture was taken. The patient has allergies to Levofloxacin and unknown allergies. The patient has been receiving antibiotics including Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is on infusions of Fentanyl and Midazolam for pain and sedation, respectively. Heparin sodium is being administered as prophylaxis.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever. Vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/53 to 141/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 20 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 55%, and plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old obese male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He is being treated for pneumonia (pna) and a COPD flare-up. The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus (DM) and is receiving insulin therapy. He also has extreme trace edema, and his labs show elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose levels, and lactic acid levels. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/53 to 141/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted above.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. Given his compromised respiratory function, sepsis is a potential complication that needs to be closely monitored and managed.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's high blood glucose levels and presence of lactic acid could indicate the development of DKA. It is important to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy accordingly.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation"

- Blood culture, urine culture, and stool culture were ordered.
- Allergies include levofloxacin (unknown) and vancomycin.
- The patient received vancomycin at 08:06 PM on 06/13/2111 and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) at 12:47 AM on 06/14/2111.
- Infusions include fentanyl (100 mcg/hour) and midazolam (6 mg/hour).
- Other ICU medications include furosemide (Lasix), given at 07:05 PM on 06/13/2111, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis), started at 12:17 AM on 06/14/2111.
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the fever.
- Vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/53 to 141/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.
- Fluid balance shows an input of 3,134 mL total, including 678 mL of PO, 1,198 mL of TF, and 1,227 mL of IVF. Output includes 2,560 mL of total output, with 195 mL of blood products, 2,560 mL of urine, and 574 mL of NG output.
- Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set Vt of 400 mL, RR set at 16, PEEP of 20 cmH2O, FiO2 of 55%, and other parameters.
- Physical examination findings are not provided.
- Labs show low white blood cell count, slightly elevated glucose levels, and altered electrolyte levels.
- Assessment and plan include fever of unknown origin, diabetes mellitus type I, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and altered lab results may indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's diabetes and altered lab results, specifically the high glucose levels, may suggest the possibility of DKA.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation raise concerns for ARDS.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6228**] is a 66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with
   antibiotics for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory
   failure.
   # Respiratory failure:  Patient intubated for worsening hypoxia on [**6-7**]
   at the OSH in the setting of worsening bilateral infiltrates and
   presumptive dx of pneumonia.  Her CXR, large A-a gradient, and low
   PaO2/FiO2 are consistent with ARDS/acute lung injury.  MRSA on sputum
   culture from OSH suggestive of superinfection following a viral
   pneumonia but influenza/viral screen was negative. Although overall
   clinical suspicion for PNA is low, there is some concern for infection
   given leukocytosis.
   - Wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - Consider mini-BAL given atypical plasma-like cells. [**Doctor Last Name **] from
   pathology ([**Pager number 6316**]) wants to repeat BAL sample.
   - restart vancomycin; was d/c

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history significant for asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. The patient required intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.2°F, with a maximum temperature of 38.4°C. Her blood pressure is low, ranging from 107/49 to 88/42 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation is 94%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,289 mL and output of 2,905 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -616 mL. The patient has received a total of 736 mL of IV fluids.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.5 K/uL. Other notable lab values include a low hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, slightly elevated sodium level of 103 mEq/L, and elevated potassium levels of 36 mEq/L and 148 mEq/L. The patient also has an elevated blood glucose level of 221 mg/dL.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 59 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 185. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds and no signs of respiratory distress. Her cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, with normal heart sounds and pulses. The patient's abdominal examination is soft and non-tender. She has mild peripheral edema in both extremities. Neurological examination is not assessed due to her being intubated.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure, suspected pneumonia with MRSA, COPD exacerbation, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. The patient is on a weaning protocol for PEEP and FiO2, and a mini-BAL is being considered due to atypical plasma-like cells. The patient is also receiving a course of antibiotics (pip/tazo) for 8 days, and vancomycin is being held off per ID consultation. Tapering of solumedrol is planned, and the patient will receive Lasix 80 mg IV to promote diuresis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type I, and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. She was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to presumed viral pneumonia. The patient tested positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) on sputum sample, suggesting a superinfection following a viral pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, requiring mechanical ventilation. The risk of further respiratory failure, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ARDS progression, needs to be closely monitored.
2. Infection: The presence of MRSA and the positive H1N1 test indicate an ongoing infection. There is a risk of developing other healthcare-associated infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or pressure ulcers.
3. Diabetes Management: The patient has type I diabetes, and insulin doses may need to be adjusted based on her glycemic control. Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia can occur if not properly managed.
4. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's baseline COPD severity is unclear, but there is a risk of exacerbation due to the ongoing respiratory failure and potential superimposed infections.

","Summary:
Mrs. [Known lastname 6228], a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism, was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. She was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, unknown origin, and a positive test for H1N1. She has also shown signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she does not improve with current treatment or if there is a progression of ARDS.
2. Infection: The presence of fever and positive H1N1 test indicates a possible viral infection. There is also evidence of a superimposed bacterial infection, as suggested by MRSA on the sputum sample.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's diabetes management should be closely monitored to prevent DKA, especially with the recent uptitration of insulin doses.
4. Hypothyroidism: Continuation of levothyroxine is necessary to manage her hypothyroidism condition.
5. COPD Exacerbation: The severity of the patient's COPD exacerbation is unclear, but it should be closely monitored and managed appropriately.

   antibiotics for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory
   failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Patient intubated for worsening hypoxia
   on [**6-7**] at the OSH in the setting of worsening bilateral infiltrates
   and presumptive dx of pneumonia.  Her CXR, large A-a gradient, and low
   PaO2/FiO2 are consistent with ARDS/acute lung injury.  MRSA on sputum
   sample from OSH suggestive of superinfection following a viral
   pneumonia but influenza/viral screen was negative. Trial of diuresis
   over weekend was not helpful
   - F/U state lab H1N1 tests
   - TTE with bubbles limited study, but no shunt seen
   - Wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - re-bronch (mini-BAL) given atypical plasma-like cells. [**Doctor Last Name **] from

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute on chronic dyspnea and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and is suspected to have MRSA superinfection.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F (Tmax), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/64 to 137/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) levels, normal platelet count (Plt), and normal kidney and liver function tests.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, anemia, vaginal bleeding, and possible COPD exacerbation. The patient is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and others.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers. Close monitoring of"

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus type I, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, treated with antibiotics for pneumonia, and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and tested positive for H1N1 influenza. Her current condition includes fever, anemia of unclear etiology, and respiratory failure. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in oxygenation but still requires PEEP at 20 cmH2O and FiO2 at 55%. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/64 to 137/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Proper oral care and regular evaluation of sputum culture are necessary to prevent and detect this condition.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility due to intubation and the use of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic subcutaneous"

   Disposition: ICU care
","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type I, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute respiratory failure, which required intubation. The initial diagnosis was pneumonia, but subsequent tests indicated a possible superinfection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and influenza H1N1 infection.

The patient's vital signs include a fever of 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit, a heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 136/64 to 137/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support. Her temperature has been fluctuating throughout the day.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,436 mL and output of 2,235 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 201 mL. The patient is receiving intravenous fluids, and her urine output is within normal limits.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.5-17.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 7.9-8.2 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) of 44-104 K/uL. Blood glucose levels are elevated at 154-165 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated lactate levels, low albumin, and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient's respiratory support consists of mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 20 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 55%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 33 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 184, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 17.9 mL/min.

The patient's condition is being managed with antibiotics for MRSA and H1N1 infections, along with supportive care for respiratory failure, diabetes, COPD, and hypothyroidism. The plan includes weaning PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated, considering mini-BAL given atypical plasma-like cells, continuing antibiotic therapy, and tapering steroid doses.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, volutrauma, oxygen toxicity, and infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) or catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI). Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, and laboratory values is crucial to prevent and manage these complications."

   on [**6-7**] at the OSH in the setting of worsening bilateral infiltrates
   and presumptive dx of pneumonia.  Her CXR, large A-a gradient, and low
   PaO2/FiO2 are consistent with ARDS/acute lung injury.  MRSA on sputum
   sample from OSH suggestive of superinfection following a viral
   pneumonia but influenza/viral screen was negative. Trial of diuresis
   over weekend was not helpful
   - F/U state lab H1N1 tests
   - appreciate ID recs: switched to linezolid and started tamaflu
   - TTE with bubbles limited study, but no shunt seen

   d/cing Zosyn yesterday. BPs stable. Possible sources of infection
   include lung, abdominal, and urine.
   - BCx and UCx pending
   - F/U ID recs re: antibiotics and consider linezolid instead of vanco
   since spiking through vanc.
   - Consider adding back zosyn given d/c
d yesterday and now worsening.
   - Consider CT abd if continues to spike without source
   .
   # Anemia:  unclear etiology (consider vaginal bleeding), but has been
   trending down since admit. No source identified yet. Stool guaiac
   negative thus far.
   - guaiac stools
   - daily Hct
   - Send Fe studies.
   - transfuse if < 21 or hemodynamically unstable

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus type 1, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure due to worsening bilateral infiltrates and presumptive pneumonia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with PEEP at 20 cmH2O and FiO2 at 55%. The patient has been experiencing fevers, with a maximum temperature of 102.1°F today. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. She also has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL. The patient's respiratory status has been improving, but she remains non-responsive and sedated. Further investigations, including cultures and bronchoscopy, are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to chronic respiratory failure if there is persistent hypoxia and hypercapnia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, elevated white blood cell count, and worsening bilateral infiltrates suggest a possible pneumonia. If not appropriately treated, this could lead to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate poor control of diabetes. If insulin therapy is inadequate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of acute respiratory failure, type I diabetes mellitus, and unknown origin fever. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is receiving mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube. He has been unresponsive for several days and is being weaned off sedation for neurological examination. The patient has a history of allergies to levofloxacin and unknown antibiotics. Recent interventions include bronchoscopies, changes in antibiotic therapy, and mini-BAL done from PCP.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Ventilator-associated events such as ventilator-associated conditions (VAC), infection-related ventilator-associated complications (IVAC), or possible or probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) based on the patient's clinical presentation and culture results.
3. Nosocomial bloodstream infection due to the use of central lines.
4. Nosocomial urinary tract infection (UTI) due to catheterization.
5. Pressure injuries due to prolonged immobility.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and hypercoagulable state.
7. Nosocomial infections such as surgical site infections (SSIs) if any surgical procedures were performed.
8. Delirium or ICU psychosis due to prolonged sedation and immobilization.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6228**] is a 66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with
   antibiotics for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory
   failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Patient intubated for worsening hypoxia
   on [**6-7**] at the OSH in the setting of worsening bilateral infiltrates
   and presumptive dx of pneumonia.  H1N1 negative on screens but positive
   on state cx; MRSA on sputum sample from OSH suggestive of
   superinfection following a viral PNA although CT chest nl. Her CXR,
   large A-a gradient, and low PaO2/FiO2 are consistent with ARDS but not
   mechanics.  Of note, trial of diuresis over weekend was not helpful.
   TTE with bubbles limited study, but no shunt seen
   - f/u BAL cultures
   - completed pip/tazo for 8 day course (stop after [**6-15**])
   - appreciate ID recs: switched to linezolid and started tamiflu
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - taper solumedrol to 50 mg Q24H today
   - not candidate for trach due to very advanced resp failure
   .
   # Fevers: New for this admission with max today now to 102.1 after
   d/cing Zosyn [**6-15**]. BPs stable. Possible sources of infection include
   lung, abdominal, and urine.
   - F/u pending bcx, ucx, BAL cx
   - Vanco changed to linezolid and started oseltamivir per ID recs
   - Consider adding back zosyn given d/c
d yesterday and now worsening.
   - Consider CT abd, vaginal exam if continues to spike without source
   .
   # Anemia:  Unclear etiology (consider vaginal bleeding), but has been
   trending down since admit. No source identified yet. Stool guaiac
   negative thus far.
   - guaiac stools
   - daily Hct
   - Fe studies unrevealing
   - transfuse if < 21 or hemodynamically unstable
   - vaginal exam
   .
   #. Vaginal Bleeding: Currently hemodynamically stable.  No history of
   abnormal bleeding from PCP or hormone therapy
   - Pelvic U/S
   - vaginal exam today
   .
   # Asthma: Patient
s PCP confirmed [**Name9 (PRE) **]
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] more consistent with asthma
   than COPD.  Asthma is well-controlled per pulmonary consult note from
   OSH.  Will continue respiratoy failure management as above.
   - respiratory failure management as above
   - albuterol and ipratropium inhalers
   # Diabetes
Type 1: Continue ISS, have uptitrated insulin doses however
   FSBS in 300s still.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, anemia, and vaginal bleeding. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for several days, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Measures to prevent VAP should be continued, such as maintaining appropriate head-of-bed elevation and performing regular chest physiotherapy.
2. Nosocomial infections: Due to the prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures, there is an increased risk of nosocomial infections, including bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections. Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters, as well as prompt investigation of any signs of infection, is crucial.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest possible AKI. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, such as fluid restriction and adjustment of medications, should be considered.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Despite uptitrating insulin doses, the patient's blood glucose levels remain elevated. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and appropriate adjustment of insulin therapy are necessary to prevent DKA.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's anemia and vaginal bleeding require further"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6228**] is a 66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with
   antibiotics for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory
   failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Patient intubated for worsening hypoxia
   on [**6-7**] at the OSH in the setting of worsening bilateral infiltrates
   and presumptive dx of pneumonia.  H1N1 negative on screens but positive
   on state cx; MRSA on sputum sample from OSH suggestive of
   superinfection following a viral PNA although CT chest nl. Her CXR,
   large A-a gradient, and low PaO2/FiO2 are consistent with ARDS but not
   mechanics.  Of note, trial of diuresis over weekend was not helpful.
   TTE with bubbles limited study, but no shunt seen
   - f/u BAL cultures
   - completed pip/tazo for 8 day course (stop after [**6-15**])
   - appreciate ID recs: switched to linezolid and started tamiflu
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - taper solumedrol to 50 mg Q24H today
   - not candidate for trach due to very advanced resp failure
   .
   # Fevers: New for this admission with max today now to 102.1 after
   d/cing Zosyn [**6-15**]. BPs stable. Possible sources of infection include
   lung, abdominal, and urine.
   - F/u pending bcx, ucx, BAL cx
   - Vanco changed to linezolid and started oseltamivir per ID recs
   - Consider adding back zosyn given d/c
d yesterday and now worsening.
   - Consider CT abd, vaginal exam if continues to spike without source
   .
   # Anemia:  Unclear etiology (consider vaginal bleeding), but has been
   trending down since admit. No source identified yet. Stool guaiac
   negative thus far.
   - guaiac stools
   - daily Hct
   - Fe studies unrevealing
   - transfuse if < 21 or hemodynamically unstable
   - vaginal exam
   .
   #. Vaginal Bleeding: Currently hemodynamically stable.  No history of
   abnormal bleeding from PCP or hormone therapy
    - C/s Gyn re: vaginal exam
   .
   # Asthma: Patient
s PCP confirmed [**Name9 (PRE) **]
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] more consistent with asthma
   than COPD.  Asthma is well-controlled per pulmonary consult note from
   OSH.  Will continue respiratoy failure management as above.
   - respiratory failure management as above
   - albuterol and ipratropium inhalers
   # Diabetes
Type 1: Continue ISS, have uptitrated insulin doses however
   FSBS in 300s.
   - consider restart gtt today or change to humalog on the sliding scale
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history significant for asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and intubated due to worsening hypoxia. The initial diagnosis was pneumonia, but further testing revealed MRSA as a superinfection following a viral PNA. The patient also has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, a large A-a gradient, and low PaO2/FiO2, consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, anemia, and possible vaginal bleeding. The fevers are new for this admission and have reached a maximum of 102.1 degrees Fahrenheit after discontinuing Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). Possible sources of infection include the lung, abdomen, and urine. The anemia is of unclear etiology but has been trending down since admission. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis secondary to pneumonia or other sources of infection, and further decline in hemoglobin levels leading to more severe anemia. It is important to monitor the patient closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these complications from occurring."

   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Patient intubated for worsening hypoxia
   on [**6-7**] at the OSH in the setting of worsening bilateral infiltrates
   and presumptive dx of pneumonia.  H1N1 negative on screens but positive
   on state cx; MRSA on sputum sample from OSH suggestive of
   superinfection following a viral PNA although CT chest nl. Her CXR,
   large A-a gradient, and low PaO2/FiO2 are consistent with ARDS but not
   mechanics.  Of note, trial of diuresis over weekend was not helpful but
   CXR today looks volume overloaded and fluid balance positive and may be
   cause of continued difficult ventilation.
   - diuresis today with goal net negative 1-2L as lower mortality with
   ARDS patients who have negative fluid balance.
   - Change linezolid to PO so less volume. Consider change TFs to less
   volume as well.
   - f/u BAL cultures
   - appreciate ID recs: switched to linezolid and started tamiflu. - wean
   PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - taper solumedrol to 50 mg Q24H today
   - not candidate for trach due to very advanced resp failure
   .
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: New over the last few days for this admission
   with max today now to 101.1 after d/cing Zosyn [**6-15**]. BPs stable.
   Possible sources of infection include lung, abdominal, and urine as
   well as lines.
   - PICC from OSH. Will need to take out. Resite PIV and if unable will
   likely need CVL.
   - F/u pending bcx, ucx, BAL cx, stool studies
   - Vanco changed to linezolid and started oseltamivir per ID recs
   - Consider adding back zosyn given d/c
d on [**6-15**] and now
   worsening->however white count started rising prior to this on [**6-12**].
   - Consider CT abd if continues to spike
   .
   # Anemia:  Unclear etiology (consider vaginal bleeding), but has been
   trending down since admit. No source identified yet. Stool guaiac
   negative thus far.
   - daily Hct
   - Fe studies unrevealing
   - transfuse if < 21 or hemodynamically unstable
   - vaginal exam

   #. Vaginal Bleeding: Currently hemodynamically stable.  No history of
   abnormal bleeding from PCP or hormone therapy. Vaginal exam showed
   blood in vault, but later vaginal exam by OB/GYN did not see any blood.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. The patient required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure due to worsening bilateral infiltrates and presumptive diagnosis of pneumonia. She tested negative for H1N1 but positive on state cx. MRSA was found on sputum sample from OSH, suggesting a superinfection following viral PNA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included worsening hypoxia, leading to intubation. She has ARDS with large A-a gradient and low PaO2/FiO2. Diuresis is being initiated to achieve a negative fluid balance, which is associated with lower mortality in ARDS patients.

2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has developed fevers over the last few days, with a maximum temperature of 101.1. Possible sources of infection include the lung, abdomen, urine, as well as lines. PICC line removal, re-siting PIV, and consideration of a central venous line may be necessary. Further blood cultures, urine cultures, and stool studies are needed.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been trending down since admission. The etiology of anemia is unclear, but it may be"

Her chest X-ray showed large A-a gradient and low PaO2/FiO2 consistent with ARDS. 

The patient has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis over the last few days, with a maximum temperature of 101.1 today. Possible sources of infection include the lung, abdomen, and urine. The patient's white blood cell count started rising prior to the discontinuation of Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) on [**6-15**]. 

She also has anemia, trending down since admission, with unclear etiology, possibly due to vaginal bleeding. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and has no history of abnormal bleeding. 

Additionally, the patient has asthma, which is well-controlled, and type 1 diabetes, with poorly controlled blood sugar levels despite uptitrated insulin doses. 

The patient's hypothyroidism is being managed with levothyroxine. 

In the ICU, the patient is receiving Ensure nutrition, insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's arterial and peripheral IV lines were placed on [**2111-6-9**]. 

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Patient intubated for worsening hypoxia
   on [**6-7**] at the OSH in the setting of worsening bilateral infiltrates
   and presumptive dx of pneumonia.  H1N1 negative on screens but positive
   on state cx; MRSA on sputum sample from OSH suggestive of
   superinfection following a viral PNA although CT chest nl. Her CXR,
   large A-a gradient, and low PaO2/FiO2 are consistent with ARDS but not
   mechanics.  Of note, trial of diuresis over weekend was not helpful.
   TTE with bubbles limited study, but no shunt seen
   - f/u BAL cultures
   - completed pip/tazo for 8 day course (stop after [**6-15**])
   - appreciate ID recs: switched to linezolid and started tamiflu
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - taper solumedrol to 50 mg Q24H today
   - not candidate for trach due to very advanced resp failure
   .
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: New over the last few days for this admission
   with max today now to 101.1 after d/cing Zosyn [**6-15**]. BPs stable.
   Possible sources of infection include lung, abdominal, and urine.
   - F/u pending bcx, ucx, BAL cx, stool studies
   - Vanco changed to linezolid and started oseltamivir per ID recs
   - Consider adding back zosyn given d/c
d on [**6-15**] and now
   worsening->however white count started rising prior to this on [**6-12**].
   - Consider CT abd, vaginal exam if continues to spike without source
   .
   # Anemia:  Unclear etiology (consider vaginal bleeding), but has been
   trending down since admit. No source identified yet. Stool guaiac
   negative thus far.
   - daily Hct
   - Fe studies unrevealing
   - transfuse if < 21 or hemodynamically unstable
   - vaginal exam
   .
   #. Vaginal Bleeding: Currently hemodynamically stable.  No history of
   abnormal bleeding from PCP or hormone therapy. Vaginal exam showed
   blood in vault, but later vaginal exam by OB/GYN did not see any blood.
   - Pelvic U/S
   - f/u Ob/gyn recs.
   .
   # Asthma: Patient
s PCP confirmed [**Name9 (PRE) **]
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] more consistent with asthma
   than COPD.  Asthma is well-controlled per pulmonary consult note from
   OSH.  Will continue respiratoy failure management as above.
   - respiratory failure management as above
   - albuterol and ipratropium inhalers
   # Diabetes
Type 1: Continue ISS, have uptitrated insulin doses however
   FSBS in 300s still.
   - Increase humalog on the sliding scale
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine.

   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Patient intubated for worsening hypoxia
   on [**6-7**] at the OSH in the setting of worsening bilateral infiltrates
   and presumptive dx of pneumonia.  H1N1 negative on screens but positive
   on state cx; MRSA on sputum sample from OSH suggestive of
   superinfection following a viral PNA although CT chest nl. Her CXR,
   large A-a gradient, and low PaO2/FiO2 are consistent with ARDS but not
   mechanics.  Of note, trial of diuresis over weekend was not helpful.
   TTE with bubbles limited study, but no shunt seen
   - f/u BAL cultures
   - completed pip/tazo for 8 day course (stop after [**6-15**])
   - appreciate ID recs: switched to linezolid and started tamiflu
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - taper solumedrol to 50 mg Q24H today
   - not candidate for trach due to very advanced resp failure
   .
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: New over the last few days for this admission
   with max today now to 101.1 after d/cing Zosyn [**6-15**]. BPs stable.
   Possible sources of infection include lung, abdominal, and urine.
   - F/u pending bcx, ucx, BAL cx, stool studies
   - Vanco changed to linezolid and started oseltamivir per ID recs
   - Consider adding back zosyn given d/c
d on [**6-15**] and now
   worsening->however white count started rising prior to this on [**6-12**].
   - Consider CT abd, vaginal exam if continues to spike without source
   .
   # Anemia:  Unclear etiology (consider vaginal bleeding), but has been
   trending down since admit. No source identified yet. Stool guaiac
   negative thus far.
   - daily Hct
   - Fe studies unrevealing
   - transfuse if < 21 or hemodynamically unstable
   - vaginal exam

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history significant for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute on chronic dyspnea and was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and has shown signs of worsening bilateral infiltrates. She tested negative for H1N1 influenza but positive for MRSA on sputum sample.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for worsening hypoxia and presumptive pneumonia. She has large A-a gradient, low PaO2/FiO2, and consistent with ARDS but not requiring mechanical ventilation. The plan is to wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated, taper solumedrol to 50 mg Q24H, and not consider tracheostomy due to advanced respiratory failure.
2. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient has had fevers and leukocytosis over the last few days with a maximum temperature of 101.1. Possible sources of infection include lung, abdominal, and urine. The plan is to follow up pending blood cultures, urine cultures, and BAL cultures. The antibiotic regimen has been changed to linezolid and oseltamivir per ID recommendations.

   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.

   on [**6-7**] at the OSH in the setting of worsening bilateral infiltrates
   and presumptive dx of pneumonia.  H1N1 negative on screens but positive
   on state cx; MRSA on sputum sample from OSH suggestive of
   superinfection following a viral PNA although CT chest nl. Her CXR,
   large A-a gradient, and low PaO2/FiO2 consistent with ARDS but not
   mechanics.  Of note, trial of diuresis over weekend was not helpful but
   CXR today looks volume overloaded and fluid balance positive and may be
   cause of continued difficult ventilation.
   - diuresis with goal net negative 1-2L as lower mortality with ARDS
   patients who have negative fluid balance.
   - Change linezolid to PO so less volume. Consider change TFs to less
   volume as well.
   - f/u BAL cultures
   - appreciate ID recs: switched to linezolid and started tamiflu. - wean
   PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - taper solumedrol to 50 mg Q24H today

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. The patient's condition worsened, leading to hypoxic respiratory failure, and she was intubated. Her blood tests showed elevated white blood cell count, indicating possible infection. The CT chest revealed diffuse multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacity with minimal worsening of consolidation in the right lower lobe. The CT head was normal, ruling out any acute intracranial pathology. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 55%. She has been receiving intravenous antibiotics, including linezolid and oseltamivir, as per infectious disease recommendations. The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable, with a heart rate ranging from 63-94 beats per minute, blood pressure between 102/51-143/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation above 95%. Fluid balance has been positive, and there is evidence of volume overload on the chest X-ray. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating,"

   - OB/GYN consulted for vaginal bleeding noted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5142**].  They
   did not see blood. Pelvic ultrasound with severely limited
   visualization.  Either way, OB/GYN feels that endometrial ca is
   unlikely and transvaginal U/S can be done as outpatient.
   - Spoke with family who indicated they would like some neurologic
   evaluation, ie CT head.  If her mental status were severely affected,
   they may want to withdraw care. CT head without intracranial process,
   air-fluid level in sphenoid sinus possibly from long term intubation
   - CT Chest *** prelim read with overall improvement in ground glass
   opacities, minimal change/worsening of opacities in RML and LUL.
   - ET tube was kinked after CT scan so it was changed out.
   - Only 1 PIV could be placed.  Since patient afebrile during the day,
   PICC was kept in.

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated for pneumonia with antibiotics. She was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers/leukocytosis, anemia, and vaginal bleeding. 

The patient's condition has been complicated by the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is indicated by worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio consistent with ARDS. The patient's fluid balance is positive, suggesting volume overload, which may be contributing to difficult ventilation.

The patient also has leukocytosis and fevers, indicating a possible infection. Sources of infection include the lung, abdomen, and urine, as well as lines. Foley catheter change was performed due to yeast in the urine culture. 

Additionally, the patient has anemia with an unclear etiology, and vaginal bleeding without active bleeding visualized on gynecological examination. The pelvic ultrasound did not reveal any significant findings, and gynecological consultation suggests an outpatient workup for vaginal bleeding.

In summary, the patient's potential medical complications include hypoxic respiratory failure, ARDS, infection (possible pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or catheter-related infection), anemia, and vaginal bleeding."

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: she is unable to assess her own mental status, peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic function due to being intubated. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type I, acute respiratory failure, and anemia secondary to blood loss. She also has a fever of unknown origin and possible endometrial cancer.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 102/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 55%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.49, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 51 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 242 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 35 mEq/L.

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old female admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, acute respiratory failure, type I diabetes mellitus, and acute anemia secondary to blood loss. The patient has been experiencing fever of unknown origin and has a history of hypothermia. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 102/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 55%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of +751 mL since 12 AM, with total input of 3,151 mL and total output of 2,400 mL. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress if there are any complications related to the mechanical ventilation or if the underlying cause of the respiratory failure worsens.
2. Infection: The presence of fever of unknown origin indicates a potential infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic treatment should be considered.
3. Diabetes Management: The patient has type I diabetes mellitus, and her blood glucose levels should be monitored regularly. Insulin therapy may be required to maintain glycemic control.
4. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. Further evaluation and"

   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Patient intubated for worsening hypoxia
   on [**6-7**] at the OSH in the setting of worsening bilateral infiltrates
   and presumptive dx of pneumonia.  H1N1 negative on screens but positive
   on state cx; MRSA on sputum sample from OSH suggestive of
   superinfection following a viral PNA although CT chest nl. Her CXR,
   large A-a gradient, and low PaO2/FiO2 are consistent with ARDS but not
   mechanics.  Of note, trial of diuresis over weekend was not helpful but
   CXR today looks volume overloaded and fluid balance positive and may be
   cause of continued difficult ventilation.
   - diuresis today with goal net negative 1-2L as lower mortality with
   ARDS patients who have negative fluid balance.
   - Change linezolid to PO so less volume. Consider change TFs to less
   volume as well.
   - f/u BAL cultures
   - appreciate ID recs: switched to linezolid and started tamiflu. - wean
   PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - taper solumedrol to 50 mg Q24H today
   - not candidate for trach due to very advanced resp failure

   # Fevers/leukocytosis: New over the last few days for this admission
   but afebrile yesterday. BPs stable. Possible sources of infection
   include lung, abdominal, and urine as well as lines.
   - PICC kept in as patient afebrile over yesterday.
   - F/u pending bcx, ucx, BAL cx, stool studies
   - continue linezolid and oseltamivir per ID recs
   - Consider adding back zosyn given d/c

   negative thus far.

   #. Vaginal Bleeding: Currently hemodynamically stable.  No history of
   abnormal bleeding from PCP or hormone therapy. Vaginal exam showed
   blood in vault, but later vaginal exam by OB/GYN did not see any
   blood.  Pelvic U/s unrevealing but OB/GYN suggests outpatient workup as

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure. The initial diagnosis was pneumonia, but further investigations revealed no evidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, leukocytosis, anemia, and vaginal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for continued difficult ventilation due to fluid overload, and diuresis has been initiated to achieve a negative fluid balance.
2. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient has been experiencing fevers over the last few days, and her white blood cell count is elevated. Possible sources of infection include the lungs, abdomen, and urine as well as intravascular lines. Further investigations are needed to identify the source of infection.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been trending down since admission, suggesting acute blood loss. The cause of the anemia is unclear, but it could be related to vaginal bleeding. Stool guaiac test has been negative thus far.
4. Vaginal Bleeding: The patient presented with vaginal bleeding, but subsequent examinations did not reveal any"

   unlikely and transvaginal U/S can be done as outpatient.
   - Spoke with family who indicated they would like some neurologic
   evaluation, ie CT head.  If her mental status were severely affected,
   they may want to withdraw care. CT head without intracranial process,
   air-fluid level in sphenoid sinus possibly from long term intubation

   large A-a gradient, and low PaO2/FiO2 consistent with ARDS but not
   mechanics.  Of note, trial of diuresis over weekend was not helpful but
   CXR today looks volume overloaded and fluid balance positive and may be
   cause of continued difficult ventilation.
   - diuresis with goal net negative 1-2L as lower mortality with ARDS
   patients who have negative fluid balance.
   - Change linezolid to PO so less volume. Consider change TFs to less
   volume as well.
   - f/u BAL cultures
   - appreciate ID recs: switched to linezolid and started tamiflu. - wean
   PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - taper solumedrol to 50 mg Q24H today
   - not candidate for trach due to very advanced resp failure
   .
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: New over the last few days for this admission
   but afebrile yesterday with decrease in leukocytosis. BPs stable.
   Possible sources of infection include lung, abdominal, and urine as
   well as lines. Foley changed for yeast in urine cx.
   - PICC kept in as patient afebrile over yesterday.
   - F/u pending bcx, BAL cx, stool studies
   - continue linezolid and oseltamivir per ID recs
   - Remove lines, consider CT abd if continues to spike. Could consider
   adding back zosyn but WBC started rising on [**6-12**] prior to d/c on [**6-15**].

   Phlebotomy v. vaginal bleed but no active bleed visualized on Gyn exam.
   Stools guaiac negative. Fe studies unrevealing.
   - daily Hct
   - transfuse if < 21 or hemodynamically unstable

   #. Vaginal Bleeding: Currently hemodynamically stable.  No history of
   abnormal bleeding from PCP or hormone therapy. Vaginal exam showed
   blood in vault, but later vaginal exam by OB/GYN did not see any
   blood.  Pelvic U/s unrevealing but OB/GYN suggests outpatient workup as
   gyn cancer is unlikely to cause her symptoms.
   - Appreciate Ob/Gyn recs. Monitor; consider repeat transvaginal
   bleeding if recurs. Otherwise, can have outpatient f/u.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted for acute on chronic dyspnea and treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. She was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She also has fevers, leukocytosis, metabolic alkalosis, anemia, and vaginal bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia on [**6-7**] resulted in intubation due to bilateral infiltrates and presumptive pneumonia diagnosis. She has ARDS, but not yet developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has new fevers over the last few days but was afebrile yesterday with a decrease in leukocytosis. Possible sources of infection include lung, abdominal, and urine as well as lines.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis possibly due to diuresis.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with an unclear etiology. It has been trending down since admission, and phlebotomy was performed for suspected vaginal bleeding. However, no active bleed was visualized during the gynecological examination.

5. Vaginal Bleeding: The patient is experiencing vaginal bleeding, which is currently"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: H1N1 with superinfection with MRSA and
   ARDS physiology with poor output to lasix 40mg IV
   - Lasix drip today for smoother diuresis since transiently hypotensive
   with lasix yesterday
   - diuresis with goal net negative 1-2L as lower mortality with ARDS
   patients who have negative fluid balance.
   - Change linezolid to PO so less volume. Consider change TFs to less
   volume as well.
   - f/u BAL cultures
   - appreciate ID recs: switched to linezolid (10 days- [**6-27**] last dose)
   and started tamiflu (8 days-[**6-23**] last dose).
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - taper solumedrol to 50 mg Q24H (day 3 of 50mg)
   - not candidate for trach due to very advanced resp failure
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: New over the last few days for this admission
   but afebrile yesterday with decrease in leukocytosis. BPs stable.
   Possible sources of infection include lung, abdominal, and urine as
   well as lines. Foley changed for yeast in urine cx.
   - PICC kept in as patient afebrile over yesterday and did not look
   infected.
   - F/u pending bcx, BAL cx, stool studies (CDiff neg)
   - continue linezolid and oseltamivir per ID recs
   - Repeat UA now that foley changed to ensure yeast just contaminant.
   # Metabolic alkalosis: Bicarb has been trending up over last few days.
   Unclear etiology. Will monitor.
   # Anemia:  Unclear etiology but has been trending down since admit.
   Phlebotomy v. vaginal bleed but no active bleed visualized on Gyn exam.
   Stools guaiac negative. Fe studies unrevealing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. She required intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by H1N1 influenza with a superimposed infection of MRSA. The patient developed ARDS and has been receiving various treatments, including diuretics, antibiotics, and supportive care.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, which required intubation and mechanical ventilation. This condition is a serious complication that can result in prolonged ventilation and potential long-term lung damage.

2. MRSA infection: The patient's pneumonia was complicated by a superimposed infection of MRSA, which is a type of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This infection may require prolonged antibiotic therapy and increases the risk of treatment failure and complications.

3. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient developed ARDS, a severe lung condition characterized by diffuse inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. ARDS often leads to respiratory failure and has a high mortality rate.

4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has been experiencing metabolic alkalosis, which is indicated by an elevated bicarbonate level. The cause of this condition is unclear, and it will need to be monitored closely.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been trending down since admission"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: H1N1 with superinfection with MRSA and
   ARDS physiology with poor output to lasix 40mg IV
   - Lasix drip today for smoother diuresis since transiently hypotensive
   with lasix yesterday
   - diuresis with goal net negative 1-2L as lower mortality with ARDS
   patients who have negative fluid balance.
   - Change linezolid to PO so less volume. Consider change TFs to less
   volume as well.
   - f/u BAL cultures
   - appreciate ID recs: switched to linezolid (10 days- [**6-27**] last dose)
   and started tamiflu (8 days-[**6-23**] last dose).
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - taper solumedrol to 50 mg Q24H (day 3 of 50mg)
   - not candidate for trach due to very advanced resp failure
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: New over the last few days for this admission
   but afebrile yesterday with decrease in leukocytosis. BPs stable.
   Possible sources of infection include lung, abdominal, and urine as
   well as lines. Foley changed for yeast in urine cx.
   - PICC kept in as patient afebrile over yesterday and did not look
   infected.
   - F/u pending bcx, BAL cx, stool studies (CDiff neg)
   - continue linezolid and oseltamivir per ID recs
   - Repeat UA now that foley changed to ensure yeast just contaminant.
   # Metabolic alkalosis: Bicarb has been trending up over last few days.
   Unclear etiology. Will monitor.
   # Anemia:  Unclear etiology but has been trending down since admit.
   Phlebotomy v. vaginal bleed but no active bleed visualized on Gyn exam.
   Stools guaiac negative. Fe studies unrevealing.
   - Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse if < 21 or hemodynamically unstable
   #. Diabetes: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs 60glargine QD with 15 regular Q6H and reg
   SS
   #. Vaginal Bleeding: Currently hemodynamically stable.  No history of
   abnormal bleeding from PCP or hormone therapy. Vaginal exam showed
   blood in vault, but later vaginal exam by OB/GYN did not see any
   blood.  Pelvic U/s unrevealing but OB/GYN suggests outpatient workup as
   gyn cancer is unlikely to cause her symptoms.
   - Appreciate Ob/Gyn recs. Monitor; consider repeat transvaginal
   bleeding if recurs. Otherwise, can have outpatient f/u.
   # ?MS: CT not helpful in giving prognostic indicators family was
   looking for. Likely [**2-16**] medications. Will re-evaluate when able to

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated.

Current Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS physiology with poor output to lasix 40mg IV. A lasix drip was started for smoother diuresis. The goal is a net negative fluid balance of 1-2L as lower mortality in ARDS patients.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has had new fevers over the last few days, but was afebrile yesterday with a decrease in leukocytosis. Possible sources of infection include the lung, abdomen, and urine, as well as lines. Foley changed due to yeast in urine culture. Continue linezolid and oseltamivir per ID recs.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb has been trending up over the last few days. Unclear etiology. Will monitor.
4. Anemia: Unclear etiology but has been trending down since admission. Phlebotomy v. vaginal bleed but no active bleed visualized on Gyn exam. Stools guaiac negative. Fe studies unrevealing.
5. Diabetes: 60glargine QD with 15 regular Q6H and reg SS.
6. Vaginal Bleeding: Currently hemodynamically stable. No history of abnormal bleeding from PCP or hormone therapy. Vaginal exam showed blood in vault, but later vaginal exam by OB/GYN did not see any blood. Pelvic U/s unrevealing but OB/GYN suggests outpatient workup as gyn cancer is unlikely to cause her symptoms.
7.?MS: CT not helpful in giving prognostic indicators family was looking for. Likely [**2-16**] medications. Will re-evaluate when able to titrate down meds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS physiology and poor response to lasix may indicate a potential complication related to respiratory failure.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The presence of new fevers and leukocytosis suggests a potential infection, which could be due to the lung, abdomen, urine, or lines.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The increasing bicarb levels indicate a potential metabolic alkalosis, although the etiology is unclear.
4. Anemia: The decreasing hemoglobin levels suggest a potential anemia, but the cause is unknown.
5. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes management plan needs to be closely monitored.
6. Vaginal Bleeding: The patient's vaginal bleeding requires further investigation, although gyn cancer is unlikely.
7.?MS: The patient's mental status changes may indicate a potential neurological complication."

   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: H1N1 with superinfection with MRSA and
   ARDS physiology. Still net positive on lasix gtt; dose limited by BP.
   - Diuresis with goal net negative 1-2L as lower mortality with ARDS
   patients who have negative fluid balance. Restart lasix gtt as
   tolerated and review I/O to minimize IV fluids in
   - f/u BAL cultures
   - appreciate ID recs: switched to linezolid (10 days- [**6-27**] last dose)
   and started tamiflu (8 days-[**6-23**] last dose).
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - taper solumedrol by 10mg q3d, decrease to 40 mg Q24H today
   - not candidate for trach due to very advanced resp failure
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: New over the last few days for this admission
   but afebrile yesterday with decrease in leukocytosis. BPs stable.
   Possible sources of infection include lung, abdominal, and urine as
   well as lines. Foley changed for yeast in urine cx.
   - PICC kept in as patient afebrile over yesterday and did not look
   infected.
   - F/u pending bcx, BAL cx, stool studies (CDiff neg)
   - continue linezolid and oseltamivir as above per ID recs
   - Repeat UA now that foley changed to ensure yeast just contaminant.
   # Metabolic alkalosis: Bicarb has been trending up over last few days.
   Unclear etiology. Will monitor.
   # Anemia:  Unclear etiology but has been trending down since admit.
   Phlebotomy v. vaginal bleed but no active bleed visualized on Gyn exam.
   Stools guaiac negative. Fe studies unrevealing.
   - Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse if < 21 or hemodynamically unstable
   #. Diabetes: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs 60glargine QD with 15 regular Q6H and reg
   SS
   #. Vaginal Bleeding: Currently hemodynamically stable.  No history of
   abnormal bleeding from PCP or hormone therapy. Vaginal exam showed
   blood in vault, but later vaginal exam by OB/GYN did not see any
   blood.  Pelvic U/s unrevealing but OB/GYN suggests outpatient workup as
   gyn cancer is unlikely to cause her symptoms.
   - Appreciate Ob/Gyn recs. Monitor; consider repeat transvaginal
   bleeding if recurs. Otherwise, can have outpatient f/u.
   # ?MS: CT not helpful in giving prognostic indicators family was
   looking for. Likely [**2-16**] medications. Will re-evaluate when able to
   titrate down meds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. She tested positive for H1N1 and had a superinfection with MRSA, resulting in ARDS physiology.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics and has shown some improvement. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains hypoxic. She is still net positive on lasix gtt due to ongoing fluid balance issues. The medical team is working towards achieving a negative fluid balance as it is associated with lower mortality in ARDS patients.

The patient has fevers and leukocytosis, which could indicate an ongoing infection. Possible sources include the lung, abdomen, and urine, as well as central lines. The Foley catheter was changed due to yeast in the urine culture. The patient is currently afebrile and looking better.

The patient also has metabolic alkalosis with an unclear etiology. Monitoring is recommended. Anemia is another concern with an unclear cause. Phlebotomy versus vaginal bleed is a possibility, but no active bleed was visualized on the gynecological examination. Stool guaiac is negative, and Fe studies are unrevealing.

Other conditions include diabetes, vaginal bleeding, and possible multiple sclerosis. The CT scan did not provide any"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: H1N1 with superinfection with MRSA and
   ARDS physiology. Still net positive on lasix gtt; dose limited by BP.
   - Try propofol with fentanyl bolus today and d/c midaz/fentanyl
   - Diuresis with goal net negative 1-2L as lower mortality with ARDS
   patients who have negative fluid balance. Restart lasix gtt as
   tolerated and review I/O to minimize IV fluids in
   - f/u BAL cultures
   - appreciate ID recs: switched to linezolid (10 days- [**6-27**] last dose)
   and started tamiflu (8 days-[**6-23**] last dose).
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - taper solumedrol by 10mg q3d, decrease to 40 mg Q24H today
   - not candidate for trach due to very advanced resp failure
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: New over the last few days for this admission
   but afebrile yesterday with decrease in leukocytosis. BPs stable.
   Possible sources of infection include lung, abdominal, and urine as
   well as lines. Foley changed for yeast in urine cx.
   - Check diff on WBC today
   - PICC kept in as patient afebrile over yesterday and did not look
   infected but if bands will d/c picc
   - F/u pending bcx, BAL cx, stool studies (CDiff neg)
   - continue linezolid and oseltamivir as above per ID recs
   - Repeat UA now that foley changed to ensure yeast just contaminant.
   # Metabolic alkalosis: Bicarb has been trending up over last few days.
   Unclear etiology. Will monitor.
   # Anemia:  Unclear etiology but has been trending down since admit.
   Phlebotomy v. vaginal bleed but no active bleed visualized on Gyn exam.
   Stools guaiac negative. Fe studies unrevealing.
   - Hct daily
   - transfuse if < 21 or hemodynamically unstable

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism.
- She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia.
- She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by H1N1 infection with a superimposed MRSA infection and ARDS physiology.
- She has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis over the last few days but was afebrile yesterday.
- She has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, antivirals, sedatives, analgesics, and diuretics.
- Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/51 mmHg to 135/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 86%.
- She has bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation and trace edema bilaterally.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count.
- She has been receiving daily chest X-rays, blood cultures, and other lab tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying infection is not effectively managed."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure due to H1N1 with a superinfection of MRSA and ARDS physiology.

The patient has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis, which may indicate an infection. Possible sources include the lung, abdomen, and urine, as well as lines. The Foley catheter was changed due to yeast in the urine culture. Blood cultures, BAL cultures, and stool studies are pending.

The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, with bicarbonate trending up over the last few days. The etiology is unclear, so it will be monitored. Anemia is present, but its cause is unclear. It has been trending down since admission. The patient may require transfusion if her hemoglobin level is less than 21 or if she becomes hemodynamically unstable.

The patient's diabetes management plan includes 60 units of insulin glargine once daily and 15 units of regular insulin every 6 hours. Additionally, she has a history of multiple sclerosis, but no prognosis can be determined from the head CT.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 120/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute"

   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: H1N1 with MRSA superinfection and ARDS
   physiology. Now likely fluid overloaded after IV fluid boluses
   yesterday and off lasix gtt given lower-running BPs. Easy agitated with
   severe bronchospasms concerning for ptx risk and requiring increasing
   doses of sedations.
   - Wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - Increase sedation (propofol, fentanyl) prn
   - F/u cx
   - Diurese with lasix 20mg x 1 and lasix gtt with pressors as needed.
   Goal net negative 1-2L as lower mortality with ARDS patients who have
   negative fluid balance.
   - If diuresis not helpful, consider other etiologies including PCP
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: New over the last few days for this admission
   but afebrile yesterday with decrease in leukocytosis. BPs stable.
   Possible sources of infection include lung, abdominal, and urine as
   well as lines. Foley changed for yeast in urine cx.
   - Lines changed [**2111-6-20**]
   - F/u pending bcx, BAL cx, stool studies (CDiff neg)
   - continue linezolid, oseltamivir as above per ID recs

   # Metabolic alkalosis: Bicarb has been trending up over last few days,
   but down to 31 today. Will monitor.
   # Anemia:  Unclear etiology but has been trending down since admit.
   Possibly due to phlebotomy v. vaginal bleed but no active bleed
   visualized on exam by OB/GYN. Stools guaiac negative. Fe studies
   unrevealing.
   - transfuse 1 U for Hct of 19 and get post-transfusion hct.
   - transfuse if < 23 or hemodynamically unstable
   #. Diabetes: few low FSG overnight. Adjust scale pen.
   #. MS: Likely [**2-16**] meds. Head CT unhelpful for prognosis. Will see how
   she is on propofol.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. She developed hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient has been diagnosed with H1N1 with MRSA superinfection and ARDS physiology. She is now showing signs of fluid overload after receiving IV fluid boluses yesterday and has been off lasix gtt. The patient is agitated with severe bronchospasms, which may indicate a risk of pneumothorax and requires increasing doses of sedation.

24-hour events:
- Sedation was changed to propofol, and the patient became more comfortable. The ventilator settings were adjusted to pressure support and decreased PEEP from 14 to 12.
- The patient's temperature spiked to 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and her white blood cell count increased. Blood cultures were sent, and a right internal jugular (RIJ) line was placed with the tip ending in the right atrium (RA). The old peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line was removed due to tip misplacement.
- The endotracheal (ET) tube was advanced by 2 cm, but the patient experienced bronchospasm in the evening. Nebulizers were used without improvement. The ET tube was then pulled back to 22 cm with some improvement,"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female with history of Asthma and with multi-month course of ABX
   now with 15 day admission with respiratory failure (hypoxic) and with
   MRSA PNA noted and having H1N1 flu positive with subsequent tests
   negative (state lab=PCR) and now with persistent hypoxemic respiratory
   failuire.  She has had some worsening of oxygenation to PO2=60 in past
   24 hours in the setting of mild volume support and 4 liter positive
   fluid balance.
   1)Respiratory Failure-patient has hadd intermitted coughing and
   difficulty maintaining patient comfort
minimal secretions.  Have had
   limited capacity to wean PEEP and PS with recurrent tachypnea and
   worsening hypoxemia.  She has evolution of lateral consolidations
   suggested on CXR.  She has been able to have tolerance of PSV across
   the day with recurrent cough and hypoxemia and has required increased
   sedation and continued pressure support.
   -Will continue to support with
   -Propofol/Fentanyl
   -Pulmonary edema is possible trigger and may be leading to worsening
   across the day night and will move to diuresis to 2 liters today using
   pressors as needed
   -PSV is reasonable mode
she has continued tachypnea but with some
   central component and reasonable absence of gas trapping seen.
   -Will need to consider alternative sources for cough, infiltrates,
   hypoxemia such as PCP if incomplete response to diuresis seen (although
   bronch negative to date)
   2)Anemia
Has decreased mildly and chronically low
   -1 unit PRBC today
   3)Hypotension-This is in the setting of high pleural pressures, anemia
   and with response to fluid support in the setting of vasodilatory
   effects of sedating medications in place.
   -Continue with broad spectrum ABX including-Tamiflu
   -Levophed as needed today

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma and a multi-month course of antibiotics. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, hypoxia, and MRSA pneumonia. Subsequently, she tested positive for H1N1 flu, but subsequent tests were negative (state lab=PCR). She has persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure and worsening oxygenation. She has intermittent coughing, difficulty maintaining patient comfort, limited capacity to wean PEEP and PS, recurrent tachypnea, and worsening hypoxemia. There is an evolution of lateral consolidations suggested on CXR. She has been tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) across the day with recurrent cough and hypoxemia, requiring increased sedation and continued pressure support. Pulmonary edema is a possible trigger and may be leading to worsening across the day-night. The plan is to move to diuresis to 2 liters today using pressors as needed. PSV is a reasonable mode, but she has continued tachypnea with some central component and reasonable absence of gas trapping seen. Alternative sources for cough, infiltrates, and hypoxemia such as PCP need to be considered if there is an incomplete response to diuresis seen (although bronch negative to date). She also has anemia, hypotension, fever of unknown origin, diabetes mellitus type I, and acute respiratory failure.

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's progress:

- The patient is in the ICU due to various medical complications.
- The patient has been experiencing fever and has been broadened to linezolid and Zosyn.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode set to CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow.
- The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/46 to 125/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- The patient has trace edema bilaterally and pneumoboots in place.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and blood glucose levels.
- The patient has been diagnosed with cough, altered mental status, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, fever of unknown origin, diabetes mellitus type I, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed (HOB) and performing regular mouth care are being implemented to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures like"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type I and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient also has a fever of 38.2 degrees Celsius, indicating a possible infection. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 98/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), as well as elevated levels of glucose, creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), and lactic acid. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated WBC count suggest a possible infection. The cultures obtained from urine and sputum will help identify the causative organism and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Diabetes mellitus (DM): The patient's high glucose level indicates uncontrolled diabetes. Insulin therapy should be continued to manage blood sugar levels.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters is necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Hemorrhage: The patient has anemia secondary to blood loss"

   superinfection and ARDS physiology. Agitation and bronchospastic/cough
   spells have resolved since increasing doses of sedations.  Lasix gtt
   started in PM yesterday with decent output, but input was +3.5L.  CXR
   with infiltrate, spiked to 100.8, and yesterday. New hypoxia may be due
   to new VAP or PE.
   - d/c lasix gtt

   - Increase sedation (propofol, fentanyl) prn to combat coughing spells.
   - F/u cx
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn for VAP
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Febrile yesterday and increased leukocytosis so
   Zosyn was added and sputum cx sent. Possible sources of infection
   include lung, abdominal, and urine as well as lines. Foley changed for
   yeast in urine cx.
   - Lines changed [**2111-6-20**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics for pneumonia, and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient now presents with increasing pressor requirement, new CXR infiltrates, atrial fibrillation, and increasing hypoxia on the ventilator. Possible etiologies for shock include septic, cardiogenic, PE, adrenal insufficiency, or increasing PEEP requirement.

Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's increasing pressor requirement, new CXR infiltrates, and new atrial fibrillation suggest the possibility of septic shock. Other potential causes include cardiogenic shock, pulmonary embolism (PE), adrenal insufficiency, or increasing PEEP requirement.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA superinfection and ARDS physiology. Agitation and bronchospastic/cough spells have resolved since increasing doses of sedations. The recent hypoxia may be due to new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or PE.
3. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient was febrile yesterday and had increased leukocytosis, leading to the addition of Zosyn and sputum culture. Possible sources of infection include the lung, abdomen, urine, as well as lines.

   24 Hour Events:
   - New-onset atrial fibrillation. Converted to sinus rhythm with amio
   bolus and gtt early in the afternoon. Check TSH with AM labs.
   - Started heparin gtt given concern for PE; also afib.
   - CTA prelim:  No evidence of PE. Multifocal ground glass opacities in
   the lungs bilaterally with worsening consolidation of the right upper
   lobe posterior segment as well as bilateral lower lobes from [**2111-6-18**].
   Mildly enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes may be reactive.
   - TTE:  Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. No
   diastolic dysfunction or significant valvular disease seen. Mild
   pulmonary hypertension
   - Sputum culture with GNR, sparse; on Zosyn. As lactate continues to
   rise, linezolid changed to vancomycin with improvement in PM lactate.
   - CVP 14, so no further fluid boluses
   - Pulled back CVL ~2cm, confirmed with CXR
   - Titrated down Propofol; attempted to downtitrate fentanyl; slowly
   decreased FiO2 to 60%

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Shock: Patient with increasing pressor requirement yesterday in the
   setting of worsened leukocytosis with new CXR infiltrates, new atrial
   Fib, and in setting of discontinued steroids. Possible etiologies
   include cardiogenic, CVL in atrium, sepsis given new pseudomonas+
   sputum cx, adrenal insufficiency, or increasing PEEP requirement. BP
   now improving s/p pharmacological conversion on amiodarone with pressor
   change, pull-back of CVL, change in abx, reinitiation of steroids, and
   decreased PEEP. No evidence of PE.
   - On vanc; zosyn changed to meropenem given pseudomonas with borderline
   sensitivities to zosyn on prelim cx
   - Switched from levophed to neosynephrine
   - Cont amiodarone, transition to po
   - Will d/c hydrocortisone and restart prednisone taper starting at 20mg
   po
   - Decrease PEEP as tolerated, follow ABGs and wean as long as Sats in
   the 90s and PaO2 in 60-70s.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology; febrile yesterday to 102 with
   ?worsening RUL and bilateral lower lobe consolidations with sputum +
   for pseudomonas. Agitation and bronchospastic/cough spells have
   resolved since increasing doses of sedations.  Off lasix gtt as thought
   to be dry.
   - wean off PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated as above
   - Increase sedation (propofol, fentanyl) prn to combat coughing spells.
   - continue vanc; change meropenem for VAP as borderline sensitive to
   zosyn
   - f/u pending cx
   - f/u ID recs
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Febrile yesterday with increased leukocytosis so
   Zosyn was added and linezolid changed to vanco d/t concern for lactic
   acidosis; now has likely pseudomonas VAP. All other cx NGTD with
   exception for yeast in urine, for which foley changed.
   - Lines changed [**2111-6-20**]
   - F/u pending sputum cx, bcx, BAL cx, stool studies (CDiff neg)
   - Continue Vanco and meropenem as above, oseltamivir x 10 d (last dose
   [**6-26**])
   # Afib: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**2-16**] overdiuresis. No e/o PE. TSH pending. In sinus now
   s/p pharm conversion.
   - F/u TSH
   - Cont amio gtt and transition to po
   - Cont hep gtt for another 24 hours as stabilizing medical issues;
   reassess need to continue in AM
   # Anemia:  Unclear etiology but has been trending down since admit.
   Possibly due to phlebotomy v. vaginal bleed but no active bleed
   visualized on exam by OB/GYN. Stools guaiac negative. Fe studies
   unrevealing.
   - transfuse if < 23 or hemodynamically unstable
   #. Diabetes: Cont insulin gtt for now as critically ill and titrating
   steroids; will transition to insulin SC when more stable
   #. MS: Likely [**2-16**] meds. Head CT unhelpful for prognosis. Reassess as
   able to wean sedation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. The patient required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure. Her current condition is complicated by several medical complications.

Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient shows signs of worsening shock, indicated by increasing pressor requirement, leukocytosis, new CXR infiltrates, atrial fibrillation, and discontinued steroids. Possible etiologies include cardiogenic shock, central venous line infection, sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or increased PEEP requirement. Treatment includes pharmacological conversion to sinus rhythm with amiodarone, pressor change, pull-back of CVL, change in antibiotics, reinitiation of steroids, and decreased PEEP.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, followed by ARDS physiology. She is febrile with worsening right upper lobe and bilateral lower lobe consolidations, sputum positive for pseudomonas. Agitation and bronchospastic/cough spells have resolved with increased sedation doses. Treatment includes weaning off PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated, increasing sedation to combat coughing spells, continuing vancomycin, and changing meropenem for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Shock: Patient with increasing pressor requirement yesterday in the
   setting of worsened leukocytosis with new CXR infiltrates, new atrial
   Fib, and in setting of discontinued steroids. Possible etiologies
   include cardiogenic, CVL in atrium, sepsis given new pseudomonas+
   sputum cx, adrenal insufficiency, or increasing PEEP requirement. BP
   now improving s/p pharmacological conversion on amiodarone with pressor
   change, pull-back of CVL, change in abx, reinitiation of steroids, and
   decreased PEEP. No evidence of PE.
   - On vanc; zosyn changed to meropenem given pseudomonas with borderline
   sensitivities to zosyn on prelim cx
   - Switched from levophed to neosynephrine
   - Cont amiodarone, transition to po
   - Will d/c hydrocortisone and restart prednisone taper starting at 20mg
   po
   - Decrease PEEP as tolerated, follow ABGs and wean as long as Sats in
   the 90s and PaO2 in 60-70s.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology; febrile yesterday to 102 with
   ?worsening RUL and bilateral lower lobe consolidations with sputum +
   for pseudomonas. Agitation and bronchospastic/cough spells have
   resolved since increasing doses of sedations.  Off lasix gtt as thought
   to be dry.
   - wean off PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated as above
   - Increase sedation (propofol, fentanyl) prn to combat coughing spells.
   - continue vanc; change meropenem for VAP as borderline sensitive to
   zosyn
   - f/u pending cx
   - f/u ID recs
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Febrile yesterday with increased leukocytosis so
   Zosyn was added and linezolid changed to vanco d/t concern for lactic
   acidosis; now has likely pseudomonas VAP. All other cx NGTD with
   exception for yeast in urine, for which foley changed.
   - Lines changed [**2111-6-20**]
   - F/u pending sputum cx, bcx, BAL cx, stool studies (CDiff neg)
   - Continue Vanco and meropenem as above, oseltamivir x 10 d (last dose
   [**6-26**])
   # Afib: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**2-16**] overdiuresis. No e/o PE. TSH pending.
   - F/u TSH
   - Cont amio gtt and transition to po
   - Cont hep gtt for now
   # Anemia:  Unclear etiology but has been trending down since admit.
   Possibly due to phlebotomy v. vaginal bleed but no active bleed
   visualized on exam by OB/GYN. Stools guaiac negative. Fe studies
   unrevealing.
   - transfuse if < 23 or hemodynamically unstable
   #. Diabetes: elevated BG overnight after scheduled regular insulin was
   d/c
   - insulin gtt started
   - will get 1 day of accurate insulin requirements, and transition to
   sub-Q after that
   #. MS: Likely [**2-16**] meds. Head CT unhelpful for prognosis. Reassess as
   able to wean sedation.

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a significant medical history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. She required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure.

Her current condition includes worsening leukocytosis with new chest X-ray infiltrates, new-onset atrial fibrillation (afib) that has been converted to sinus rhythm with amiodarone, concern for possible pulmonary embolism (PE) but ruled out on computed tomography angiography (CTA), and worsening consolidation of the right upper lobe posterior segment as well as bilateral lower lobes.

She is currently receiving multiple medications including vancomycin, meropenem, amiodarone, phenylephrine, fentanyl, propofol, insulin, and heparin. Her vital signs show a temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 62 beats per minute, blood pressure of 98/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 16, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted for acute on chronic dyspnea and treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. The patient's condition has worsened, and she is currently intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current medical complications include shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers/leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, anemia, diabetes, and possible multi-system involvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is showing signs of shock, including increasing pressor requirement, worsened leukocytosis with new chest X-ray infiltrates, new atrial fibrillation, and discontinued steroids. Possible etiologies include cardiogenic, CVL in atrium, sepsis given new pseudomonas+ sputum culture, adrenal insufficiency, or increasing PEEP requirement.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, leading to ARDS physiology. She has worsening right upper lobe and bilateral lower lobe consolidations with sputum positive for pseudomonas.
3. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient is febrile with increased leukocytosis, indicating an ongoing infection. Zosyn was added, and linezolid was changed to vancomycin due to concern for lactic acidosis. She"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Shock: Patient now with increasing pressor requirement in the setting
   of new CXR infiltrates and new Atrial Fib.  Also with increasing
   hypoxia on vent this AM and had stopped steroids yesterday.  Possible
   etiologies include septic, cardiogenic, PE, adrenal insufficiency or
   increasing PEEP requirement.
   - Broadened to Vanc/Zosyn yesterday
   - CTA Chest for ? PE, will start on heparin gtt empirically for both PE
   and a-fib
   - Echo, amiodarone, and pull back central line to find etology for
   a-fib
   - transition levaphed to neosynephrine
   - treat presumed adrenal insufficiency with hydrocortisone 100 mg TID.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology. Agitation and bronchospastic/cough
   spells have resolved since increasing doses of sedations.  Lasix gtt
   started in PM yesterday with decent output, but input was +3.5L.  CXR
   with infiltrate, spiked to 100.8, and yesterday. New hypoxia may be due
   to new VAP or PE.
   - d/c lasix gtt
   - continue PEEP and FiO2 as needed to treat hypoxia
   - Increase sedation (propofol, fentanyl) prn to combat coughing spells.
   - F/u cx
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn for VAP
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Febrile yesterday and increased leukocytosis so
   Zosyn was added and sputum cx sent. Possible sources of infection
   include lung, abdominal, and urine as well as lines. Foley changed for
   yeast in urine cx.
   - Lines changed [**2111-6-20**]
   - F/u pending sputum cx, bcx, BAL cx, stool studies (CDiff neg)
   - Added Zosyn
   - continue linezolid, Zosyn, oseltamivir as above per ID recs
   # Anemia:  Unclear etiology but has been trending down since admit.
   Possibly due to phlebotomy v. vaginal bleed but no active bleed
   visualized on exam by OB/GYN. Stools guaiac negative. Fe studies
   unrevealing.
   - transfuse if < 23 or hemodynamically unstable
   #. Diabetes: elevated BG overnight after scheduled regular insulin was
   d/c
   - insulin gtt started
   - will get 1 day of accurate insulin requirements, and transition to
   sub-Q after that
   #. MS: Likely [**2-16**] meds. Head CT unhelpful for prognosis. Will see how
   she is on propofol.

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted for acute on chronic dyspnea and treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. She is currently intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's recent events include new-onset atrial fibrillation, which was converted to sinus rhythm with amiodarone. She also started on heparin due to concerns for pulmonary embolism (PE). A CT angiogram showed no evidence of PE, but there are multifocal ground glass opacities in the lungs bilaterally with worsening consolidation of the right upper lobe and bilateral lower lobes. There are also mildly enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, which may be reactive.

A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed normal global and regional biventricular systolic function, no diastolic dysfunction or significant valvular disease, and mild pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's sputum culture showed growth of gram-negative rods (GNR), so she was placed on Zosyn. Due to rising lactate levels, linezolid was changed to vancomycin. The central venous line (CVL) was pulled back 2 cm, and confirmed with chest X-ray.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C (102.7°F), heart rate of 62 beats per minute, blood pressure of 98/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 14 mmHg.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3962 mL and output of 3620 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 342 mL.

The patient is currently receiving multiple infusions, including phenylephrine, fentanyl, amiodarone, heparin, propofol, and insulin. She is also on other medications such as metoprolol and diltiazem.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 21.5 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) of 24.0%, normal platelet count (Plt) of 286 K/uL, and slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) of 0.7 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include several concerns. The first concern is shock, with increasing pressor requirement, new chest X-ray infiltrates, and new atrial fibrillation. Possible etiologies include septic shock, cardiogenic shock, PE, adrenal insufficiency, or increasing PEEP requirement. The second concern is hypoxic respiratory failure, initially presenting with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, ARDS physiology, agitation, bronchospastic/cough spells"

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. The patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and has been in the ICU since then.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

- The patient developed new-onset atrial fibrillation, which has since converted to sinus rhythm with the administration of amiodarone.
- The patient was started on heparin due to concerns of pulmonary embolism (PE), although a CT angiography (CTA) did not show any evidence of PE.
- The CTA did reveal multifocal ground glass opacities in the lungs bilaterally, with worsening consolidation in the right upper lobe posterior segment as well as bilateral lower lobes since June 18th. There are also mildly enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes that may be reactive.
- A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal global and regional biventricular systolic function, with no diastolic dysfunction or significant valvular disease seen. However, there is mild pulmonary hypertension.
- The patient's sputum culture grew resistant Pseudomonas, so the antibiotic regimen was broadened to include vancomycin.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by shock, which was initially suspected due to worsening leukocyt"

   the setting of worsened leukocytosis with new CXR infiltrates, new
   atrial Fib, and in setting of discontinued steroids. Possible
   etiologies include cardiogenic, CVL in atrium, septic, adrenal
   insufficiency, or increasing PEEP requirement. BP now improving s/p
   pharmacological conversion on amiodarone with pressor change, pull-back
   of CVL, change in abx, reinitiation of steroids, and decreased PEEP. No
   evidence of PE
   - Broadened to Vanc/Zosyn; f/u pending cx
   - Switched from levophed to neosynephrine
   - Cont amiodarone, transition to po
   - treating presumed adrenal insufficiency with hydrocortisone 100 mg

   - Decrease PEEP as tolerated
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology. Agitation and bronchospastic/cough
   spells have resolved since increasing doses of sedations.  Off lasix
   gtt as thought to be dry.  [**Month (only) 11**] be [**2-16**] VAP as CXR/CT chest with with
   ?RUL worsening consolidation with fever to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday and sputum cx
   growing sparse GNR.
   - wean off PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - Increase sedation (propofol, fentanyl) prn to combat coughing spells.
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn for VAP
   - f/u repeat sputum cx
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Febrile yesterday with increased leukocytosis so
   Zosyn was added and linezolid changed to vanco d/t concern for lactic
   acidosis; sputum with sparse GNR. All other cx NGTD with exception for
   yeast in urine, for which foley changed.
   - Lines changed [**2111-6-20**]
   - F/u pending sputum cx, bcx, BAL cx, stool studies (CDiff neg)
   - Continue Vanco, Zosyn, oseltamivir
   # Afib: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**2-16**] overdiuresis. No e/o PE. TSH pending.
   - F/u TSH

   - Cont hep gtt for now
   # Anemia:  Unclear etiology but has been trending down since admit.
   Possibly due to phlebotomy v. vaginal bleed but no active bleed
   visualized on exam by OB/GYN. Stools guaiac negative. Fe studies
   unrevealing.
   - transfuse if < 23 or hemodynamically unstable

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. She developed hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient's condition has been complicated by various issues, including shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers/leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, anemia, diabetes management, and possible medication-induced delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing increasing pressor requirement, worsened leukocytosis with new CXR infiltrates, new atrial fibrillation, and discontinued steroids. Possible etiologies include cardiogenic, CVL in atrium, septic, adrenal insufficiency, or increasing PEEP requirement.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA superinfection and ARDS physiology. She has improved since increasing doses of sedations but still requires ventilatory support.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has worsening consolidation in the right upper lobe with fever and sputum culture growing sparse GNR. She is being treated with Vanc/Zosyn for VAP.
4. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient had febrile yesterday with increased leukocytosis. Antibiotics were changed due to concern for l"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated for pneumonia, and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has developed multiple complications including shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers/leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, anemia, diabetes, and possible multi-system involvement. She is currently receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is showing signs of increasing pressor requirement, new infiltrates on CXR, new-onset atrial fibrillation, and worsening leukocytosis. Possible etiologies include cardiogenic, CVL in atrium, septic, adrenal insufficiency, or increasing PEEP requirement.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, along with ARDS physiology. She has been sedated to manage agitation and bronchospastic/cough spells.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed worsening consolidation in the right upper lobe and bilateral lower lobes, with a sputum culture growing sparse GNR. She is being treated with Vanc/Zosyn for VAP.
4. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient had febrile reactions and increased leukocytosis,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. She is currently intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has shown worsening leukocytosis with new CXR infiltrates, new atrial fibrillation, and in the setting of discontinued steroids. Possible etiologies for her condition include cardiogenic shock, central venous line infection, sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or increasing PEEP requirement. 

The patient's medical team has implemented several interventions to address these issues, including changing antibiotics, pulling back the CVL, reinitiating steroids, decreasing PEEP, and adjusting pressor support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's increasing pressor requirement, worsening leukocytosis, new CXR infiltrates, new atrial fibrillation, and discontinued steroids suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock, CVL infection, sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or increasing PEEP requirement. Immediate attention should be given to stabilize the patient's hemodynamics and address any underlying causes.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, resulting in ARDS physiology. She is now febrile with worsening right upper lobe and bilateral lower lobe consolidations. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated for pneumonia. She was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and later diagnosed with MRSA superinfection, ARDS, and pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has also been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, metabolic alkalosis, anemia, and diabetes. She is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics for VAP, amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, steroids, and insulin for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which improved with the change from Zosyn to meropenem, suggesting a resistant pseudomonas infection. It is important to monitor her blood pressure and ensure adequate perfusion.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for 15 days and has developed VAP. Weaning off the ventilator will be challenging, and close monitoring of oxygen saturation and PaO2 levels is necessary.
3. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient had fevers and leukocytosis, likely due to pseudomonas VAP. With the change in antibiotics to meropenem, her condition is improving.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. She has been on mechanical ventilation for 16 days and has now developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with a possible pseudomonas infection. The patient also has fevers and leukocytosis, which are improving with the antibiotic meropenem. Other issues include atrial fibrillation, metabolic alkalosis, anemia, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. The patient's condition remains critical, and ongoing management involves weaning off sedation, adjusting ventilator settings, and providing nutritional support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, likely caused by a pseudomonas infection. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and may require more aggressive antibiotic therapy.
2. Septic shock: The patient's blood pressures have improved with the change in antibiotics, suggesting a response to treatment. However, there is a possibility of septic shock due to the resistant pseudomonas infection, which can lead to hypotension and organ dysfunction.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to an unclear etiology. This condition needs to be closely monitored and managed with appropriate interventions.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. She has been on mechanical ventilation for 15 days and has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to pseudomonas infection. Her blood pressure improved with the change from Zosyn to meropenem, suggesting septic shock. She also has metabolic alkalosis, anemia of unclear etiology, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's blood pressure has improved with the change from Zosyn to meropenem, suggesting septic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate management is crucial.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA superinfection and ARDS physiology. Now she has pseudomonas VAP. Weaning off the ventilator will depend on her ability to maintain oxygen saturation in the 90s and PaO2 in the 60-70s.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient likely has pseudomonas VAP. She is currently being treated with meropenem and vancomycin. Further investigation is needed through sputum culture, blood cultures, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. She required intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers/leukocytosis (likely pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia), atrial fibrillation, metabolic alkalosis, anemia, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's blood pressure has improved with the change from Zosyn to meropenem, suggesting a possible improvement in septic shock caused by resistant pseudomonas infection.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) physiology. She now has pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Tracheostomy is planned as she is unlikely to come off the ventilator soon.
3. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient's fevers and leukocytosis are likely due to pseudomonas VAP. Her condition is improving on meropenem instead of Zosyn.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had atrial fibrillation but is now in sinus rhythm after pharmacologic conversion. Overdiuresis may have contributed to this condition.

The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type I, respiratory failure, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, and fever of unknown origin. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has been placed on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 14 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,783 mL and output of 2,884 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 899 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. The patient's glucose level is within normal range. The patient's medical team is closely monitoring the following conditions: atrial fibrillation, cough, altered mental status, acute respiratory failure, and diabetes mellitus type I.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.

   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Shock: BPs have improved with change from zosyn to meropenem
   suggesting had resistant pseudomonas making septic shock more likely
   - Switched from levophed to neosynephrine
   - Cont amiodarone, transition to po
   - Cte prednisone taper starting at 20mg po
   - Decrease PEEP as tolerated, follow ABGs and wean as long as Sats in
   the 90s and PaO2 in 60-70s.
   - Defer diuresis as of now.
   - continue sedation at current doses for trach today.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology; Now with pseudomonas VAP as well
   - Per IP, trach today as will likely not be able to come off ventilator
   soon and been on vent X 16days
   - wean off PEEP using increased sedation (try titrating fentanyl) and
   FiO2 as tolerated
   - Continue sedation (propofol, fentanyl) prn to combat coughing spells.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, fever of unknown origin, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, anemia secondary to blood loss, and cough. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/55 to 141/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, PaO2 of 212, and HCO3- of 29 mEq/L. The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin level, increased serum glucose level, and abnormal liver function test results. The patient's fluid balance is within normal limits, and the blood product usage has been significant.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation and the presence of fever, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and considering appropriate antibiotic therapy should be taken"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at PEEP 10 cmH2O, FiO2 50%, and PSV 16 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 C (100.6 F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/55 mmHg to 141/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for fever. The patient's physical examination reveals intubation and sedation, as well as anicteric sclera, CTAB anteriorly, RRR no M/R/G, soft abdomen, no edema, and sedated neurologic status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure is a significant concern. The current ventilator settings are being adjusted to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). However, there is still a potential for further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to pressure ulcers or bedsores. Proper positioning and regular repositioning are necessary to prevent this complication.
3. Fever of Unknown Origin (FU"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. She also has impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation, cough, altered mental status, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever of unknown origin, and respiratory failure. 

The patient's condition has improved with the change from Zosyn to meropenem, suggesting a resistant pseudomonas infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a Vt of 471 mL, PS of 16 cmH2O, RR of 19, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 94%. Her ABG results show pH 7.47, PaCO2 46, PaO2 212, HCO3- 34, BE -8, and O2 saturation 99%. 

The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 112 and 190 mg/dL. Her WBC count has decreased from 16.2 to 11.1 K/uL. The patient's electrolytes show a slightly low sodium level at 138 mEq/L and a slightly high potassium level at 5.0 mEq/L. Her creatinine"

   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology; Now with pseudomonas VAP as well.
   [**Month (only) 11**] have mild component of fluid overload as 15L net positive over LOS
   (not accounting for insensible losses).
   - Plan for trach placement today as at PEEP goal of 10 and FiO2 goal of
   50% - will touch base with IP. Cont to wean vent as tolerated to
   maintain O2sat >90 and PaO2 >60. Check ABG on current vent settings
   (55% fio2)
   - Wean sedation (Propofol and fentanyl gtt) as tolerated.
   - Continue meropenem for pseudomas VAP X 15 days.
   - F/u ID recs and pending cx.
   - Cont prednisone taper: D [**1-17**] of 15mg po
   - Cont low dose diuresis gtt today as long as no increased need for
   pressors or rise in BUN/Cr on pm lytes
   - Goal is run net negative hourly with minimal pressor requirement
   (neo<1)
   # Shock: BPs improved with change from zosyn to meropenem suggesting
   had resistant pseudomonas. Likely also component from conversion back
   to sinus rhythm.
   - Wean neosynephrine as tolerated
   - Cont amiodarone po
   - Continue sedation at current doses for trach today.
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Pseudomonas VAP now on meropenem with bump in
   WBC yesterday. 1 of 2 sets ?peripheral bcx from [**6-20**] growing GPC in
   clusters while pt on linezolid but had been switched back to vanc on
   [**6-22**] due to concern for lactic acidosis; possible this may have been
   contaminant. C. diff neg x 2. CXR without change. WBC improved today
   with no change in antibiotic coverage.
   - Lines changed [**2111-6-20**]
   - Send surveillance cx
   - Continue vanc for now pending speciation of bcx
   - Continue meropenem D [**4-29**] (last dose 6/22) due to pseudomonas in
   sputum
   - Oseltamivir discontinued [**6-25**]
   # Afib: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**2-16**] overdiuresis. No e/o PE. TSH WNL. In sinus now s/p
   pharm conversion.
   - Cont amoi po (currently 200mg po BID x 7 days) for at least a few
   months
   - Cte hep gtt after trach placement given hct drop today and potential
   for trach placement.
   - hold on coumadin (CHADS2 score = 2) given need for trach/peg in next
   few days
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Unclear etiology but did improve with
   acetazolamide earlier. Bicarb slightly higher today, may be in setting
   of diuresis although no bump in BUN/Cr
   - Recheck PM lytes; d/c lasix gtt as indicated
   # Anemia:  Had downtrended since admit w/ question of phlebotomy v.
   vaginal bleed. No active bleed visualized on exam by OB/GYN. Stools
   guaiac negative. Fe studies unrevealing. Now trending down again.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute-on-chronic dyspnea and was treated for H1N1 with MRSA superinfection, pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and ARDS physiology. 

The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including hypoxic respiratory failure, fluid overload, shock, fevers/leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, metabolic alkalosis, and anemia. 

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, leading to ARDS physiology. Now, she also has pseudomonas VAP. The plan is to continue weaning off the ventilator while maintaining oxygen saturation above 90% and PaO2 above 60.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient has a mild component of fluid overload with a net positive fluid balance of 15 liters over the length of stay (not accounting for insensible losses).

3. Shock: The patient's blood pressures improved with the change from zosyn to meropenem, suggesting resistant pseudomonas infection. This may also be related to the conversion back to sinus rhythm.

4. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis and fevers, likely due to pseudomonas V"

   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology; Now with pseudomonas VAP as well.
   [**Month (only) 11**] have mild component of fluid overload as 15L net positive over LOS
   (not accounting for insensible losses).
   - Plan for trach placement today as at PEEP goal of 10 and FiO2 goal of
   50% - will touch base with IP. Cont to wean vent as tolerated to
   maintain O2sat >90 and PaO2 >60.
   - Wean sedation (Propofol and fentanyl gtt) as tolerated.
   - Continue meropenem for pseudomas VAP X 15 days.
   - F/u ID recs and pending cx.
   - Cont prednisone taper: D [**1-17**] of 15mg po
   - Cont low dose diuresis gtt today as long as no increased need for
   pressors or rise in BUN/Cr on pm lytes
   # Shock: BPs improved with change from zosyn to meropenem suggesting
   had resistant pseudomonas. Likely also component from conversion back
   to sinus rhythm.
   - Wean neosynephrine as tolerated
   - Cont amiodarone po
   - Continue sedation at current doses for trach today.
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Pseudomonas VAP now on meropenem with bump in
   WBC yesterday. 1 of 2 sets ?peripheral bcx from [**6-20**] growing GPC in
   clusters while pt on linezolid but had been switched back to vanc on
   [**6-22**] due to concern for lactic acidosis; possible this may have been
   contaminant. C. diff neg x 2. CXR without change. WBC improved today
   with no change in antibiotic coverage.
   - Lines changed [**2111-6-20**]
   - Send surveillance cx
   - Continue vanc for now pending speciation of bcx
   - Continue meropenem D [**4-29**] (last dose 6/22) due to pseudomonas in
   sputum
   - Oseltamivir discontinued [**6-25**]
   # Afib: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**2-16**] overdiuresis. No e/o PE. TSH WNL. In sinus now s/p

   months
   - Cte hep gtt and hold on coumadin (CHADS2 score = 2) given need for
   trach/peg in next few days
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: Unclear etiology but did improve with
   acetazolamide earlier. Bicarb slightly higher today, may be in setting
   of diuresis although no bump in BUN/Cr
   - Recheck PM lytes; d/c lasix gtt as indicated
   # Anemia:  Had downtrended since admit w/ question of phlebotomy v.
   vaginal bleed. No active bleed visualized on exam by OB/GYN. Stools

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. She developed hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient subsequently developed MRSA and pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has mild fluid overload and is planned for tracheostomy placement. The patient's sedation and ventilator support are being weaned as tolerated. Antibiotic coverage has been adjusted for pseudomonas VAP. The patient also has shock, fevers, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, and metabolic alkalosis.

Potential Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, and now has pseudomonas VAP as well. The ongoing challenge is maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation while weaning off sedation and ventilator support.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has a mild component of fluid overload, with 15 liters of net positive fluid balance over the length of stay (not accounting for insensible losses). Close monitoring and diuresis management are necessary to prevent further fluid accumulation.
3. Pseudomonas VAP: The patient has developed pseudomonas VAP, which is a serious complication. Appropriate antibiotic coverage with meropenem is being continued for 15 days.
4. Shock: The patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. However, several significant events occurred within a 24-hour period.

The patient was previously on tamiflu, but it was discontinued. An attempt was made to wean the PEEP, but the patient's oxygen saturation remained at 60, so the PEEP was increased back to 12. Lasix was started with a goal of 100 mL/hr, but there was no urine output initially. The foley catheter did not return any urine, so it was changed. After diuresis, another attempt was made to decrease PEEP, but the ABG showed pH 7.49/44/117, indicating respiratory alkalosis. 

The patient has a history of leukocytosis, and cultures were ordered. A chest X-ray was unchanged, and c. diff was ordered. The patient also had an NG tube that was pulled and then reinserted. The CXR was okay, and the patient started using the overnight.

The patient's allergies include levofloxacin, and the last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin and meropenem. The patient is currently on several infusions, including fentanyl, lasix, phenylephrine, and propofol. Other ICU medications include dextrose. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure"

   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology; Now with pseudomonas VAP as well
   - Plan for trach placement Friday as at PEEP goal of 10 and FiO2 goal
   of 50%; cont to wean as tolerated to maintain O2sat >90 and PaO2 >60
   - Wean sedation (Propofol and fentanyl gtt) as tolerated

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted due to acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia.
- The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. She had an initial infection with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, followed by pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's blood pressure improved with the change from zosyn to meropenem, suggesting resistant pseudomonas infection.
- The patient converted back to sinus rhythm, and her shock state improved.
- The patient has been weaned off neosynephrine and continues to be on meropenem for pseudomonas VAP.
- She is planned for tracheostomy placement tomorrow with goals of PEEP 10 and FiO2 50%.
- The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to pseudomonas VAP, and cultures have been ordered.
- Her fevers and leukocytosis should be monitored, and she will be followed up pending sputum culture results.
- The patient's ID recommended an 8-day course of meropenem and discontinuation of vancomycin.
- She has a history of atrial fibrillation but is currently in sinus rhythm after pharmacologic conversion.
- The patient's metabolic alkalosis is improving, and her anemia is trending down"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics for pneumonia, and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. She now has pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as well. The patient has impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), cough, altered mental status, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, fever of unknown origin, and diabetes mellitus type I. She is also experiencing respiratory failure and has mild fluid overload.

Plan:
- Plan for tracheostomy placement today with PEEP goal of 10 and FiO2 goal of 50%.
- Continue weaning of ventilator as tolerated, maintaining O2 saturation >90 and PaO2 >60.
- Wean sedation as tolerated.
- Continue meropenem for pseudomonas VAP for 15 days, ending on [**2111-7-6**].
- Follow up with ID recs and pending cultures.
- Continue prednisone taper.
- Continue low-dose diuresis gtt today as long as no increased need for pressors or rise in BUN/Cr on pm lytes.
- Goal is to run net negative hourly with minimal pressor requirement (neo<1).

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, presenting with acute on chronic dyspnea. She was treated for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation, cough, altered mental status, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever of unknown origin, respiratory failure, and diabetes mellitus type I. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, and now also has pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Shock: The patient's blood pressures improved with the change from zosyn to meropenem, suggesting resistance to pseudomonas. This could be due to conversion back to sinus rhythm.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of infection and delayed wound healing.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of AFIB, which can lead to an irregular heartbeat and increase the risk of blood clots and stroke.
5. Cough: The patient has a cough, which may be due to pneumonia or VAP.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to sedation, infection, or other underlying causes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute-on-chronic dyspnea and was treated for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. She has mild fluid overload, hypoxic respiratory failure, and pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's medical team plans to perform a tracheostomy on Monday, continue weaning from the ventilator, and switch antibiotics to meropenem for the VAP. Other ongoing issues include shock, fevers/leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, metabolic alkalosis, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. There is a risk of worsening hypoxia if the ventilator weaning process is not managed properly.
2. Pseudomonas VAP: The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonas VAP and is being treated with meropenem. However, there is a risk of treatment failure or antibiotic resistance if the appropriate antibiotic regimen is not maintained.
3. Shock: The patient's blood pressure has improved with the change from zosyn to meropenem, suggesting possible resistant pseudomonas infection. There is a risk of ongoing hypotension and shock if"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a significant medical history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated for pneumonia with antibiotics before being intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), cough, altered mental status, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever of unknown origin, and respiratory failure. She has also been diagnosed with H1N1 infection with MRSA superinfection, ARDS physiology, and pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility and increased pressure on certain areas of the body.
2. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient may be at risk for complications associated with AFIB such as stroke, heart failure, or embolic events if not properly managed.
3. Cough: The patient may develop respiratory complications such as aspiration pneumonia or further respiratory failure if the underlying cause of the cough is not addressed.
4. Altered mental status: The patient may be at risk for delirium or worsening cognitive function if not closely monitored and managed.
5. Anemia: The patient may require further evaluation and management to address the underlying cause of anemia and prevent further blood loss.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-inch height individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of unknown origin fever. The patient has multiple medical complications including impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), cough, altered mental status (not delirium), acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding), fever of unknown origin (FUO, hypertension, pyrexia), and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS/[Doctor Last Name 2]).

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 58 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 92/43 mmHg to 144/66 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 17 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 410 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 36.

The patient has received several antibiotics including vancomycin and meropenem, but their growth showed coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. The patient also has multiple lines including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and PICC line.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.3 K/u"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was initially admitted with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, and subsequently developed pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a goal PEEP of 10 and FiO2 of 50%. She has been treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and is also being treated for type I diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to prolonged immobility, pressure from the endotracheal tube, and potential infection.
2. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of AFIB, which can lead to irregular heart rhythm and potential complications such as stroke.
3. Cough: The patient may experience coughing due to irritation in the airways caused by the endotracheal tube or respiratory secretions.
4. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient may have altered mental status due to sedation from medications or underlying medical conditions.
5. Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient may develop anemia due to blood loss during procedures or bleeding episodes.
6. Fever, unknown origin (FUO, hypertension, pyrexia): The patient may develop fever due to infection or other underlying causes"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been intubated and sedated, with an endotracheal tube in place. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 112/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission.

The patient has been diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation, cough, altered mental status (not delirium), anemia secondary to blood loss, fever of unknown origin, diabetes mellitus type I, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and has arterial, multi-lumen, and PICC lines in place for monitoring and medication administration. Prophylactic measures include systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor, and elevation of the head of bed to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's intubation and prolonged immobility, there is a risk of developing pneumonia due to aspiration or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and the presence of central lines."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. She has developed several complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), septic shock, atrial fibrillation, and possible central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already developed VAP due to Pseudomonas infection. Continued ventilation and inadequate lung clearance can increase the risk of further infections or worsening of the existing VAP.
2. Septic shock: The patient's blood pressure improved with the change in antibiotic therapy, suggesting a possible resistant Pseudomonas infection causing septic shock. If not adequately managed, septic shock can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and mortality.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and it has recurred during her ICU stay. If not properly managed, atrial fibrillation can lead to embolic events such as stroke or worsen heart failure.
4. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient has a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus from a peripheral line. This raises concerns for a possible CLABSI. If not promptly addressed, a CL"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted for acute on chronic dyspnea and treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. She was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure due to H1N1 with MRSA superinfection and ARDS physiology. The patient now has pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as well.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have hypoxic respiratory failure initially presenting with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, now with pseudomonas VAP.
   - Plan for tracheostomy placement on Monday with a goal of PEEP of 8 and FiO2 of 50%.
   - Continue weaning off the ventilator while maintaining O2 saturation above 90% and PaO2 above 60.
   - Wean sedation (Propofol and fentanyl gtt) as tolerated.
   - Continue meropenem for pseudomonas VAP for 15 days to end on [**2111-7-6**].

2. Shock: The patient's BPs improved with the change from zosyn to meropenem, suggesting resistant pseudomonas. It is likely also related to the conversion back to sinus rhythm.
   - Wean neosynephrine as tolerated.
   - Cont amiodarone po.
   - Continue sedation at current doses. Check triglycerides as has been on propofol several days.

3. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has pseudomonas VAP and is now on meropenem. One of the two peripheral blood cultures from [**6-20**] grew coag-negative Staph while the patient was on linezolid, but had been switched back to vancomycin on [**6-22**] due to concern for lactic acidosis; possible contaminant. C. diff negative x 2. CXR without change.
   - Lines changed [**2111-6-20**].
   - Surveillance cx NGTD.
   - Continue meropenem x15 days (last dose 6/22) due to pseudomonas in sputum.
   - Oseltamivir discontinued [**6-25**]; Vanc discontinued [**6-26**].

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has been in atrial fibrillation since [**Month (only) 11**] and overdiuresis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. TSH within normal limits. In sinus rhythm now after pharmacological conversion.
   - Cont amiodarone po (currently 200mg po BID x 7 days to end [**6-30**]) then 200mg PO daily.
   - Continue hepatic gtt until tracheostomy placement."

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. She was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and diagnosed with H1N1, MRSA superinfection, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Currently, she has developed pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has mild fluid overload, shock, fevers, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation (afib), metabolic alkalosis, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection leading to ARDS. Now, she has pseudomonas VAP. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has a mild component of fluid overload with a net positive fluid balance of 15 liters over the length of stay (not accounting for insensible losses). This could lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.
3. Shock: The patient's blood pressures improved with the change from zosyn to meropenem, suggesting resistant pseudomonas. This suggests that the patient may have had septic shock due to the resistant infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. She developed hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient had an initial presentation of H1N1 with MRSA superinfection and ARDS physiology, and now has pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She also has mild fluid overload, as indicated by a net positive fluid balance of 15 liters during her hospital stay. The plan is to proceed with tracheostomy placement, continue weaning of ventilation support, and taper sedation. The patient is also being treated for pseudomonas VAP with meropenem, diabetes management, and conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure due to H1N1 with MRSA superinfection and ARDS physiology. She now also has pseudomonas VAP, which increases the risk of further respiratory complications.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient has a mild component of fluid overload, with a net positive fluid balance of 15 liters over her hospital stay. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory function.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient underwent surgery and had a tracheostomy performed. They were held for TFs and hepatic graft overnight in preparation for the operation. The patient has a known allergy to levofloxacin and an unknown allergy. The last dose of antibiotics administered was meropenem on [**2111-6-28**] at 08:00 PM.

The patient is currently on phenylephrine infusion at a rate of 0.3 mcg/kg/min and receiving other ICU medications including lansoprazole. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the following:

- Fever
- Anemia secondary to blood loss
- Respiratory failure
- Diabetes mellitus, type I

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
- Heart rate: 60 bpm (58-82 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 114/53 mmHg (73-134/48-85 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (17-35 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,932 mL with outputs totaling 3,080 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -148 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The tidal volume (Vt) is 383 mL (138-472 mL), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is set at 8 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 50%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 24 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results are pending, and their ventilation rate is 6.7 L/min.

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, or heart sounds. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Blood glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient has multiple medical complications including impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation, cough, altered mental status, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, fever of unknown origin, diabetes mellitus type I, and acute respiratory failure.

The patient is receiving ICU care with arterial and multi-lumen lines in place. They are being provided with nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is unknown.

   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology; Now with pseudomonas VAP as well.
   [**Month (only) 11**] have mild component of fluid overload as 15L net positive over LOS
   (not accounting for insensible losses).
   - Plan for trach placement on Monday as at PEEP goal of 8 and FiO2 goal
   of 50% - will touch base with IP then. Cont to wean vent as tolerated
   to maintain O2sat >90 and PaO2 >60.
   - Wean sedation (Propofol and fentanyl gtt) as tolerated.
   - Continue meropenem for pseudomas VAP X 15 days to end on [**2111-7-6**].
   - F/u ID recs and pending cx.
   - Cont prednisone taper: D [**3-17**] of 15mg po. Tomorrow will have 10mg PO
   daily.
   - Cont low dose diuresis gtt today as long as no increased need for
   pressors or rise in BUN/Cr on pm lytes
   - Goal is run net negative hourly with minimal pressor requirement
   (neo<1) with 24h goal net neg 1L
   # Shock: BPs improved with change from zosyn to meropenem suggesting
   had resistant pseudomonas. Likely also component from conversion back
   to sinus rhythm.
   - Wean neosynephrine as tolerated
   - Cont amiodarone po
   - Continue sedation at current doses. Check triglycerides as has been
   on propofol several days.
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Pseudomonas VAP now on meropenem. 1 of 2 sets
   ?peripheral bcx from [**6-20**] growing coag neg staph while pt on linezolid
   but had been switched back to vanc on [**6-22**] due to concern for lactic
   acidosis; possible this may have been contaminant. C. diff neg x 2. CXR
   without change.
   - Lines changed [**2111-6-20**]
   - Surveillance cx NGTD
   - Continue meropenem x15 days (last dose 6/22) due to pseudomonas in
   sputum
   - Oseltamivir discontinued [**6-25**]; Vanc discontinued [**6-26**]
   # Afib: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**2-16**] overdiuresis. No e/o PE. TSH WNL. In sinus now s/p
   pharm conversion.
   - Cont amiodarone po (currently 200mg po BID x 7 days to end [**6-30**]) then
   200mg PO daily
   - Cte hep gtt until trach placement.
   - hold on coumadin (CHADS2 score = 2) given need for trach/peg in next
   few days

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a significant medical history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including hypoxic respiratory failure initially caused by H1N1 with MRSA superinfection and ARDS physiology, now also complicated by pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She also has mild fluid overload as indicated by a net positive fluid balance of 15 liters over the length of stay (not accounting for insensible losses).

The plan for tracheostomy placement is scheduled on Monday with a target PEEP of 8 and FiO2 goal of 50%. The goal is to continue weaning the patient off the ventilator while maintaining oxygen saturation above 90% and PaO2 above 60. Sedation will be weaned as tolerated.

Antibiotic therapy will be continued with meropenem for pseudomonas VAP for an additional 15 days until [**2111-7-6**]. The patient is also on a prednisone taper and low-dose diuresis. The target is to run a net negative hourly fluid balance with minimal pressor requirement (neo<1) and a 24-hour goal of net negative 1 liter.

   when trached, can wean sedation and pressors and she may mobilize fluid
   better on her own.
   # Shock: BPs improved with change from zosyn to meropenem suggesting
   had resistant pseudomonas. Likely also component from conversion back

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a significant medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute-on-chronic dyspnea and was treated for pneumonia with antibiotics. The patient was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by H1N1 with MRSA superinfection and ARDS physiology. Currently, she has developed pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient has a mild component of fluid overload with a net positive fluid balance of 15L over the length of stay (not accounting for insensible losses). The plan for tracheostomy placement today involves a PEEP goal of 8 and FiO2 goal of 50%. The goal is to wean the patient off the ventilator while maintaining O2 saturation above 90% and PaO2 above 60. Sedation will be weaned as tolerated, and the triglyceride level will be followed up.

Meropenem will be continued for pseudomonas VAP for 15 days until [**2111-7-6**]. The patient's ID recommendations and pending cultures will be followed up. Prednisone taper will continue with a dose of 10mg po today. Low-dose diuresis will be started today as long as there is no increased need for pressors or rise in BUN/Cr. The goal is to run a net"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. She has since been diagnosed with MRSA superinfection, H1N1 infection, ARDS physiology, and pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has mild fluid overload and is planned for tracheostomy placement. She is being weaned off the ventilator, sedation, and pressors as tolerated. Antibiotic therapy includes meropenem for pseudomonas VAP and previous treatment with oseltamivir and vancomycin. The patient is also being managed for diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonas VAP and is currently receiving treatment with meropenem. This condition requires ongoing monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has a mild component of fluid overload, with a net positive fluid balance of 15L over the length of stay (not accounting for insensible losses). This needs to be managed carefully to prevent complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure.
3. Shock: The patient's blood pressure improved with the change from zosyn to mer"

   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology; Now with pseudomonas VAP as well.
   [**Month (only) 11**] have mild component of fluid overload as 15L net positive over LOS
   (not accounting for insensible losses).
   - Trach in place. Still bronchospastic and requiring sedation through
   drips
   - Cont to wean vent and sedation as tolerated to maintain O2sat >90 and
   PaO2 >60.
   - Continue meropenem for pseudomas VAP X 15 days to end on [**2111-7-6**].
   - Cont prednisone taper: D [**1-17**] of 10mg po today.
   - Cont low dose diuresis gtt today as long as no increased need for
   pressors or rise in BUN/Cr
   - Goal is run net negative hourly with minimal pressor requirement
   (neo<1) with 24h goal net neg 1L
   - Start acetozolimide 500mg Q8hr for metabolic alkalosis -> hopefully
   when trached, can wean sedation and pressors and she may mobilize fluid
   better on her own.
   # Shock: BPs improved with change from zosyn to meropenem suggesting
   had resistant pseudomonas. Likely also component from conversion back
   to sinus rhythm.
   - Wean neosynephrine as tolerated
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - Cont amiodarone po (200mg daily starting today)
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Pt afebrile, leukocytosis fluctuating but mostly
   around 15. Likely [**2-16**] pseudomonas VAP on meropenem. C. diff neg x 2.
   Last CXR [**6-25**] without change. Lines changed [**2111-6-20**] with surveillance cx
   NGTD.
   - Continue meropenem x15 days (last dose 6/22) due to pseudomonas in
   sputum
   - Attempt peripheral IVs and pull CVL today if no longer need as many
   ports
   # Lone Afib: [**Month (only) 11**] have been [**2-16**] overdiuresis. CHADS2 score 2.
   - Cont amiodarone po ->today is first dose 200mg daily
   - As only one episode and has not recurred re-assess the need for
   long-term anticoagulation with coumadin. Consider just asa.
   # DM: FSBS not well-controlled on half-dose ISS yesterday and in
   setting of one dose solumedrol.

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated for pneumonia with antibiotics. She was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure initially due to H1N1 with MRSA superinfection and ARDS physiology. Now she also has pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient still requires sedation through drips and is bronchospastic, requiring weaning of sedation and ventilation while maintaining oxygen saturation above 90% and PaO2 above 60. Meropenem will be continued for pseudomonas VAP for 15 days until [**2111-7-6**]. Prednisone taper will be continued with a dose of 10mg po today.

The patient has a mild component of fluid overload as 15L net positive over LOS (not accounting for insensible losses). Tracheostomy has been placed, and low-dose diuresis will be continued as long as there is no increased need for pressors or rise in BUN/Cr. The goal is to run net negative hourly with minimal pressor requirement (neo<1) with a 24-hour goal net negative 1L.

Acetazolamide 500mg Q8hr will be started for metabolic alkalosis. When the patient is weaned off sedation and pressors, she may mobilize"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a significant medical history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. She required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with various complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), mild fluid overload, shock, and lone atrial fibrillation (Afib).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection leading to ARDS physiology. Now she has pseudomonas VAP as well. The main goal is to wean off the ventilator while maintaining oxygen saturation above 90% and PaO2 above 60.
2. Pseudomonas VAP: The patient has been treated with meropenem for pseudomonas VAP for an additional 15 days until [**2111-7-6**].
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has a mild component of fluid overload as 15L net positive over LOS (not accounting for insensible losses). Efforts are being made to wean off diuretics and run a net negative hourly fluid balance with minimal pressor requirements.
4. Shock: The patient's BPs improved with the change from zosyn to meropenem, suggesting resistant pseudomonas. Shock is likely also"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology; Now with pseudomonas VAP as well.
   [**Month (only) 11**] have mild component of fluid overload as 15L net positive over LOS
   (not accounting for insensible losses).
   - Plan for trach placement today as at PEEP goal of 8 and FiO2 goal of
   50%.
   - Cont to wean vent as tolerated to maintain O2sat >90 and PaO2 >60.
   - Wean sedation (propofol and fentanyl gtt) as tolerated; f/u
   triglycerides level
   - Continue meropenem for pseudomas VAP X 15 days to end on [**2111-7-6**].
   - F/u ID recs and pending cx.
   - Cont prednisone taper: D [**2-17**] of 10mg po today.
   - Cont low dose diuresis gtt today as long as no increased need for
   pressors or rise in BUN/Cr
   - Goal is run net negative hourly with minimal pressor requirement
   (neo<1) with 24h goal net neg 1L
   - Start acetozolimide 500mg Q8hr for metabolic alkalosis -> hopefully
   when trached, can wean sedation and pressors and she may mobilize fluid
   better on her own.
   # Shock: BPs improved with change from zosyn to meropenem suggesting
   had resistant pseudomonas. Likely also component from conversion back
   to sinus rhythm.
   - Wean neosynephrine as tolerated
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - Cont amiodarone po
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Pt afebrile, leukocytosis fluctuating but
   downtrending today. Pseudomonas VAP on meropenem. C. diff neg x 2. Last
   CXR [**6-25**] without change. Lines changed [**2111-6-20**] with surveillance cx
   NGTD.
   - Continue meropenem x15 days (last dose 6/22) due to pseudomonas in
   sputum
   - Oseltamivir discontinued [**6-25**]; Vanc discontinued [**6-26**]
   - Attempt peripheral IVs and pull CVL today or tomorrow
   # Afib: [**Month (only) 11**] have been [**2-16**] overdiuresis. No e/o PE. TSH WNL. In sinus
   now s/p pharm conversion.
   - Cont amiodarone po (currently 200mg po BID x 7 days to end [**6-30**], then
   200mg PO daily)
   - Reassess need for coumadin after trach/PEG placement today
   # DM: Improved FSG control on current RISS
   - Cont FSG qid with q6h RISS; adjust prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism who presented with acute on chronic dyspnea. She was treated for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient now has pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is on meropenem. She also has septic shock and cardiogenic shock from atrial fibrillation. The patient has been weaned off sedation and ventilation, but still requires pressors. She has been on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. She has low-grade fevers and leukocytosis. The patient's metabolic alkalosis has been managed with acetazolamide. EKG changes suggest strain, but cardiac enzymes are negative. The patient is expected to have an outpatient workup for CAD when more stable. She is currently receiving nutritional support through enteral feeding and is being monitored closely for ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already been diagnosed with pseudomonas VAP and is being treated with meropenem. This condition requires continued aggressive treatment to prevent further deterioration.
2. Septic shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to the presence of multiple infections. Prompt and effective management of sepsis is crucial to prevent organ dysfunction and mortality.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated for pneumonia. The patient was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by H1N1 with MRSA superinfection and ARDS physiology. She now has pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as well. A tracheostomy was placed on [**6-30**]. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, shock (likely septic and cardiogenic from atrial fibrillation), fevers/leukocytosis, and EKG changes consistent with strain. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic and cardiogenic shock. Proper management is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
3. Pseudomonas Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which increases the risk of morbidity and mortality if not appropriately treated.
4. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient's low-grade fever and leukocytosis"

   [**Month (only) 11**] have mild component of fluid overload as 15L net positive over LOS
   (not accounting for insensible losses). Trach placed [**6-30**].
   - Cont to wean vent and sedation (propofol first) as tolerated to
   maintain O2sat >90 and PaO2 >60.
   - Trach mask trials today
   - Continue meropenem for pseudomas VAP X 15 days to end on [**2111-7-6**].
   - Cont prednisone taper: D [**1-17**] of 10mg po today.
   - Cont low dose diuresis gtt today as long as no increased need for
   pressors or rise in BUN/Cr
   - Goal is run net negative hourly with minimal pressor requirement
   (neo<1) with 24h goal net neg
   - Cte acetozolimide for metabolic alkalosis -> hopefully now that
   trached, can wean sedation and pressors and she may mobilize fluid
   better on her own.
   # Shock: BPs improved with change from zosyn to meropenem suggesting
   had resistant pseudomonas. Likely also component from conversion back
   to sinus rhythm.
   - Wean neosynephrine as tolerated
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - Cont amiodarone po (200mg daily starting today)
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Pt afebrile, leukocytosis fluctuating but mostly
   around 15. Likely [**2-16**] pseudomonas VAP on meropenem. C. diff neg x 2.
   Last CXR [**6-25**] without change. Lines changed [**2111-6-20**] with surveillance cx
   NGTD.

   # Lone Afib: [**Month (only) 11**] have been [**2-16**] overdiuresis. CHADS2 score 2.
   - Cont amiodarone po ->today is first dose 200mg daily
   - As only one episode and has not recurred re-assess the need for
   long-term anticoagulation with coumadin. Consider just asa.
   # DM: FSBS not well-controlled on half-dose ISS yesterday and in
   setting of one dose solumedrol.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted for acute on chronic dyspnea and treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. She was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient initially presented with H1N1, MRSA superinfection, and ARDS physiology, and now has pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as well.

The patient has mild fluid overload with a net positive fluid balance of 15L over the length of stay (not accounting for insensible losses). A tracheostomy was placed on [**6-30**].

The plan includes continuing weaning of sedation and ventilation, tracheostomy mask trials, continuing meropenem for pseudomonas VAP for 15 days, and tapering prednisone. The goal is to run a net negative fluid balance hourly with minimal pressor requirement and maintain O2 saturation above 90% and PaO2 above 60.

The patient is also being treated for shock, likely caused by resistant pseudomonas and conversion back to sinus rhythm. Weaning of neosynephrine and sedation is planned, and amiodarone is being started.

The patient has leukocytosis fluctuating around 15, likely due to pseudomonas VAP on meropenem. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) tests"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, respiratory failure, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever of unknown origin, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, cough, and altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities and is currently receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever of unknown origin and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection. Cultures have been obtained to identify the causative agent.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of hypoxemia and hypercapnia in the arterial blood gas analysis. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, indicating possible hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic parameters is necessary to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
4. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events due to immobilization and underlying conditions such as atrial fibrillation. Prophylactic measures, such as DVT prophylaxis, should be continued to reduce the risk.
5. Delirium: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which may be due to various factors including the underlying medical conditions, medications, or sepsis. Close monitoring for signs"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated. She also has pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been weaned off fentanyl and propofol, but still requires pressors for blood pressure support. She has been started on fluconazole for urine yeast and valium for sedation. The patient's current medications include lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and furosemide.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA superinfection and ARDS physiology. Now, she has pseudomonas VAP as well. There is a continued need for ventilatory support and weaning off sedation while maintaining oxygen saturation above 90% and PaO2 above 60.

2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to suspected pseudomonas VAP and cardiogenic shock from atrial fibrillation. There is a continued need for pressor support, weaning sedation, and monitoring for hemodynamic stability.

3. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has a low-grade fever and stable leukocytosis around 14-15. This could be related to the ongoing infection and should be monitored with frequent cultures and appropriate antibiotic coverage.

4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which may be related to diuretic use (furosemide) and respiratory alkalosis due to mechanical ventilation. Acetazolamide can be resumed to help correct the metabolic alkalosis.

5. EKG Changes: The patient has EKG changes suggestive of strain, but cardiac enzymes are flat, indicating no recent myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications in ICU Care:
1. Nutritional Support: The patient is receiving Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 30 mL/hour.

2. Glycemic Control: The patient's glycemic control should be monitored and managed as per ICU protocol.

3. Lines: The patient has multiple lines including an arterial line, multi-lumen central line, and a PICC line.

4. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Overall, the patient's condition remains critical, and close monitoring and management of her respiratory status, hemodynamics, infection, and other medical complications are essential in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a significant medical history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute-on-chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated.

The patient initially presented with H1N1 infection and MRSA superinfection, but now she is being treated for Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as well. There is persistence of Gram-negative bacilli on the sputum gram stain sent yesterday.

The patient's tracheostomy placement on June 30th was successful, and she tolerated a tracheostomy mask trial yesterday, which is encouraging. The plan is to continue weaning off the ventilator and sedation while maintaining oxygen saturation above 90% and PaO2 above 60.

The patient is on meropenem for Pseudomonas VAP for an additional 15 days until July 6th. There is consideration to add gentamicin or tobramycin for double coverage. The prednisone taper will be continued, and the patient will be weaned off propofol as tolerated.

The patient has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis, which are concerning. She has been on meropenem due to Pseudomonas in the sputum, but the s"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. She developed hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation. She was diagnosed with MRSA superinfection and ARDS physiology. She is currently being treated for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has persistent gram-negative bacilli on sputum gram stain. The patient has shown improvement in tolerating tracheostomy mask trials. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, leading to ARDS physiology. She is now on treatment for pseudomonas VAP. The persistence of GNB on sputum gram stain suggests ongoing infection, which could lead to worsening respiratory failure if not effectively managed.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is likely septic, as indicated by low-grade fever and leukocytosis. This could progress to septic shock, especially if the source of infection is not controlled.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiac enzymes are flat, suggesting no recent cardiac event. However, her history of AFib increases the risk of cardiogenic shock due to arrhythmias.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which is improving with acetazolamide. Discontin"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a significant medical history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute-on-chronic dyspnea and was treated for pneumonia with antibiotics. The patient was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient initially had H1N1 with MRSA superinfection and ARDS physiology. Now, she is being treated for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as well as persistent gram-negative bacteria (GNB) on sputum gram stain sent yesterday.

The patient has a tracheostomy placed and was able to tolerate a tracheostomy mask trial yesterday, which is encouraging. The plan is to continue weaning the patient off the ventilator and sedation as tolerated, maintaining oxygen saturation above 90% and partial pressure of oxygen above 60 mmHg. The goal is to perform tracheostomy trials daily and increase the time off the ventilator each day as tolerated.

The patient is currently on meropenem for pseudomonas VAP and will continue this antibiotic for 15 days until [**2111-7-6**]. There is a consideration to add either gentamicin or tobramycin for double coverage based on sensitivities.

The patient is also on prednisone taper, with the last dose of acetaz"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history significant for asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted for acute on chronic dyspnea and treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. The patient required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure initially presenting with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, as well as ARDS physiology. She is now being treated for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has persistence of gram-negative bacilli (GNB) on sputum gram stain sent yesterday.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is on treatment for pseudomonas VAP, along with continuing efforts to wean off sedation and ventilation. Daily trach trials are encouraged.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has low-grade fever and leukocytosis, which is stable at around 13-15. She is on meropenem for pseudomonal VAP, but sputum culture still shows GNB. Fluconazole was started for multiple UCX positive for yeast.
3. Shock: The patient likely has septic shock as well as cardiogenic shock from atrial fibrillation. MAP >60 is being maintained off pressors as sedation is being weaned off.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis is improving on acetazolamide, which is being discontinued today.
5. EKG Changes c/w Strain: Cardiac enzymes are flat. If the patient had an event, it was many days ago, as troponin levels are negative.
6. Nutrition: The patient is receiving Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 45 mL/hour.
7. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels are being monitored.
8. Lines: The patient has an arterial line, PICC line, and central venous line (CVL) in place.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis, lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and meropenem for pseudomonas VAP.
10. Communication: The patient's family members have been informed about her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonas VAP: The patient has persistent GNB in the sputum, indicating a potential ongoing infection.
2. Yeast Infection: The patient has UCX positive for yeast, indicating a potential fungal infection.
3. Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and the need for pressors suggest ongoing shock, which could be septic or cardiogenic in nature.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis is improving but may require further management.
5. EKG Changes: Although cardiac enzymes are flat, the EKG changes suggest strain on the heart, which may require further evaluation.
6. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status may continue to pose a risk for hypoxia.
7. DVT/PE: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility and central venous lines.
8. Nosocomial Infections: The patient is at risk for acquiring additional nosocomial infections due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines.

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient initially had H1N1 with MRSA superinfection and ARDS physiology. Currently, she is being treated for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with intermediate sensitivity to meropenem. The patient's arterial line and PICC line have stopped, and blood cultures were obtained. She has a fever of 102.0°F and is experiencing tachycardia. The patient's tracheostomy trial failed due to fever and tachycardia, but she converted from atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A-fib w/ RVR) to sinus rhythm prior to administering metoprolol. Blood cultures from July 1st showed budding yeast, and the patient was advised to discontinue fluconazole and start micafungin. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) has been ordered for possible endocarditis. Sputum cultures from July 1st revealed pseudomonas with intermediate sensitivity to meropenem, but tobramycin was not given. The patient's intravenous (IV) lines were pulled for line holiday, and two peripheral IVs (PIVs) were placed. The patient's cuff"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history significant for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute-on-chronic dyspnea and was treated for pneumonia. The patient required intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure initially caused by H1N1 with MRSA superinfection and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) physiology. She is now being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as persistent gram-negative bacilli (GNB) on sputum gram stain.

The patient has shown some improvement, including tolerating a tracheostomy mask trial yesterday and encouraging progress. The plan is to continue weaning the patient off sedation and ventilation while maintaining oxygen saturation above 90% and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) above 60. Daily tracheostomy trials will be conducted, gradually increasing the time spent off the ventilator.

The patient's fevers and leukocytosis have been stable for the past week, with a white blood cell count ranging from 13-15. Despite being on meropenem for pseudomonal VAP, the sputum culture still shows growth of GNB. Fluconazole was started yesterday for multiple urine cultures positive for yeast, and yeast was also found in the blood culture drawn from an arterial"

   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # L arm flaccid paralysis: Moving other extremities moving randomly,
   but not moving L arm since yesterday.  Was on heparin for a-fib, but
   stopped several days ago due to CHADs of 2. R pupil sluggish.
   - Head CT
    # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology; now on tx for pseudomonas VAP with
   persistence of pseudomonas on sputum cultures which is intermediate
   sensitivity to meropenem.
   - Consider eval by respiratory/thoracics for possible trach cuff leak
   as concern that balloon may have ruptured
   - Cont to wean vent and sedation as tolerated to maintain O2sat >90 and
   PaO2 >60. Stop valium today and [**Month (only) 202**] fentanyl dose. Attempt to wean
   propofol today.
   - trach trials daily as tolerated with increased time off vent each day
   as able
   - Lidocaine to calm bronchospasms
   - Continue meropenem for pseudomonas VAP X 15 days to end on [**2111-7-6**] as
   likely the fevers are from fungemia
   - CT chest today
   - BAL per ID if respiratory status worsens but currently improving
   daily.
   - Cont prednisone taper: D1/3 at 5mg today
   - Cont lasix IV 160mg TID with 24h goal net neg U/O without restarting
   pressors. Check PM lytes daily.
   # Fungemia: Yeast growing from BCx from [**7-1**] drawn from a-line as well
   as from urine on multiple cultures despite foley change.
   - On micafungin (day 1 [**2111-7-3**])
   - On line holiday
   - surveillance mycolytic culture.
   - Consult ophtho
   - TTE in the next few days for candidemia
   # AFib with RVR: CHADS2 score 1. Had been on heparin but was stopped
   about 1 week ago as was felt to be just lone afib. Now that has
   recurred may consider full dose aspirin or heparin->coumadin.
   - Continue to monitor on tele
   - Rate control with beta blocker PRN.
   - Start low dose beta blocker for long term rate control as pressures
   allow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated for H1N1 pneumonia with MRSA superinfection. She developed ARDS physiology and required intubation. The patient has since been diagnosed with pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has persistent gram-negative bacilli (GNB) in her sputum gram stain. She also has candidemia as indicated by positive blood cultures for budding yeast. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including meropenem and fluconazole, but the infection persists. She is currently on mechanical ventilation support and is being weaned off sedation as tolerated. The plan is to continue meropenem for pseudomonas VAP for another 15 days, and to consider adding gentamicin or tobramycin for double coverage based on sensitivities. She will also be started on micafungin due to the presence of candidemia. The patient's tracheostomy tube was replaced yesterday, and she tolerated it well. Her arterial line and PICC line were stopped previously due to infection. The patient's fever and leukocytosis are being monitored, and further investigations are planned to determine the cause of the persistent infection."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, H1N1 infection, and fungemia. They have been experiencing fevers, arterial and PICC line stops, blood cultures taken, and conversion of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) after administration of a beta-blocker. The patient also has no spontaneous left arm movement. Allergies include Levofloxacin, and the last dose of antibiotics was given on 07-03. Infusions include furosemide, lansoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted changes above. 

Vital signs show a maximum temperature of 102.0°F, heart rate between 86-135 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/43 mmHg to 158/71 mmHg, respiratory rate between 17-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's height is 62 inches, and their weight is not specified. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,687 mL total in, including 771 mL of PO, 502 mL of IVF, and 100 mL of TF. Output includes 1,480 mL of total out, consisting of 925 mL of urine, 207 mL of NG, and -154 mL of drain balance. Respiratory support is provided through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. Oxygen delivery is set at 50%, with PS of 8 cmH2O, RR of 24 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, PaO2 of 60 mmHg, HCO3- of 21 mEq/L, and BE of -10 mEq/L. Ve is 11.2 L/min.

Physical examination reveals a tracheostomy, lying in bed, HEENT with reactive pupils though right slower than left, CV with RR, chest with coarse bilateral breath sounds, abdomen as obese soft NT, extremities with 1+ edema, and neurologic with spontaneous movement of all extremities except for the left arm. 

Lab results show a WBC count of 13.0 K/uL, Hct of 31.1%, Plt of 457 K/uL, Cr of 0.7 mg/dL, TCO2 of 33 mmHg, glucose levels ranging from 128-230 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits. Urine yeast is present.

Assessment and plan:
1. Resp Failure: Continue PSV wean with daily TM trials and ongoing steroid taper.
2. New Fevers: Discontinue all"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, H1N1 infection, and fungemia. They have been admitted to the ICU and have undergone various interventions and treatments. The patient's condition has been monitored closely, and several medical complications have been identified.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which requires ongoing management and weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had persistent fevers despite antibiotic coverage, indicating a possible infection that needs further investigation.
3. Fungemia: The patient has been diagnosed with fungemia, which is a systemic fungal infection. Appropriate antifungal therapy has been initiated, and all central lines have been removed.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has coarse bilateral crackles in the chest, suggesting potential lung damage or impaired skin integrity.
5. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient was initially in atrial fibrillation (AFib) but was successfully converted to sinus rhythm. Ongoing management of the patient's heart rhythm is necessary.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient has shown signs of altered mental status, which is being closely monitored and managed.
7. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss during their illness. Blood product transfusions have been administered as needed.
8. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type I: The patient has developed hyperglycemia, suggesting the"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to H1N1 infection and fungemia. The patient has been experiencing fevers, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, altered mental status, anemia secondary to blood loss, and diabetes mellitus type 1. The patient requires respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation in CPAP/PSV mode. There are concerns regarding impaired skin integrity, cough, and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure needs continuous monitoring and management. Weaning from mechanical ventilation should be done cautiously, considering the ongoing steroid taper.
2. Infection: The presence of yeast in urine and blood suggests a possible fungal infection. All lines need to be removed, and appropriate antifungal therapy should be initiated. Consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended for further coverage and management.
3. Endophthalmitis: The patient requires an ophthalmology consult for potential endophthalmitis, which is an infection of the inside of the eye.
4. Cardiac Issues: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response needs to be managed carefully. Antiarrhythmic medication should be considered, and the patient's cardiac function should be monitored closely.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity should be assessed regularly to prevent or manage any potential pressure ulcers or infections."

   TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully
   excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen (suboptimal-quality study). Normal
   global and regional biventricular systolic function.  Compared with the
   prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-6-22**], the findings are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.

   well as from urine on multiple cultures despite foley change. Also with
   unidentified organisms from PICC tip cx. Suboptimal TTE without
   evidence of vegetation although concern yesterday for embolic event as
   above. No endophtalmitis on exam.
   - On micafungin (D1 [**2111-7-3**])
   - Cont line holiday as long as possible
   - Cont daily surveillance mycolytic and routine blood cx tmrw
   - Appreciate ID input; f/u recs including need for TEE and antifungal
   course
   - Appreciate Ophtho eval
    # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology; now on tx for pseudomonas VAP with
   persistence of pseudomonas+ sputum cultures, thought to be respiratory
   colonizers with fevers attributed to fungemia.
   - Continue meropenem for pseudomonas VAP X 15 days (last dose [**2111-7-6**]
   as likely the fevers are from fungemia. Consider BAL per ID recs if
   respiratory status worsens but currently improving daily.
   - Weaned off vent to trach mask. Now off propofol and valium - cont to
   decrease dose of fentanyl patch q3d.
   - Completed prednisone taper (last dose [**2111-7-4**])
   - F/u CT chest final read
   - Hold further diuresis
   # AFib with RVR: CHADS2 score 1. Had been on heparin but was stopped
   about 1 week ago as was felt to be just lone Afib but has had several
   self-limited episodes of recurrence; currently in sinus.
   - Continue to monitor on tele
   - Increase ASA to full dose; could consider starting coumadin
   - Cont amiodarone low dose beta blocker for long term rate control as
   pressures allow with prn beta blocker doses for rate control
   # Concern for embolic event: L arm thought to be without movement
   yesterday and R pupil sluggish but CT head without acute intracranial
   process and observed to have spontaneous movement later in day. Of
   note, recent afib with CHADS 2 on heparin gtt until switched to ASA and
   hep SQ several days ago. No vegetations seen on TTE.

She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated for pneumonia with antibiotics. The patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with candidemia, with yeast growing from blood cultures and unidentified organisms from the PICC tip culture. A suboptimal transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) showed no evidence of vegetation, but there is concern for an embolic event. The patient has been started on micafungin and continues to receive meropenem for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has been weaned off the ventilator and is now on a tracheostomy mask. The patient's respiratory status is improving daily, and further diuresis has been held. She also has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and a CHADS2 score of 1. There is concern for an embolic event, and a repeat CT head in 48 hours is being considered if there is no movement of the left arm. The patient's bowel regimen needs to be increased due to constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Candidemia: The patient has yeast growing from blood cultures, indicating candidemia. It is important to continue antifungal therapy and monitor for any signs of worsening infection.

   24 Hour Events:
   - No left arm movement observed so CT Head done which was without acute
   intracranial process. Ability to get trach limited by metal component
   of trach, so plan to repeat CT in 48 hours. Later noted to be moving
   left arm when doing ABG.
   - ID recommended micafungin while awaiting speciation, TTE, and ophtho
   eval. TTE suboptimal quality but no vegetations seen. Ophtho saw no
   evidence of endophthalmitis. Persistent pseudomonas from resp cx
   thought to be colonizer and recommended no change in abx or course, esp
   given clinical improvement in pulm function and improving CT chest.
   - On CT chest, scout film had large gastric bubble. PEG opened to air
   and patient rolled a few times. Abd not distended. Repeat KUB at 9:30pm
   showed no air-fluid levels or free-air. Final read pending.
   - Remained on trach mask throughout day/night.

   leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully
   excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen (suboptimal-quality study). Normal
   global and regional biventricular systolic function.  Compared with the
   prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-6-22**], the findings are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Candidemia: Yeast growing from BCx from [**7-1**] drawn from a-line as
   well as from urine on multiple cultures despite foley change. Also with
   unidentified organisms from PICC tip cx. Suboptimal TTE without
   evidence of vegetation although concern yesterday for embolic event as
   above. No endophtalmitis on exam.
   - On micafungin (D1 [**2111-7-3**])
   - Cont line holiday as long as possible
   - Cont daily surveillance mycolytic and routine blood cx tmrw
   - Appreciate ID input; f/u recs including need for TEE and antifungal
   course
   - Appreciate Ophtho eval
    # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology; now on tx for pseudomonas VAP with
   persistence of pseudomonas+ sputum cultures, thought to be respiratory
   colonizers with fevers attributed to fungemia.
   - Continue meropenem for pseudomonas VAP X 15 days (last dose [**2111-7-6**]
   as likely the fevers are from fungemia. Consider BAL per ID recs if
   respiratory status worsens but currently improving daily.
   - Weaned off vent to trach mask. Now off propofol and valium - cont to
   decrease dose of fentanyl patch q3d.
   - Completed prednisone taper (last dose [**2111-7-4**])
   - F/u CT chest final read
   - Hold further diuresis
   # AFib with RVR: CHADS2 score 1. Had been on heparin but was stopped
   about 1 week ago as was felt to be just lone Afib but has had several
   self-limited episodes of recurrence; currently in sinus.
   - Continue to monitor on tele
   - Increase ASA to full dose; could consider starting coumadin
   - Cont amiodarone low dose beta blocker for long term rate control as
   pressures allow with prn beta blocker doses for rate control
   # Concern for embolic event: L arm thought to be without movement
   yesterday and R pupil sluggish but CT head without acute intracranial
   process and observed to have spontaneous movement later in day. Of
   note, recent afib with CHADS 2 on heparin gtt until switched to ASA and
   hep SQ several days ago. No vegetations seen on TTE.
   - Hold further imaging for now; Consider repeat CT head in 48 hours if
   concern remains
   - Cont ASA and hep SQ

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with candidemia, identified by yeast growth from blood cultures, as well as unidentified organisms from the PICC line tip culture. There is no evidence of endophthalmitis or vegetation on the echocardiogram, which was of suboptimal quality. The patient is currently on micafungin, and further surveillance and blood cultures are pending. She is also being treated for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), with persistent pseudomonas-positive sputum cultures, considered to be respiratory colonizers. The patient's respiratory status is improving daily, and she has been weaned off the ventilator to a tracheostomy mask. Her steroid taper is complete, and further diuresis has been held. There is concern for an embolic event, including a possible stroke, but this has not been confirmed on imaging.

   leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully
   excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # Candidemia: C. parasilopsis growing from BCx from [**7-1**] drawn from
   a-line as well. Ucx also persistently growing yeast. PICC tip cx with
   Coag neg Staph, presumed contaminant given no growth on other bcx to
   date. Suboptimal TTE without evidence of vegetation although concern
   yesterday for embolic event as above. No endophtalmitis on exam.
   - On micafungin (D1 [**2111-7-3**])
   - Cont line holiday as long as possible
   - Cont daily surveillance mycolytic and routine blood cx tmrw
   - Appreciate ID input; f/u recs including need for TEE and antifungal
   course
   - Appreciate Ophtho eval
    # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology; now on tx for pseudomonas VAP with
   persistence of pseudomonas+ sputum cultures, thought to be respiratory
   colonizers with fevers attributed to fungemia.
   - Continue meropenem for pseudomonas VAP X 15 days (last dose [**2111-7-6**]
   as likely the fevers are from fungemia. Consider BAL per ID recs if
   respiratory status worsens but currently improving daily.
   - Weaned off vent to trach mask. Now off propofol and valium - cont to
   decrease dose of fentanyl patch q3d.
   - Completed prednisone taper (last dose [**2111-7-4**])
   - F/u CT chest final read
   - On lasix 160mg tid but may be nearing euvolemia as BUN bumping; will
   reassess dose after I/O check in PM with goal net neg 1 L over 24h
   # AFib with RVR: CHADS2 score 1. Had been on heparin but was stopped
   about 1 week ago as was felt to be just lone Afib but has had several
   self-limited episodes of recurrence; currently in sinus.
   - Continue to monitor on tele
   - Increase ASA to full dose; could consider starting coumadin
   - Cont amiodarone low dose beta blocker for long term rate control as
   pressures allow with prn beta blocker doses for rate control
   # Concern for embolic event: L arm thought to be without movement
   yesterday and R pupil sluggish but CT head without acute intracranial
   process and observed to have spontaneous movement later in day. Of
   note, recent afib with CHADS 2 on heparin gtt until switched to ASA and
   hep SQ several days ago. No vegetations seen on TTE.
   - Hold further imaging for now; Consider repeat CT head in 48 hours if
   concern remains
   - Cont ASA and hep SQ

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated for pneumonia. The patient required intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with candidemia caused by C. parapsilosis and is currently being treated with micafungin. The patient also has a persistent pseudomonas infection in her respiratory tract, which is thought to be a colonizer and not requiring a change in antibiotic therapy. There is concern for an embolic event, but no vegetations were seen on the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). The patient is on anticoagulation therapy and is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Candidemia: The patient has an active infection of C. parapsilosis, which is a type of yeast infection. This can lead to further systemic spread and potential complications if not treated effectively.

2. Pseudomonas infection: Although considered a colonizer, the persistent presence of pseudomonas in the respiratory tract may increase the risk of respiratory failure or worsening of the patient's current condition.

3. Embolic event: There have been concerns about the possibility of an embolic event, possibly related to atrial fibrillation or other cardiac issues. Monitoring and appropriate management are crucial to prevent any potential complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a significant medical history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted for acute on chronic dyspnea and treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. The patient required intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. She has had various complications during her stay in the ICU, including suspected embolic events, fungemia, and persistent pseudomonas infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Embolic events: The patient initially had no movement in her left arm, raising concerns for an embolic event. Although a CT head was done, it did not show any acute intracranial process. However, the patient was observed to have spontaneous movement later in the day. It is important to monitor for any further signs or symptoms of embolic events.

2. Fungemia: The patient has yeast growing from blood cultures, indicating a fungal infection. Despite a change in Foley catheter, yeast is also present in the urine cultures. Additionally, there are unidentified organisms from the PICC line tip culture. The patient is currently on micafungin, and further surveillance blood and mycologic cultures are planned. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be considered to assess for endocarditis.

3. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, leading to ARDS physiology. She is currently being treated for pseud"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # L arm flaccid paralysis: Moving other extremities moving randomly,
   but not moving L arm since yesterday.  Was on heparin for a-fib, but
   stopped several days ago due to CHADs of 2. R pupil sluggish.
   - Head CT
    # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology; now on tx for pseudomonas VAP with
   persistence of pseudomonas on sputum cultures which is intermediate
   sensitivity to meropenem.
   - Consider eval by respiratory/thoracics for possible trach cuff leak
   as concern that balloon may have ruptured
   - Cont to wean vent and sedation as tolerated to maintain O2sat >90 and
   PaO2 >60. Stop valium today and [**Month (only) 202**] fentanyl dose. Attempt to wean
   propofol today.
   - trach trials daily as tolerated with increased time off vent each day
   as able
   - Lidocaine to calm bronchospasms
   - Continue meropenem for pseudomonas VAP X 15 days to end on [**2111-7-6**] as
   likely the fevers are from fungemia
   - CT chest today
   - BAL per ID if respiratory status worsens but currently improving
   daily.
   - Cont prednisone taper: D1/3 at 5mg today
   - Cont lasix IV 160mg TID with 24h goal net neg U/O without restarting
   pressors. Check PM lytes daily.
   # Fungemia: Yeast growing from BCx from [**7-1**] drawn from a-line as well
   as from urine on multiple cultures despite foley change.
   - On micafungin (day 1 [**2111-7-3**])
   - On line holiday
   - surveillance mycolytic culture.
   - Consult ophtho
   - TTE in the next few days for candidemia
   # AFib with RVR: CHADS2 score 1. Had been on heparin but was stopped
   about 1 week ago as was felt to be just lone afib. Now that has
   recurred may consider full dose aspirin or heparin->coumadin.
   - Continue to monitor on tele
   - Rate control with beta blocker PRN.
   - Start low dose beta blocker for long term rate control as pressures
   allow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, DM, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with H1N1, MRSA superinfection, ARDS physiology, and pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has a yeast infection, likely candidemia, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonas VAP: The patient's current infection with pseudomonas VAP poses a risk for worsening respiratory failure and possible sepsis.
2. Candidemia: The presence of yeast growth from blood cultures indicates a systemic fungal infection, which can lead to disseminated candidiasis if not treated promptly.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases the risk of thromboembolic events, such as stroke.
4. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation with hypoxic respiratory failure indicates severe lung compromise, which can progress to further respiratory deterioration.
5. Tracheostomy Cuff Leak: The concern for a tracheostomy cuff leak may result in aspiration pneumonia and worsening respiratory status.

   leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully
   excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen (suboptimal-quality study). Normal
   global and regional biventricular systolic function.  Compared with the

   TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully
   excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen (suboptimal-quality study). Normal
   global and regional biventricular systolic function.  Compared with the
   prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-6-22**], the findings are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old female with PMH significant for asthma, COPD, DM,
   hypothyroidism with acute on chronic dyspnea, treated with antibiotics
   for pneumonia and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   # ?L arm flaccid paralysis: Concern for embolic event as L arm thought
   to be without movement and R pupil sluggish but CT head without acute
   intracranial process and observed to have spontaneous movement later in
   day. Of note, recent afib with CHADS 2 on heparin gtt until switched to
   ASA and hep SQ several days ago. No vegetations seen on TTE.
   - Consider repeat CT head in 48 hours if concern remains
   - Cont ASA and hep SQ
   # Fungemia: Yeast growing from BCx from [**7-1**] drawn from a-line as well
   as from urine on multiple cultures despite foley change. Also with
   unidentified organisms from PICC tip cx. Suboptimal TTE without
   evidence of vegetation although concern yesterday for embolic event as
   above.
   - On micafungin (D1 [**2111-7-3**])
   - On line holiday
   - Follow surveillance blood and mycolytic cx
   - Consider TEE
   - Appreciate ID input; f/u recs
   - F/u Ophtho recs
    # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology; now on tx for pseudomonas VAP with
   persistence of pseudomonas+ sputum cultures, thought to be respiratory
   colonizers with fevers attributed to fungemia.
   - Continue meropenem for pseudomonas VAP X 15 days (last dose [**2111-7-6**]
   as likely the fevers are from fungemia. Consider BAL per ID recs if
   respiratory status worsens but currently improving daily.
   - Weaned off vent to trach mask. Now off propofol and valium - cont to
   decrease dose of fentanyl patch q3d.
   - Completed prednisone taper (last dose [**2111-7-4**])
   - Consider eval by respiratory/thoracics for possible trach cuff leak
   as concern that balloon may have ruptured
   - F/u CT chest final read
   - Cont lasix IV 160mg TID with 24h goal net neg U/O without restarting
   pressors. Check lytes [**Hospital1 **].
   # AFib with RVR: CHADS2 score 1. Had been on heparin but was stopped
   about 1 week ago as was felt to be just lone Afib but has had several
   self-limited episodes of recurrence; currently in sinus.
   - Continue to monitor on tele
   - Increase ASA to full dose; could consider starting coumadin
   - Cont low dose beta blocker for long term rate control as pressures
   allow with prn doses for rate control

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated for pneumonia. She required intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Embolic event: The patient's left arm was initially observed to be without movement, but later it was noted to have spontaneous movement. This raises concern for a possible embolic event, especially considering the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent use of heparin. A repeat CT head in 48 hours is planned if concern remains.
2. Fungemia: Yeast is growing from blood cultures, indicating a possible fungal infection. The source of infection may be the urinary catheter or the intravenous line. The patient has already started on micafungin and will continue surveillance blood and mycologic cultures. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be considered to assess for endocarditis.
3. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with H1N1 and MRSA superinfection, leading to ARDS physiology. She is currently being treated for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Despite antibiotic therapy, pseudomonas continues to be present in sputum cultures, but these organisms are thought to be respiratory colonizers. Fever attributed to fungemia is expected to improve with micaf"

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on a ventilator (TM) for 24 hours and is experiencing ongoing steroid taper.
2. New fevers: The patient has low-grade fevers, and the source is unknown. The patient is being monitored for sepsis, and daily blood cultures are being taken. The patient is also on micafungin for a positive fungal blood culture.
3. Total body volume overload: The patient has been diuresed with lasix, but the BUN levels are increasing. The diuretic dose needs to be decreased by half, aiming for a negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters per day.
4. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient will continue receiving vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and azithromycin for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) for another 15 days (ending on [**7-6**]). The patient has worsening secretions, and a chest CT scan is stable to slightly improved. The patient's cough is ongoing, and they may benefit from nebulized lidocaine for comfort.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and currently admitted to the ICU. They have a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, impaired skin integrity, cough, altered mental status, anemia secondary to blood loss, fever of unknown origin, and diabetes mellitus type I. The patient also has acute respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/68 to 137/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on T-piece with SpO2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient has a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, specifically atrial fibrillation (AFIB). This condition can lead to irregular heart rhythms and potentially compromise cardiac output, causing symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, or even cardiac arrest if left unmanaged.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores. These ulcers can be painful, difficult to heal, and may lead to infection if not properly managed.
3. Cough: The patient presents with a cough. If persistent or severe, this can indicate underlying respiratory issues, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. In a critically ill patient, it may suggest the need for further evaluation and treatment to prevent complications like"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-inch, 83 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and altered mental status. They have a history of diabetes mellitus type I and respiratory failure. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for cough. On examination, the patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 130/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on T-piece. The patient is now out of bed and sitting in a chair. They have a tracheostomy in place and are on mechanical ventilation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and creatinine levels, but overall stable parameters. The patient's blood cultures grew C. parapsilosis and coag-negative staphylococcus from the PICC catheter tip. The patient was started on a 14-day course of antifungal treatment and a 15-day course of meropenem for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Prednisone was discontinued as the taper was completed. The patient's mental status is improving, and they are expected to continue weaning from the ventilator."

   superinfection and ARDS physiology. Trach and PEG on [**2111-6-29**]; now on tx
   for pseudomonas VAP with persistence of pseudomonas+ sputum cultures,
   thought to be respiratory colonizers with fevers attributed to
   fungemia.
   - Complete meropenem course today for pseudomonas VAP X 15 days.
   Consider BAL per ID recs if respiratory status worsens but currently
   improving daily.
   - Weaned off vent to trach mask. Now off propofol and valium - cont to

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history significant for asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She presented with acute on chronic dyspnea and was treated for pneumonia, resulting in intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's recent hospital course includes candidemia caused by C. parapsilosis, which was initially treated with micafungin. The central line holiday is being continued as long as possible, and daily surveillance mycolytic and routine blood cultures are recommended. There is also a PICC line tip culture positive for coag-negative staph, presumed to be a contaminant.

The patient has been on meropenem for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), with persistent pseudomonas-positive sputum cultures. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is suggested if the respiratory status worsens, but currently, the patient is improving daily. She has been weaned off the ventilator to a tracheostomy mask and is off propofol and valium. The prednisone taper has been completed.

The patient is also diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), with a CHADS2 score of 1. She has had several self-limited episodes of recurrence, but currently, she is in sinus rhythm. Monitoring on telemetry is recommended, along with increasing the dose of aspirin and considering starting coumadin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-inch tall, 83 kg male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type I, presenting with an altered mental status, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, cough, fever of unknown origin, and acute anemia secondary to blood loss. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on various medications including micafungin, meropenem, lasix, prevacid, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of C. paraipsilosis and coag negative staph infection. There is a potential risk of developing further infections due to prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive lines.
2. Bleeding: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. There is a potential risk of ongoing bleeding or re-bleeding due to the presence of multiple lines and the need for anticoagulation.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure. There is a potential risk of worsening respiratory status leading to ventilator dependence or respiratory arrest.
4. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient has atrial fibrillation. There is a potential risk of developing more serious arrhythmias or cardiac events.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may lead to pressure ulcers or infections.

   a-line as well; currently on line holiday. Ucx also persistently
   growing yeast. PICC tip cx with coag neg Staph, presumed contaminant
   given no growth on other bcx to date. Suboptimal TTE without evidence
   of vegetation. No endophthalmitis on exam per Ophtho.
   - On micafungin (D1 [**2111-7-3**]) with planned 14-day course per ID; will
   need PICC placement

    # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially presented with H1N1 with MRSA
   superinfection and ARDS physiology. Trach and PEG on [**2111-6-29**]; now on tx
   for pseudomonas VAP with persistence of pseudomonas+ sputum cultures,
   thought to be respiratory colonizers with fevers attributed to
   fungemia.
   - Complete meropenem course tmrw for pseudomonas VAP X 15 days.
   Consider BAL per ID recs if respiratory status worsens but continuing
   to improve.
   - Weaned off vent to trach mask.
   - Fentanyl tp to be decreased to 25 mg/h on [**7-8**], and then stopped on
   [**7-11**].
   - Completed prednisone taper [**2111-7-4**]

   - D/c trach sutures today per Thoracics recs
   - Cont OOB to chair; mobilize as tolerated
   # AFib with RVR: CHADS2 score 1. Had been on heparin but was stopped
   about 1 week ago as was felt to be just lone Afib but has had several
   self-limited episodes of recurrence; currently in sinus.
   - Continue to monitor on tele
   - Increase ASA to full dose; hold off on anticoagulation with coumadin
   for now
   - Cont amiodarone, low dose beta blocker for long term rate control as
   pressures allow with prn beta blocker doses for rate control
   # Elevated BUN: Cont to rise, Cr 0.9. [**Month (only) 11**] be [**2-16**] diuesis.

   # Concern for embolic event: L arm thought to be without movement and R
   pupil sluggish but CT head without acute intracranial process and now
   moving all extremities although LUE somewhat less than RUE. Of note,
   recent afib with CHADS 2 on heparin gtt until switched to ASA and hep
   SQ several days ago. No vegetations seen on TTE. No need for repeat CT

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic dyspnea and treated for pneumonia. She developed hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with candidemia caused by C. parapsilosis and is currently being treated with micafungin. She also has a PICC tip culture positive for coag-negative staph, which is considered a contaminant. The patient has completed a course of meropenem for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is improving. She is weaned off the ventilator and mobilized out of bed to a chair. The patient's asthma and COPD are being managed with appropriate medications. She has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) and is on aspirin and amiodarone for rate control. The patient's BUN levels are elevated, and close monitoring of intake and output is recommended. There is a concern for an embolic event, but a recent CT scan of the head showed no acute intracranial process. The patient's current medications include micafungin, meropenem, fentanyl, lasix, lansoprazole, and heparin sodium. She will be discharged to a long-term acute care facility (LTAC) once her acute"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing several medical complications. These include respiratory failure, candidemia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), cardiac dysrhythmia, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, fever of unknown origin, and diabetes mellitus type 1.

The patient is currently on a breathing tube (TM) for respiratory support and is being weaned off steroids. The new fevers are being monitored, and the patient is on micafungin for a positive fungal blood culture. There is also a concern for total body fluid overload, which is being managed with diuretics.

The patient has a history of pneumonia and will continue to receive antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia for another 15 days. There is a worsening cough, and the chest CT shows stable to slightly improved findings. Nebulized lidocaine may be tried for comfort, and measures such as elevating the head of the bed and changing positions may help alleviate symptoms.

The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with amiodarone and aspirin. The mental status seems to be slowly improving, and the patient is being weaned off valium and fentanyl patch. There is limited arm movement, and a repeat head CT will be done tomorrow morning due to weakness on the left side.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, candidemia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on a T-piece respiratory support device and has a SpO2 of 98%. Vital signs show a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/66 mmHg to 134/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.7°C. The patient's weight has decreased from 89.3 kg to 83 kg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 890 mL and output of 1,395 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 505 mL. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, and elevated glucose level.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been on a T-piece for 48 hours, and steroid taper is ongoing.
2. New Fevers: Low-grade fevers are present. The source is unclear, and daily blood cultures are being taken. Fluconazole is being initiated due to suspected fungal infection.
3. Total Body Fluid Overload: The patient has been diuresed with Lasix, but further diuresis is necessary. BUN levels are elevated, and the Lasix dose should be decreased by half.
4. Pneumonia: The patient will continue receiving [**"
