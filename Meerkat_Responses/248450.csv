","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever and rapid ventricular response due to atrial fibrillation. He was admitted from the ER and started on vancomycin, meropenem, and oral vancomycin. The patient also received panculture and started on diltiazem drip and oral diltiazem for atrial fibrillation. However, the diltiazem drip was discontinued due to hypotension.

Allergies include amoxicillin, penicillins, Coumadin (warfarin sodium), oxycodone, megestrol acetate, Remeron (mirtazapine), Ritalin (methylphenidate Hcl), and nausea/vomiting. The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin at 08:00 PM on 08/01 and meropenem at 04:12 AM on 08/02.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.3Â°F, heart rate of 140 bpm, blood pressure of 97/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 41 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has atrial fibrillation and a fluid balance of 4,228 mL in and 1,025 mL out since midnight.

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 11.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, platelet count of 458 K/uL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, glucose of 95 mg/dL, and other labs with notable findings of elevated PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Imaging reveals a possible small amount of free air beneath the left hemidiaphragm on the portable chest X-ray. Microbiology cultures are pending.

Assessment and plan include sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and tachycardia. The patient is being managed in the ICU with various interventions and prophylactic measures."

   Assessment and Plan: 87 year old male with a history of type II
   diabetes on insulin, prostate cancer s/p XRT, with multiple recent
   hospitalizations since [**2176-5-31**] for bladder rupture s/p repair, altered
   mental status, and hematuria who presents from [**Hospital 12**] Rehab with
   fevers, tachycardia and somnolence.
   Fevers/Tachycardia:  Likely represents infection.  Currently borderline
   hypotensive but this seems to be seconary to diltiazem drip and not the
   infection.  Currently no evidence of end organ lack of perfusion.  He
   is making good urine. In this patient, there are many potential
   sources.  He has a new cough with sputum production (recent MRSA in his
   sputum here and at [**Hospital1 12**]) but CXR without clear infection.  He has a
   suprapubic catheter and indwelling foley so urinary source is high on
   the differential.  Also was recently treated for clostridium difficle
   colitis.  Cultures from here in the past have shown MRSA, pseudomonas,
   and gram negative rods in urine. He received vancomycin and zosyn for
   24 hours at [**Hospital1 12**] prior to transfer with worsening of his clinical
   status.
   - vancomycin, meropenem and PO vancomycin to cover MRSA, resistent gram
   negative rods, and clostridium difficle
   - blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - repeat stool for c. diff (although unclear clinical utility of
   positive value)
   - follow cultures from [**Hospital 12**] rehab with plans for quick tapering of
   antibiotics
   - IV fluids for systolic BPs < 90s, UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - RUQ ultrasound given mildly elevated LFTs
   Hypoxia:  On arrival he was satting only 93% on a non-rebreather with
   tachypnea.  Currently breathing comfortably on 4L nasal canula.  CXR
   without clear pathology. Pulmonary embolim is of concern given
   immobility and lack of anticoagulation.
   - titrate down oxygen
   - if persistent O2 requirement will get CTA tonight to assess for
   pulmonary embolism
   Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:  HR on admission
   was in the 140s.  Unclear whether the underlying rhythm was SVT versus
   atrial fibrillation.  No improvement with carotid massage.  Given IV
   diltiazem with slowing of his rate to 90s with clear atrial
   fibrillation.  Now on a diltiazem drip with HR in the 90s, limited by
   blood pressure.
   - continue diltitazem drip for now
   - will start low dose PO diltiazem
   - may need to consider digoxin if unable to control adequately with
   drip secondary to hypotension
   - not on anticoagulation given previous bleeding
   Altered Mental Status:  Most likely related to critical illness and
   infection.  Patient is awake but currently not following commands.
   Neurologic exam is non-focal.  Is at high risk for ichemic stroke given
   atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation.
   - monitor neurologic exam for now
   - consider CT head if no improvement
   Anemia: Hematocrit 34, likely hemoconcentrated.  Past workup revealed
   iron deficiency and inappropriately low reticulocyte count.
   - continue iron supplements
   - monitor hematocrit
   Type II Diabetes: On insulin.
   - Will give half patient's home lantus and continue regular sliding
   scale
   Seizure Disorder:
   - continue dilantin
   C. diff colitis: Scheduled to complete course of flagyl on [**2176-7-31**].
   - will treat with PO vancomycin for now
   Pressure Ulcer:
   - wound care consult
   FEN: IVF for SBP < 90, UOP < 30 cc/hr, replete electrolytes, NPO, tube
   feeds

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, prostate cancer treated with radiation, and multiple recent hospitalizations. He presents with fevers, tachycardia, and somnolence from a rehabilitation facility. He has impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, anemia, and a history of C. difficile colitis. The patient is currently being treated for suspected sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been ordered. The patient is also receiving IV fluids for hypotension and is on a diltiazem drip for atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, tachycardia, and altered mental status suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis. The source of infection could be from the urinary tract, respiratory system, or another site. Antibiotics have been started empirically to cover common pathogens, including MRSA and resistant gram-negative rods.

2. Organism Perfusion: There is no evidence of end-organ dysfunction at this time. However, close monitoring of vital signs and organ function will be necessary to detect any signs of organ hypoperfusion.

3. Hypotension: The patient's systolic blood pressure is low, which may be due to the diltiazem drip"

   Assessment and Plan: 87 year old male with a history of type II
   diabetes on insulin, prostate cancer s/p XRT, with multiple recent
   hospitalizations since [**2176-5-31**] for bladder rupture s/p repair, altered
   mental status, and hematuria who presents from [**Hospital 12**] Rehab with
   fevers, tachycardia and somnolence.
   Fevers/Tachycardia/Leukocytosis:  Likely related to infection.  Source
   currently unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 1526**] and urine cultures from yesterday continue to
   have no growth.  Unable to send sputum or c. diff currently.  [**Name2 (NI) 1526**]
   pressures ranging in high 80s after 5 liters of IVF and PO diltiazem.
   Creatinine improved today.  Lactate trended down with hydration.
   Currently no evidence of end organ lack of perfusion.  He is making
   good urine.  In the past, patient has grown MRSA in his sputum,
   pseudomonas in peritoneal cultures multiple gram negative rods in his
   urine.  Also was recently treated for clostridium difficle colitis.  He
   is currently on vancomycin, meropenem and PO vancomyin.
   - vancomycin, meropenem and PO vancomycin to cover MRSA, resistent gram
   negative rods, and clostridium difficle
   - [**Name2 (NI) **], urine, sputum cultures
   - stool for c. diff
   - follow cultures from [**Hospital 12**] rehab with plans for quick tapering of
   antibiotics
   - IV fluids for systolic BPs < 90s, UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - RUQ ultrasound given mildly elevated LFTs on admission
   Hypoxia:  On arrival he was satting only 93% on a non-rebreather with
   tachypnea. Tachypnea may have been related to underlyign infection.
   Currently off oyxgen breathing comfortably.  CXR without infiltrates.
   - no further workup
   Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:  HR on admission
   was in the 140s.  Unclear whether the underlying rhythm was SVT versus
   atrial fibrillation.  No improvement with carotid massage.  Given IV
   diltiazem with slowing of his rate to 90s with clear atrial
   fibrillation but rate control limited by hypotension.
   - continue low dose PO diltiazem
   - may need to consider digoxin if unable to control adequately with
   drip secondary to hypotension
   - not on anticoagulation given previous bleeding
   Altered Mental Status:  Most likely related to critical illness and
   infection.  Patient is awake but currently not following commands.
   Neurologic exam is non-focal.  Is at high risk for ichemic stroke given
   atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation.
   - monitor neurologic exam for now
   - consider CT head if no improvement
   Anemia: Hematocrit 25 today down from 34 in the setting of significant
   IVF.  25 is his recent baseline.  Past workup revealed iron deficiency
   and inappropriately low reticulocyte count.
   - continue iron supplements
   - monitor hematocrit
   - active type and screen
   Type II Diabetes: On insulin.
   - Will give half patient's home lantus and continue regular sliding
   scale given critial illness and titrate up as tolerated
   Seizure Disorder:  Dilantin level low this morning at 2.0 in the
   setting of missing some doses yesterday.
   - continue dilantin at 100 mg PO TID
   C. diff colitis: Scheduled to complete course of flagyl on [**2176-7-31**] at

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy, multiple recent hospitalizations, altered mental status, and hematuria. The patient presents with fevers, tachycardia, and somnolence.

The patient's current conditions include sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, tachycardia, and altered mental status. He has been admitted to the ICU.

The assessment and plan include:

1. Fevers/Tachycardia/Leukocytosis: The source of infection is unclear, but it is likely related to an infection. Cultures have been sent, including urine and blood cultures, and sputum culture. Antibiotics have been started to cover MRSA, resistant gram-negative rods, and Clostridium difficile.

2. Hypoxia: The patient was initially hypoxic but is now breathing comfortably without supplemental oxygen. No further workup is needed.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's heart rate was in the 140s on admission, and he was given IV diltiazem, which slowed his rate to the 90s. He is now on low-dose PO diltiazem for rate control. Digoxin may be considered if rate control is inadequate due to hypotension.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, prostate cancer, and multiple recent hospitalizations. He presents with fevers, tachycardia, and somnolence from a rehabilitation center. The patient has impaired skin integrity, tachycardia, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. He is currently on vancomycin, meropenem, and PO vancomycin to cover MRSA, resistant gram-negative rods, and Clostridium difficile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fevers, tachycardia, and altered mental status suggests sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores. This can lead to infection and further complications if not properly managed.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate (140 bpm) indicates tachycardia. If left untreated, it can result in reduced cardiac output and inadequate tissue perfusion.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's somnolence and lack of response to questions indicate an altered mental status. This can be caused by various factors such as critical illness, infection, or medication side effects. Monitoring and addressing the underlying cause are essential to prevent further deterioration.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old man with a history of dementia, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), a ruptured bladder requiring a suprapubic catheter, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and previous Clostridium difficile infection. He presented with fever, rapid AF, and sepsis. He is currently being treated with vancomycin, meropenem, and oral vancomycin to cover MRSA, resistant gram-negative rods, and Clostridium difficile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has fevers, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, indicating a concern for infection. The source of the infection has not yet been identified, so it is important to continue monitoring and follow-up cultures to identify the causative organism.

2. Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has AFib with rapid ventricular response. Treatment includes low-dose oral diltiazem and adding digoxin. If not controlled with these measures, amiodarone may be considered. However, the patient is not on anticoagulation due to previous bleeding.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is improving. It is important to continue monitoring his condition.

4. ICU Care: The patient's nutrition is being provided through PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) or tube feeding (TF). Glycemic control is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of dementia, recurrent urinary tract infections, ruptured bladder requiring suprapubic catheter, atrial fibrillation, and previous Clostridium difficile infection. He presents with fever, rapid atrial fibrillation, and sepsis. He is currently on vancomycin, meropenem, and oral vancomycin to cover MRSA, resistant gram-negative rods, and Clostridium difficile. The source of infection has not yet been identified. The patient has been volume resuscitated and a RUQ ultrasound has been performed due to mildly elevated liver function tests on admission. A wound care consult for pressure ulcer has also been requested.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's presentation with fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis suggests a possible infection. The source of infection is not yet identified, so it is crucial to continue monitoring for any signs of worsening infection.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. It is important to manage this condition with low-dose PO diltiazem and consider adding digoxin. If the above measures do not control the atrial fibrillation, amiodarone may be considered.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which is improving. Continuous monitoring is advised to assess any changes in mental status.
4. Pressure Ulcer: The patient requires a wound care consult for a pressure ulcer. This indicates the need for proper wound management to prevent further complications.
5. Glycemic Control: The patient's glycemic control should be monitored closely, considering his critical illness.
6. Nutrition: The patient is on PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) for nutrition. Monitoring his nutritional status and ensuring adequate intake is essential.
7. Kidney Function: The patient's creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL indicates potential kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of kidney function and fluid balance is necessary.
8. Liver Function: The patient's mildly elevated liver function tests on admission require further evaluation with the RUQ ultrasound. Monitoring liver function is important to detect any liver-related complications.

   [**2176-5-31**] for bladder rupture s/p repair, altered mental status, and
   hematuria who presents from [**Hospital 12**] Rehab with fevers, tachycardia and
   somnolence.
   Fevers/Tachycardia/Leukocytosis:  Likely related to infection.  Source
   currently unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 1526**] and urine cultures from yesterday continue to
   have no growth.  Unable to send sputum or c. diff currently.  [**Name2 (NI) 1526**]
   pressures ranging in high 80s after 5 liters of IVF and PO diltiazem.
   Creatinine improved today.  Lactate trended down with hydration.
   Currently no evidence of end organ lack of perfusion.  He is making
   good urine.  In the past, patient has grown MRSA in his sputum,
   pseudomonas in peritoneal cultures multiple gram negative rods in his
   urine.  Also was recently treated for clostridium difficle colitis.  He
   is currently on vancomycin, meropenem and PO vancomyin.
   - vancomycin, meropenem and PO vancomycin to cover MRSA, resistent gram
   negative rods, and clostridium difficle
   - [**Name2 (NI) **], urine, sputum cultures
   - stool for c. diff
   - follow cultures from [**Hospital 12**] rehab with plans for quick tapering of
   antibiotics
   - IV fluids for systolic BPs < 90s, UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - RUQ ultrasound given mildly elevated LFTs on admission
   Hypoxia:  On arrival he was satting only 93% on a non-rebreather with
   tachypnea. Tachypnea may have been related to underlyign infection.
   Currently off oyxgen breathing comfortably.  CXR without infiltrates.
   - no further workup
   Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:  HR on admission
   was in the 140s.  Unclear whether the underlying rhythm was SVT versus
   atrial fibrillation.  No improvement with carotid massage.  Given IV
   diltiazem with slowing of his rate to 90s with clear atrial
   fibrillation but rate control limited by hypotension.
   - continue low dose PO diltiazem
   - may need to consider digoxin if unable to control adequately with
   drip secondary to hypotension
   - not on anticoagulation given previous bleeding
   Altered Mental Status:  Most likely related to critical illness and
   infection.  Patient is awake but currently not following commands.
   Neurologic exam is non-focal.  Is at high risk for ichemic stroke given
   atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation.
   - monitor neurologic exam for now
   - consider CT head if no improvement
   Anemia: Hematocrit 25 today down from 34 in the setting of significant
   IVF.  25 is his recent baseline.  Past workup revealed iron deficiency
   and inappropriately low reticulocyte count.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, prostate cancer, and multiple recent hospitalizations. He presents with fevers, tachycardia, and somnolence. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.5 C (101.3 F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 64-88/36-59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He is unresponsive and has atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response.

The patient has been started on vancomycin, meropenem, and PO vancomycin to cover MRSA, resistant gram-negative rods, and Clostridium difficile. Cultures have been obtained from the blood, urine, and sputum. He is also on IV fluids for systolic BPs <90s and UOP <30 cc/hr. An RUQ ultrasound has been ordered due to mildly elevated LFTs on admission.

The patient has hypoxia, which was initially treated with a non-rebreather mask but is now comfortable off oxygen. His chest X-ray is clear of infiltrates. There are no further plans for workup.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Despite being given IV diltiazem, his heart rate remains high, limited by hypotension. He is currently"

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, prostate cancer, and multiple recent hospitalizations. He presents with fevers, tachycardia, and somnolence from [Hospital 12] Rehab. He has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, C. diff colitis, altered mental status, hypoxia, anemia, type II diabetes, seizure disorder, and pressure ulcer. The patient is currently receiving IV antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) and PO vancomycin for MRSA, resistant gram-negative rods, and C. diff. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been ordered. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.6 C, heart rate 113 bpm, blood pressure 142/68 mmHg, respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and mildly elevated liver function tests. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's heart rate remains difficult to control despite being on digoxin and diltiazem. Consideration should be given to amiodarone if the heart rate remains uncontrolled.
2. C. diff colitis: The patient has tested positive for C. diff again. Continue PO vancomycin for now,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple comorbidities admitted to the ICU for sepsis, tachycardia, altered mental status, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's condition has been complicated by a urinary tract infection with yeast, C. difficile infection, and a sacral ulcer requiring surgical consultation. The patient is currently on multiple medications including digoxin, diltiazem, and various antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial admission to the ICU was due to sepsis without organ dysfunction. It is crucial to monitor and manage the patient's infection effectively to prevent further complications.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate remains elevated despite the administration of digoxin and an increased dose of diltiazem. Close monitoring of the heart rhythm and rate is essential to prevent arrhythmias and cardiac complications.
3. C. difficile Infection: The patient has tested positive for C. difficile, which can lead to severe colitis and potentially life-threatening complications. Appropriate treatment and isolation precautions should be implemented to prevent the spread of the infection.
4. Sacral Ulcer: The patient's sacral ulcer requires surgical consultation for possible debridement. Proper wound care and management are necessary to prevent further complications such as infection or worsening of the ulcer.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient exhibits signs of impaired skin integrity, which can increase"

   87 year old male with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   prostate cancer s/p XRT, with multiple recent hospitalizations since
   [**2176-5-31**] for bladder rupture s/p repair, altered mental status, and
   hematuria who presents from [**Hospital 12**] Rehab with fevers, tachycardia and
   somnolence.
   Fevers/Tachycardia/Leukocytosis:  Patient now with 3 possible sources
   of infection (+ C diff, GPC in OSH blood cx, and yeast in urine).
   Blood pressures much improved after d/c
ing diltiazem gtt.  Creatinine
   improved.  Lactate trended down with hydration.  Currently no evidence
   of end organ lack of perfusion.  He is making good urine.  RUQ
   ultrasound with stones but no signs of cholecystitis. He is currently
   on vancomycin, meropenem and PO vancomyin.
   - vancomycin, meropenem and PO vancomycin to cover MRSA, resistent gram
   negative rods, and clostridium difficle
   - f/u blood, urine cx - sputum cultures contaminated
   - follow cultures from [**Hospital 12**] rehab with plans for quick tapering of
   antibiotics
   - [**Hospital 12**] rehab MACU (for culture data) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1959**]
   Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:  HR on admission
   was in the 140s.  Unclear whether the underlying rhythm was SVT versus
   atrial fibrillation.  No improvement with carotid massage.  Given IV
   diltiazem with slowing of his rate to 90s with clear atrial
   fibrillation but rate control initially limited by hypotension.   Dig
   load started [**2176-8-2**] with good effect.
   - continue PO diltiazem and titrate up as needed
   - continue digoxin
   - Consider amio if HR remains difficult to control.
   - not on anticoagulation given previous bleeding
   C. diff colitis: He was scheduled to complete course of flagyl on
   [**2176-7-31**] at [**Hospital1 12**] but this was continued given clinical deterioration.
   Now C diff positive again
   - continue PO vancomycin for now
   Yeast in Urine: Patient with complicated GU history including bladder
   rupture x2, now with neobladder drained by suprapubic cath and foley
   cath.
   - Given significant GU hx, will call urology for possible foley and
   suprapubic cath change.
   Altered Mental Status:  Most likely related to critical illness and
   infection.  Patient is awake but currently not following commands.
   Neurologic exam is non-focal.  Is at high risk for ichemic stroke given
   atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation.  Mental status much
   improved since admission
   - monitor neurologic exam for now
   Hypoxia:  On arrival he was satting only 93% on a non-rebreather with
   tachypnea. Tachypnea may have been related to underlyign infection.
   Currently off oyxgen breathing comfortably.  CXR without infiltrates.
   - no further workup
   Anemia: Hematocrit 34 on presentation and came down to 25 in the
   setting of significant IVF.  25 is his recent baseline.  Past workup
   revealed iron deficiency and inappropriately low reticulocyte count.
   - continue iron supplements
   - monitor hematocrit
   - active type and screen
   Type II Diabetes: On insulin.
   - Will give half patient's home lantus and continue regular sliding
   scale given critial illness and titrate up as tolerated
   Seizure Disorder:  Dilantin level low this morning at 2.0 in the
   setting of missing some doses yesterday.
   - continue dilantin at 100 mg PO TID
   Pressure Ulcer:
   - wound care consult
   FEN: IVF for SBP < 90, UOP < 30 cc/hr, replete electrolytes, NPO, tube
   feeds

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, prostate cancer treated with radiation, and multiple recent hospitalizations for bladder rupture repair, altered mental status, and hematuria. He presents with fevers, tachycardia, and somnolence from a rehabilitation facility.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that require attention. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, indicating an infection. He has positive cultures for C. difficile, yeast in the urine, and is being treated with antibiotics to cover MRSA, resistant gram-negative rods, and C. difficile. The source of infection needs to be identified and treated accordingly.

2. Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's initial heart rate was in the 140s, and he was given IV diltiazem to control the rate. Digoxin was started with good effect, but his heart rate remains difficult to control. Further evaluation and management of atrial fibrillation are necessary.

3. C. difficile colitis: The patient was scheduled to complete a course of Flagyl but had clinical deterioration. He is now positive for C. difficile again, and his treatment plan should be adjusted accordingly.

4. Yeast in the urine: The patient has a complicated GU history and is currently on a suprapubic catheter and Foley catheter."

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, prostate cancer treated with radiation, and multiple recent hospitalizations. He presents with fevers, tachycardia, and somnolence from a rehabilitation facility. He has altered mental status, hematuria, and a previous bladder rupture repair. The patient's blood pressures are much improved after discontinuing diltiazem. His creatinine level has improved, and lactate trended down with hydration. There are no signs of end-organ hypoperfusion, and he is making good urine. An RUQ ultrasound showed gallstones but no signs of cholecystitis. The patient is currently on vancomycin, meropenem, and oral vancomycin to cover MRSA, resistant gram-negative rods, and Clostridium difficile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's heart rate was initially in the 140s, and the underlying rhythm may have been either SVT or atrial fibrillation. Carotid massage was unsuccessful in controlling the heart rate. IV diltiazem was given, which slowed the rate to the 90s with clear atrial fibrillation. The patient's heart rate remains difficult to control, and consideration should be given to amiodarone if needed. Digoxin has been started, and the patient's rate has improved. Continued PO diltiazem and"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and reduced ejection fraction, who was admitted to the ICU for sepsis and altered mental status. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem), digoxin for atrial fibrillation, and diuretics. The patient's condition has been unstable, with persistent tachycardia despite medication adjustments. The patient's blood cultures showed an infection with yeast, indicating a possible fungal infection. The patient also tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff). The patient's wound care recommendations include surgical consultation for debridement of a sacral ulcer. The patient's nutritional status is of concern, and he is receiving a high-calorie formula through a feeding tube.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient's blood cultures showed an infection with yeast, and he tested positive for C. diff. This increases the risk of further infections, including antibiotic-resistant organisms.
2. Heart failure: The patient has a history of reduced ejection fraction and is on digoxin for atrial fibrillation. Tachycardia and fluid overload may indicate worsening heart failure.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a sacral ulcer that requires surgical consultation for debridement. Poor wound healing and skin breakdown increase the risk of infection and other complications.

   [**2176-5-31**] for bladder rupture s/p repair, altered mental status, and
   hematuria who presents from [**Hospital 12**] Rehab with fevers, tachycardia and
   somnolence.
   Fevers/Tachycardia/Leukocytosis:  Patient now with 3 possible sources
   of infection (+ C diff, GPC in OSH blood cx, and yeast in urine).
   Blood pressures much improved after d/c
ing diltiazem gtt.  Creatinine
   improved.  Lactate trended down with hydration.  Currently no evidence
   of end organ lack of perfusion.  He is making good urine.  RUQ
   ultrasound with stones but no signs of cholecystitis. He is currently
   on vancomycin, meropenem and PO vancomyin.
   - vancomycin, meropenem and PO vancomycin to cover MRSA, resistent gram
   negative rods, and clostridium difficle
   - f/u blood, urine cx - sputum cultures contaminated
   - follow cultures from [**Hospital 12**] rehab with plans for quick tapering of
   antibiotics

   Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:  HR on admission
   was in the 140s.  Unclear whether the underlying rhythm was SVT versus
   atrial fibrillation.  No improvement with carotid massage.  Given IV
   diltiazem with slowing of his rate to 90s with clear atrial
   fibrillation but rate control initially limited by hypotension.   Dig
   load started [**2176-8-2**] with good effect.
   - continue PO diltiazem and titrate up as needed
   - continue digoxin
   - Consider amio if HR remains difficult to control.
   - not on anticoagulation given previous bleeding
   C. diff colitis: He was scheduled to complete course of flagyl on
   [**2176-7-31**] at [**Hospital1 12**] but this was continued given clinical deterioration.
   Now C diff positive again
   - continue PO vancomycin for now
   Yeast in Urine: Patient with complicated GU history including bladder
   rupture x2, now with neobladder drained by suprapubic cath and foley
   cath.
   - Spoke with Urology who stated we should easily be able to change both
   catheters but can call for any trouble.
   - Change foley and suprapubic cath today.
   Altered Mental Status:  Most likely related to critical illness and
   infection.  Patient is awake but currently not following commands.
   Neurologic exam is non-focal.  Is at high risk for ichemic stroke given
   atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation.  Mental status much
   improved since admission
   - monitor neurologic exam for now
   Hypoxia:  On arrival he was satting only 93% on a non-rebreather with
   tachypnea. Tachypnea may have been related to underlyign infection.
   Currently off oyxgen breathing comfortably.  CXR without infiltrates.
   - no further workup
   Anemia: Hematocrit 34 on presentation and came down to 25 in the
   setting of significant IVF.  25 is his recent baseline.  Past workup
   revealed iron deficiency and inappropriately low reticulocyte count.
   - continue iron supplements
   - monitor hematocrit
   - active type and screen
   Type II Diabetes: On insulin.
   - Titrate up lantus and continue regular sliding scale as tolerated
   Seizure Disorder:  Dilantin level low again this morning at 1.8 and
   corrects to 2.8 with most recent albumin.
   - check albumin
   - reload with 800 mg fosphenytoin
   - 100 mg TID of fosphenytoin (regular pheytoin can clog PICC)
   - When transition back to PO/NG will need to flush PEG well as
   phenytoin sticks to PEG tube
   Pressure Ulcer:
   - f/u wound care
   - consider surgery consult for debridement of sacral ulcer.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, prostate cancer treated with radiation, and multiple recent hospitalizations. He presents with fevers, tachycardia, and somnolence from a rehabilitation hospital. The patient has several potential sources of infection, including C. difficile colitis, a yeast infection in the urine, and possibly MRSA.

The patient's blood pressure has improved after discontinuing diltiazem. His creatinine levels have also improved, and there is no evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion. He is currently on vancomycin, meropenem, and oral vancomycin to cover MRSA, resistant gram-negative rods, and Clostridium difficile.

The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, which has been controlled with intravenous diltiazem and digoxin. He is not currently on anticoagulation due to previous bleeding.

The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis and is continuing with oral vancomycin. Additionally, there is yeast present in the urine, likely due to his complicated GU history including bladder rupture and neobladder drained by suprapubic catheter and foley catheter.

The patient's mental status is altered, likely related to critical illness and infection. His neurologic exam is non-focal, and he is at high risk for ischemic stroke given his atrial fibrillation, but he is"

   Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:  HR on admission
   was in the 140s.  Unclear whether the underlying rhythm was SVT versus
   atrial fibrillation.  No improvement with carotid massage.  Given IV
   diltiazem with slowing of his rate to 90s with clear atrial
   fibrillation but rate control initially limited by hypotension.   Dig
   load started [**2176-8-2**] with good effect.
   - continue PO diltiazem and titrate up as needed
   - continue digoxin
   - Consider amio if HR remains difficult to control.
   - not on anticoagulation given previous bleeding
   C. diff colitis: He was scheduled to complete course of flagyl on
   [**2176-7-31**] at [**Hospital1 12**] but this was continued given clinical deterioration.
   Now C diff positive again
   - continue PO vancomycin for now
   Yeast in Urine: Patient with complicated GU history including bladder
   rupture x2, now with neobladder drained by suprapubic cath and foley
   cath.
   - Given significant GU hx, will call urology for possible foley and
   suprapubic cath change.
   Altered Mental Status:  Most likely related to critical illness and
   infection.  Patient is awake but currently not following commands.
   Neurologic exam is non-focal.  Is at high risk for ichemic stroke given
   atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation.  Mental status much
   improved since admission
   - monitor neurologic exam for now
   Hypoxia:  On arrival he was satting only 93% on a non-rebreather with
   tachypnea. Tachypnea may have been related to underlyign infection.
   Currently off oyxgen breathing comfortably.  CXR without infiltrates.
   - no further workup
   Anemia: Hematocrit 34 on presentation and came down to 25 in the
   setting of significant IVF.  25 is his recent baseline.  Past workup
   revealed iron deficiency and inappropriately low reticulocyte count.
   - continue iron supplements
   - monitor hematocrit
   - active type and screen
   Type II Diabetes: On insulin.
   - Will give half patient's home lantus and continue regular sliding
   scale given critial illness and titrate up as tolerated
   Seizure Disorder:  Dilantin level low again this morning at 1.8.
   - check albumin
   - reload with 800 mg fosphenytoin

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy, and multiple recent hospitalizations for bladder rupture repair, altered mental status, and hematuria. He presents with fevers, tachycardia, and somnolence from a rehabilitation hospital. The patient has multiple potential sources of infection including Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, gallstones without acute cholecystitis, and a yeast infection in the urine. His vital signs show a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 142/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on vancomycin, meropenem, and oral vancomycin to cover MRSA, resistant gram-negative rods, and C. difficile. He also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has been partially controlled with diltiazem and digoxin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including C. difficile colitis, yeast infection in the urine, and possible gallstones. The current treatment plan includes antibiotics to cover these infections. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and clinical symptoms is necessary to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and watch for any signs of worsening infection.

   Neurologic exam is non-focal.  Is at high risk for ichemic stroke given
   atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation.  Mental status much
   improved since admission
   - monitor neurologic exam for now
   Hypoxia:  On arrival he was satting only 93% on a non-rebreather with
   tachypnea. Tachypnea may have been related to underlyign infection.
   Currently off oyxgen breathing comfortably.  CXR without infiltrates.
   - no further workup
   Anemia: Hematocrit 34 on presentation and came down to 25 in the
   setting of significant IVF.  25 is his recent baseline.  Past workup
   revealed iron deficiency and inappropriately low reticulocyte count.
   - continue iron supplements
   - monitor hematocrit
   - active type and screen
   Type II Diabetes: On insulin.
   - Will give half patient's home lantus and continue regular sliding
   scale given critial illness and titrate up as tolerated
   Seizure Disorder:  Dilantin level low again this morning at 1.8.
   - Increase dilantin to 150 mg PO TID
   Pressure Ulcer:
   - f/u wound care
   - consider surgery consult for debridement of sacral ulcer.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, prostate cancer treated with radiation, and multiple recent hospitalizations for bladder rupture repair, altered mental status, and hematuria. He presents from a rehabilitation hospital with fevers, tachycardia, and somnolence. The patient has several potential sources of infection, including C. difficile colitis, yeast in the urine, and a possible central line infection. His blood pressures have improved after discontinuing diltiazem, and his creatinine levels have also improved. The patient is currently on vancomycin, meropenem, and oral vancomycin to cover MRSA, resistant gram-negative rods, and Clostridium difficile. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers/Tachycardia/Leukocytosis: The patient is showing signs of infection with three possible sources - C. difficile colitis, yeast in the urine, and a possible central line infection. It is important to continue monitoring his vital signs and laboratory results to assess the progression of the infections.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has an irregularly irregular heartbeat and a rapid heart rate, which may be related to his underlying condition or medication side effects. It is necessary to control his heart rate to prevent complications such as heart failure or stroke.
3. C. difficile colitis: The patient has tested positive for C."

   87 year old male with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   prostate cancer s/p XRT, with multiple recent hospitalizations since
   [**2176-5-31**] for bladder rupture s/p repair, altered mental status, and
   hematuria who presents from [**Hospital 12**] Rehab with fevers, tachycardia and
   somnolence.
   Fevers/Tachycardia/Leukocytosis:  Patient now with 3 possible sources
   of infection (+ C diff, GPC in OSH blood cx, and yeast in urine).
   Blood pressures much improved after d/c
ing diltiazem gtt.  Creatinine
   improved.  Lactate trended down with hydration.  Currently no evidence
   of end organ lack of perfusion.  He is making good UOP.  RUQ ultrasound
   with stones but no signs of cholecystitis. He is currently on
   vancomycin, meropenem and PO vancomyin.
   - vancomycin, meropenem and PO vancomycin to cover MRSA, resistant gram
   negative rods, and clostridium difficle
   - f/u blood, urine cx (sputum cultures contaminated)
   - follow cultures from [**Hospital1 12**] MACU ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1959**]) with plans for quick
   tapering of antibiotics (likely meropenem first)
   - change out Foley and suprapubic caths (ok per Urology); reculture
   urine after
   - TTE on Mon unless GPC contaminant
   Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:  HR on admission
   was in the 140s.  Unclear whether the underlying rhythm was SVT versus
   atrial fibrillation.  No improvement with carotid massage.  Given IV
   diltiazem with slowing of his rate to 90s with clear atrial
   fibrillation but rate control initially limited by hypotension.  Dig
   load started [**2176-8-2**] with good effect.
   - continue PO diltiazem and titrate up as needed
   - continue digoxin
   - Consider amio if HR remains difficult to control.
   - not on anticoagulation given previous bleeding
   C. diff colitis: He was scheduled to complete course of flagyl on
   [**2176-7-31**] at [**Hospital1 12**] but this was continued given clinical deterioration.
   Now C diff positive again
   - continue PO vancomycin for now
   Yeast in Urine: Patient with complicated GU history including bladder
   rupture x2, now with neobladder drained by suprapubic cath and foley
   cath.
   - Spoke with Urology who stated we should easily be able to change both
   catheters but can call for any trouble.
   - Change foley and suprapubic cath today, resend urine culture
   Altered Mental Status:  Most likely related to critical illness and
   infection.  Mental status much improved since admission. Is at high
   risk for ichemic stroke given atrial fibrillation not on
   anticoagulation but neurologic exam is non-focal.
   - monitor neurologic exam for now
   - f/u cx data
   Seizure Disorder:  Dilantin level low again this morning at 1.8 and
   corrects to 2.8 with most recent albumin.
   - check albumin
   - reload with 800 mg fosphenytoin
   - 100 mg TID of fosphenytoin (regular pheytoin can clog PICC)
   - When transition back to PO/NG will need to flush PEG well as
   phenytoin sticks to PEG tube
   Type II Diabetes: On insulin.
   - Titrate up lantus and continue regular sliding scale as tolerated
   Pressure Ulcer:
   - f/u wound care
   - consider surgery consult for debridement of sacral ulcer.
   Anemia: Hematocrit 34 on presentation and came down to 25 in the
   setting of significant IVF.  25 is his recent baseline.  Past workup
   revealed iron deficiency and inappropriately low reticulocyte count.
   - continue iron supplements

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, prostate cancer treated with radiation, and multiple recent hospitalizations. He presents with fevers, tachycardia, and somnolence from a rehabilitation center. The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, Clostridium difficile colitis, yeast infection in the urine, anemia, hypoxia, and pressure ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's heart rate is elevated, and he has been prescribed medications such as diltiazem and digoxin to control his heart rate. If the heart rate remains difficult to control, amiodarone may be considered.
2. Clostridium difficile Colitis: The patient has tested positive for C. diff again despite being on vancomycin therapy. Continuing PO vancomycin for now and considering a quick tapering of antibiotics, likely meropenem first, once blood cultures are available.
3. Yeast Infection in the Urine: The patient has a complicated GU history, including bladder rupture and neobladder drainage by suprapubic catheter and Foley catheter. Both catheters should be changed today, and a urine culture should be repeated.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has decreased from 34 to 25, which is his recent baseline."

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old man with a history of dementia, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), ruptured bladder requiring suprapubic catheter, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and previous Clostridium difficile infection. He presented with fever, rapid AFib, and sepsis. The patient is currently on vancomycin, meropenem, and oral vancomycin to cover MRSA, resistant gram-negative rods, and Clostridium difficile. He has been volume resuscitated, and a RUQ ultrasound was performed due to mildly elevated liver function tests on admission. A wound care consult has also been requested for a pressure ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's presentation with fever, rapid AFib, and sepsis suggests an ongoing infection. It is important to identify the source of infection and continue appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's AFib is not well-controlled, and there is a concern for rapid ventricular response. The plan includes continuing low-dose oral diltiazem and adding digoxin. If the AFib is not controlled with these medications, amiodarone may be considered.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which is improving. Close monitoring is recommended to assess any changes in his cognitive function.
4. Pressure Ulcer: The patient has a pressure ulcer that"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old man with a history of dementia, recurrent urinary tract infections, ruptured bladder requiring suprapubic catheter, atrial fibrillation, and prior C. diff infection. He presented with fever, rapid atrial fibrillation, sepsis, and possible sources of infection including GPCC in blood, C. diff positive, and yeast in urine. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.6Â°C (99.7Â°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 134/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, anticoagulants, and cardiac medications. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's current condition is somwhat worse, with worsening altered mental status and a history of seizures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, rapid atrial fibrillation, and leukocytosis suggests the possibility of sepsis. If left untreated or inadequately managed, sepsis can progress to organ dysfunction and potentially lead to septic shock.
2. C. diff infection: The patient's history of prior C. diff infection and current positive"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old man with a history of dementia, recurrent urinary tract infections, ruptured bladder requiring suprapubic catheter, atrial fibrillation, and previous Clostridium difficile infection. He presents with fever, rapid atrial fibrillation, and sepsis. The patient has an elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. He is not in acute distress and appears thin. Physical examination reveals normal breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to altered mental status.

24-hour events include IV diltiazem for increased heart rate, positive C. diff, blood culture from rehabilitation with Gram-positive cocci (GPCC), and wound care consult. Allergies are noted for amoxicillin, penicillins, Coumadin, oxycodone, megestrol acetate, Mirtazapine, and methylphenidate.

Vital signs show a maximum temperature of 37.6Â°C (99.7Â°F), current temperature of 36.7Â°C (98Â°F), heart rate of 104 bpm (range 93-132 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 134/60 mmHg to 142/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (range 18-35 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97%.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old man with a history of dementia, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), ruptured bladder requiring suprapubic catheter, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and previous Clostridium difficile infection. He presented with fever, rapid AF, and sepsis. The patient has multiple medical conditions including altered mental status, seizure disorder, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He is currently being treated for possible sources of infection such as GPCC in blood, C. diff positivity, and yeast in urine. The patient is also being monitored for glycemic control and has a PICC line, 20-gauge, and 18-gauge lines in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis suggests a possible infection, leading to sepsis. Prompt and appropriate management is crucial to prevent further complications and deterioration.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient's history of prior C. diff infection and current positivity indicate a risk for complications related to this infection, such as severe diarrhea, colitis, and potential need for colectomy.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's AFib with rapid ventricular response requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as heart failure, stroke, or thromboembolism.
4. Altered Mental Status: The"
