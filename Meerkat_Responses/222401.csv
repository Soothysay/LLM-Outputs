   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 87 y/o F CAD, CHF, HTN, sick sinus s/p pacer,
   severe AS who presents with acute respiratory distress.
   # Acute respiratory distress: Elevated WBC concerning for pneumonia,
   recieved ceftriaxone and levofloxacin in ED. Patchy infiltrates on CXR
   concerning for atypical pneumonia versus volume overload. BP > 200 on
   presentation suggesting patient could have acutely flashed secondary to
   diastolic dysfunction. Acute decompensation also concerning for MI
   (patient with known CAD disease and paced EKG makes acute changes
   difficult to intrepert on EKG). Less likely PE in setting of patchy
   infiltrates on CXR. For CHF exacerbation patient received 60 mg IV
   lasix however dropped pressure to 60 in the setting of propofo and
   patient's mod-severe AS makes her preload dependent and difficult to
   diuresis.
   - Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for CAP (no nursing home expsosure,
   prior MDR)
   - Send sputum culture and legionella antigen
   - Trend troponins
   - ECHO to eval progression of AS, systolic/diastolic dysfunction
   - Place a-line to monitor ABGs
   - Ultrasound CVP to eval respiratory variation and whether volume
   overloaded vs. hypovolemic -> CVP easily collapsable try 500 cc bolus
   # Hypotension: Patient with labile blood pressures ranging from hypo to
   hypertensive. Hypotensive most likely in setting of propofol, however
   lactate elevated 5.9 and acute kidney injury concerning for shock.
   - Stat lactate on arrival
   - Antibiotics as above for possible PNA leading to septic shock
   - Follow urine, blood for infection
   - ECHO and troponins to eval for cardiogenic shock
   - 500 cc bolus trial and attempt to decrease PEEP
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine increased to 1.2 from baseline 0.9. Concerning for
   shock, however adequate urine output.
   - Send urine lytes
   - 5OO cc bolus
   # CAD: Patient with known 3 vessel disease but no intervention. No
   history of chest pain, but difficult to interpert EKG in setting of
   v-pacing.
   - Trend troponins
   - Continue ASA, simvastatin
   # HTN: Labile blood pressure (see above).
   - Hold blood pressure medications (Lopressor, Clonidine) until follow
   for longer course
   - Place a-line for closer/more adequate monitoring
   # CHF: Acute respiratory distress concerning for acute exacerbation.
   - Hold Imdur in setting of labile blood pressure
   - Hold Lasix until able to assess volume status
   # Mod-Severe Aortic Stenosis: Patient increasing dyspnea prior to
   admission. No known history of chest pain or syncope.
   - ECHO to eval severity
   - Cautious diuresis due to preload dependence
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.
   # Rate: Patient with history of A Fib and sick sinus syndrome s/p PPM.
   - Continue Amiodarone 200 mg qd

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), sick sinus syndrome, and severe aortic stenosis. She presents with acute respiratory distress, elevated white blood cell count (WBC) concerning for pneumonia, and received ceftriaxone and levofloxacin in the emergency department. Patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray are concerning for atypical pneumonia versus volume overload. Her blood pressure was greater than 200 on presentation, suggesting she could have acutely flashed secondary to diastolic dysfunction. Acute decompensation is also concerning for myocardial infarction (MI) due to her known CAD disease and paced electrocardiogram (EKG), making acute changes difficult to interpret.

The patient received 60 mg IV lasix but dropped pressure to 60 in the setting of propofol and the patient's moderate-severe aortic stenosis makes her preload dependent and difficult to diurese. The assessment and plan include the following:

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, sick sinus syndrome with a pacemaker, and severe aortic stenosis. She presented with acute respiratory distress and elevated white blood cell count, suggesting pneumonia. She also had high blood pressure on presentation, which could be due to diastolic dysfunction or acute flash pulmonary edema. There are concerns about a possible myocardial infarction, but interpretation of the EKG is challenging due to the paced rhythm. Less likely is pulmonary embolism given the patchy infiltrates on the chest X-ray. The patient received IV lasix for congestive heart failure exacerbation, but her blood pressure dropped. 

The assessment and plan include treatment for acute respiratory distress with ceftriaxone and azithromycin, a bronchial wash for sputum culture, monitoring troponin levels, and an echocardiogram to evaluate the progression of aortic stenosis and systolic/diastolic dysfunction. An arterial line is also placed to monitor arterial blood gases. An ultrasound central venous pressure (CVP) is performed to evaluate for respiratory variation and determine if the patient is volume overloaded or hypovolemic. 

The patient's hypertension is being managed with low-dose captopril and diuresis. There are concerns about hypotension/hypertension and the possibility of septic shock, so antibiotics have been"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 87 y/o F CAD, CHF, HTN, sick sinus s/p pacer,
   severe AS who presents with acute respiratory distress.
   # Acute respiratory distress:  Pt
s respiratory status much improved
   now successfully extubated. Given echo findings, hx of progressive AS,
   and episodes of SBP>200 while in hospital suspect that flash pulmonary
   edema was most likely etiology of acute respiratory decompensation. Pt
   still seeming volume overloaded on exam.  Pt has been ruled out for
   myocardial infarction. PNA still in differential although less likely
   as Pt has been afebrile and without leukocytosis
   - diurese with 80 PO Lasix X1 as pt still volume overloaded on exam
   - Can d/c Ceftriaxone and Azithro as Pt not appearing actively
   infected, no fever, no leukocytosis, all cx to date negative
   - Would leave d/c a-line after diuresis w/ lasix
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt hypertensive in per-extubation in setting, briefly
   on nitro gtt, normotensive now
   - captopril titrated up to 25 mg TID yesterday
   - hold on home clonidine and lopressor for now
   - restart ativan 0.25 q8 prn
   - diuresis as above
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Patient with labile blood pressures ranging
   from hypo to hypertensive. Hypotensive most likely in setting of
   propofol, however lactate elevated 5.9 and acute kidney injury
   concerning for shock.
   - Antibiotics as above for possible PNA leading to septic shock
   - Follow urine, blood for infection
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine increased to 1.2 from baseline 0.9.
   - Has been 0.9 over past 2 days
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # CAD: Patient with known 3 vessel disease but no intervention. No
   history of chest pain, but difficult to interpert EKG in setting of
   v-pacing.
   - Pt has been ruled out for MI
   - Continue ASA, simvastatin
   # HTN: Labile blood pressure (see above).
   - Continuing Captopril, 25 mg TID
   - Continuing Imdur, 60 mg qD
   - Can d/c a-line after diuresis
   .
   # CHF: Acute respiratory distress concerning for acute exacerbation.
   - Continuing Imdur in setting of labile blood pressure
   - Continue Lasix as above
   - Continuing captopril
   # Mod-Severe Aortic Stenosis: Patient increasing dyspnea prior to
   admission. No known history of chest pain or syncope.
   - Cautious diuresis due to preload dependence
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.
   # Rate: Patient with history of A Fib and sick sinus syndrome s/p PPM.
   - Continue Amiodarone 200 mg qd
   # FEN:
   -replete electrolytes,
   -will start regular diet
   -stop famotidine
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals, R radial a-line
   -d/c a-line before goes to floor

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 87 y/o F CAD, CHF, HTN, sick sinus s/p pacer,
   severe AS who presents with acute respiratory distress.
   # Acute respiratory distress: Elevated WBC concerning for pneumonia,
   recieved ceftriaxone and levofloxacin in ED. Patchy infiltrates on CXR
   concerning for atypical pneumonia versus volume overload. BP > 200 on
   presentation suggesting patient could have acutely flashed secondary to
   diastolic dysfunction. Acute decompensation also concerning for MI
   (patient with known CAD disease and paced EKG makes acute changes
   difficult to intrepert on EKG). Less likely PE in setting of patchy
   infiltrates on CXR. For CHF exacerbation patient received 60 mg IV
   lasix however dropped pressure to 60 in the setting of propofo and
   patient's mod-severe AS makes her preload dependent and difficult to
   diuresis.
   - diurese with 60 IV Lasix once more prior to extubation
   - Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for CAP (no nursing home expsosure,
   prior MDR)
   - Bronchial wash (respiratory) for sputum culture and legionella
   antigen
   - Trend troponins
   - ECHO to eval progression of AS, systolic/diastolic dysfunction
   - Place a-line to monitor ABGs
   - Ultrasound CVP to eval respiratory variation and whether volume
   overloaded vs. hypovolemic -> CVP easily collapsable try 500 cc bolus
   # Hypertension: increasingly hypertensive
   - low dose captopril (12.5 TID)
   - diuresis as above
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Patient with labile blood pressures ranging
   from hypo to hypertensive. Hypotensive most likely in setting of
   propofol, however lactate elevated 5.9 and acute kidney injury
   concerning for shock.
   - Antibiotics as above for possible PNA leading to septic shock
   - Follow urine, blood for infection
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine increased to 1.2 from baseline 0.9. Concerning for
   shock, however adequate urine output.
   - Send urine lytes
   - 5OO cc bolus
   # CAD: Patient with known 3 vessel disease but no intervention. No
   history of chest pain, but difficult to interpert EKG in setting of
   v-pacing.
   - Trend troponins
   - Continue ASA, simvastatin
   # HTN: Labile blood pressure (see above).
   - Hold blood pressure medications (Lopressor, Clonidine) until follow
   for longer course
   - Place a-line for closer/more adequate monitoring
   # CHF: Acute respiratory distress concerning for acute exacerbation.
   - Hold Imdur in setting of labile blood pressure
   - Restart Lasix as above
   - Starting captopril
   # Mod-Severe Aortic Stenosis: Patient increasing dyspnea prior to
   admission. No known history of chest pain or syncope.
   - ECHO to eval severity
   - Cautious diuresis due to preload dependence
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.
   # Rate: Patient with history of A Fib and sick sinus syndrome s/p PPM.
   - Continue Amiodarone 200 mg qd

   Disposition:
","The patient is an elderly female with a history of chronic conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), sick sinus syndrome, and moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis (AS). She presented with acute respiratory distress and was found to have elevated white blood cell count, suggesting possible pneumonia. The patient received antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and bronchial washes were obtained for sputum culture and legionella antigen. 

The patient's blood pressure has been labile, ranging from hypotension to hypertension. This could be related to her acute exacerbation of CHF, acute decompensation, or possibly myocardial infarction (MI). Due to the patient's known CAD and paced EKG, it is difficult to interpret acute changes on the EKG. Troponins are being trended, and an echocardiogram (ECHO) will be performed to evaluate the progression of AS, systolic/diastolic dysfunction, and guide diuresis.

The patient's kidney function has shown some deterioration, with an increase in creatinine from baseline. However, she has maintained adequate urine output. Urine electrolytes and blood cultures are being sent, and a 500 cc bolus has been given.

The patient's medications include captopril, ASA, simvastatin, levothyroxine, amiodarone, and subcutaneous heparin for prophyl"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 87 y/o F CAD, CHF, HTN, sick sinus s/p pacer,
   severe AS who presents with acute respiratory distress.
   # Acute respiratory distress:  Pt
s respiratory status much improved,
   successfully extubated. Given echo findings, hx of progressive AS, and
   episodes of SBP>200 while in hospital suspect that flash pulmonary
   edema was most likely etiology of acute respiratory decompensation. Pt
   still seeming volume overloaded on exam.  Pt has been ruled out for
   myocardial infarction. PNA still in differential although less likely
   as Pt has been afebrile and without leukocytosis
    - diurese with 60 IV Lasix X1 as Pt still volume overloaded on exam
   - Can d/c Ceftriaxone and Azithro as Pt not appearing actively
   infected, no fever, no leukocytosis, all cx to date negative
   - Would leave d/c a-line after diuresis w/ lasix
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt hypertensive in per-extubation in setting, briefly
   on nitro gtt, normotensive now
   - Captopril titrated up to 25 mg TID yesterday
   - diuresis as above
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Patient with labile blood pressures ranging
   from hypo to hypertensive. Hypotensive most likely in setting of
   propofol, however lactate elevated 5.9 and acute kidney injury
   concerning for shock.
   - Antibiotics as above for possible PNA leading to septic shock
   - Follow urine, blood for infection
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine increased to 1.2 from baseline 0.9.
   -Has been 0.9 over past 2 days
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # CAD: Patient with known 3 vessel disease but no intervention. No
   history of chest pain, but difficult to interpert EKG in setting of
   v-pacing.
   - Pt has been ruled out for MI
   - Continue ASA, simvastatin
   # HTN: Labile blood pressure (see above).
   - Continuing Captopril, 25 mg TID
   - Continuing Imdur, 60 mg qD
   - Can d/c a-line after diuresis
   .
   # CHF: Acute respiratory distress concerning for acute exacerbation.
   - Continuing Imdur in setting of labile blood pressure
   - Continue Lasix as above
   - Continuing captopril
   # Mod-Severe Aortic Stenosis: Patient increasing dyspnea prior to
   admission. No known history of chest pain or syncope.
   - Cautious diuresis due to preload dependence
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.
   # Rate: Patient with history of A Fib and sick sinus syndrome s/p PPM.
   - Continue Amiodarone 200 mg qd
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), sick sinus syndrome post pacemaker placement, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and hypothyroidism. She presents with acute respiratory distress, which has improved after being extubated. The patient is still volume overloaded on examination. She has been ruled out for myocardial infarction and pneumonia, but remains under consideration for possible pulmonary edema. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash pulmonary edema: Given the patient's history of severe AS, episodes of high blood pressure while in the hospital, and current symptoms, flash pulmonary edema is a possible etiology of acute respiratory decompensation. 
2. Volume overload: The patient appears to be volume overloaded on examination, which could lead to further respiratory distress and complications.
3. Hypertension: The patient experienced high blood pressure during the peri-extubation period and has a history of HTN. It is important to continue monitoring and managing her blood pressure.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated lactate levels and increased creatinine suggest a possible acute kidney injury. This should be closely monitored and treated accordingly.
5. Possible septic shock: Antibiotics have been started for possible pneumonia leading to septic shock. The patient's labile blood pressures and elevated lactate levels are concerning for this condition.
