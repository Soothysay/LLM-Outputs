","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of COPD and ulcerative colitis who was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She required intubation in the emergency department. The patient has been sedated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40% and a respiratory rate (RR) set at 20 breaths per minute. Her blood pressure is within normal limits, but her heart rate is slightly elevated. The patient has pinpoint pupils, dry mucous membranes, and a jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 7 with a flat head-of-bed position at 30 degrees. There are rhonchi heard in the left upper lung field, and her abdomen is soft and mildly distended. The patient also has a non-healing ulcer with a necrotic center on her right lateral leg. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, hypernatremia, thrombocytosis, anemia, and hyperbicarbonatemia. The patient's current medications include levaquin, prednisone, atrovent MDI, albuterol MDI, flovent, propofol, versed, and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of rhonchi in the left upper lung field may indicate a possible pneumonia. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and obtaining"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ulcerative colitis who was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's allergies include penicillins, sulfa, Asacol, Rowasa, Percocet, and Percodan. She has received one dose of solumedrol in the ED but is not bronchospastic on examination, so systemic steroids will be withheld. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 105/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing due to excess carbon dioxide in her bloodstream. This condition can worsen if the ventilator settings are not adjusted appropriately or if there is a respiratory infection.
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient's pre-existing COPD may worsen due to infection or other factors, leading to increased respiratory distress.
3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis with a suspected bacterial source, possibly pulmonary. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures are pending to identify the specific infection.
4. Dehydration: The patient is volume depleted, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of COPD and ulcerative colitis who presented to the ICU with respiratory distress and altered mental status. She was intubated in the emergency department for hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely due to a COPD exacerbation. The patient's ABG results show baseline CO2 retention. She requires minimal sedation on the ventilator and a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) is planned to determine the level of support needed. Medications include levaquin, prednisone, atrovent MDI, albuterol MDI, flovent, and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure - the patient's current condition of respiratory distress and altered mental status is likely due to hypercarbic respiratory failure caused by a COPD exacerbation.
2. Hypernatremia - the patient has hypernatremia in the setting of volume depletion, with a calculated free water deficit of approximately 850 mL. This condition may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hyperkalemia - the patient's potassium level is elevated at 5.8 mEq/L, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Thrombocytosis - the patient has a high platelet count, which may be reactive to infection, iron deficiency anemia, or inflammatory bowel disease.

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), currently experiencing respiratory distress and altered mental status. She was intubated in the emergency department for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The most likely cause of her current condition is a COPD exacerbation, possibly triggered by a viral upper respiratory infection (URI). Other potential causes, such as bacterial pneumonia or fluid overload, have been ruled out based on the chest X-ray (CXR). The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate baseline CO2 retention.

The patient's sedation requirement is minimal, and a pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial is being considered to determine the level of support needed. Low-dose ativan has been given for sedation, as propofol and versed were stopped due to a drop in blood pressure. Levofloxacin will continue while awaiting culture data, and a week-long taper of prednisone 40 mg orally will begin today. The patient is also prescribed atrovent MDI, albuterol MDI, flovent [Hospital1], and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) as an outpatient. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be done for bilateral assessment of cardiac function.

Regarding the patient's electrolyte imbalances, she has hypernatremia in the setting of volume depletion, with a free water deficit estimated at around"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of COPD and ulcerative colitis admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was intubated in the emergency department and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient has experienced respiratory distress and altered mental status, which is suspected to be due to hypercarbia. She is currently sedated with midazolam (versed) and has had her NG tube pulled out. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure - The patient's COPD exacerbation, possibly triggered by a viral upper respiratory infection, has resulted in increased carbon dioxide levels in her blood. This can lead to respiratory acidosis and further deterioration of mental status.
2. Infection - The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures are pending. The presence of C. difficile colitis and necrotic leg ulcer suggests a possible infection.
3. Altered mental status - The patient's baseline mild dementia could contribute to her current altered mental status. Other potential causes include hypercarbia, infection, or cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Delirium is a common complication in critically ill patients.
4. Fluid imbalance - The patient is euvolemic but has a history of volume depletion. She has hypernatremia, which needs to be managed carefully to avoid complications such as dehydration or fluid overload.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of COPD and ulcerative colitis.
- She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and change in mental status.
- The patient has been intubated and sedated.
- She has been on ventilator support with a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.
- Her oxygen saturation (SpO2) is maintained at 99%.
- The patient has been receiving midazolam (versed) and haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation.
- She has a central line for fluid administration and a urinary catheter.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/44 mmHg to 89/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.8 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 107 mEq/L, and thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 531 K/uL.
- The patient has an elevated serum creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL and a blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL.
- The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.
- Microbiology tests are pending for blood cultures and sputum gram stain.
- The patient's recent medical history includes a urinary tract infection (UTI), presumed pneumonia (PNA), and recent Clostridium difficile colitis.
- She has been prescribed levofloxacin (Levaquin) for the UTI and vancomycin for the C. difficile colitis.
- The patient's current medications include prednisone, ipratropium bromide/albuterol (Atrovent/Albuterol) metered-dose inhalers, fluticasone propionate (Flovent) inhaler, and balsalazide and mesalamine for ulcerative colitis.
- The patient has a free water deficit of approximately 1 L and is being managed for hypernatremia.
- She also has anemia and thrombocytosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function if not properly managed.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, elevated CRP, and positive sputum gram stain for gram-negative rods, suggesting a possible respiratory infection. UTI and C. difficile colitis are also present, indicating multiple sites of infection.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) who has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors.

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has an increased level of carbon dioxide in her blood due to inadequate ventilation. This can lead to respiratory acidosis and further compromise her respiratory function.

2. Respiratory infection: The patient has a positive sputum gram stain for gram-negative rods, indicating a possible respiratory infection. This could contribute to her respiratory distress and hypoxia.

3. Delirium and agitation: The patient exhibits alternating delirium and agitation, making it difficult to assess her respiratory status accurately. This can be a result of metabolic encephalopathy, infection, or other factors.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high levels of sodium in her blood, which may be due to volume depletion. This condition needs to be managed carefully to avoid complications.

5. Recent C. difficile colitis: Although the patient's C. difficile infection appears to have resolved, she is still receiving vancomycin for an additional four weeks, particularly while on antibiotic therapy.

6. Ulcerative colitis: The patient's UC seems to be in a quiescent state, but she has a necrotic leg ulcer that resembles pyoderma"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 86 y/o F with COPD and UC a/w hypoxia and change in mental status
   in the setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of
   resp infection.
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure - COPD exacerbation most likely in the
   setting of viral URI vs. bacterial PNA. GNR on sputum GS may reflect
   colonization. Less likely volume overload due to CHF as volume depleted
   on admission, CXR did not show pulm edema, and LV function normal by
   echo [**2156-5-25**]. Clinically stable, afebrile without leukocytosis.
   Alternating delirium/agitation and sedation makes it difficult to
   assess respiratory status.  Did not tolerate trial of PSV yesterday
   (caused tachycardia and HTN)
   - Cont full support on current settings VC 350/40/18/5; RSBI this
   morning inadequate due to apnea (on propofol).
   - CXR [**2156-5-28**]: final report pending; appears to have new LLL
   consolidation concerning for VAP.  Consolidation less evident on repeat
   cxr.
   - continue abx as below
   - continue propofol gtt to keep sedated while benzos clear from system
   -continue week-long taper of prednisone; day 2 of 30 mg, may taper to
   20 tomorrow
   -atrovent MDI
   -albuterol MDI
   -flovent [**Hospital1 **]
   Possible VAP:
   -          CXR [**2156-5-28**]: final report pending; appears to have new LLL
   consolidation concerning for VAP.  However, consolidation less evident
   on repeat cxr.
   -          Repeat sputum and blood cultures.
   -          Obtain Chest CT today to confirm VAP
   -          Begin empiric treatment with meropenem, vanco and continue
   levaquin
   -          Inquire about penicillin allergy
           -      order PICC line
   #Altered Mental Status -  toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**12-20**] infection
   and/or drug-induced by benzos and steroids; hypercarbia unlikely
   playing a prominent role as significant degree of CO2 retention at
   b/l.  Pt is more responsive this afternoon.  Makes eye contact answers
   yes/no questions appropriately.

   .
   #Thrombocytosis - chronic, dating back to [**12-26**]; likely reactive in the
   setting of infection, Fe-deficiency anemia and/or IBD
   -no treatment at this time, as no s/sx bleeding or thrombosis
   .
   #Anemia - b/l 35-38%; Hct stable throughout admission, no s/sx bleeding
   -follow daily
   -x-fuse for Hct < 21%

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of COPD and ulcerative colitis who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient's current condition is stable, with improved mental status but still experiencing alternating delirium and agitation due to sedation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a VC of 350/40/18/5 and has shown inadequate respiratory status during spontaneous breathing trials. A chest X-ray suggests new left lower lobe consolidation, raising concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. The patient has several medical complications including hypercarbic respiratory failure, possible VAP, altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI), hypernatremia, recent Clostridium difficile colitis, ulcerative colitis, thrombocytosis, anemia, and fever/neutropenia. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is expected to remain in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of COPD and ulcerative colitis who presented with hypoxia and change in mental status. She was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of respiratory infection. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation support due to her altered mental status and inability to tolerate spontaneous breathing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation in the setting of viral URI or bacterial PNA may lead to worsening respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP, which can be caused by bacteria such as E. coli.
3. Delirium/Agitation: The patient's alternating delirium and agitation make it difficult to assess respiratory status and may require adjustment of sedation medications.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to volume depletion. This condition needs to be closely monitored and managed to avoid complications like seizures or neurological damage.
5. Thrombocytosis: The patient has chronic thrombocytosis, which may be reactive in the setting of infection, iron-deficiency anemia, and/or inflammatory bowel disease. Regular monitoring is recommended to prevent bleeding complications.
6. Anemia: The patient has biconcave anemia with a stable H"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 86 y/o F with COPD and UC a/w hypoxia and change in mental status
   in the setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of
   resp infection.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure - COPD exacerbation most likely in the
   setting of viral URI vs. bacterial PNA. GNR on sputum GS may reflect
   colonization. Less likely volume overload due to CHF as volume depleted
   on admission, CXR did not show pulm edema, and LV function normal by
   echo [**5-25**]. Clinically stable, afebrile without leukocytosis. Alternating
   delirium/agitation and sedation makes it difficult to assess
   respiratory status. Will likely not tolerate PSV due to mental status

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of COPD and ulcerative colitis who presented with hypoxia and change in mental status. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of urinary tract infection (UTI) and presumed pneumonia (PNA), for which she is being treated with antibiotics. She also has hypernatremia, likely due to volume depletion, and a history of Clostridium difficile colitis, which appears to have resolved. She is being continued on oral vancomycin for four weeks, particularly while on antibiotics. 

The patient has a chronic thrombocytosis, likely reactive to infection, iron-deficiency anemia, and inflammatory bowel disease. She also has anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, and her platelet count is within normal range. 

The patient's mental status has been fluctuating between delirium and agitation on one hand, and sedation on the other. This makes it difficult to assess her respiratory status. Propofol has been started to keep her sedated while benzodiazepines clear from her system, so that her mental status can be reassessed. 

The patient's respiratory support includes a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of COPD and ulcerative colitis. She presented with respiratory distress, hypoxia, and change in mental status. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a VC of 350/40/18/5. She is also receiving propofol for sedation. 

The patient has been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure, most likely due to a COPD exacerbation. There is a possibility of a viral upper respiratory infection or bacterial pneumonia. The sputum culture grew a Gram-negative rod, which may indicate colonization rather than an active infection. The patient's urine culture showed an abundance of E. coli. 

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.8 thousand/mm3, an elevated hematocrit level of 37.1%, and a platelet count of 555 thousand/mm3. Other lab values include a slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen level, creatinine level, lactate level, calcium level, and magnesium level. The patient's glucose levels have been relatively stable. 

The patient's condition is complicated by altered mental status, possibly due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from medications and infection. The patient is also experiencing hypernatremia and volume depletion, likely resulting from her previous gastrointestinal issues. 

The patient has a history of recent Clostridium difficile colitis,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of COPD and ulcerative colitis. She presented with respiratory distress and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing alternating delirium and agitation, making it difficult to assess her respiratory status. She requires full ventilator support due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly exacerbated by a respiratory infection.

The patient has a history of recent Clostridium difficile colitis, which appears to have resolved. She also has ulcerative colitis, although currently in a quiescent state. There are concerns about her mental status, which may be due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, possibly induced by benzodiazepines and steroids. The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to volume depletion, and anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL. Thrombocytosis is also present.

The patient is on multiple medications including propofol, heparin, levofloxacin, vancomycin, prednisone, atrovent MDI, albuterol MDI, and flovent. The plan is to continue these medications and closely monitor the patient's condition. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o F with COPD and UC a/w hypoxia and change in mental status in
   the setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of resp
   infection.
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure - COPD exacerbation most likely in the
   setting of viral URI vs. bacterial PNA. GNR on sputum GS may reflect
   colonization. Less likely volume overload due to CHF as volume depleted
   on admission, CXR did not show pulm edema, and LV function normal by
   echo [**2156-5-25**]. Clinically stable, afebrile without leukocytosis.
   Alternating delirium/agitation and sedation makes it difficult to
   assess respiratory status.  Did not tolerate trial of PSV yesterday
   (caused tachycardia and HTN)
   - Cont full support on current settings VC 350/40/18/5; RSBI this
   morning inadequate due to apnea (on propofol).
   - CXR [**2156-5-28**]: final report pending; appears to have new LLL
   consolidation concerning for VAP.  Consolidation less evident on repeat
   cxr.

   on repeat cxr.
   -          Repeat sputum and blood cultures.
   -          Obtain Chest CT today to confirm VAP
   -          Begin empiric treatment with meropenem, vanco and continue

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of COPD and ulcerative colitis who is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient's main issues include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to a COPD exacerbation possibly triggered by a viral upper respiratory infection or bacterial pneumonia. There is also a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits delirium and agitation, making it difficult to assess respiratory status. This could be due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy caused by infection and/or drug-induced effects of benzodiazepines and steroids.

3. Possible VAP: The patient's chest X-ray shows new left lower lobe consolidation, which is concerning for VAP. However, the consolidation is less evident on repeat X-ray. Blood and sputum cultures are pending, and a chest CT will be ordered to confirm VAP. Empiric treatment with meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin will be initiated.

4. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection, and broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued while awaiting speciation/sensitivities.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, likely due to volume depletion. Free water deficit is estimated to be around 1 liter, and efforts will be made"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o F with COPD and UC a/w hypoxia and change in mental status in
   the setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of resp
   infection.
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure - COPD exacerbation most likely in the
   setting of viral URI vs. bacterial PNA.  Less likely volume overload
   due to CHF as volume depleted on admission, CXR did not show pulm
   edema, and LV function normal by echo [**2156-5-25**]. Clinically stable,
   afebrile without leukocytosis. Sedation improved with propofol.   RSBI
   today not favorable for extubation.
   - Cont full support on current settings VC 350/40/18/5; RSBI this
   morning inadequate due to apnea (on propofol).
   - obtain CXR tomorrow to further eval L CP angle
 radiologist did not
   feel it was a PNA on CXR.
   -continue abx as below
   - continue propofol gtt to keep sedated while benzos clear from system
   -continue week-long taper of prednisone taper to 20mg PO today.
   Continue for 1 more days, then down to 10mg.

   -Consider SBT tomorrow morning and possible extubation when daughter is
   present.  Check 5 pm lytes and consider lasix 10 mg IV to help diuresis
   of pos fluid balance.
   Possible VAP:
   -          CT scan was less concern ing for VAP
   -          f-up re: blood and sputum cx.
   -          Continue empiric tx with meropenem (day 3), vanco (day 6)
   and continue levaquin (day [**4-24**]) for H. flu cov'g
   -          Inquire about penicillin allergy
   #Altered Mental Status -  toxic/metabolic encephalopathy [**12-20**] infection
   and/or drug-induced by benzos and steroids; hypercarbia unlikely
   playing a prominent role as significant degree of CO2 retention at

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of COPD and ulcerative colitis. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia and change in mental status, likely due to hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of respiratory infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support with a VC of 350/40/18/5, indicating a controlled ventilation mode with a set tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, inspiratory pressure of 40 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/55 to 147/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on FiO2 of 35%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 14.8 g/dL, decreased platelet count of 460 K/uL, normal creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, and elevated potassium level of 5.3 mEq/L. Other lab results include elevated troponin-T level of 0.01 ng/mL"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of COPD and ulcerative colitis who presented with hypoxia and change in mental status. She was diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a suspected COPD exacerbation, possibly caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support and is clinically stable. Sedation has been improved with propofol. RSBI (Respiratory System Impairment Score) is not favorable for extubation at this time. The patient's current medications include antibiotics (meropenem, vancomycin, levofloxacin), steroids (prednisone taper), bronchodilators (Atrovent MDI, albuterol MDI, flovent), and others. The plan is to continue supportive care, monitor for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and consider a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) tomorrow morning for potential extubation. The patient also has a history of C. difficile colitis, ulcerative colitis, thrombocytosis, anemia, and is being treated for presumed urinary tract infection (UTI). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team is monitoring for this complication and has initiated appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy.
2. Deep vein thrombosis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The patient presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and was intubated for a change in mental status. She is now extubated and continues to be in the ICU.

The patient's medical conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure (resolved), COPD exacerbation, altered mental status (possibly due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, infection, and/or drug-induced by benzos and steroids), urinary tract infection (UTI), hypernatremia (resolved), recent Clostridium difficile colitis (appears to have resolved), quiescent ulcerative colitis, thrombocytosis, anemia, and iron deficiency anemia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 106/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 50% face tent. The patient's physical examination reveals scattered rhonchi and monophonic wheeze in the right chest anteriorly, with no rales. Her abdominal examination is unremarkable, and her extremities are warm, dry, and without edema.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 460 K/u"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). She presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of drug-induced exacerbation of COPD and a respiratory infection. The patient was intubated for a change in mental status but has now been successfully extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This is a resolved condition that occurred due to the combination of drug-induced COPD exacerbation and respiratory infection. The patient has been extubated, indicating improvement in her respiratory status.
2. Drug-induced COPD exacerbation: The patient may experience further exacerbation of her COPD due to the use of certain medications. It is recommended to change bronchodilators to nebs and avoid narcotics, which can cause respiratory depression.
3. Toxic-metabolic and/or drug-induced delirium: The patient appears to be resolving from acute mental status changes (AMS), but there is a possibility of recurrent agitation and delirium. It is advised to avoid benzodiazepines and narcotics, and use low-dose haloperidol or risperidone as needed.
4. E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has an ongoing E. coli UTI, and sensitivities are available. It is recommended to continue meropenem until day 23.
5. Recent Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient appears to have resolved her recent C. difficile colitis. It is recommended to continue oral vancomycin for four weeks, especially while on antibiotics, and continue for two weeks after the last dose of antibiotics.
6. Ulcerative colitis: The patient's UC is apparently in a quiescent state, but a necrotic leg ulcer looks like pyoderma gangrenosum. It is advised to continue balsalazide and mesalamine, and consult with Dr. [Last Name] (Title) 3515.
7. Fluid and electrolyte balance: The patient requires gentle diuresis to optimize respiratory status and maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. The goal is to maintain a total fluid intake of 2,341 mL and output of 2,280 mL, with a balance of 61 mL.
8. Nutrition: The patient is on ProBalance (full) at a rate of 35 mL/hour.
9. Glycemic control: Regular insulin sliding scale is used for glycemic control.
10. Prophylaxis: The patient is on prophylactic SQ UF heparin for DVT and stress ulcer PPI. There is no systemic anticoagulation currently.
11. VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia): The chest CT lowers the suspicion for VAP.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note."

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). She was admitted to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of a respiratory infection. She was intubated for a change in mental status but is now extubated.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 106/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 50% on face tent. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows sinus bradycardia.

The patient has received various medications including lasix, propofol, furosemide, heparin sodium, and different antibiotics. She also has ongoing infusions of propofol and has had previous infusions of vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (460 K/uL) and a slightly low platelet count (460 K/uL). Her electrolytes are within normal range, except for hypernatremia which has resolved. Her kidney function is normal.

The patient's assessment and plan include resolving hypercarbic respiratory failure, COPD exacerbation, urinary tract infection (UTI), hypernatremia, recent Clostrid"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), who was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of a respiratory infection. She was intubated due to a change in mental status and subsequently extubated today. The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli, which is being treated with meropenem. Her recent C. difficile colitis appears to have resolved, and her ulcerative colitis is currently in a quiescent state. She also has a necrotic leg ulcer that may be pyoderma gangrenosum. The patient's condition is improving, with her AMS (acute mental status) appearing at or near baseline.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure - The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has since resolved after extubation. However, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if she develops another respiratory infection or exacerbation of her COPD.
2. COPD exacerbation - The patient's history of COPD puts her at risk for exacerbations, especially in the setting of viral or bacterial respiratory infections. This could lead to worsening respiratory status and potential need for re-intubation.
3. UTI - The patient has an ongoing E. coli UTI, which needs to be monitored for resolution and potential complications such as"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) who presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of a respiratory infection. She was intubated for a change in mental status but has now been extubated. The patient's allergies include penicillins, sulfa, Asacol, Rowasa, Percocet, and Percodan. She received various antibiotics, including levofloxacin, meropenem, and vancomycin. Her vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and a fever. The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds, non-labored breathing on high-flow nasal cannula, and warm extremities. Her laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and low glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and the current symptoms of respiratory failure suggest the possibility of a COPD exacerbation. This could be due to a viral or bacterial infection.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Although a chest CT lowers the suspicion for VAP, it cannot be completely ruled out since the patient was intubated for a change in mental status.
3. Delirium/Acute Mental"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo female with COPD and admitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure now with successful extubation.  This represents progress in
   the setting of improved volume status and improved mental status
   contributing to successful extubation.
   Respiratory Failure-
   Will need pulmonary toiled, Oob to chair and chest PT to expand lung
   volumes and clear the secretions
   If possible ambulation would be optimal and would get PT involved.
   Mental status much improved and is likely secondary to improved
   infectious insults.
   Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease--with acute exacerbation
   -Prednisone Taper
   -Flovent and bronchodilators

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of COPD who was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has shown progress in her condition, including successful extubation and improved mental status. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/53 mmHg to 167/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,462 mL, including 998 mL through IV fluids, and a total output of 2,965 mL, including 545 mL of urine output. 

The patient is currently on several medications, including Diltiazem, morphine sulfate, fentanyl, furosemide (Lasix), and heparin sodium. The lab results indicate normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, blood glucose, and electrolytes. However, the patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated at 0.6 mg/dL. The imaging shows that the PICC line is in reasonable position, with mild pulmonary infiltrates observed.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with COPD who has made progress in her condition. She was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure but has now been successfully extubated. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with COPD and ulcerative colitis admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was intubated in the emergency department and later extubated successfully. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/53 mmHg to 166/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation on nasal cannula. The patient has decreased breath sounds bilaterally with moderate effort. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. The patient has an active urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, possibly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing, and is currently being treated with meropenem. She also has a history of recent Clostridium difficile colitis, which appears to have resolved, and ulcerative colitis that seems to be in a quiescent state. The patient's tachycardia may be related to anxiety and agitation, for which she is being treated with zyprexa and trazodone. Her code status is DNR/DNI with no intubation. The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU for the day and consider transferring to the floor tomorrow if stable."

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) who presented with hypoxia and change in mental status. She was intubated in the emergency department for hypercarbic respiratory failure, most likely due to a COPD exacerbation. The patient has been extubated and is doing well on nasal cannula oxygen. She has multiple medical complications including urinary tract infection (UTI), tachycardia, anxiety/agitation, recent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, and a necrotic leg ulcer consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This condition occurs when there is an accumulation of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, leading to respiratory acidosis. It can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD can worsen during the course of her hospital stay, leading to increased shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing.
3. UTI: The patient has an identified E. coli infection, which may progress to a more severe infection if not appropriately managed with antibiotics.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, and she is at risk of developing arrhythmias or cardiac complications if her heart rate remains uncontrolled.
5. Anxiety/Agitation:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient experienced agitation, tachycardia, and hypertension overnight, converting to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response early this morning. 

The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, sulfa, Asacol (mesalamine), Rowasa (rectal mesalamine), Percocet (oral oxycodone HCl/acetaminophen), and Percodan (oral oxycodone HCl/aspirin). 

The patient received antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and meropenem. They are also on various infusions, such as heparin sodium for prophylaxis, furosemide (Lasix), metoprolol, and diltiazem. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.2°C (95.4°F), heart rate of 122 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 122/80 to 177/128 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation on high-flow neb at 42%. 

The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examinations were not assessed.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 86 y/o F with COPD and UC a/w hypoxia and change in mental status,
   intubated in the ED for hypercarbic respiratory failure.   Currently
   extubated but respiratory distress has returned.
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure - COPD exacerbation most likely in the
   setting of viral URI, less likely bacterial pneumonia or fluid overload
   based on CXR.
   - extubated [**2156-5-30**]; increased O2 demand from 3L NC to 60% facemask
   overnight
   - trial of BiPAP during acute respiratory distress this morning with
   resulting hypotension and minimal improvement in mental status.  Will
   discuss with daughter wishes of continuing BiPAP therapy.
   -continue atrovent MDI
   -continue albuterol MDI
   -continue flovent [**Hospital1 **]
   - ECHO [**2156-5-25**]: moderate pulmonary artery systolic HTN; mild MR; LVEF
   >55%
   -will cont. levaquin while awaiting cultures
   -continue week-long taper of prednisone 2O po
   - for possible pulmonary edema continue low dose lasix prn
   .
   # UTI:
   - Urine Cx: E.coli (possible ESBL)
   - currently on meropenem; consider switching to alternative abx to
   narrow coverage, keeping in mind PCN allergy (hives).
   # Tachycardia:
   EKG: sinus tach with increased APCs and VPCs yesterday converting to
   A-fib with RVR this morning and converting back to sinus rhythm this
   morning during rounds.
   Attempted rate control this morning with multiple doses of metoprolol
   po and IV without success.
   Will hold metoprolol in face of worsening COPD exacerbation.
   Consider diltiazem for rate control if A-fib with RVR returns.
   Continue telemetry.
   #Anxiety/Agitation: persists and may be contributing factor to
   tachycardia
   Because of prior paradoxical effects of benzos will avoid benzos.  Use
   zyprexa 5mg q8h prn agitation.  [**Month (only) 60**] use trazadone qhs prn if difficulty
   sleeping.
   #Recent C.diff colitis - appears to have resolved
   -cont. PO vanco x 4 wks (start date was [**2156-5-11**] per rehab records);
   continue vanc 2 wks post last abx treatment
   #Ulcerative Colitis- apparently quiescent disease, although necrotic
   leg ulcer looks like pyoderma gangrenosum
   -cont. balsalazide and mesalamine
   #F/E/N
 euvolemic by exam
   - started regular diet yesterday but will hold today (must consider

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of COPD and ulcerative colitis who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and change in mental status. She was intubated in the ED for hypercarbic respiratory failure and currently remains extubated. The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, agitation, hypertension, and tachycardia. She has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E.coli, which may be an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producer. The patient has a history of anxiety, agitation, recent Clostridium difficile (C.diff) colitis, and quiescent ulcerative colitis. She has been treated with various antibiotics and medications for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD exacerbation may lead to worsening respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. UTI: The UTI caused by E.coli (possible ESBL) needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications.
3. Agitation and anxiety: The patient's agitation and anxiety can contribute to tachycardia and potentially worsen her respiratory status.
4. Hypotension: The patient experienced acute hypotension during BiPAP therapy, which could indicate fluid or cardiac issues.
5. Pulmonary edema: Considering the patient's history of COPD and recent respiratory distress, there is a possibility of developing pulmonary ed"

   Imaging: CXR-[**2156-6-1**]--Striking asymmetry with hyperlucency on right
   suggesting dynamic hyperinflation and increased diffuse pulmonary
   infiltrates on left suggestive of edema given acute evolution
   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo female with history of COPD and now s/p extubation after
   optimized therapy now has had progressive worsening over past 12
   hours.  This may well be evidence of aspiration triggering some
   increased respiratory distress and in that setting triggering of A-fib
   and worsening hemodynamic compromise.  This may be triggered by the
   incapacity to adequately control oral secretions and po intake.  We
   have taken patient off BIPAP and provided fluid bolus to try to aid in
   establishment of stable BP.  This likely represents significant
   evidence of failure to maintain stable respiratory status off the
   ventilator and with an easy trigger of cardiovascular compromise in the
   setting of recurrent respiratory distress.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -BIPAP 10/5 as much tolerated
   -Nebs q6 and PRN with focus on non-B Agonists
   -Will need to be npo and maintain aspiration precautions
   2)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Return to sinus rhythm at this time with improvement in respiratory
   status
   -Maintain nodal blockade in bacground
   3)Pneumonia/UTI/C. Diff-
   -Continue with Vanco/Levo/[**Last Name (un) **] for 7 day course as reasonable minimum
   but will not discontinue in the setting of such tenuous clinical
   status.
   -Can not rule out pneumonia given pulmonary infiltrates and compromise
   4)Hypotension-
   -Likely cardiogenic compromise with Atrial Fibrillation
   -IVF bolus as tolerated
   -No role for pressors given goals of care
   5)ICU-
   Extensive discussion with daughter in regards to source of compromise
   which represents unstable cardiovascular status with atrial
   fibrillation and hypotension as well as severe chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease and rapid evolution of hypercarbia and dynamic
   hyperinflation with event triggered likely by aspiration event but may
   well be a component of hydrostatic edema
both of which are possible to
   be recurrent over time.  Ms. [**Known lastname 3513**]
s daughter was quite clear that
   she would not want prolonged intubation or ventilatory support and
   given the absence of a rapid resolution of the current active issues
   she would express her mother
s wishes to be no intubation, no CPR and
   for goals of care to focus on comfort if stable clinical status is not
   achieved at the current levels of support.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of COPD. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently in critical condition. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening over the past 12 hours, with increasing difficulty in breathing and persistent hypotension. She has developed atrial fibrillation and has shown signs of pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's condition is unstable, and her daughter has expressed that she does not want prolonged intubation or ventilatory support. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status and inability to maintain adequate oxygenation may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's development of atrial fibrillation can increase the risk of further complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of pulmonary infiltrates suggests a possible pneumonia, which can worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of infection.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's symptoms may indicate a UTI, which can lead to complications such as sepsis or kidney infection.
5. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient's recent antibiotic use increases the risk of developing a C. difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and abdominal pain.
6. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 86 y/o F with COPD and UC a/w hypoxia and change in mental status,
   intubated in the ED for hypercarbic respiratory failure.   Currently
   extubated but respiratory distress has returned.
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure - COPD exacerbation most likely in the
   setting of viral URI, less likely bacterial pneumonia or fluid overload
   based on CXR.
   - extubated [**2156-5-30**]; increased O2 demand from 3L NC to 60% facemask
   overnight
   - trial of BiPAP during acute respiratory distress this morning with
   resulting hypotension and minimal improvement in mental status.  Will
   discuss with daughter wishes of continuing BiPAP therapy.
   -continue atrovent MDI
   -continue albuterol MDI
   -continue flovent [**Hospital1 **]
   - ECHO [**2156-5-25**]: moderate pulmonary artery systolic HTN; mild MR; LVEF
   >55%
   -will cont. levaquin while awaiting cultures
   -continue week-long taper of prednisone 2O po
   - for possible pulmonary edema continue low dose lasix prn
   .
   # UTI:
   - Urine Cx: E.coli (possible ESBL)
   - currently on meropenem; consider switching to alternative abx to
   narrow coverage, keeping in mind PCN allergy (hives).
   # Tachycardia:
   EKG: sinus tach with increased APCs and VPCs yesterday converting to
   A-fib with RVR this morning and converting back to sinus rhythm this
   morning during rounds.
   Attempted rate control this morning with multiple doses of metoprolol
   po and IV without success.
   Will hold metoprolol in face of worsening COPD exacerbation.
   Consider diltiazem for rate control if A-fib with RVR returns.
   Continue telemetry.
   #Anxiety/Agitation: persists and may be contributing factor to
   tachycardia
   Because of prior paradoxical effects of benzos will avoid benzos.  Use
   zyprexa 5mg q8h prn agitation.  [**Month (only) 60**] use trazadone qhs prn if difficulty
   sleeping.
   #Recent C.diff colitis - appears to have resolved
   -cont. PO vanco x 4 wks (start date was [**2156-5-11**] per rehab records);
   continue vanc 2 wks post last abx treatment
   #Ulcerative Colitis- apparently quiescent disease, although necrotic
   leg ulcer looks like pyoderma gangrenosum
   -cont. balsalazide and mesalamine
   #F/E/N
 euvolemic by exam
   - started regular diet yesterday but will hold today (must consider
   aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia in the setting of acute respiratory

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypercarbic respiratory failure and subsequent intubation in the emergency department (ED). The patient is currently extubated but experiencing respiratory distress again. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation was hypoxia and change in mental status due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, which led to intubation. Despite being extubated, she is experiencing respiratory distress again, indicating a potential recurrence or worsening of this condition.
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and her current symptoms may be indicative of a COPD exacerbation. This could be triggered by a viral upper respiratory infection (URI), as mentioned in the assessment and plan.
3. Bacterial pneumonia: Although less likely than a URI, the possibility of bacterial pneumonia cannot be ruled out based on the chest X-ray findings. Pneumonia can cause respiratory distress and worsen underlying COPD.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, suggesting that she has been receiving less fluid than she is giving out. However, if her respiratory distress is due to fluid overload, this could pose a complication.
5. UT"
