 [**Last Name 9**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with h/o dementia, CAD, paroxysmal
   aflutter who was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for LUE thrombectomy and a
   flutter with RVR complicated by worsening renal failure,
   rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload and now s/p LUE fasciotomy.
    L brachial thrombus c/b compartment syndrome: S/p thromboembolectomy
   which was c/b compartment syndrome, likely reperfusion injury with no
   necrosis on intraop evaluation seen, now s/p fasciotomy.
   - F/u Plastics and Vascular recs
   - continue heparin gtt
   ARF: Baseline unknown but Cr 1.2 on admission likely represents mild
   ARF given age. Likely prerenal from hypoperfusion with possible
   progression to ATN, complicated by progressive rhabdomyolysis. Cr now
   increased to 2.8 and pt anuric.
   - Given lack of urine output and tenuous respiratory status will
   discontinue fluids
   - Hold duloxetine and gabapentin for now; renally dose all meds
   - Trend Cr and electrolytes
   - Foley in place to monitor urine output
   - Pt's family open to idea of hemodialysis if becomes necessary
   - F/u renal recs
   Rhabdomyolysis:  As above, CKS stabilizing in the range of 40k.  Little
   improvement with bicarbonate.
   - holding fluids for now
   Fluid overload: Pt with increasing O2 requirement in setting of
   aggressive fluid hydration and anuria. [**Month (only) 8**] also be exacerbated by
   aflutter with RVR although rate currently better controlled. No known
   h/o CHF.  CXR without significant worsening thus far.
   - as above, now anuric despite aggressive hydration with bicarbonate
   - will discontinue fluids
   - monitor oxygen saturations
   - okay to intubate
   - would likely favor trial of high dose lasix prior to intubation
   Atrial flutter: H/o a flutter in past, likely in setting of pain or
   acute illness. Earlier required dilt gtt for RVR but HR currently
   better controlled off gtt.
   - Monitor on tele, EKG in AM
   - Cont home metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **], uptitrate prn
   - digoxin level elevated so will discontinue
   - Consider IV dilt if relapses in to RVR
   - Add on TSH
   - F/u cards recs
   - echocardiogram this morning
   CAD: H/o unspecified CAD per son. [**Name (NI) **] CK and trops difficult to
   interpret in setting of worsening renal failure but ACS less likely. Pt
   does not appear to be in pain currently.
   - Monitor on tele, EKG in AM
   - Cont ASA 325mg, beta blocker
   - Already on heparin gtt for thrombus
   - echocardiogram this morning
   Altered mental status: Pt with dementia at baseline. No acute findings
   on CT head. Yesterday thought to be somnolent in setting of sedation
   with some improvement after receving Narcan. Now also s/p sedation for
   OR and lethargic. [**Month (only) 8**] also have contribution from acute illness and
   underlying dementia.
   - No need for Narcan for now
   - Holding duloxetine
   - Reassess mental status in AM
   - Monitor lytes and renal function, f/u TSH
   ?Eye infection: Cont erythromycin ointment to left eye.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now but can start tube feeds
   in AM as NG tube in place.
   Prophylaxis: Heparin gtt, H2 blocker
   Access: PICC
   Code: DNR, ok to use pressors, ok to intubate.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for a left upper extremity thrombectomy and has since developed several complications.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Altered mental status: The patient has a pre-existing dementia, making it challenging to assess acute changes in mental status. The note mentions sedation and possible contributions from acute illness and underlying dementia.

2. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient has a known history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Her heart rate is currently better controlled, but she continues to experience episodes of atrial flutter with variable block. Diltiazem was initially started but has been held.

3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has elevated creatine kinase levels, indicating rhabdomyolysis. Despite receiving bicarbonate, there has been little improvement. Fluid overload is a concern, and fluid administration has been discontinued.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's baseline renal function is unknown, but her serum creatinine level on admission suggests mild ARF. The condition may progress to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), further complicated by rhabdomyolysis. The patient is anuric (no urine output), and hemodialysis may be necessary.

5. Fluid overload: The patient"

   Imaging: Echocardiogram: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular
   wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are moderately thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
   may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, coronary artery disease, and atrial flutter who was admitted to the ICU for left upper extremity thrombectomy and treatment of atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. The patient has multiple medical complications including altered mental status, renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, and fluid overload. She underwent a left brachial thrombectomy that resulted in compartment syndrome, which was treated with fasciotomy. The patient's current condition includes anuria, worsening renal function, and increasing oxygen requirements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) - The patient's renal function has progressively worsened, indicated by an increase in creatinine levels from 1.2 to 2.8 and anuria. This suggests the development of acute kidney injury, which may be due to prerenal causes such as hypoperfusion or progression to acute tubular necrosis.
2. Rhabdomyolysis - The patient has elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), indicating muscle breakdown. Rhabdomyolysis can lead to complications like myoglobinuria, acute kidney injury, and electrolyte disturbances.
3. Fluid Overload - The patient has signs of fluid overload, as evidenced by aggressive fluid hydration, increasing oxygen requirements, and absence of urine output. This may result in pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or worsening of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, coronary artery disease, and paroxysmal atrial flutter who was admitted to the ICU for left upper extremity thrombectomy and atrial flutter with right ventricular overload. She has since developed worsening renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload, and underwent a left upper extremity fasciotomy.

The patient's current condition includes acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis from hypoperfusion and rhabdomyolysis. Her serum creatinine is still elevated but improved with increased urine output this morning. The goal is to maintain urine output at 100 cc/h and continue diuresis with diuril and lasix. Her medications, including duloxetine, gabapentin, and digoxin, are being held and will be renally dosed. Her electrolytes will be trended, and a Foley catheter is in place to monitor urine output. The patient's family is agreeable to hemodialysis if necessary.

The patient also has evidence of rhabdomyolysis, but her creatine kinase (CK) levels are now downtrending. She will be restarted on fluids with diuresis using lasix and diuril.

Additionally, the patient has fluid overload, which is being managed with diuretics and rate control. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows no systolic dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and paroxysmal atrial flutter. She was admitted to the ICU for left upper extremity (LUE) thrombectomy and atrial flutter with right ventricular overload. The patient's medical conditions have worsened, including worsening renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload, and lower extremity compartment syndrome. She underwent a fasciotomy and thromboembolectomy.

The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 166/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. She is currently on a heparin drip and has been started on diuretics to manage fluid overload. Her urine output has improved.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels and signs of rhabdomyolysis. The echocardiogram reveals mild aortic stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypoperfusion and rhabdomyolysis. Her creatinine levels are still elevated, but urine output is improving with the use of diuretics. The goal is to maintain urine output at 100"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, coronary artery disease, and paroxysmal atrial flutter. She was admitted for a left upper extremity thrombectomy and atrial flutter with right ventricular overload. The patient has several medical complications including worsening renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload, and compartment syndrome.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypoperfusion and rhabdomyolysis. The goal is to maintain urine output at 100 cc/h and continue diuresis with diuril and lasix. Hemodialysis may be necessary if the patient's condition worsens.

2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are now downtrending. It is important to restart fluids with diuresis.

3. Hypovolemia: The patient has presumed 3L volume overload. Diuretics will be continued, and oxygen therapy will be weaned as possible.

4. Left brachial thrombus: The patient underwent thromboembolectomy due to compartment syndrome caused by reperfusion injury. She has already undergone a fasciotomy and is on heparin gtt. Follow-up with plastics and vascular recommendations is necessary.

5. Atrial Flutter: The patient has a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and paroxysmal atrial flutter who was admitted to the hospital for a left upper extremity (LUE) thrombectomy and treatment of flutter with right ventricular overload (RVR).
- The patient has developed worsening renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload, and underwent a fasciotomy for compartment syndrome caused by a left brachial thrombus.
- The patient's current conditions include acute kidney injury (ARF) due to hypoperfusion and rhabdomyolysis, with creatinine levels still elevated but responding to diuretics.
- The patient's rhabdomyolysis is improving, as indicated by the downward trend in creatine kinase (CK) levels.
- The patient has fluid overload but is stable in terms of oxygen requirements and is responding to diuretics.
- The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which is likely related to acute illness or pain.
- The patient has a history of unspecified CAD, but cardiac biomarkers are difficult to interpret due to worsening renal failure. No thrombus was reported on the limited transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).
- The patient has altered mental status, likely exacerbated by acute illness and underlying dementia. A CT scan of the head showed no acute findings.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly woman with a history of dementia, coronary artery disease, and paroxysmal atrial flutter. She was admitted to the ICU for a left upper extremity thrombectomy and atrial flutter with right ventricular overload. The patient's condition has been complicated by worsening renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload, and compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has a history of renal failure, and her creatinine levels are elevated. She is currently being treated with diuretics to promote urine output and prevent further fluid overload. If her condition worsens, hemodialysis may be necessary.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are high, indicating muscle breakdown. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and diuresis are being implemented to prevent further muscle damage.
3. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's initial presentation included volume depletion, which can lead to hypovolemic shock. However, her current fluid status is complicated by fluid overload, and diuresis is being used to manage this.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, but it is downtrending. Close monitoring of the platelet levels is important to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Atrial Flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, and her heart"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, coronary artery disease, and paroxysmal atrial flutter who was admitted to the ICU for a left upper extremity thrombectomy and atrial flutter with right ventricular overload. She has been complicated by worsening renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload, and now has undergone a left upper extremity fasciotomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has ATN (acute tubular necrosis) due to hypoperfusion and rhabdomyolysis. Her creatinine levels are rising, but she is being diuresed with diuril and lasix to achieve a goal urine output of 100 cc/h. If necessary, hemodialysis will be considered with the family's agreement.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are downtrending, indicating improvement. However, she will continue to receive fluid resuscitation with diuresis.
3. Hypovolemia: The patient has presumed 3L volume overload, and diuresis will be continued to manage this condition. Oxygen therapy will be weaned as possible.
4. Left brachial thrombus: The patient has undergone thromboembolectomy, which was complicated by compartment syndrome, likely due to reperfusion injury. She has since undergone a fasciotomy and is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, coronary artery disease, and paroxysmal atrial flutter. She was admitted to the ICU for a thrombectomy and treatment of atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. The patient's condition has been complicated by worsening renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload, and compartment syndrome. She underwent a fasciotomy and is currently on heparin. The patient's current issues include acute kidney injury, rhabdomyolysis, hypoemia, left brachial thrombus, atrial flutter, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised due to hypoperfusion and rhabdomyolysis. Continued monitoring and management of fluid balance, electrolytes, and urine output are necessary to prevent further deterioration of kidney function.

2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels indicate ongoing muscle breakdown. Close monitoring of CK levels and maintaining adequate hydration to facilitate diuresis are essential to prevent further complications.

3. Hypovolemia: The patient has presumed volume overload, as indicated by stable oxygen saturation on 3 liters of oxygen. Continued diuresis and careful monitoring of fluid balance"
