   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] was previously known to the MICU [**Location (un) **] team when he was
   admitted on [**2119-8-5**] with right sided abdominal pain, ascites, lactic
   acidosis thought to be perhaps secondary to metformin toxicity, and
   renal failure requiring emergent dialysis. Then (and since then)
   diagnostic paracenteses did not show evidence for SBP (para done
   earlier today shows WBC 300 but in setting of RBC [**Numeric Identifier 7881**]). In MICU
   [**Location (un) **] stay, dialysis was initiated. Since he has been on the floor, he
   has been able to stop dialysis for a time, with last session on 8.21
   per housestaff notes. He has had urine output of 600 as of the morning
   of [**8-16**]. A diabetic who has been on insulin only during this admission,
   he has had difficult-to-control glucose, remaining in the 300s-400s for
   much of the last day despite an aggressive sliding scale. He triggered
   on the floor both the night of transfer and the night prior for
   agitation and altered mental status. The evening prior to transfer, the
   MICU resident was notified by the liver-kidney resident that Mr.
   [**Known lastname **]
s status was troubling and that a transfer might be necessary;
   on the second trigger overnight, nightfloat and MICU residents agreed
   to transfer Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the MICU for insulin drip and closer
   monitoring in the setting of ongoing encephalopathy, intermittent
   agitation, and difficult to control blood sugar. The liver attending
   was contact[**Name (NI) **] by the nightfloat covering team, and reportedly
   recommended insulin drip and suggested the possibility of infection.
   At time of transfer, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was tachycardic and hypertensive. He
   was alternating between periods of sleep and periods of agitated
   moaning, consistent with the mournful moans of the encephalopathic
   periods of his prior MICU [**Location (un) **] stay.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a known diabetic with a history of right-sided abdominal pain, ascites, lactic acidosis, renal failure, and metformin toxicity, has been admitted multiple times to the MICU. During this current stay, the patient's urine output has been good, with a recent output of 600 mL. However, the patient's blood glucose levels have been difficult to control, remaining in the 300s-400s despite an aggressive sliding scale.

The patient experienced episodes of agitation and altered mental status, triggering a transfer from the floor to the ICU for closer monitoring. At the time of transfer, the patient was tachycardic and hypertensive, alternating between periods of sleep and periods of agitated moaning.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent development of difficult-to-control glucose levels. Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, except for distended abdomen with a fluid wave and umbilical hernia. Neurological examination shows the patient to be sedated, responding to tactile stimuli, and moaning intermittently.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal coagulation profiles. The patient is currently receiving insulin drip and has been placed on prophylactic measures such as stress ulcer prevention, deep vein thrombosis prevention, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention.

   Assessment and Plan
   Hepatic encephalopathy.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 attributable to hepatic encephalopathy.
   Precipitants likely multifactorial, including hypernatremia,
   hypokalemia, and contribution of renal failure, on background of prior
   TIPS (increased incidence of encephalopathy).  No evidence for GI bleed
   or protein load in gut.  Medication effect possible.  Also need to
   consider possibility of infection, but no localizing signs or symptoms
   or line infection or SBP (no evidence for SBP by recent paracentesis).
   Plan provide free water, replete K, avoid sedating medications.
   Monitor for infection, await cultures (including C. Diff)
 empirical
   antimicrobials.  Monitor airway, with low threshold for intubation to
   protect airway.  Lactulose per NGT and enema to manage encephalopathy.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS
 unclear etiology, variable levels.  No obvious signs
   of infection.  Consider thiamine repletion.  Monitor.
   RENAL FAILURE
 Recovering ATN.  No longer requiring renal replacement
   therapy.  Monitor uo, BUN, creatinine.  Check urine lytes, UA.
   Continue midodrine, albumin as per Renal consultation.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 requires free water repletion.  Monitor Na.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 poorly controlled diabetes.  Unclear precipitant, but
   concern for infection.  No evidence for DKA.  Plan monitor glucose,
   resume insulin continuous infusion, maintain glucose <150.  [**Last Name (un) 294**]
   Consultation.
   ELEVATED TSH
 unclear whether this represents hypothyroidism or
   consequences of critical illness.  Monitor closely on synthroid or
   consider discontinuing.
   PORTAL VEIN THROMBOSIS
 continue anticoagulation.  [**Name (NI) 7883**] PT/INR.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO while encephalopathic, high aspiration risk.
   CIRRHOSIS
 not transplant candidate.  Continue supportive care.
   Plans otherwise as outlined per Resident note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU for acute renal failure and lactic acidosis, attributed to metformin toxicity. The patient underwent dialysis and was transferred to another hospital but did not require further dialysis. The patient's mental status remains abnormal, with periods of agitation and somnolence. Management of hyperglycemia is ongoing. The patient's encephalopathy worsened, prompting transfer back to the MICU for further evaluation and management.

Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing altered mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy. Precipitants include hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and the contribution of renal failure on a background of prior TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt), which increases the incidence of encephalopathy. Medication effect is also a possible factor. Infection is considered but no localizing signs or symptoms or line infection or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) are present. The plan includes providing free water, repleting potassium, avoiding sedating medications, monitoring for infection, awaiting cultures (including Clostridium difficile), and administering empirical antimicrobials. Airway protection and lactulose administration are also planned.

2. Lactic Acidosis: The etiology of lactic acidosis is unclear, with variable levels. No obvious signs of infection are observed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, and renal failure. He is currently in the ICU for hyperglycemia and encephalopathy. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has leukocytosis without fever. He is receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range except for hypernatremia, which is being corrected with D5W. His liver function tests are abnormal, indicating liver failure. The patient has tense and obese ascites with compartment syndrome, contributing to ileus and renal failure. He is also experiencing hematuria and altered mental status. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and his INR is elevated, leading to the discontinuation of warfarin. The patient is being closely monitored for potential medical complications such as infection, liver failure, renal failure, hyperglycemia, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is on multiple antibiotics due to suspected infection. Further investigations, such as blood cultures and sputum cultures, are pending. Considering the presence of leukocytosis without fever, a line infection or pneumonia needs to be considered. Clostridium difficile infection should also be considered due to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, type II diabetes mellitus, acute confusion, renal failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, ineffective coping, hypernatremia, liver function abnormalities, and hypothyroidism. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for an insulin drip and is planned to be transferred to the floor tomorrow. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for various infections due to his compromised immune system. These may include urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, and catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis and strict infection control measures should be implemented.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of liver failure and high ammonia levels, hepatic encephalopathy could worsen and lead to further cognitive decline. Close monitoring of ammonia levels and timely administration of lactulose enemas are necessary.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels need to be carefully managed, especially during the insulin drip. Hypoglycemia should be avoided, and appropriate adjustments to the insulin dosage should be made.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels require careful correction to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome. Frequent monitoring of serum sodium levels and slow correction with hypotonic fluids are recommended.
5. Renal failure: Acute kidney injury or chronic"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, and alcohol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for hyperglycemia and suspected infection. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, as well as insulin for hyperglycemia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 132/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's mental status is altered, and he is unable to follow commands or communicate effectively.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, leukocytosis, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Blood glucose levels are also elevated. Other lab results indicate electrolyte imbalances, including hypernatremia (high sodium) and hyponatremia (low sodium).

The patient has a tense and distended abdomen, which may indicate ascites and potential abdominal compartment syndrome. He has a history of renal failure and is currently showing signs of acute renal failure.

The patient's medications include albumin, lactulose, insulin, Haldol, morphine, and Tylenol. He is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of liver failure and multiple medical complications. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has received various treatments and interventions.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient's condition includes ineffective coping, hypernatremia (high sodium), liver function abnormalities, cirrhosis of the liver (alcoholic), diabetes mellitus type II, acute confusion, renal failure (acute renal failure, ARF), and sepsis without organ dysfunction.
- The patient has altered mental status, hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, and encephalopathy, suggesting the possibility of infection.
- The patient's abdominal pain was initially noted but not significant on examination.
- The patient is currently moaning mournfully, consistent with past presentation.
- Current treatments and interventions include covering with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, gently correcting hypernatremia, managing hyperglycemia with an insulin drip, holding oral medications due to the patient's inability to cooperate, considering non-pharmacological pain relief measures, lactulose enema, and further evaluation of microbiological data and cultures.
- The patient also has liver failure, likely contributing to some degree of pre-renal failure, and is not listed for transplant. Transplant committee is asking for a colonoscopy and outpatient relapse therapy. Specific interventions for liver failure include midodrine, albumin, and"

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of hepatic encephalopathy and hyperglycemia. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic diabetes mellitus (type II), renal failure, portal vein thrombosis, and ineffective coping.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, high blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He has a fever with a maximum temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F) and a current temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F). The patient is weighing 92.2 kg and is 67 inches tall.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,487 mL and a total output of 1,363 mL since 12 AM. The patient's weight has increased from 90.6 kg at admission to 92.2 kg currently.

Physical examination reveals a disheveled appearance, poor air movement in the chest, tense ascites, hypoactive bowel sounds, trace edema in the extremities, and altered mental status with groaning and asterixis.

Lab results indicate an elevated blood glucose level of 660 mg/dL and altered liver function tests with elevated ALT and AST levels. Other lab values such as white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, potassium, and sodium are within"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of hepatic encephalopathy and hyperglycemia. The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic, diabetes mellitus type II, and acute renal failure. The patient's current condition includes ineffective coping, hypernatremia, liver function abnormalities, altered mental status, lactic acidosis, recovering ATN (acute tubular necrosis), hyperglycemia, elevated TSH, portal vein thrombosis, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition can worsen if not properly managed, leading to further alterations in mental status and potential development of severe complications such as sepsis or respiratory failure if the airway is compromised.
2. Hypernatremia: Free water repletion is necessary to correct this electrolyte imbalance. Failure to do so may result in continued dehydration and potential complications like renal dysfunction.
3. Liver function abnormalities: Monitoring liver enzymes and addressing underlying causes of liver dysfunction is crucial. If left untreated, it can lead to further deterioration of liver function and complications such as hepatic failure or hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Altered mental status: Close monitoring of neurological status is essential to detect any changes or deterioration. Failure to recognize and manage this condition appropriately may result in increased risk of falls, aspiration pneumonia, or other complications associated with altered mental status.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function due to severe liver disease.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, with high blood sugar levels. The cause of this hyperglycemia is unclear, but there is concern for infection. The plan is to monitor glucose levels, resume insulin continuous infusion, and maintain glucose below 150 mg/dL.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, requiring ongoing free water repletion. It is important to monitor sodium levels closely.

4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are worsening, and it is unclear whether this is due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Further monitoring of urine output, BUN, and creatinine is necessary. Midodrine and albumin will be continued as per renal consultation.

5. Ileus: The patient has a condition called ileus, which is a temporary stoppage of the normal propulsive ability of the gastrointestinal tract. This may be related to massive ascites, but further evaluation by GI may be needed.

6. Portal vein thrombosis: The patient has portal vein thrombosis, and anticoagulation should be continued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes mellitus type II, and acute confusion. He is currently admitted to the ICU with suspected infection, treated empirically, and remains afebrile. The patient's mental status has improved today, and he is more cooperative. He is also showing signs of hypernatremia, liver function abnormalities, renal failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective coping: The patient may experience emotional or psychological distress due to his current medical condition and hospitalization.
2. Hypernatremia (high sodium): The patient has an elevated sodium level in his blood, which can lead to dehydration, confusion, seizures, or other neurological complications if not managed properly.
3. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's liver function is impaired, which can result in complications such as hepatic encephalopathy (altered mental status), portal hypertension, and increased risk of infections.
4. Cirrhosis of the liver: The patient has a chronic liver disease called cirrhosis, which can lead to complications like ascites (abdominal fluid accumulation), variceal bleeding, hepatorenal syndrome, and liver cancer.
5. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's diabetes may worsen during his hospital stay due to stress, infection, or other factors, potentially leading to hyperglycemia and its associated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with suspected infection, hyperglycemia, and altered mental status. The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic, diabetes mellitus type II, acute confusion, renal failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and ineffective coping. 

The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications. The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, suggesting uncontrolled diabetes. Additionally, the patient's sodium levels are high, indicating hypernatremia. The patient's renal function has also been affected, with elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output. 

The patient's coagulation status is abnormal, with an elevated INR. The patient is also experiencing hematuria, likely related to the elevated INR. 

The patient's mental status remains altered, and there are concerns about possible hepatic encephalopathy or central nervous system infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Uncontrolled diabetes: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control. This can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels can cause dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and neurological symptoms.
3. Renal failure: The patient's reduced urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. This can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte"

","The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis, admitted for encephalopathy and later transferred to the ICU due to hyperglycemia and worsening agitation. He has had significant ileus, limiting lactulose administration, and has also experienced hypernatremia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, blood pressure ranging from 109-126 mmHg, heart rate between 68-76 bpm, respiratory rate of 13-14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,742 mL, with 2,542 mL administered intravenously and 200 mL of blood products. The total output consists of 1,850 mL of urine, 210 mL of stool, and 768 mL of NG drainage. 

The patient's blood tests reveal a low white blood cell count (WBC) of 7.1 K/uL, normal hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 30.0-32.6%, low platelet count (Plt) of 102, elevated creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 2.8-3.1 mg/dL, high glucose levels ranging from 183-191 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) with elevated ALT/AST levels. Other lab results show elevated levels of BUN, potassium, and lactic acid, along with decreased albumin, LDH, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with clear breath sounds, firm distended abdomen, and normal peripheral pulses. Neurological examination shows the patient following simple commands, responding to verbal stimuli, and exhibiting purposeful movement with normal muscle tone.

The patient has been diagnosed with ineffective coping, hypernatremia, liver function abnormalities, cirrhosis of the liver, type II diabetes mellitus, acute confusion, acute renal failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The plan includes removing 4 liters of ascites fluid, monitoring bladder pressure, and providing ICU care including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening liver dysfunction leading to hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure, progression of acute renal failure resulting in end-stage renal disease or the need for dialysis, development of infections due to immunosuppression and indwelling lines, and potential cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. He has a history of cirrhosis of the liver, alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, sepsis, and ineffective coping. The patient's recent events include a paracentesis performed to remove 4 liters of turbid fluid from his abdomen, which was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He has shown improvement in his mental status and is now at baseline. The patient tolerated the procedure well, had no residuals with his nasogastric (NG) tube, had regular bowel movements, and was able to eat a soft diet. His vital signs are stable, and his labs show improvement in several areas. The patient's hypernatremia has been addressed, his liver function abnormalities are being managed, and his blood sugar levels are under control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver failure. Treatment includes lactulose to reduce ammonia levels in the blood.
2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): Although the recent paracentesis did not reveal SBP, there is still a risk of infection in the peritoneal fluid. Close monitoring of symptoms and follow-up cultures are necessary.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the"

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, acute confusion, renal failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, ineffective coping, hypernatremia, liver function abnormalities, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the MICU with suspected infection and treated empirically. The patient remained afebrile and improved clinically. He underwent paracentesis, which removed 4 liters of turbid fluid and showed no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with only 125 WBC.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, ARF, encephalopathy, and hyperglycemia. He underwent paracentesis yesterday and had improvement in mental status. The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), protonix, albumin, rifaximin, lactulose, and synthroid. He is also receiving ICU care, which includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition occurs due to liver dysfunction and can cause confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and buildup of waste products.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels suggest uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM), which can increase the risk of infections, neuropathy, and cardiovascular complications.
4. Cirrhosis of the liver: Long-term alcohol abuse has led to liver damage and cirrhosis, which increases the risk of portal hypertension, ascites, and liver-related complications.
5. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: Although the patient does not exhibit signs of organ dysfunction, sepsis can still occur as a result"
