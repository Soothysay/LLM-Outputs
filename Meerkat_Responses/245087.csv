   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male who presented with chest pain and was found to have left main coronary artery disease. He was medically managed overnight with heparin, nitroglycerin, aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin therapy. A cardiac catheterization revealed LMCA disease, and CT surgery has evaluated the patient.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 112/48 mmHg, heart rate of 58 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination shows no fever, oriented and with appropriate mood and affect, sclera anicteric, right pupil 3mm --> 2mm and left faintly reactive, extraocular movements intact, supple neck with jugular venous pressure of 8 cm, regular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur at the left sternal border, clear lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, 2+ bilateral edema, and a 4x3cm tan discoloration on the right buttock that blanches, intact skin, and no rashes.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, sodium, potassium, and glucose levels, but slightly low hematocrit and elevated creatinine levels. Other labs are within normal range.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male presenting with chest pain and found to have left main coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization. The patient also experienced a right anterior cerebral artery (ACA) cerebrovascular accident (CVA), likely embolic in nature. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 112/48 to 153/94 mmHg and a heart rate between 50-60 beats per minute. 

The physical examination reveals no acute changes in the head, neck, respiratory system, or abdomen. However, there is evidence of bilateral lower extremity edema and a tan-colored, blanching area on the right buttock, which is likely a prior decubitus ulcer site. Neurological examination shows decreased strength on the left side, particularly in the foot and leg. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 7.9 K/uL, a decreased hemoglobin level of 12.4 g/dL, and a platelet count of 129. Electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.2 mEq/L. Imaging studies reveal loss of gray/white matter differentiation in the medial right frontal lobe, suggesting a possible acute infarction, which requires further evaluation through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

   Assessment and Plan
   85M presenting with chest pain, found to have left main disease on
   cath, complicated by a Rt ACA CVA and multiple other small infarcts,
   likely embolic.
   # CVA.  Likely embolic secondary to plaque embolus from his aorta
   during the cardiac cath.  Official MRI reports show an acute Rt ACA
   infarct and multiple small infarcts in his right parietal, right medial
   occipital, left parietal, and left frontal regions.  Neuro feels that
   he has completed his stroke.  His left-sided hemiparesis has improved
   somewhat throughout the day, however he still remains weaker on his
   left side.
   - Will aim for SBP > 130.
   - F/u carotid U/S read.
   - BG < 150, HISS
   - Appreciate neuro recs, will f/u.
   - PT/OT
   - Patient will need coumadin for at least 3 months given the embolic
   nature of his stoke.
   - Will have the patient patient f/u in the outpatient stroke clinic in
   3 months.
   # CORONARIES: He initially presented with concern for unstable angina
   and was ruled out by cardiac enzymes; ECG difficult to interpret in
   setting of LBBB.  Cardiac cath showed LMCA disease.   CABG was
   considered however given his recent stroke and the risk of open-heart
   surgery both the surgeons and the family feel it would be better to
   proceed with medical management at this time.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg (will decrease to 81 mg daily once his INR is
   therapeutic)
   - Will DC the heparin and integrellin gtts.
   - Continue Metoprolol at a smaller dose of 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **] (decreased as
   his HR has been in the 50
s to 60
s and his SBP in the low 100
   - Continue high dose statin
   - Once he recovers from the acute event, can consider continue medical
   management vs CABG vs cath with stent placement for his left main stem
   partial blockage.
   # PUMP: Echo with low-normal EF 50-55% and LVH.  Patient with lower
   extremity edema on exam, however this is most likely due to venous
   insufficiency.
   - Will have the patient wear compression stockings to decrease his
   lower extremity edema.
   - No diuresis for now given his low SBP.
   # RHYTHM: Sinus bradycardia on telemetry, however the patient has a
   reported history of PAF (patient denies).
   - Continue telemetry.
   - Patient with need 2 week long monitor as an outpatient to monitor for
   a.fib as this would change the length of treatment with coumadin.  If
   the patient is found to have a.fib, will need lifelong coumadin
   therapy.
   # ANEMIA: Hct stable today at 35.4
   - Follow daily Hct
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA: 130s-140s. Low before heparin.  Continue to
   monitor.
   # SPINAL STENOSIS:
   - Pain control with acetaminophen
   # HYPERTENSION:  Patient currently having low SBP
   - Holding  ACE, CCB,
   - continue decreased dose of Metoprolol as above.
   # LUNG NODULE: Seen on CXR as incidental finding, no priors for
   comparison.
   - Will need CT for further eval but will hold off for now, will need
   f/u as OP.
   # RIGHT BUTTOCK PRIOR DECUB ULCER SITE: Patient reports this is site of
   prior decub which occured during hip fracture surgery.  Per his report,
   was difficult to heal.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. He presented with angina and was found to have left main coronary artery disease during cardiac catheterization. He also suffered a stroke, specifically an acute right anterior cerebral artery infarct and multiple small infarcts. His left-sided hemiparesis has improved, but he still remains weaker on the left side. The neurologist feels that he has completed his stroke. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is being managed medically for his coronary artery disease, as surgery poses a high risk due to his recent stroke. He will continue taking aspirin, metoprolol at a decreased dose, and a high-dose statin. He will also start warfarin for at least three months after discontinuing heparin and integrin. The patient's low blood pressure is being monitored, and he will follow up with cardiology for further evaluation. He has shown improvement in his neurologic findings, and the neurologist recommends outpatient follow-up in three months. The patient will undergo physical therapy and occupational therapy. The plan is to aim for a blood pressure above 130 mmHg, monitor his carotid ultrasound, keep his blood glucose below 150 mg/dL, and monitor his PT/PTT/INR levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Due to immobility and prolonged bed rest, the patient is at an increased risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of his legs.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): If the patient develops DVT, there is a risk that a clot may dislodge and travel to the lungs, causing a potentially life-threatening condition.
3. Stroke: The patient's recent stroke increases his risk of having another one. Close monitoring and management of risk factors such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia are crucial.
4. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of sinus bradycardia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Monitoring and treatment for arrhythmias are important to prevent complications.
5. Infection: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures increase the risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Pressure Ulcers: Immobility and decreased sensation can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers, particularly at sites of pressure and friction.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's baseline lung function may be compromised due to age and underlying conditions, increasing the risk of respiratory complications such as atelectasis or pneumonia."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. He presented with angina and was found to have left main coronary artery disease during a cardiac catheterization procedure. The patient experienced a stroke and multiple small infarcts in his brain, likely due to an embolic event during the cardiac catheterization.

The patient's neurological findings are improving, with some left-sided neglect and weakness. He is able to move his left toes and arm, although his left arm is weaker than his right. The neurologist believes that he has completed his stroke and has no further recommendations regarding blood pressure goals. The patient is cleared to get out of bed and work with physical therapy.

The patient is currently on warfarin for at least 3 months after he is off heparin and will follow up with the neurologist as an outpatient in 3 months. He is also started on an integrellin gtt yesterday. He was advanced to a cardiac diet. The patient and his family decided to proceed with medical management for his coronary artery disease and defer surgery given his recent stroke.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, which increases his risk for future cardiac events such as angina, myocardial infarction, or heart failure.

2. Neurological complications: The patient has already experienced a stroke and"

   multiple small infarcts, which could be embolic in nature.
   Assessment and Plan
   85M presenting with chest pain, found to have left main disease on
   cath, c/b R ACA CVA, likely embolic.
   # CORONARIES: Initially presented with concern for unstable angina;
   ruled out by cardiac enzymes; ECG difficult to interpret in setting of
   LBBB.  Caridac cath today showed LMCA disease. CT surgery has evaluated
   patient.  Given anginal symptoms and poor correlation w/ LMCA lesion
   etiologically (e.g. thrombosis of LM should theoretically lead to
   cardiogenic shock), will reassess the risk profile for LMCA ulcerated
   lesion, discuss w/ family, CT surgery.  [**Hospital 3379**] medical therapy.
   - Continue ASA, heparin gtt,
   - Start integrillin IV gtt
   - Holding nitro gtt given CVA, if SBP > 160 or pt. becomes sx will
   restart.
   - continue metoprolol, high dose statin
   - CT surgeyr aware, will review films, restratify risk and discuss w/
   family.  For now, will hold off on Plavix given possible CABG on
   Monday.
   - F/U carotid U/S.
   # CVA.  Likely embolic, but can not r/o ischemic given HTN in ED/Floor
   (per nursing report), now improving L sided strength.  No ICH.  Not
   candidate for tPA given timing > 3hrs and MERSI retrieval given  > 5hrs
   and size of infarct respectively.  Medical management.
   - Per balance between Neuro recs (autoregulate, SBP < 180 and > 120)
   and decreasing cardiac demand, will maintain SBP 120-160 range for
   now.
   - F/[**Location **] MRI/A
   - F/u carotid U/S.
   - Will consider TEE to eval for cardiac thrombosis
   - BG < 150, HISS
   - appreciate neuro recs, will f/u.
   - PT/OT
   # PUMP: Echo with low-normal EF 50-55% and LVH.  Pt. volume overloaded,
   R sides failure.
   - Will hold off on diuresis given BP goals for now
   # RHYTHM: Sinus bradycardia; reported history of PAF (patient denies).
   In sinus on Tele.  Will monitor
   # ANEMIA: Hct slightly down, 39 to 34 post cath.  Stable.
   - Follow daily and transfuse if <30
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA: 130s-140s. Low before heparin.  Continue to
   monitor.
   # SPINAL STENOSIS:
   - Surgery delayed until cardiac disease
   - Pain control with oxycodone/acetaminphen
   # HYPERTENSION:
   - Holding  ACE, CCB,
   - continue Metoprolol
   - Nitro gtt prn pressure as above.
   # LUNG NODULE: See on CXR as incidental finding, no priors for
   comparison.
   - Will need CT for further eval but will hold off for now, will need
   f/u as OP.
   # RIGHT BUTTOCK PRIOR DECUB ULCER SITE: Patient reports this is site of
   prior decub which occured during hip fracture surgery.  Per his report,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who presented with angina. He has been transferred to the CCU after being found to have left main coronary artery disease on cath and experienced a stroke.

The patient's neuro findings are improving, and he is able to move his left toes slightly and his left arm, although it is still weaker than his right side. He shows signs of neglect, only lifting his right arm until specifically asked to lift his left arm. Neurology feels that he has completed his stroke and has no further recommendations regarding blood pressure goals. They recommend warfarin for at least 3 months after he is off heparin and for him to follow up with them as an outpatient in 3 months. He is cleared by neurology to get out of bed and work with physical therapy.

The patient's blood pressure was in the low 100's after lopressor, so his dose was decreased to 12.5 mg. He was started on an integrellin gtt today and is planned to stay on it until Monday. He is still awaiting a carotid ultrasound. He was advanced to a cardiac diet. CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] sent an email to [**Doctor Last Name 2573**] stating that they would likely want to hold off in the setting of an acute stroke. The family expressed concern about immediately proceeding with surgery as well"

   Assessment and Plan
   85M presenting with chest pain, found to have left main disease on
   cath, complicated by a Rt ACA CVA and multiple other small infarcts,
   likely embolic.
   # CVA.  Likely embolic secondary to plaque embolus from his aorta
   during the cardiac cath.  Official MRI reports show an acute Rt ACA
   infarct and multiple small infarcts in his right parietal, right medial
   occipital, left parietal, and left frontal regions.  Neuro feels that
   he has completed his stroke.  His left-sided hemiparesis has improved
   significantly, however he still remains weaker on his left side.
   Carotid U/S scheduled for today
   - F/u carotid U/S read.
   - BG < 150, HISS
   - Appreciate neuro recs, will f/u.
   - PT/OT
   - Will start lovenox bridge to coumadin, pt will need coumadin for at
   least 3 months given the embolic nature of his stoke.
   - Will have the patient patient f/u in the outpatient stroke clinic in
   3 months (appt already made).
   # CORONARIES: He initially presented with concern for unstable angina
   and was ruled out by cardiac enzymes; ECG difficult to interpret in
   setting of LBBB.  Cardiac cath showed LMCA disease.   CABG was
   considered however given his recent stroke and the risk of open-heart
   surgery both the surgeons and the family feel it would be better to
   proceed with medical management at this time.
   - Continue ASA 81mg
   - Increase Metoprolol to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] and up-tightrate as tolerated by
   BPs.
   - Continue high dose statin
   - Restart ACEI as tolerated by BPs, likely tomorrow.
   - Once he recovers from the acute event, can consider continue medical
   management vs CABG for his left main stem partial blockage.
   # PUMP: Echo with low-normal EF 50-55% and LVH.  Patient with lower
   extremity edema on exam, but JVP is 7.  Likely [**12-29**] venous
   insufficiency.
   - Will have the patient wear compression stockings to decrease his
   lower extremity edema.
   - Gentle diuresis, 20mg IV lasix, for now and f/u lytes.
   # RHYTHM: Sinus bradycardia on telemetry, however the patient has a
   reported history of PAF (patient denies).
   - Continue telemetry.
   - Patient with need 2 week long monitor as an outpatient to monitor for
   a.fib (per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2830**] as this would change the length of treatment
   with coumadin.  If the patient is found to have a.fib, will need
   lifelong coumadin therapy.
   # ANEMIA: Hct stable today at 35.4
   - Follow daily Hct
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA: 130s-140s. Low before heparin.  Continue to
   monitor.
   # SPINAL STENOSIS:
   - Pain control with acetaminophen
   # HYPERTENSION:  Patient currently having low SBP
   - Holding  ACE, CCB,
   - continue decreased dose of Metoprolol as above.
   # LUNG NODULE: Seen on CXR as incidental finding, no priors for

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease.
- He presented with angina and was found to have left main coronary artery disease during cardiac catheterization, which resulted in a right anterior cerebral artery stroke and multiple small infarcts.
- The patient's left-sided hemiparesis has improved, but he still remains weaker on his left side.
- He has been started on Coumadin due to the embolic nature of his stroke and will need it for at least 3 months.
- Carotid ultrasound has been scheduled for today.
- The patient will follow up with an outpatient stroke clinic in 3 months.
- Coronary artery disease management includes continuing aspirin, increasing Metoprolol to 12.5 mg, continuing high-dose statin, and restarting ACE inhibitor as tolerated by blood pressures.
- The option of considering CABG for his left main stem partial blockage will be evaluated once he recovers from the acute event.
- Pump function shows a low-normal ejection fraction of 50-55% and left ventricular hypertrophy.
- The patient has lower extremity edema, likely due to venous insufficiency, and will be advised to wear compression stockings to decrease edema.
- Gentle diuresis with IV lasix will be initiated and followed up with electrolyte levels.
- Rhythm management includes monitoring for atrial fibrillation, especially since the patient has a reported history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
- Anemia and thrombocytopenia are stable, and the patient's spinal stenosis pain will be managed with acetaminophen.
- Hypertension is currently being managed with a decreased dose of Metoprolol due to hypotension.
- A lung nodule seen on CXR will require further evaluation with CT at a later date.
- The patient has a prior decub ulcer site on his right buttock, which will be monitored for any worsening and may require wound consultation if necessary.
- The patient's ICU care includes cardiac healthy diet, glycemic control, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Stroke recurrence: Given the patient's history of stroke and the presence of left main coronary artery disease, there is a risk of another stroke occurring.
2. Bleeding complications: With the initiation of Coumadin therapy, there is a risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
3. Hypotension: The patient's current low systolic blood pressure requires careful monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive medications.
4. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and left ventricular hypertrophy increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT):"

   Assessment and Plan
   85M presenting with chest pain, found to have left main disease on
   cath, complicated by a Rt ACA CVA and multiple other small infarcts,
   likely embolic.
   # CVA.  Likely embolic secondary to plaque embolus from his aorta
   during the cardiac cath.  Official MRI reports show an acute Rt ACA
   infarct and multiple small infarcts in his right parietal, right medial
   occipital, left parietal, and left frontal regions.  Neuro feels that
   he has completed his stroke.  His left-sided hemiparesis has improved
   somewhat throughout the day, however he still remains weaker on his
   left side.
   - Will aim for SBP > 130.
   - F/u carotid U/S read.
   - BG < 150, HISS
   - Appreciate neuro recs, will f/u.
   - PT/OT
   - Patient will need coumadin for at least 3 months given the embolic
   nature of his stoke.
   - Will have the patient patient f/u in the outpatient stroke clinic in
   3 months.
   # CORONARIES: He initially presented with concern for unstable angina
   and was ruled out by cardiac enzymes; ECG difficult to interpret in
   setting of LBBB.  Cardiac cath showed LMCA disease.   CABG was
   considered however given his recent stroke and the risk of open-heart
   surgery both the surgeons and the family feel it would be better to
   proceed with medical management at this time.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg (will decrease to 81 mg daily once his INR is
   therapeutic)
   - Will DC the heparin and integrellin gtts.
   - Continue Metoprolol at a smaller dose of 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **] (decreased as
   his HR has been in the 50
s to 60
s and his SBP in the low 100
   - Continue high dose statin
   - Once he recovers from the acute event, can consider continue medical
   management vs CABG vs cath with stent placement for his left main stem
   partial blockage.
   # PUMP: Echo with low-normal EF 50-55% and LVH.  Patient with lower
   extremity edema on exam, however this is most likely due to venous
   insufficiency.
   - Will have the patient wear compression stockings to decrease his
   lower extremity edema.
   - No diuresis for now given his low SBP.
   # RHYTHM: Sinus bradycardia on telemetry, however the patient has a
   reported history of PAF (patient denies).
   - Continue telemetry.
   - Patient with need 2 week long monitor as an outpatient to monitor for
   a.fib as this would change the length of treatment with coumadin.  If
   the patient is found to have a.fib, will need lifelong coumadin
   therapy.
   # ANEMIA: Hct stable today at 35.4
   - Follow daily Hct
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA: 130s-140s. Low before heparin.  Continue to
   monitor.
   # SPINAL STENOSIS:
   - Pain control with acetaminophen
   # HYPERTENSION:  Patient currently having low SBP
   - Holding  ACE, CCB,
   - continue decreased dose of Metoprolol as above.
   # LUNG NODULE: Seen on CXR as incidental finding, no priors for
   comparison.
   - Will need CT for further eval but will hold off for now, will need
   f/u as OP.
   # RIGHT BUTTOCK PRIOR DECUB ULCER SITE: Patient reports this is site of
   prior decub which occured during hip fracture surgery.  Per his report,
   was difficult to heal.
   - Skin care; if worsens, wound consult

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who presented with angina. He was found to have left main coronary artery disease during cardiac catheterization and experienced a right anterior cerebral artery stroke (Rt ACA CVA) and multiple other small infarcts, likely embolic. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/55 mmHg to 150/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His physical examination reveals a first-degree AV block, a systolic murmur at the left sternal border, crackles at the lung bases, bilateral lower extremity edema, and normal neurologic examination except for left-sided neglect and weakness in the left leg. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), glucose, and leukocyte count (WBC). The patient's hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt) are within normal limits. 

The patient's plan includes aiming for a systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 130 mmHg, following up on carotid ultrasound, maintaining blood glucose levels below"
