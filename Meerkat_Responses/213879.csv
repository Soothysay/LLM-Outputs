","Summary:
The patient is a 68-inch tall individual who was admitted with an RSBI of 17 and an ABG of 7.40/38/119/22. They were given a total of 16 liters of fluid, placed on 0.3 Phenylephrine to maintain blood pressure, and started on invasive ventilation. The patient also has a multi-lumen line, arterial line, and tunneled (Hickman) line inserted. They received Famotidine (Pepcid) on 08/02/2137 at 03:41 AM. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (96.9 F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/49 to 118/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus, and their CVP is 11 mmHg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,388 mL and output of 395 mL, with urine output of 110 mL. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with set tidal volume of 650 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and RSBI of 17. The patient's ABG values are 7.40/38/119/22, and their PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 238. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable. Lab results include WBC count of 13.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, sodium of 130 mg/dL, potassium of 0.8 mg/dL, chloride of 22 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 14 mg/dL, BUN of 108 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 147 mg/dL. Other labs show elevated PT/PTT/INR levels, slightly elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and elevated LDH. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending further evaluation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Stress ulcer due to increased gastric acid production caused by critical illness and medications.
4. Fluid overload and congestive heart failure due to excessive fluid administration.
5. Renal dysfunction indicated by elevated BUN and creatinine levels.
6. Infection at the site of central venous catheters.
7. Arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances and underlying medical conditions.
8. Nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or hospital-acquired pneumonia."

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of recurrent rectal cancer who underwent extensive abdominal surgery. He was admitted to the ICU for observation and IVF resuscitation post-operatively. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, respiratory distress, and fluid balance issues. He is on pressure support ventilation and has been receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation. The target CVP range is 11-12, and the MAP should be maintained above 65. 

The patient has multiple drains and ostomies, with maroonish tinged discharge from the ileoconduit to the small intestine. Laboratory results indicate slightly elevated WBC count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The plan includes continuing aggressive fluid resuscitation, maintaining good oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring for signs of hemodynamic instability or electrolyte imbalance. The patient will also receive prophylactic antibiotics, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis."

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of recurrent colorectal cancer, who underwent extensive abdominal surgery including sigmoid to anus resection, colostomy, ureteral diversion to small bowel, and reconstruction of pelvic floor. The patient is currently in the ICU for observation and IVF resuscitation post-operatively.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the surgical service plans to aggressively resuscitate with fluids. Continuous LR at 125/hr and PRN boluses will be given, along with maintaining Neosynephrine as needed to keep MAP > 65 and UOP > 40cc/hr.
2. Respiratory Issues: The patient is electively intubated and requires good oxygenation and ventilation. PSV trial may be discussed with the surgical service in the morning.
3. Abdominal Complications: The patient has an NG tube to low-continuous suction per surgical service, and is NPO. IV fluids will be continued, along with anti-emetics, tight glycemic control, and wound care.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient requires IV fluids and electrolyte repletion PRN.
5. Access Issues: TLC (temporary localizing catheter) is needed for access.
6. Thromboembolic Events: Heparin SC will be administered for DVT prophylaxis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent extensive abdominal surgery for recurrent colorectal cancer. The surgery included sigmoid to anus resection, colostomy, ureteral diversion to small bowel, and reconstruction of the pelvic floor.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Blood pressure is maintained with the use of phenylephrine, heart rate is within normal range, respiratory rate is low due to mechanical ventilation, and oxygen saturation is above 95%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation.
- Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 10 liters of fluid since admission and has a positive fluid balance of 2,993 mL over the past 24 hours.
- Respiratory support: The patient is on invasive ventilation with pressure support, and ABG results indicate a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 238, which suggests acceptable gas exchange.
- Neurological status: The patient is mildly sedated but alert and able to respond to commands.
- Physical examination: No acute distress is noted, with clear lungs, warm extremities, and intact dressings. However, there is a mild crackle at the left base of the lungs.
- Drains: There are two ostomies, one colostomy"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory Failure
   2) Hypotension
   3) Anemia
   4) Acidosis
   Patient did well throgh the night from a respiratory standpoint with
   good oxygenation. RSBI excellent this AM. Patient extubated. Monitor O2
   saturations and work of breathing today; with large volume
   resuscitation, may experience some capillary leak into the lung.
   Atelectasis on Left. Use incentive spirometer.
   BP improving off propofol. Try to wean phenylephrine (surgery prefers
   phenylephrine to norepinephrine for BP support); ongoing lactic
   acidosis may be related to local tissue underperfusion - anion gap up
   marginally when corrected for albumin. Continue to support fluid needs
   to keep CVP > [**10-6**]. Urine output good. Surgery prefers continuous
   infusion of fluid; will supplement with boluses as needed.
   Hct down with surgical blood loss and hemodilution. Not at threshold
   for transfusion now.

   Assessment and Plan :
   In summary, this is a 74 year-old male with a history of recurrent
   rectal CA who presented with hypotension and was resuscitated with IVF
   s/p lower colon, sigmoid, bladder resection
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension - most likely volume related at this time, per surgical
   service, will resuscitate aggressively with fluids.  LVEF=55% in [**Month (only) 591**]
   [**2136**].
   - Continuous LR at 125/hr finished this morning but will plan to bolus
   PRN per surgery recs and goal CVP 14-16 today with MAP above 60.
   - Will use PRN neosynephrine to keep MAP > 60 and UOP > 40cc/hr
   alongside PRN fluid boluses.
   .
   # Respiratory
 Extubated successfully this morning and doing well with
   oxygen saturations above 95% on low flow NC. Will get a repeat ABG on
   monitor today while maintianig BPs and will assess pain medications to
   anticipate possible oversedation and impairment in respiratory status.
   Pain moderately controlled now, will discuss possible PCA bolus with
   suregery/pain team.
   .
   # Abdominal surgery - NG tube to low-continous suction per surgical
   service, NPO, IV fluids.
   - Continue anti-emetics, will discuss discontinuation timeframe of NGT
   with surgery today
   - Tight glycemic control, ISS and gtt if needed, for wound healing.
   - TID hematocrit, transfuse for hematocrit fall > 3, hemodynamically
   stable now, will quantify specific HCT goal with surgery today as Hct
   has dropped from 35-30 to mid twenties, all likely [**1-26**] dilutional IVF
   effects but will touch base w/surgery
   .
   # FEN:  IV fluids and electrolyte repletion PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of recurrent rectal cancer who presented with hypotension and was resuscitated with intravenous fluids. He underwent lower colon, sigmoid, and bladder resection. The patient continues to have serosanguinous drainage from three Jackson-Pratt drains and mixed urine and blood at the ureteral and colostomy sites. He is maintaining good pain control, oxygen saturation above 95% on low flow nasal cannula, and has a stable blood pressure. The patient's heart rate and respiratory rate are within normal limits. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's presence of serosanguinous drainage from the Jackson-Pratt drains and mixed urine and blood at the ureteral and colostomy sites may indicate an infection or ongoing bleeding.
2. Bleeding: Given the patient's history of rectal cancer and recent surgery, there is a risk of ongoing bleeding or hematoma formation.
3. Fluid overload: Aggressive fluid resuscitation may lead to fluid overload, which can cause pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure.
4. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension indicates potential low blood volume, but close monitoring is required to prevent recurrent hypotension.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's extubation status should be closely monitored for any signs of respiratory distress or inadequate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-inch tall male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. He received 1 unit of blood overnight due to a low hematocrit level. His pain medication was adjusted, and he has been maintaining blood pressures between 110/50-80. The patient's oxygen saturation remains above 95% on 2L nasal cannula. He is currently on invasive ventilation but stopped briefly. The patient has serosanguinous drainage from three Jackson-Pratt drains and mixed urine and blood at the ureteral and colostomy sites. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure dropped to 80 mmHg after pain medication administration, indicating a risk for hypotension.
2. Sepsis: The presence of serosanguinous drainage and mixed urine and blood at the ostomy sites may indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: Although the patient is currently on invasive ventilation, there is a potential risk for respiratory failure if the ventilation support is discontinued.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 17,985 mL, indicating potential fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and cardiac complications.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous"

   post-operatively after a sigmoid to anus resection, colostomy, bladder
   and distal ureteral resection, ureteral diversion to small bowel, and
   entero-gastric anastamoses with gastrostomy, gracilis and thigh skin
   flap reconstruction of pelvis and is stable currently.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension - most likely volume related at this time, per surgical
   service, will resuscitate aggressively with fluids.  LVEF=55% in [**Month (only) 591**]
   [**2136**].
   - Continuous LR at 125/hr finished this morning but will plan to bolus
   PRN per surgery recs and goal CVP 14-16 today with MAP above 60.
   - Will use PRN neosynephrine to keep MAP > 60 and UOP > 40cc/hr
   alongside PRN fluid boluses.
   .
   # Respiratory
 Extubated successfully this morning and doing well with
   oxygen saturations above 95% on low flow NC. Will get a repeat ABG on
   monitor today while maintianig BPs and will assess pain medications to
   anticipate possible oversedation and impairment in respiratory status.
   Pain moderately controlled now, will discuss possible PCA bolus with
   suregery/pain team.
   .
   # Abdominal surgery - NG tube to low-continous suction per surgical
   service, NPO, IV fluids.
   - Continue anti-emetics, will discuss discontinuation timeframe of NGT
   with surgery today
   - Tight glycemic control, ISS and gtt if needed, for wound healing.
   - TID hematocrit, transfuse for hematocrit fall > 3, hemodynamically
   stable now, will quantify specific HCT goal with surgery today as Hct
   has dropped from 35-30 to mid twenties, all likely [**1-26**] dilutional IVF
   effects but will touch base w/surgery

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of recurrent rectal cancer. He presented with hypotension post-operatively after undergoing a sigmoid to anus resection, colostomy, bladder and distal ureteral resection, ureteral diversion to small bowel, and entero-gastric anastamoses with gastrostomy, gracilis and thigh skin flap reconstruction of the pelvis. The patient is currently stable in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which could be due to volume loss or other factors. The surgical service recommends aggressive fluid resuscitation to address this issue.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient was intubated but successfully extubated in the morning. Oxygen saturation levels are above 95% on low flow NC. However, it is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status and assess for possible oversedation and impairment.

3. Abdominal Surgery Complications: The patient had abdominal surgery, including NG tube placement to low-continuous suction. It is important to continue anti-emetics and discuss discontinuation timeframe of NGT with the surgical team. The patient should be kept NPO and receive IV fluids.

4. Wound Healing: The patient's wound healing should be closely monitored, and tight glycemic control should be maintained. The use of insulin sliding scale and glucose checks will be necessary for this purpose.

5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels should be monitored and corrected as needed. IV fluids and electrolyte repletion will be necessary.

6. Blood Transfusion: The patient's hematocrit levels have dropped significantly. Close monitoring of HCT levels is recommended, and transfusion for hematocrit fall >3 is advised.

7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and surgery. Heparin SC and other appropriate measures should be taken for DVT prophylaxis.

8. Pressure Ulcers: Due to prolonged immobility, the patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and use of pressure-relieving devices should be implemented.

9. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's recent mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Proper hand hygiene, early ambulation, and other preventive measures should be implemented.

10. Infection: The patient is at risk for surgical site infections and other infections due to the invasive procedures performed. Close monitoring of vital signs, wound sites, and laboratory parameters is essential.

11. Cardiac Function: The patient has a history of heart disease, and his cardiac function should be closely monitored, especially with the use of vasopressors and fluid resuscitation.

12. Renal Function: The patient's renal function should be"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note. However, it is mentioned that the patient received 1 unit of blood overnight due to a decrease in hematocrit (Hct) from 26 to 23. The patient was also switched from patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) to intravenous (IV) pain relief on a prn basis using Dilaudid at a dose of 0.5-2 mg. Additionally, the patient continues to have serosanguinous drainage from three Jackson-Pratt (JP) drains and mixed urine and blood at the ureteral and colostomy sites. The patient's pain seems to be well-controlled, and they are maintaining good oxygen saturation (>95%) on just 2 liters of nasal cannula (NC).

The patient is still on invasive ventilation, but the specific mode and settings are not mentioned. There are no known drug allergies. The patient is receiving several medications including famotidine (Pepcid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Other medications, medical and family history, review of systems, and any changes are not detailed in the provided information.

The flow sheet data shows the patient's vital signs, including temperature (Tmax: 38.2°C), heart rate (HR: 103 bpm), blood pressure (BP: 172/80 mmHg), respiratory rate (RR: 32 breaths per"

   He was given 1 Unit of blood overnight for a Hct that had gone down to
   23 from 26 and Hct back up to 27 today. He was also switched overnight
   from his PCA to an IV PRN .5-2mg  Dilaudid schedule in addition to his
   epidural with Bupivacaine at 16cc/hr rate.  He continues to have
   serosanguinous drainage in 3 JP drains and mixed urine and blood at
   ureteral ostomy site and colostomy site in tact at RUQ.  Patient had
   good pain control overnight and was saturating well at >95% on just 2L

   Assessment and Plan :
   In summary, this is a 74 year-old male with a history of recurrent
   rectal CA who presented with hypotension
   post-operatively after a sigmoid to anus resection, colostomy, bladder
   and distal ureteral resection, ureteral diversion to small bowel, and
   entero-gastric anastamoses with gastrostomy, gracilis and thigh skin
   flap reconstruction of pelvis and is stable currently.
   Plan:
   # Hypotension
resolved , neosynephrine discontinued, pain medications
   and PCA adjusted yesterday
   #Hypertension - today
s SBP climbing to 160-170s range. Most likely
   pain related and volume related at this time given aggressive IV fluid
   schedule with 125cc/hr LR.  LVEF=55% in [**2137-6-25**], history of CAD.
   - will plan to continue PRN Lasix IV to get some fluid off
   -maintain goal CVP 14-16 today with MAP above 60 and UOP goal  >
   40cc/hr
   -f/up surgery recs
   -consider B-Blocker, HTN meds if needed
   .
   # SOB/ Respiratory
 Extubated successfully [**8-2**]. Doing well with oxygen
   saturations above 95% on low flow NC until 8 am this morning.
   -Will get a repeat ABG
   - will assess pain medications, touch base with acute pain team. Pain
   moderately controlled now.  Will continue IV PRN Dilaudid for now
   .
   # Abdominal surgery - still NPO, holding IV fluids now as per above.
   Continue anti-emetics PRN.
   - Tight glycemic control, ISS and gtt if needed, for wound healing.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hematocrit, transfuse for hematocrit fall > 3, hemodynamically
   stable now.  Fall likely dilutional effect.
   # FEN:  IV fluids and electrolyte repletion PRN

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of metastatic rectal cancer who underwent pelvic exoneration surgery. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several complications.

1. Hypotension: The patient's post-operative course was initially complicated by hypotension. However, it is now noted that he has become hypertensive and volume overloaded. Diuresis with IV lasix has been initiated to address this issue.

2. Pain control: The patient requires ongoing pain management, and IV dilaudid boluses along with a bupivicaine epidural have been prescribed. A pain service consult has also been requested.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and goals have been set to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, central venous pressure (CVP) between 14-16, and urine output (UOP) above 40 cc/hr. Beta-blockade and an ACE inhibitor are planned to start today.

4. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2 into low 90s) may be related to volume overload and atelectasis. Diuresis, incentive spirometry, and supplemental oxygen have been recommended to improve oxygenation.

5. Abdominal surgery: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) except for ice chips. Reglan has been continued to promote gastrointestinal motility.

   control.  This a.m. dose initially held as BP in 113/67.  ART line
   readings inconsistent with cuff reads. Eventually received 7.5mg dose
   at 6:20am when BP returned to 150s systolic. Pt comfortable and

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year-old male with a history of recurrent rectal CA who presented
   with hypotension
   post-operatively after a sigmoid to anus resection, colostomy, bladder
   and distal ureteral resection, ureteral diversion to small bowel, and
   entero-gastric anastamoses with gastrostomy, gracilis and thigh skin
   flap reconstruction of pelvis and is stable currently.
   Plan:
   # Hypotension
resolved , neosynephrine discontinued, pain medications
   and PCA adjusted yesterday.
   #Hypertension - yesterday SBP climbing to 160-170s range, with high in
   low 200s. Most likely pain related and volume related given large fluid
   shifts. Also has baseline HTN.  LVEF=55% in [**2137-6-25**], history of CAD.
   - Will continue Metoprolol, change dose to 7.5mg IV q6 for better BP
   control.
   - Consider transition to pt
s home PO meds when pt nears discharge
   -Maintain goal CVP 14-16 today with MAP above 60 and UOP goal  >
   40cc/hr, per surgery
   -F/u surgery recs
   .
   # SOB/ Respiratory
 Extubated successfully [**8-2**]. Satting well now on
   2LNC in  upper 90s. Likely improved now also as pain better controlled.
   - Will continue Bupivicaine/Dilaudid epidural per pain recs
   - Dilaudid IV PRN d/c
ed yesterday
   - Continue to encourage incentive spirometry and have pt OOB to chair
   again today
   .
   # Abdominal surgery - still NPO, holding IV fluids now as per above.
   Continue anti-emetics PRN.
   - Tight glycemic control, ISS and gtt if needed, for wound healing.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hematocrit, transfuse for hematocrit fall > 3, hemodynamically
   stable now.
   - Will transfuse 1 uPRBC this a.m. per Surgery request (Hct 26.3, 27.6
   yesterday). Check hct in p.m. post-transfusion.
   .
   # FEN:  IV fluids and electrolyte repletion PRN
   .
   # Access: PIV, Portacath, RIJ, A-line-> will pull this today as
   currently ineffective for BP monitoring and draws
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of recurrent rectal cancer who presented with hypotension post-operatively after undergoing a sigmoid to anus resection, colostomy, bladder and distal ureteral resection, ureteral diversion to small bowel, and entero-gastric anastomoses with gastrostomy, gracilis and thigh skin flap reconstruction of the pelvis. The patient is currently stable.

The patient required 40% facemask in the afternoon to maintain saturation in the 90s and was given Lasix 20mg IV with good urine output (approximately 3 liters negative up to that point over 24 hours). The patient's blood pressure was elevated to 200s systolic over yesterday, with heart rate in the 80s-100s. Lopressor was started at 5mg IV q6 and then changed to 7.5mg IV q4 for better blood pressure control. The dose was initially held as blood pressure returned to 150s systolic, but the patient eventually received the 7.5mg dose at 6:20am when blood pressure returned to 150s systolic. The patient is comfortable and asymptomatic in the morning.

The patient's pain control was switched to an epidural of Bupivicaine/Dilaudid 6-12cc/hr per pain consult. The patient denies any pain or nausea. Allergies:"

   Plan:
   # Hypotension
resolved , neosynephrine discontinued, pain medications
   and PCA adjusted yesterday
   #Hypertension - today
s SBP climbing to 160-170s range. Most likely
   pain related and volume related at this time given aggressive IV fluid
   schedule with 125cc/hr LR.  LVEF=55% in [**2137-6-25**], history of CAD.
   - will plan to continue PRN Lasix IV to get some fluid off

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of recurrent rectal cancer. He presented with hypotension post-operatively after undergoing a sigmoid to anus resection, colostomy, bladder and distal ureteral resection, ureteral diversion to small bowel, and entero-gastric anastamoses with gastrostomy, gracilis and thigh skin flap reconstruction of pelvis. 

Over the past 24 hours, the patient required 40% facemask to maintain oxygen saturation in the 90s. Lasix 20mg IV was given with good urine output (approximately 3L negative up to that point). The patient was gradually weaned to 3L NC. His systolic blood pressure (SBP) was elevated to 200s over yesterday, with a heart rate (HR) in the 80s-100s. Lopressor at 5mg IV q6 was started, then changed to 7.5mg IV q4 for better blood pressure control. The initial dose was held as blood pressure was in 113/67, but eventually received the 7.5mg dose at 6:20am when blood pressure returned to 150s systolic. The patient is comfortable and asymptomatic this morning.

Pain control was switched to an epidural of Bupivicaine/Dilaudid 6-12cc/hr per pain consult.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with metastatic rectal cancer who underwent a pelvic exoneration. He experienced post-operative hypotension, which has since resolved, but now presents with hypertension. The patient has been diuresed with Lasix, weaned off oxygen therapy, and started on IV beta-blockade for hypertension. His pain is well-controlled with an epidural. He has shown improvement in his respiratory status. The patient's current issues include hypertension, volume overload, pain management, respiratory function, anemia, and disposition planning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HTN - Hypertension can be managed by continuing IV lopressor and spacing it out to every 6 hours. Once the patient is able to take oral medication, an ACE inhibitor can be resumed.
2. Volume Overload - The patient is autodiuresing, which suggests that his body is naturally eliminating excess fluid. This should help manage the volume overload.
3. Pain - The patient's pain is currently well-controlled with an epidural. It is recommended to continue the epidural and involve a pain service for further management.
4. Respiratory - The patient's respiratory status is improving with autodiuresis. It is advised to continue using Flovent and Combivent as needed. The patient should remain out of bed.
5. Anemia - The patient is receiving a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) at the surgical service's request.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with metastatic rectal cancer who underwent pelvic exoneration. He initially experienced post-operative hypotension, which has since resolved. The patient is now volume overloaded and hypertensive. The medical team has been managing his condition in the ICU, addressing various issues such as diuresis, pain control, hypertension, respiratory status, anemia, and disposition planning.

24-hour events include diuresis with lasix, weaning off oxygen to 3 liters nasal cannula, managing hypertension with IV beta-blockade, difficulty with arterial line, discontinuing and reinitiating epidural pain medication, and obtaining blood cultures.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds with diminished bases, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and midline incision with ostomy that is pink. Extremities show 1+ edema at the ankles, and neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine and lactate levels. Imaging reveals improved hilar fullness, elevated right hemidiaphragm, retrocardiac opacity with left costophrenic blunting, and properly positioned inferior vena cava filter.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Continue IV lopressor and space to Q6H. Resume ACE inhibitor when able to take orals for hypertension.
2) Aut"
