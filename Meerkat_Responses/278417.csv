","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely due to Dieulefoy's lesion. He presented with no other past medical history. The patient underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) which revealed a large clot and the lesion was clipped with 4 clips. He received an epinephrine injection and is currently hemodynamically stable. His vital signs are within normal range, except for orthostatic changes. He has received a total of 1000cc IV fluid bolus three times. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been decreasing from 32.1 to 26.3 over the past 24 hours. He is on pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis and has occasional bloating sensation in his abdomen. He denies nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or shortness of breath. The patient has had one small bowel movement and is passing flatus. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that could arise include:
1. Rebleeding: The patient may experience rebleeding from the Dieulefoy's lesion or another source in the gastrointestinal tract.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his indwelling lines and the immunosuppressive effects of critical illness.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of IV fluids, which puts him"

He underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) where a large clot was visualized and the lesion was clipped with 4 clips. The patient received an epinephrine injection and is currently hemodynamically stable.

The patient has two 18-gauge peripheral IVs in place. The current plan includes maintaining the current type and cross of blood products, as well as continuing IV fluid boluses as needed to achieve a goal urine output (UOP) greater than 40 cc/hr and a heart rate (HR) less than 100 beats per minute. The hematocrit (Hct) should be trended every six hours, and blood transfusions should be given if Hct is less than 21.

Follow-up gastrin levels and Helicobacter pylori testing are recommended per GI recommendations. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) IV is to be administered twice daily. The patient is to follow up with GI recommendations and repeat EGD in three to nine weeks unless rebleeding occurs and requires more urgent EGD. The patient will be monitored in the ICU until demonstrating durable stability, including a stable hematocrit and no longer being orthostatic.

The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) due to the recent upper GI bleed. He has two peripheral intravenous lines (PIV) in place"

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of GI bleed admitted for upper gastrointestinal bleeding likely due to a Dieulefoy's lesion. He had an endoscopic treatment with placement of 4 clips and epinephrine injection. The patient remained hemodynamically stable overnight without signs of intravascular volume depletion. He is positive for H. pylori antibodies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: Despite the endoscopic treatment, there is still a risk of rebleeding due to the underlying Dieulefoy's lesion.
2. Infection: The patient is receiving multiple medications and has been transfused with blood products, which increases the risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and wound or catheter site infections is important.
3. Transfusion reaction: The patient experienced a transfusion reaction with hives during the blood transfusion. This could be due to an allergic reaction or ABO incompatibility. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause and prevent future reactions.
4. H. pylori eradication therapy: The patient is undergoing sequential therapy for H. pylori infection. Monitoring for adverse effects of the antibiotics and ensuring compliance with the treatment regimen is important.
5. Gastric outlet obstruction: There is a mild tenderness to palpation inferior to the umbilicus, which could indicate the possibility of gastric outlet obstruction. Monitoring for symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain,"

","The patient in the ICU has a chief complaint of GI bleed. They experienced a transfusion reaction during a blood transfusion, which resulted in hives around the neck and back but no respiratory compromise. The transfusion was stopped, and diphenhydramine was given, leading to rapid resolution of symptoms. The hematocrit trend shows a decrease after the transfusion but returned to a near baseline level by the stat recheck.

The patient has allergies to erythromycin (oral) and hives. They were given pantoprazole (Protonix) at 08:00 PM. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 70 bpm (normal range: 70-88 bpm), blood pressure of 108/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute (normal range: 11-23 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient received a total input of 3,921 mL and had a total output of 4,225 mL, resulting in a fluid balance of -304 mL. Urine output was 4,225 mL, and there were no notable NG or stool outputs. Drains were not assessed.

The hematocrit trend showed a decrease from 28.1 to 21.3 after the transfusion, but then increased to 29.6 on recheck. 

The hemolysis labs indicated a total bilirubin of 0.8, LDH of 119, reticulocyte count of 2.3%, and haptoglobin of 90. 

The patient's vital signs were stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/62 to 97/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's cardiovascular examination revealed regular rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. Peripheral pulses were present in both radial arteries. 

The respiratory/chest examination showed clear breath sounds. 

The gastrointestinal examination found normoactive bowel sounds, soft abdomen, mild tenderness inferior to the umbilicus, and no lower extremity edema.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 2274**] is a 25 year old male with a PMH significant for GI bleed in
   [**2119**] admitted for upper GIB likely due to Dieulefoy
s lesion
   .
   # UGIB: Patient is s/p EGD with large clot visualized (4 clips placed
   and epi injected) likely representing dieulefoy's lesion.  The patient
   was hemodynamically stable overnight without signs of intravascular
   volume depletion including hypotension or tachycardia.  Patient is H.
   pylori antibody positive.
   - Monitor VS for signs of hemodynamic instability
   - Trend hct, type and crossed, transfuse if hct<21
   - Sequential therapy for H.pylori: PPI and amoxicillin x 5 days, then
   PPI, clarithromycin, and tinidazole x 5 days
   - F/u gastrin
   - PPI IV bid, switch to po.
   - F/u GI recs. Pplan to repeat EGD in [**3-9**] weeks per GI unless rebleeds
   and needs more urgent EGD
   .
   # FEN: Patient tolerating full liquids. ADAT, replete as necessary.
   .
   # Access: PIV
   .
   # PPx:  pneumoboots,  PPI.

   Present for the key portions of history and exam. Agree with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 784**]
   note as above.  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 2291**] is feeling well and remains hemodyn stable.
   No evidence of further bleeding.  Plan to treat H pylori. Gastrin is
   pending.  Remains at small risk of rebleed but should do well.
   Time spent: 35 min

","Summary:
- Patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of GI bleed.
- He was admitted for an upper GI bleed likely due to Dieulefoy's lesion.
- The patient underwent an EGD procedure, where a large clot was visualized and treated with clips and epinephrine injection.
- The patient remained hemodynamically stable overnight without signs of intravascular volume depletion.
- The patient is H. pylori antibody positive.
- The plan includes monitoring vital signs for signs of hemodynamic instability, trending hematocrit levels, and transfusing if hematocrit drops below 21.
- The patient will receive sequential therapy for H. pylori, which includes a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and amoxicillin for 5 days, followed by a PPI, clarithromycin, and tinidazole for another 5 days.
- The patient's gastrin levels will be followed up.
- The patient will be started on PPI IV twice daily, which will be switched to oral once stable.
- The patient is advised to follow gastrointestinal recommendations and will have an EGD repeat in 3-9 weeks unless there is rebleeding and an urgent EGD is required.
- The patient is tolerating full liquids well and will continue to be monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: Although the patient is currently stable, there is still a risk of rebleeding, which can lead to further GI bleeding and potentially"
