","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of large B-cell lymphoma, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain and was found to have a small bowel perforation. He underwent emergent surgery for small bowel jejunum resection and repair. The patient has been in the ICU since then and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.

Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel perforation: The patient had an overnight small bowel perforation, which required emergency surgery. This complication can lead to sepsis and peritonitis.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been in the low 90s systolic blood pressures over the past several weeks, which may be due to his underlying medical conditions or medication effects. Hypotension can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Anemia: The patient has a history of chronic anemia and is currently receiving chemotherapy for large B-cell lymphoma. Chemotherapy can further suppress bone marrow function and worsen anemia.
4. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient has longstanding diabetes mellitus type II, which requires careful glycemic control. Poorly controlled diabetes can increase the risk of infections and delay wound healing.
5. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, including a prior inferior myocardial infarction. This increases the"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of large B-cell lymphoma, hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), and diabetes mellitus type II (DM-II). He underwent emergent surgery for an overnight small bowel perforation and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
- Heart Rate: 63 bpm
- Blood Pressure: 104/43 mmHg
- Respiratory Rate: 14 breaths per minute
- Oxygen Saturation: 97% on room air

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 8,437 mL and output of 2,510 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 5,927 mL. His central venous pressure (CVP) is steady in the mid-90s.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and complications, including:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive with SBPs in the low 90s for several weeks prior to admission and post-op. Possible causes include sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or volume depletion.
   - Plan: Continue ongoing IV fluids with lactated Ringer's (LR) and consider other sources of infection if the patient remains hypotensive with low urine output despite fluid repletion.
   
2. Small bowel perforation: The patient presented with acute abdominal pain"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Mr. [Known Lastname 8842] is a 73-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of large B-cell lymphoma, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus type II. He is currently in the ICU after undergoing emergent surgery for a small bowel perforation. The patient's recent medical history includes acute abdominal pain and a confirmed small bowel perforation. In the operating room, he underwent small bowel jejunum resection and repair. He did not require any blood transfusions during surgery and his hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is now stable at 26-28 range. There are no signs of active bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing low blood pressure readings in the low 90s systolic blood pressure over the past several weeks. This could be due to various factors such as pain medications, underlying conditions, or electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid administration is recommended.
2. Infection: Given the recent surgery and prolonged hospital stay, there is a risk of infection. Antibiotic coverage with Zosyn/Flagyl is recommended, and blood cultures should be monitored for any signs of infection.
3. Anemia: The patient has a history of chronic anemia and ongoing chemotherapy treatment. Close monitoring of blood counts and consideration of blood transfusions if Hct drops below 25.
4. Diabetes Management: The patient's diabetes management may be"

   bowel perforation. Here in O.R. surgical team did small bowel jejunum
   resection and repair. He has no external drains at this time and has
   well-appearing mid-line closure in place. He did not require any blood
   transfusions in OR and Hct is now stable at 26-28 range. No signs of
   active bleeding.
   .
   --follow-up surgery recommendations
   --will continue on Zosyn/Flagyl Abx coverage
   --continue IVFs with 100cc/hr LR overnight
   --will wean Fentanyl & continue Dilaudid PCA for pain control
   --monitor UOP with goal >30cc/hr
   --serial abdominal exams
   --f/up blood cultures
   --active T&S
   --monitor fevers, CBC trends
   .
   #Hypotension - He has been in the low 90s SBPs over past several weeks
   per OMR and oncology team. He is now post-op and on pain medications
   which can lower BP so will monitor closely.
   .
   --continue ongoing IVFs with LR
   --continue to wean levophed pressor as tolerates
   --will continue on stress dose hydrocortisone 100mg q8hrs (he had been
   on 2mg Dexamethasone daily pre-op)
   .
   # Large B-cell lymphoma -Patient was diagnosed with MDS on bone marrow
   biopsy in [**2102**] and now has new diagnosis of large B-cell lymphoma
   diagnosed about 6-7 weeks ago. He is now s/p 2nd cycle, day #13 R-CHOP
   with PET-CT last done on [**6-6**]. Cell counts have been dropping since
   last chemotherapy session.
   .
   -follow-up oncology recommendations, appreciate input
   -continue on neupogen daily
   -continue monitor CBC/diff daily
   -tumor lysis labs [**Hospital1 7**] per oncology
   -[**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes
   -continue Fe, Vit B12
   -transfuse for Hct drop <25
   .
   #DM-II- Longstanding history of DM-II which is managed with home oral
   glipizide therapy.
   --Will continue NPO for now
   --continue holding PO glipizide for now given NPO
   --once eating will implement QID FSGs, diabetic/cardiac healthy diet
   and SSI coverage
   .
   #HTN - He is now in the low 90-110 SBPs range and he has had low BPs in
   similar ranges in recent weeks per OMR notes. Will continue to hold all
   anti-HTN medications at this time.
   .
   #CAD: He has known prior inferior MI. Once awake will monitor for any
   chest pains. No new ischemic changes on pre-op EKG.
       - holding all ASA in setting of recent surgery
       - repeat STAT EKG
       -continue telemetry

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of large B-cell lymphoma, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus type II. He is currently post-operative after emergent surgery for an overnight small bowel perforation. The patient's medical history includes chronic anemia, acute abdominal pain, and a previous inferior myocardial infarction.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/43 mmHg to 91/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm.

The patient has undergone multiple surgeries and procedures, including small bowel jejunum resection and repair, placement of arterial and venous lines, and administration of various medications such as antibiotics, pain medications, and stress dose hydrocortisone.

The patient's laboratory results indicate low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood cultures were positive for Last Name (LF) 4696 and First Name3 (LF) 755 hospital bacteria.
