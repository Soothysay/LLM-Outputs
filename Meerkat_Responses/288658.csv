   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart cath.
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading
   to elevated elastic pressures. ABG initially showed chronic respiratory
   acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, may be due to obesity
   hypoventilation/Pickwickian syndrome, but repeat ABG showed normal
   gas.  Initially pt was diuresed with lasix gtt (40 mg IV bolus x1),
   which was held in the setting of hypotension and poor UOP.  Patient was
   put on Assist Control throughout the night here in CCU, and PEEP was
   down-titrated from 12 to 8 with good oxygenation.
   - change from AC to pressure support
   - decrease and wean off propofol
   - wean ventilator as tolerated
   - start lasix diuresis once pt is off pressor
   - attempt to extubate this am
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient had pre-procedure SBP of 140s. After arriving on
   the CCU floor, non-invasive approach revealed BP in the 90-100s/40s.
   However, patient had no UOP to lasix bolus and gtt, so A-line was
   placed. Placement of A-line showed SBPs of 70s, indicating relative
   hypotension. Etiologies include sedation/mechanical ventilation which
   are more likely given the acute change versus sepsis given recent
   diagnosis of cellulitis treated with 10 days of keflex, fever noted on
   CCU admission, hypotension, and decreased urine output.  Patient was
   started on neo gtt for MAP>65.  Lasix gtt was held. PEEP was turned
   down from 12 to 8 with adequate oxygenation.
   - turn off neo this morning and see if pt can maintain BP on his own
   - decrease and wean off propofol
   - extubate today if possible
   - hold placement of CVL for now given possible extubation this AM; will
   place if pressor requirements increase.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - check  c. diff toxin assay
   - continue broad coverage abx (vanc and cefepime)
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cre up to 1.7 on admission and up to 2.1 this AM
   (baseline 1.1).  Patient relatively oliguric on admission to the CCU
   with only 40 ccs of dark urine output to 20 of IV lasix administered in
   the PACU.   After lasix gtt was started last night, UOP was close to
   zero.  After neo was started, UOP finally picked up after a few hours.
   At 6am, UOP was 250cc/hr. Most likely pre-renal in setting of
   hypotension during the procedure due to sedation/intubation, leading to
   ATN (intrarenal).  FeUrea is 10, indicating pre-renal etiology. Other
   etiologies (though less likely) include poor forward flow in setting of
   depressed EF% versus overdiuresis with PO lasix at home. No recent
   contrast administration.
   - turn off neo and see if he can maintain BP on his own
   - renal consult this AM
   - hold lasix gtt for now
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] for now
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Fever: Pt with T to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, spiked to 101.4
   overnight. Likely febrile in setting of recent procedure. Hypotension,
   although more likely due to sedation/intubation is somewhat concerning
   for possible sepsis.  UA is negative.
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - f/u CXR
   - tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - continue broad coverage abx (vanc and cefepime)
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Long-standing but bilirubin is very high at 2.7
   this am. Etiologies include [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome, fatty liver and biliary
   stasis, CHF and biliary stasis, acalculous cholecystitis, gallstone
   cholecystitis. Patient sedated with propofol overnight given quick
   on/off for sedation. Patient received fentanyl and versed but was
   reportedly not well sedated during the procedure on this regimen,
   resulting in switch to propofol. Per discussion with pharmacy, OK to
   sedate with propofol temporarily overnight (12 hours) if extubation
   planned this AM.
   - f/u on direct and indirect bili
   - consider RUQ US
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   # PUMP: Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, thought to be viral in
   etiology. Likely has chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure (EF
   25% on [**9-28**].) Elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC
   today with severe pulmonary hypertension. Patient received lasix 20 mg
   IV x1 in PACU and 40 IV x1 in CCU followed by lasix gtt, which was then
   held in the setting of hypotension noted on A-line readings (which were
   ~20 pts lower than non-invasive readings) and poor urine output.
   - hold lasix gtt for now
   - fluid restriction, low Na diet, strict Is and Os, foley, daily
   weights
   - continue BB, digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 25%. One
   episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 this am.
   - will need PA/lateral CXR once pt is extubated to check lead position
   - EP to interrogate pacer in AM
   - replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - continue beta-blocker and digoxin
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD.
   - continue ASA, beta-blocker
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] in setting acute renal failure
   .
   # Asthma:
   - albuterol inhaler prn
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.
   - Trend Hct.
   - Continue iron supplements with bowel regimen and vitamin C once able
   to take PO.
   .
   # OSA:
   - restart/encourage nocturnal CPAP at home once extubated.

","The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate post-elective AICD placement and right heart cath. He has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Failure to extubate: The patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU following ICD placement, EP study, and right heart cardiac catheterization. This could be due to extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume overload from the patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading to elevated elastic pressures. The ABG initially showed chronic respiratory acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, possibly due to obesity hypoventilation/Pickwickian syndrome, but the repeat ABG showed normal gases. The plan is to change from AC to pressure support, decrease and wean off propofol, wean ventilator as tolerated, start lasix diuresis once the patient is off pressor, and attempt to extubate this morning.

2. Hypotension: The patient had pre-procedure SBP of 140s. After arriving on the CCU floor, non-invasive BP readings were in the 90-100s/40s. However, the patient had no UOP after lasix bolus and gtt, so an arterial line was placed. Placement of A-line showed SBPs of 70s, indicating"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart cath.
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading
   to elevated elastic pressures. ABG initially showed chronic respiratory
   acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, may be due to obesity
   hypoventilation/Pickwickian syndrome, but repeat ABG showed normal
   gas.  Initially pt was diuresed with lasix gtt (40 mg IV bolus x1),
   which was held in the setting of hypotension and poor UOP.  Patient was
   put on Assist Control throughout the night here in CCU, and PEEP was
   down-titrated from 12 to 8 with good oxygenation.
   - change from AC to pressure support
   - decrease and wean off propofol
   - wean ventilator as tolerated
   - start lasix diuresis once pt is off pressor
   - attempt to extubate this am
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient had pre-procedure SBP of 140s. After arriving on
   the CCU floor, non-invasive approach revealed BP in the 90-100s/40s.
   However, patient had no UOP to lasix bolus and gtt, so A-line was
   placed. Placement of A-line showed SBPs of 70s, indicating relative
   hypotension. Etiologies include sedation/mechanical ventilation which
   are more likely given the acute change, sepsis given recent diagnosis
   of cellulitis treated with 10 days of keflex, fever noted on CCU
   admission, or cardiogenic which are less likely given the acute time
   course of events, i.e., his BP was good prior to the procedure.
   Patient was started on neo gtt for MAP>65.  Lasix gtt was held. PEEP
   was turned down from 12 to 8 with adequate oxygenation.
   - turn off neo this morning and see if pt can maintain BP on his own
   - decrease and wean off propofol
   - extubate today if possible
   - hold placement of CVL for now given possible extubation this AM; will
   place if pressor requirements increase.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - check  c. diff toxin assay
   - continue broad coverage abx (vanc and cefepime)
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cre up to 1.7 on admission and up to 2.1 this AM
   (baseline 1.1).  Patient relatively oliguric on admission to the CCU
   with only 40 ccs of dark urine output to 20 of IV lasix administered in
   the PACU.   After lasix gtt was started last night, UOP was close to
   zero.  After neo was started, UOP finally picked up after a few hours.
   At 6am, UOP was 250cc/hr. Most likely pre-renal in setting of
   hypotension during the procedure due to sedation/intubation, leading to
   ATN (intrarenal).  FeUrea is 10, indicating pre-renal etiology. Other
   etiologies (though less likely) include poor forward flow in setting of
   depressed EF% versus overdiuresis with PO lasix at home. No recent
   contrast administration.
   - turn off neo and see if he can maintain BP on his own
   - renal consult this AM
   - hold lasix gtt for now
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] for now
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Fever: Pt with T to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, spiked to 101.4
   overnight. Likely febrile in setting of recent procedure. Hypotension,
   although more likely due to sedation/intubation is somewhat concerning
   for possible sepsis.  UA is negative.
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - f/u CXR
   - tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - continue broad coverage abx (vanc and cefepime)
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Long-standing but bilirubin is very high at 2.7
   this am. Etiologies include [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome, fatty liver and biliary
   stasis, CHF and biliary stasis, acalculous cholecystitis, gallstone
   cholecystitis. Patient sedated with propofol overnight given quick
   on/off for sedation. Patient received fentanyl and versed but was
   reportedly not well sedated during the procedure on this regimen,
   resulting in switch to propofol. Per discussion with pharmacy, OK to
   sedate with propofol temporarily overnight (12 hours) if extubation
   planned this AM.
   - f/u on direct and indirect bili
   - consider RUQ US
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   # PUMP: Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, thought to be viral in
   etiology. Likely has chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure (EF
   25% on [**9-28**].) Elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC
   today with severe pulmonary hypertension. Patient received lasix 20 mg
   IV x1 in PACU and 40 IV x1 in CCU followed by lasix gtt, which was then
   held in the setting of hypotension noted on A-line readings (which were
   ~20 pts lower than non-invasive readings) and poor urine output.
   - hold lasix gtt for now
   - fluid restriction, low Na diet, strict Is and Os, foley, daily
   weights
   - continue BB, digoxin

   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 25%. One
   episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 this am.
   - will need PA/lateral CXR once pt is extubated to check lead position

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient has a history of chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure, with elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, with an endotracheal tube in place, and has been sedated with propofol. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90-100s/40s, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension, fever, acute renal failure, hyperbilirubinemia, and a history of anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Failure to extubate: The patient's inability to be extubated may be due to extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance resulting from volume overload caused by systolic and diastolic heart failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be attributed to several factors, including sedation/mechanical ventilation, sepsis (given recent diagnosis of cellulitis treated with 10 days of keflex), fever noted on CCU admission, or cardiogenic causes which are less"

   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading
   to elevated elastic pressures. ABG initially showed chronic respiratory
   acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, may be due to obesity
   hypoventilation/Pickwickian syndrome, but repeat ABG showed normal
   gas.  Initially pt was diuresed with lasix gtt (40 mg IV bolus x1),
   which was held in the setting of hypotension and poor UOP.  Patient was
   put on Assist Control throughout the night here in CCU, and PEEP was

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy who was admitted to the CCU after failing to extubate following elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. He is currently intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation with PEEP at 8 cmH2O. The patient has a history of obesity, systolic and diastolic heart failure, and recent cellulitis treated with cephalexin. He presented with hypotension and oliguria upon admission, which improved with neo and weaning off propofol. His urine output increased to 250cc/hr after starting neo. The patient also has elevated creatinine levels, indicating acute renal failure. His bilirubin level is high, and he is febrile with a temperature of 101.4°F. The patient has a history of asthma, anemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Failure to wean off mechanical ventilation: The patient's inability to be extubated post-procedure suggests the possibility of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Hypotension and shock: The patient's initial hypotension and oliguria raise concerns for septic shock, especially given his recent infection and fever.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels and oliguria indicate possible AKI, which could be pre-renal due to hypotension or intrinsic renal injury.
4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's high bilirubin level requires further evaluation for potential causes such as biliary stasis, cholecystitis, or liver dysfunction.
5. Fever: The patient's fever could be indicative of an ongoing infection or inflammatory response, necessitating further investigation and appropriate antibiotic coverage.
6. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS): Given the patient's morbid obesity and chronic respiratory acidosis, OHS should be considered and managed accordingly.
7. Cardiac complications: As a patient with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, he is at risk for further cardiac events like arrhythmias or worsening heart failure.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the information provided in the progress note. Additional clinical information and tests may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart cath.
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization.
   Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large
   body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume overload from
   patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading to elevated
   elastic pressures. ABG initially showed chronic respiratory acidosis
   with appropriate metabolic compensation, may be due to obesity
   hypoventilation/Pickwickian syndrome, but repeat ABG showed normal
   gas.  Initially pt was diuresed with lasix gtt (40 mg IV bolus x1),
   which was held in the setting of hypotension and poor UOP.  Patient was
   put on Assist Control throughout the night here in CCU, and PEEP was
   down-titrated from 12 to 8 with good oxygenation.
   - decrease and wean off propofol
   - wean ventilator as tolerated
   - start lasix diuresis once pt is off pressor
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient had pre-procedure SBP of 140s. After arriving on
   the CCU floor, non-invasive approach revealed BP in the 90-100s/40s.
   However, patient had no UOP to lasix bolus and gtt, so A-line was
   placed. Placement of A-line showed SBPs of 70s, indicating relative
   hypotension. Etiologies include sedation/mechanical ventilation versus
   sepsis given recent diagnosis of cellulitis treated with 10 days of
   keflex, fever noted on CCU admission, hypotension, and decreased urine
   output.  Patient was started on neo gtt for MAP>65.  Lasix gtt was
   held. PEEP was turned down from 12 to 8 with adequate oxygenation.
   - turn off neo this morning and see if pt can maintain BP on his own
   - extubate today if possible
   - hold placement of CVL for now given possible extubation this AM; will
   place if pressor requirements increase.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - check  c. diff toxin assay
   - continue broad coverage abx (vanc and cefepime)
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cre up to 1.7 on admission and up to 2.1 this AM
   (baseline 1.1).  Patient relatively oliguric on admission to the CCU
   with only 40 ccs of dark urine output to 20 of IV lasix administered in
   the PACU.   After lasix gtt was started last night, UOP was close to
   zero.  After neo was started, UOP finally picked up after a few hours.
   At 6am, UOP was 250cc/hr. Most likely pre-renal in setting of
   hypotension during the procedure due to sedation/intubation, leading to
   ATN (intrarenal).  FeUrea is 10, indicating pre-renal etiology. Other
   etiologies (though less likely) include poor forward flow in setting of
   depressed EF% versus overdiuresis with PO lasix at home. No recent
   contrast administration.
   - turn off neo and see if he can maintain BP on his own
   - renal consult this AM
   - hold lasix gtt for now
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] for now
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Fever: Pt with T to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, spiked to 101.4
   overnight. Likely febrile in setting of recent procedure. Hypotension,
   although more likely due to sedation/intubation is somewhat concerning
   for possible sepsis.  UA is negative.
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - f/u CXR
   - tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - continue broad coverage abx (vanc and cefepime)
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Long-standing but bilirubin is very high at 2.7
   this am. Etiologies include [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome, fatty liver and biliary
   stasis, CHF and biliary stasis, acalculous cholecystitis, gallstone
   cholecystitis. Patient sedated with propofol overnight given quick
   on/off for sedation. Patient received fentanyl and versed but was
   reportedly not well sedated during the procedure on this regimen,
   resulting in switch to propofol. Per discussion with pharmacy, OK to
   sedate with propofol temporarily overnight (12 hours) if extubation
   planned this AM.
   - f/u on direct and indirect bili
   - consider RUQ US
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   # PUMP: Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, thought to be viral in
   etiology. Likely has chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure (EF
   25% on [**9-28**].) Elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC
   today with severe pulmonary hypertension. Patient received lasix 20 mg
   IV x1 in PACU and 40 IV x1 in CCU followed by lasix gtt, which was then
   held in the setting of hypotension noted on A-line readings (which were
   ~20 pts lower than non-invasive readings) and poor urine output.
   - hold lasix gtt for now
   - fluid restriction, low Na diet, strict Is and Os, foley, daily
   weights
   - continue BB, digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 25%. One
   episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 this am.
   - will need PA/lateral CXR once pt is extubated to check lead position
   - EP to interrogate pacer in AM
   - replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - continue beta-blocker and digoxin
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD.
   - continue ASA, beta-blocker
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] in setting acute renal failure
   .
   # Asthma:
   - albuterol inhaler prn
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.
   - Trend Hct.
   - Continue iron supplements with bowel regimen and vitamin C once able
   to take PO.
   .
   # OSA:
   - restart/encourage nocturnal CPAP at home once extubated.

","The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate post-elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU, likely due to extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume overload from the patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading to elevated elastic pressures. The ABG initially showed chronic respiratory acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, possibly due to obesity hypoventilation/Pickwickian syndrome, but a repeat ABG showed normal gas exchange.

The patient had hypotension pre-procedure with a SBP of 140s, but after arriving in the CCU floor, non-invasive BP readings were in the 90-100s/40s. An arterial line was placed, showing SBPs of 70s, indicating relative hypotension. Etiologies include sedation/mechanical ventilation versus sepsis given recent diagnosis of cellulitis treated with 10 days of Keflex, fever noted on CCU admission, hypotension, and decreased urine output. The patient was started on neo gtt for MAP>65. PEEP was turned down from 12 to 8 with adequate oxygenation.

The patient also has acute renal failure with a creatinine level up to 2.1 (baseline 1.1). The patient was oliguric on admission to the CCU with only 40 ccs of dark urine output to 20 of IV lasix administered in the PACU. After starting lasix gtt, UOP was close to zero. After neo was started, UOP finally picked up after a few hours, reaching 250cc/hr at 6am. The most likely etiology is pre-renal in setting of hypotension during the procedure due to sedation/intubation, leading to ATN (intrarenal). 

The patient also has a fever with a temperature of 101.2 on arrival to CCU, which spiked to 101.4 overnight. This could be due to recent procedure-related infection or sepsis. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and CXR are pending. The patient has hyperbilirubinemia with bilirubin levels very high at 2.7 this am. Possible etiologies include [Doctor Last Name] syndrome, fatty liver, biliary stasis, CHF, and biliary stasis, acalculous cholecystitis, gallstone cholecystitis. 

The patient has non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, thought to be viral in etiology. He has chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure (EF 25% on [9-28]). Elevated left and right heart pressures were noted on RHC today with severe pulmonary hypertension. The patient received lasix"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following an elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a fever of 101.4. He has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, hypotension, and an elevated creatinine level of 2.1. Other findings include hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and obesity with associated complications such as morbid obesity, pitting edema, venous stasis changes, and a large body habitus. The patient's medical history includes asthma, OSA, iron deficiency anemia, and chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%. He is currently receiving various medications including diuretics, vasopressors, antibiotics, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and oliguric output indicate possible acute renal failure. This could be due to pre-renal causes such as hypotension during the procedure or intrinsic renal damage. Further evaluation and management are required, including holding lasix gtt and consulting a nephrologist.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure readings throughout the ICU stay suggest hypotension. This could be attributed to sedation, mechanical ventilation, sepsis"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart cath.
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading
   to elevated elastic pressures. ABG initially showed chronic respiratory
   acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, may be due to obesity
   hypoventilation/Pickwickian syndrome, but repeat ABG showed normal
   gas.  Initially pt was diuresed with lasix gtt (40 mg IV bolus x1),
   which was held in the setting of hypotension and poor UOP.  Patient was
   put on Assist Control throughout the night here in CCU, and PEEP was
   down-titrated from 12 to 8 with good oxygenation.
   - change from AC to pressure support
   - decrease and wean off propofol
   - wean ventilator as tolerated
   - start lasix diuresis once pt is off pressor
   - attempt to extubate this am
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient had pre-procedure SBP of 140s. After arriving on
   the CCU floor, non-invasive approach revealed BP in the 90-100s/40s.
   However, patient had no UOP to lasix bolus and gtt, so A-line was
   placed. Placement of A-line showed SBPs of 70s, indicating relative
   hypotension. Etiologies include sedation/mechanical ventilation which
   are more likely given the acute change, sepsis given recent diagnosis
   of cellulitis treated with 10 days of keflex, fever noted on CCU
   admission, or cardiogenic which are less likely given the acute time
   course of events, i.e., his BP was good prior to the procedure.
   Patient was started on neo gtt for MAP>65.  Lasix gtt was held. PEEP
   was turned down from 12 to 8 with adequate oxygenation.
   - turn off neo this morning and see if pt can maintain BP on his own
   - decrease and wean off propofol
   - extubate today if possible
   - hold placement of CVL for now given possible extubation this AM; will
   place if pressor requirements increase and pt cannot be extubated,
   consider a swan-ganz catheter
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - check  c. diff toxin assay
   - continue broad coverage abx (vanc and levo)
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cre up to 1.7 on admission and up to 2.1 this AM
   (baseline 1.1).  Patient relatively oliguric on admission to the CCU
   with only 40 ccs of dark urine output to 20 of IV lasix administered in
   the PACU.   After lasix gtt was started last night, UOP was close to
   zero.  After neo was started, UOP finally picked up after a few hours.
   At 6am, UOP was 250cc/hr. Most likely pre-renal in setting of
   hypotension during the procedure due to sedation/intubation, leading to
   ATN (intrarenal).  FeUrea is 10, indicating pre-renal etiology. Other
   etiologies (though less likely) include poor forward flow in setting of
   depressed EF% versus overdiuresis with PO lasix at home. No recent
   contrast administration.
   - turn off neo and see if he can maintain BP on his own
   - renal consult if creatinine continues to go up this afternoon
   - hold lasix gtt for now
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] for now
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Fever: Pt with T to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, spiked to 101.4
   overnight. Likely febrile in setting of recent procedure. Hypotension,
   although more likely due to sedation/intubation is somewhat concerning
   for possible sepsis.  UA is negative.
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - f/u CXR
   - RUQ US
   - tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - continue broad coverage abx (vanc and levo)
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Long-standing but bilirubin is very high at 2.7
   this am. Etiologies include [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome, fatty liver and biliary
   stasis, CHF and biliary stasis, acalculous cholecystitis, gallstone
   cholecystitis,especially given fever. Patient sedated with propofol
   overnight given quick on/off for sedation. Patient received fentanyl
   and versed but was reportedly not well sedated during the procedure on
   this regimen, resulting in switch to propofol. Per discussion with
   pharmacy, OK to sedate with propofol temporarily overnight (12 hours)
   if extubation planned this AM.
   - f/u on direct and indirect bili
   - get RUQ US
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   # PUMP: Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, thought to be viral in
   etiology. Likely has chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure (EF
   25% on [**9-28**].) Elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC
   today with severe pulmonary hypertension. Patient received lasix 20 mg
   IV x1 in PACU and 40 IV x1 in CCU followed by lasix gtt, which was then
   held in the setting of hypotension noted on A-line readings (which were

   - get TTE today
   - hold lasix gtt for now
   - fluid restriction, low Na diet, strict Is and Os, foley, daily
   weights
   - continue BB, digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 25%. One
   episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 this am.
   - will need PA/lateral CXR once pt is extubated to check lead position
   - EP to interrogate pacer in AM
   - replete K > 4 Mg > 2

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   Patient with profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably
   secondary to prior heavy etoh and cocaine use (as per various reports
   from interviewers.  I have not had the opportunity to corroborate this
   hx).  His situation is grave, as his LV stroke work capacity is so
   profoundly reduced.  His morbid obesity, presumptive substance abuse
   problem, make cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable.  we need
   to attempt a definitive dx before implementing maximal therapy.
   Thererfore we will do left and right heart cath, endomyocardial bx, and
   pulmonary arterioloar vasodilator trila irf PVR is > 4 [**Doctor Last Name 2576**] units.
   Thereafter we will leave SGC in place and do tailored therapy
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]  on:[**2193-1-9**]

","The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy who was admitted to the CCU after failing to extubate following an elective AICD placement and right heart cath. The patient's current medical complications include failure to extubate, hypotension, acute renal failure, fever, hyperbilirubinemia, and dilated cardiomyopathy with severe pulmonary hypertension. 

Failure to extubate: The patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU following ICD placement, EP study, and right heart cardiac catherization. It is likely due to extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance caused by volume overload from the patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading to elevated elastic pressures. 

Hypotension: The patient had a pre-procedure SBP of 140s. After arriving in the CCU, non-invasive BP readings were in the 90-100s/40s. However, the patient had no urine output to lasix bolus and gtt, so an arterial line was placed. Placement of the arterial line showed SBPs of 70s, indicating relative hypotension. Etiologies include sedation/mechanical ventilation, sepsis, or cardiogenic causes. 

Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level increased from 1.1 to 2.1 this morning"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart cath.
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization.
   Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large
   body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume overload from
   patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading to elevated
   elastic pressures. ABG initially showed chronic respiratory acidosis
   with appropriate metabolic compensation, may be due to obesity
   hypoventilation/Pickwickian syndrome, but repeat ABG showed normal
   gas.  Initially pt was diuresed with lasix gtt (40 mg IV bolus x1),
   which was held in the setting of hypotension and poor UOP.  Patient was
   put on Assist Control throughout the night here in CCU, and PEEP was
   down-titrated from 12 to 8 with good oxygenation.
   - decrease and wean off propofol
   - wean ventilator as tolerated
   - start lasix diuresis once pt is off pressor
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient had pre-procedure SBP of 140s. After arriving on
   the CCU floor, non-invasive approach revealed BP in the 90-100s/40s.
   However, patient had no UOP to lasix bolus and gtt, so A-line was
   placed. Placement of A-line showed SBPs of 70s, indicating relative
   hypotension. Etiologies include sedation/mechanical ventilation versus
   sepsis given recent diagnosis of cellulitis treated with 10 days of
   keflex, fever noted on CCU admission, hypotension, and decreased urine
   output.  Patient was started on neo gtt for MAP>65.  Lasix gtt was
   held. PEEP was turned down from 12 to 8 with adequate oxygenation.
   - turn off neo this morning and see if pt can maintain BP on his own
   - extubate today if possible
   - hold placement of CVL for now given possible extubation this AM; will
   place if pressor requirements increase.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - check  c. diff toxin assay
   - continue broad coverage abx (vanc and cefepime)
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cre up to 1.7 on admission and up to 2.1 this AM
   (baseline 1.1).  Patient relatively oliguric on admission to the CCU
   with only 40 ccs of dark urine output to 20 of IV lasix administered in
   the PACU.   After lasix gtt was started last night, UOP was close to
   zero.  After neo was started, UOP finally picked up after a few hours.
   At 6am, UOP was 250cc/hr. Most likely pre-renal in setting of
   hypotension during the procedure due to sedation/intubation, leading to
   ATN (intrarenal).  FeUrea is 10, indicating pre-renal etiology. Other
   etiologies (though less likely) include poor forward flow in setting of
   depressed EF% versus overdiuresis with PO lasix at home. No recent
   contrast administration.
   - turn off neo and see if he can maintain BP on his own
   - renal consult this AM
   - hold lasix gtt for now
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] for now
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Fever: Pt with T to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, spiked to 101.4
   overnight. Likely febrile in setting of recent procedure. Hypotension,
   although more likely due to sedation/intubation is somewhat concerning
   for possible sepsis.  UA is negative.
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - f/u CXR
   - tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - continue broad coverage abx (vanc and cefepime)
   .
   # PUMP: Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, thought to be viral in
   etiology. Likely has chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure (EF
   25% on [**9-28**].) Elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC
   today with severe pulmonary hypertension. Patient received lasix 20 mg
   IV x1 in PACU and 40 IV x1 in CCU followed by lasix gtt, which was then
   held in the setting of hypotension noted on A-line readings (which were
   ~20 pts lower than non-invasive readings) and poor urine output.
   - hold lasix gtt for now
   - fluid restriction, low Na diet, strict Is and Os, foley, daily
   weights
   - continue BB, digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 25%. One
   episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 this am.
   - will need PA/lateral CXR once pt is extubated to check lead position
   - EP to interrogate pacer in AM
   - replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - continue beta-blocker and digoxin
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD.
   - continue ASA, beta-blocker
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] in setting acute renal failure
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Long-standing but bilirubin is very high at 2.7
   this am. Etiologies include [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome, fatty liver and biliary
   stasis, CHF and biliary stasis, acalculous cholecystitis, gallstone
   cholecystitis. Patient sedated with propofol overnight given quick
   on/off for sedation. Patient received fentanyl and versed but was
   reportedly not well sedated during the procedure on this regimen,
   resulting in switch to propofol. Per discussion with pharmacy, OK to
   sedate with propofol temporarily overnight (12 hours) if extubation
   planned this AM.
   - f/u on direct and indirect bili
   - consider RUQ US
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   # Asthma:
   - albuterol inhaler prn
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.
   - Trend Hct.
   - Continue iron supplements with bowel regimen and vitamin C once able
   to take PO.
   .
   # OSA:
   - restart/encourage nocturnal CPAP at home once extubated.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU. 

The patient has several medical complications that need attention:
1. Failure to wean from mechanical ventilation: The patient is currently on assist control ventilation and PEEP has been down-titrated from 12 to 8 with good oxygenation. The plan is to decrease and wean off propofol, wean ventilator as tolerated, and start lasix diuresis once the patient is off pressor.
2. Hypotension: The patient initially had a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140s, but after arriving in the CCU, the SBP was in the 90-100s/40s. The patient had no urine output (UOP) after receiving lasix bolus and gtt, so an arterial line was placed. The SBPs were in the 70s, indicating relative hypotension. Possible etiologies include sedation/ventilation versus sepsis. The patient was started on neo gtt for MAP > 65, and PEEP was turned down from 12 to 8 with adequate oxygenation. The plan is to turn off neo this morning and see if the patient can maintain BP on his own, extubate today"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart cath.
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading
   to elevated elastic pressures. ABG initially showed chronic respiratory
   acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, may be due to obesity
   hypoventilation/Pickwickian syndrome, but repeat ABG showed normal
   gas.  Initially pt was diuresed with lasix gtt (40 mg IV bolus x1),
   which was held in the setting of hypotension and poor UOP.  Patient was
   put on Assist Control throughout the night here in CCU, and PEEP was
   down-titrated from 12 to 8 with good oxygenation.
   - change from AC to pressure support
   - decrease and wean off propofol
   - wean ventilator as tolerated
   - start lasix diuresis once pt is off pressor
   - attempt to extubate this am
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient had pre-procedure SBP of 140s. After arriving on
   the CCU floor, non-invasive approach revealed BP in the 90-100s/40s.
   However, patient had no UOP to lasix bolus and gtt, so A-line was
   placed. Placement of A-line showed SBPs of 70s, indicating relative
   hypotension. Etiologies include sedation/mechanical ventilation which
   are more likely given the acute change, sepsis given recent diagnosis
   of cellulitis treated with 10 days of keflex, fever noted on CCU
   admission, or cardiogenic which are less likely given the acute time
   course of events, i.e., his BP was good prior to the procedure.
   Patient was started on neo gtt for MAP>65.  Lasix gtt was held. PEEP
   was turned down from 12 to 8 with adequate oxygenation.
   - turn off neo this morning and see if pt can maintain BP on his own
   - decrease and wean off propofol
   - extubate today if possible
   - hold placement of CVL for now given possible extubation this AM; will
   place if pressor requirements increase and pt cannot be extubated,
   consider a swan-ganz catheter
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - check  c. diff toxin assay
   - continue broad coverage abx (vanc and levo)

   # Acute renal failure: Cre up to 1.7 on admission and up to 2.1 this AM
   (baseline 1.1).  Patient relatively oliguric on admission to the CCU
   with only 40 ccs of dark urine output to 20 of IV lasix administered in
   the PACU.   After lasix gtt was started last night, UOP was close to
   zero.  After neo was started, UOP finally picked up after a few hours.
   At 6am, UOP was 250cc/hr. Most likely pre-renal in setting of

   etiologies (though less likely) include poor forward flow in setting of
   depressed EF% versus overdiuresis with PO lasix at home. No recent
   contrast administration.
   - turn off neo and see if he can maintain BP on his own
   - renal consult if creatinine continues to go up this afternoon
   - hold lasix gtt for now
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] for now
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Fever: Pt with T to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, spiked to 101.4
   overnight. Likely febrile in setting of recent procedure. Hypotension,
   although more likely due to sedation/intubation is somewhat concerning
   for possible sepsis.  UA is negative.
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - f/u CXR
   - RUQ US
   - tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - continue broad coverage abx (vanc and levo)
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Long-standing but bilirubin is very high at 2.7
   this am. Etiologies include [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome, fatty liver and biliary
   stasis, CHF and biliary stasis, acalculous cholecystitis, gallstone
   cholecystitis,especially given fever. Patient sedated with propofol
   overnight given quick on/off for sedation. Patient received fentanyl
   and versed but was reportedly not well sedated during the procedure on
   this regimen, resulting in switch to propofol. Per discussion with
   pharmacy, OK to sedate with propofol temporarily overnight (12 hours)
   if extubation planned this AM.
   - f/u on direct and indirect bili
   - get RUQ US
   - trend LFTs daily

   # PUMP: Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, thought to be viral in
   etiology. Likely has chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure (EF

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate post-elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU, s/p ICD placement, EP study, and right heart cardiac catherization on [**1-8**]. 

The patient has several medical complications that need attention. 

1. Failure to extubate: The patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU. This may be due to extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume overload from the patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading to elevated elastic pressures. 

2. Hypotension: The patient had pre-procedure SBP of 140s. After arriving on the CCU floor, non-invasive BP revealed BP in the 90-100s/40s. However, the patient had no UOP to lasix bolus and gtt, so an arterial line was placed. Placement of the arterial line showed SBPs of 70s, indicating relative hypotension. Etiologies include sedation/mechanical ventilation, sepsis, cardiogenic, or other causes. 

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.1 to 2.1"

    In comparison with the study of [**1-8**], there are very low lung volumes.
   Huge enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. Pulmonary vessels
   are difficult to evaluate, though they do not appear to be especially
   engorged. The AICD line extends to the region of the apex of the right
   ventricle. The area behind the hugely enlarged heart cannot be
   evaluated for the possible presence of pneumonia or effusion
   ECHO [**1-9**]
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably severely
   depressed (LVEF 20%??) but views are suboptimal for assessment of wall
   motion. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free
   wall contractility. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   a small pericardial effusion (seen largely posteriorly). There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided
   pressures.

   Evaluation is slightly limited by patient's
   size. Within this limitation, the liver echotexture is unremarkable.
   There
   is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and the common

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart cath.
   .
   # CHF, systolic and exacerbated. profound biventricular systolic
   dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy cocaine use in year
   prior to CHF diagnosis.  Also possibly viral (was tested at time of
   diagnosis and only positive for RSV) or alcoholic (patient endorses
   weekend binges at most). TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of 10% that may be an
   overestimate. His situation is grave, as his LV stroke work capacity is
   so profoundly reduced.  His morbid obesity and history of substance
   abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable.
   PLAN per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   -  attempt a definitive dx before implementing maximal therapy
   -  Thererfore we will do left and right heart cath, endomyocardial bx,
   and pulmonary arterioloar vasodilator trila irf PVR is > 4 [**Doctor Last Name 2576**] units.
   -  Thereafter we will leave SGC in place and do tailored therapy
   - continue bb, digoxin, fluid restriction, and when appropriate, a low
   Na diet
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading
   to elevated elastic pressures. ABG initially showed chronic respiratory
   acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, may be due to obesity
   hypoventilation/Pickwickian syndrome, but repeat ABG showed normal
   gas.  Elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC [**1-8**] with
   severe pulmonary hypertension; Patient received lasix 20 mg IV x1 in
   PACU and 40 IV x1 in CCU followed by lasix gtt, which was then held in
   the setting of hypotension noted on A-line readings (which were ~20 pts
   lower than non-invasive readings) and poor urine output. On [**1-9**], UOP
   briskly responded to brief time on phenylephrine.  Patient was put on
   was transitioned from AC to CPAP on [**1-9**].
   - modify vent settings as needed
   - decrease and wean off propofol
   - wean ventilator as tolerated
   - patient with excellent urine output; can diurese gently as plan
   regarding heart becomes clear
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Cre up to 1.7 on admission and up to
   2.1 on [**1-9**] (baseline 1.1). Improving to 1.7 today  Patient relatively
   oliguric on admission to the CCU with only 40 ccs of dark urine output
   to 20 of IV lasix administered in the PACU.   After lasix gtt was
   started last night, UOP was close to zero.  After neo was started, UOP
   finally picked up after a few hours.  At 6am, UOP was 250cc/hr. Most
   likely, his ARF was pre-renal in setting of hypotension during the
   procedure due to sedation/intubation, leading to ATN (intrarenal).
   FeUrea is 10, indicating pre-renal etiology. Other etiologies (though
   less likely) include poor forward flow in setting of depressed EF%
   versus overdiuresis with PO lasix at home. No recent contrast
   administration.
   -  hold lasix gtt for now
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] for now
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Fever: Pt with T to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, spiked to 101.4 on [**1-8**].
   Likely febrile in setting of recent procedure with traumatic
   intubation. Most likely aspiration pneumonitis or (less likely)
   pneumonia). Sputum gram stain with several species. Hypotension,
   although more likely due to sedation/intubation is somewhat concerning
   for possible sepsis.  UA negative. Blood cx pending. RUQ US: No
   gallbladder, no cholecystitis
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - f/u CXR
   - tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - continue broad coverage abx ( vanc and levo). Likely switch to
   regular vanc dosing from level-dosing. Receiving 1.5 g this AM.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].
   - will need PA/lateral CXR once pt is extubated to check lead position
   - replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - continue beta-blocker and digoxin
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Long-standing but bilirubin is very high at 2.7
   on [**1-8**]. Etiologies include obstructive and infiltrative disease
   including congestive hepatopathy, fatty liver and biliary stasis,
   fibrosis and biliary stasis, and post-hepatic obstruction. Given fever,
   was ruled out for cholecystitis. This is most likely congestive.
   - trend liver enzymes
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved. Patient had pre-procedure SBP of 140s. After
   arriving on the CCU floor, non-invasive approach revealed BP in the
   90-100s/40s.  However, patient had no UOP to lasix bolus and gtt, so
   A-line was placed. Placement of A-line showed SBPs of 70s, indicating
   relative hypotension. Etiologies include sedation/mechanical
   ventilation which are more likely given the acute change, sepsis given
   recent diagnosis of cellulitis treated with 10 days of keflex, fever
   noted on CCU admission, or cardiogenic which are less likely given the
   acute time course of events, i.e., his BP was good prior to the
   procedure.  Patient was started on neo gtt for MAP>65.  Lasix gtt was
   held. PEEP was turned down from 12 to 8 with adequate oxygenation.
   Patient weaned from Neo in the AM of [**1-9**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, who was admitted to the CCU after failing to extubate following an elective AICD placement and right heart cath. He has profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, likely secondary to prior heavy cocaine use, viral or alcoholic etiology. His ejection fraction (EF) is severely depressed, and his left ventricular stroke work capacity is profoundly reduced. The patient's morbid obesity and history of substance abuse make cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, leading to systolic and diastolic heart failure. This increases the risk of complications such as pulmonary edema, hypotension, renal dysfunction, and arrhythmias.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially presented with oliguric renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.7, which improved to 1.7 today. This may be due to pre-renal causes such as hypotension during procedures or overdiuresis with PO lasix at home. Other etiologies include poor forward flow due to depressed EF% or contrast nephropathy.
3. Fever: The patient had a fever of 101.2 on arrival to CCU, which could be due to aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia. Blood and"

   Imaging: CXR [**1-9**]
    In comparison with the study of [**1-8**], there are very low lung volumes.
   Huge enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. Pulmonary vessels
   are difficult to evaluate, though they do not appear to be especially
   engorged. The AICD line extends to the region of the apex of the right
   ventricle. The area behind the hugely enlarged heart cannot be
   evaluated for the possible presence of pneumonia or effusion
   ECHO [**1-9**]
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably severely
   depressed (LVEF 20%??) but views are suboptimal for assessment of wall
   motion. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free
   wall contractility. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   a small pericardial effusion (seen largely posteriorly). There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided
   pressures.
   ABD US [**1-9**]
   Evaluation is slightly limited by patient's
   size. Within this limitation, the liver echotexture is unremarkable.
   There
   is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and the common
   bile
   duct measures 6 mm. Main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow.

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart cath.
   .
   # CHF, systolic and exacerbated. profound biventricular systolic
   dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy cocaine use in year
   prior to CHF diagnosis.  Also possibly viral (was tested at time of
   diagnosis and only positive for RSV) or alcoholic (patient endorses
   weekend binges at most). TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of 10% that may be an
   overestimate. His situation is grave, as his LV stroke work capacity is
   so profoundly reduced.  His morbid obesity and history of substance
   abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable.
   PLAN per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   -  attempt a definitive dx before implementing maximal therapy
   -  Thererfore we will do left and right heart cath, endomyocardial bx,
   and pulmonary arterioloar vasodilator trila irf PVR is > 4 [**Doctor Last Name 2576**] units.
   -  Thereafter we will leave SGC in place and do tailored therapy
   - continue bb, digoxin, fluid restriction, and when appropriate, a low
   Na diet
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading
   to elevated elastic pressures. ABG initially showed chronic respiratory
   acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, may be due to obesity
   hypoventilation/Pickwickian syndrome, but repeat ABG showed normal
   gas.  Elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC [**1-8**] with
   severe pulmonary hypertension; Patient received lasix 20 mg IV x1 in
   PACU and 40 IV x1 in CCU followed by lasix gtt, which was then held in
   the setting of hypotension noted on A-line readings (which were ~20 pts
   lower than non-invasive readings) and poor urine output. On [**1-9**], UOP
   briskly responded to brief time on phenylephrine.  Patient was put on
   was transitioned from AC to CPAP on [**1-9**].
   - modify vent settings as needed
   - decrease and wean off propofol
   - wean ventilator as tolerated
   - patient with excellent urine output; can diurese gently as plan
   regarding heart becomes clear
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Cre up to 1.7 on admission and up to
   2.1 on [**1-9**] (baseline 1.1). Improving to 1.7 today  Patient relatively
   oliguric on admission to the CCU with only 40 ccs of dark urine output
   to 20 of IV lasix administered in the PACU.   After lasix gtt was
   started last night, UOP was close to zero.  After neo was started, UOP
   finally picked up after a few hours.  At 6am, UOP was 250cc/hr. Most
   likely, his ARF was pre-renal in setting of hypotension during the
   procedure due to sedation/intubation, leading to ATN (intrarenal).
   FeUrea is 10, indicating pre-renal etiology. Other etiologies (though
   less likely) include poor forward flow in setting of depressed EF%
   versus overdiuresis with PO lasix at home. No recent contrast
   administration.
   -  hold lasix gtt for now
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] for now
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Fever: Pt with T to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, spiked to 101.4 on [**1-8**].
   Likely febrile in setting of recent procedure with traumatic
   intubation. Most likely aspiration pneumonitis or (less likely)
   pneumonia). Sputum gram stain with several species. Hypotension,
   although more likely due to sedation/intubation is somewhat concerning
   for possible sepsis.  UA negative. Blood cx pending. RUQ US: No
   gallbladder, no cholecystitis
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - f/u CXR
   - tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - continue broad coverage abx ( vanc and levo). Likely switch to
   regular vanc dosing from level-dosing. Receiving 1.5 g this AM.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].
   - will need PA/lateral CXR once pt is extubated to check lead position
   - replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - continue beta-blocker and digoxin
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Long-standing but bilirubin is very high at 2.7
   on [**1-8**]. Etiologies include obstructive and infiltrative disease
   including congestive hepatopathy, fatty liver and biliary stasis,
   fibrosis and biliary stasis, and post-hepatic obstruction. Given fever,
   was ruled out for cholecystitis. This is most likely congestive.
   - trend liver enzymes
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved. Patient had pre-procedure SBP of 140s. After
   arriving on the CCU floor, non-invasive approach revealed BP in the
   90-100s/40s.  However, patient had no UOP to lasix bolus and gtt, so
   A-line was placed. Placement of A-line showed SBPs of 70s, indicating
   relative hypotension. Etiologies include sedation/mechanical
   ventilation which are more likely given the acute change, sepsis given
   recent diagnosis of cellulitis treated with 10 days of keflex, fever
   noted on CCU admission, or cardiogenic which are less likely given the
   acute time course of events, i.e., his BP was good prior to the
   procedure.  Patient was started on neo gtt for MAP>65.  Lasix gtt was
   held. PEEP was turned down from 12 to 8 with adequate oxygenation.
   Patient weaned from Neo in the AM of [**1-9**].
   - decrease and wean off propofol as possible
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - check  c. diff toxin assay
   - continue broad coverage abx (vanc and levo)
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD.
   - cath will be definitive
   - continue ASA, beta-blocker
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] in setting acute renal failure
   .
   # Asthma:
   - ipratropium prn or albuterol
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.
   - Trend Hct.
   - Continue iron supplements with bowel regimen and vitamin C once able
   to take PO.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and a history of cocaine use, admitted to the ICU after failing to extubate post-elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient has profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, likely secondary to prior heavy cocaine use, viral infection, or alcoholic abuse. His ejection fraction (EF) is severely depressed at 10%, and his left ventricular stroke work capacity is profoundly reduced. The patient's situation is grave, and his candidacy for cardiac transplantation is questionable due to morbid obesity and substance abuse.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Failure to extubate: The patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU after ICD placement, EP study, and right heart cardiac catheterization. He has elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC, severe pulmonary hypertension, and poor urine output. The patient has been transitioned from AC to CPAP and will continue with gentle diuresis.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient had an elevated creatinine level of 1.7 on admission and 2.1 on [1-9], which is improving. He was oliguric initially but responded well to neo and diuretics. The likely etiology is pre-renal due to hypotension during procedures, leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Medications will be renally dosed, and nephrotoxins will be avoided.
3. Fever: The patient had a temperature of 101.2 on arrival to the CCU and spiked to 101.4 on [1-8]. He is febrile in the setting of recent procedures with traumatic intubation. The most likely causes are aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia. Sputum gram stain shows several species, and blood cultures are pending. The patient will continue on broad coverage antibiotics.
4. Rhythm: The patient has a history of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) in the CCU and has undergone AICD placement for primary prevention of tachyarrhythmias. Digoxin levels are within normal range, and beta-blockers and digoxin will be continued.
5. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has long-standing hyperbilirubinemia with a bilirubin level of 2.7 on [1-8]. The most likely etiology is congestive hepatopathy due to chronic heart failure.
6. Hypotension: The patient initially had stable blood pressure but later developed hypotension in the 70s/40s, which was initially attributed to sedation and mechanical ventilation. Other potential causes include sepsis or cardiogenic shock. The patient was started on neo gtt for mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65, and lasix gtt was held.
7. Coronaries: No known history of coronary artery disease (CAD). Coronary catheterization will provide definitive information. Continue ASA and beta-blocker therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's severely depressed EF and reduced left ventricular stroke work capacity indicate a high risk of cardiogenic shock.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's poor lung compliance and elevated elastic pressures suggest a risk of developing ARDS, especially if he develops pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis.
3. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's hyperbilirubinemia and elevated liver enzymes indicate potential hepatic dysfunction, which could be due to congestive hepatopathy or other causes.
4. Renal failure: The patient's initial acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels indicates a risk of further renal dysfunction.
5. Infection: The patient's fever and positive sputum gram stain suggest a risk of infection, possibly pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis.
6. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobility and hypercoagulable state increase his risk for thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous unfractionated heparin are in place."

 ULTRASOUND - At [**2193-1-9**] 10:53 AM
   - spontaneous breathing trial off propofol - patient became very
   agitated and desaturated to 79 and was 90 on 100%. Placed back on
   propofol 60 and CPAP. Sputum suction was thick and red tinged, sent for
   cx.
   - NGT placed for meds
   - met with mother, explained situation. She will be back this PM.
   - TTE: read as EF <20%, but Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] stated that he felt his EF was
   likely single digits
   - RUQ u/s: Non-visualization of the gallbladder. Findings are
   concordant with prior CT colonography and in the absence of a surgical
   history, gallbladder agenesis is suggested. (No, I'm not kidding. He
   really doesn't have one. Check out his CT abdomen/pelvis from [**1-29**] for
   confirmation.)
   - PM lytes: look good except Cr still 2.1
   - pt on schedule for cardiac cath (minimal dye load) with planned swann
   placement, so no further diuresis today, ordered for mucomyst
   - 8pm ABG looks good, but rr in high 30's, so turned up sedation as he

   Imaging: CXR [**1-9**]
    In comparison with the study of [**1-8**], there are very low lung volumes.
   Huge enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. Pulmonary vessels
   are difficult to evaluate, though they do not appear to be especially
   engorged. The AICD line extends to the region of the apex of the right
   ventricle. The area behind the hugely enlarged heart cannot be
   evaluated for the possible presence of pneumonia or effusion
   ECHO [**1-9**]
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably severely
   depressed (LVEF 20%??) but views are suboptimal for assessment of wall
   motion. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free
   wall contractility. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   a small pericardial effusion (seen largely posteriorly). There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided
   pressures.
   ABD US [**1-9**]
   Evaluation is slightly limited by patient's
   size. Within this limitation, the liver echotexture is unremarkable.
   There
   is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and the common
   bile
   duct measures 6 mm. Main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow.
   There
   is no ascites. The gallbladder is not identified. The spleen measures

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart cath.
   .
   # CHF, systolic and exacerbated. profound biventricular systolic
   dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy cocaine use in year
   prior to CHF diagnosis.  Also possibly viral (was tested at time of
   diagnosis and only positive for RSV) or alcoholic (patient endorses
   weekend binges at most). TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of 10% that may be an
   overestimate. His situation is grave, as his LV stroke work capacity is
   so profoundly reduced.  His morbid obesity and history of substance
   abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable.
   PLAN per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   -  attempt a definitive dx before implementing maximal therapy
   -  Thererfore we will do left and right heart cath, endomyocardial bx,
   and pulmonary arterioloar vasodilator trila irf PVR is > 4 [**Doctor Last Name 2576**] units.
   -  Thereafter we will leave SGC in place and do tailored therapy
   - continue bb, digoxin, fluid restriction, and when appropriate, a low
   Na diet
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading
   to elevated elastic pressures. ABG initially showed chronic respiratory
   acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, may be due to obesity
   hypoventilation/Pickwickian syndrome, but repeat ABG showed normal
   gas.  Elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC [**1-8**] with
   severe pulmonary hypertension; Patient received lasix 20 mg IV x1 in
   PACU and 40 IV x1 in CCU followed by lasix gtt, which was then held in
   the setting of hypotension noted on A-line readings (which were ~20 pts
   lower than non-invasive readings) and poor urine output. On [**1-9**], UOP
   briskly responded to brief time on phenylephrine.  Patient was put on
   was transitioned from AC to CPAP on [**1-9**].
   - modify vent settings as needed
   - decrease and wean off propofol
   - wean ventilator as tolerated
   - patient with excellent urine output; can diurese gently as plan
   regarding heart becomes clear
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Cre up to 1.7 on admission and up to
   2.1 on [**1-9**] (baseline 1.1). Improving to 1.7 today  Patient relatively
   oliguric on admission to the CCU with only 40 ccs of dark urine output
   to 20 of IV lasix administered in the PACU.   After lasix gtt was
   started last night, UOP was close to zero.  After neo was started, UOP
   finally picked up after a few hours.  At 6am, UOP was 250cc/hr. Most
   likely, his ARF was pre-renal in setting of hypotension during the
   procedure due to sedation/intubation, leading to ATN (intrarenal).
   FeUrea is 10, indicating pre-renal etiology. Other etiologies (though
   less likely) include poor forward flow in setting of depressed EF%
   versus overdiuresis with PO lasix at home. No recent contrast
   administration.
   -  hold lasix gtt for now
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] for now
   - renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Fever: Pt with T to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, spiked to 101.4 on [**1-8**].
   Likely febrile in setting of recent procedure with traumatic
   intubation. Most likely aspiration pneumonitis or (less likely)
   pneumonia). Sputum gram stain with several species. Hypotension,
   although more likely due to sedation/intubation is somewhat concerning
   for possible sepsis.  UA negative. Blood cx pending. RUQ US: No
   gallbladder, no cholecystitis
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - f/u CXR
   - tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - continue broad coverage abx ( vanc and levo). Likely switch to
   regular vanc dosing from level-dosing. Receiving 1.5 g this AM.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].
   - will need PA/lateral CXR once pt is extubated to check lead position
   - replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - continue beta-blocker and digoxin
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Long-standing but bilirubin is very high at 2.7
   on [**1-8**]. Etiologies include obstructive and infiltrative disease
   including congestive hepatopathy, fatty liver and biliary stasis,
   fibrosis and biliary stasis, and post-hepatic obstruction. Given fever,
   was ruled out for cholecystitis. This is most likely congestive.
   - trend liver enzymes
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved. Patient had pre-procedure SBP of 140s. After
   arriving on the CCU floor, non-invasive approach revealed BP in the
   90-100s/40s.  However, patient had no UOP to lasix bolus and gtt, so
   A-line was placed. Placement of A-line showed SBPs of 70s, indicating
   relative hypotension. Etiologies include sedation/mechanical
   ventilation which are more likely given the acute change, sepsis given
   recent diagnosis of cellulitis treated with 10 days of keflex, fever
   noted on CCU admission, or cardiogenic which are less likely given the
   acute time course of events, i.e., his BP was good prior to the
   procedure.  Patient was started on neo gtt for MAP>65.  Lasix gtt was
   held. PEEP was turned down from 12 to 8 with adequate oxygenation.
   Patient weaned from Neo in the AM of [**1-9**].
   - decrease and wean off propofol as possible
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - check  c. diff toxin assay
   - continue broad coverage abx (vanc and levo)
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD.
   - cath will be definitive
   - continue ASA, beta-blocker
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] in setting acute renal failure
   .
   # Asthma:
   - ipratropium prn or albuterol
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.
   - Trend Hct.
   - Continue iron supplements with bowel regimen and vitamin C once able
   to take PO.
   .
   # OSA:
   - restart/encourage nocturnal CPAP at home once extubated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, and a history of cocaine use, viral or alcoholic etiology. He was admitted to the CCU after failing to extubate following an elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. His current condition is grave, with profound reduction in left ventricular stroke work capacity. The patient's morbid obesity and history of substance abuse raise questions about cardiac transplantation candidacy.

Medical Complications:
1. Failure to extubate: The patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU after ICD placement, EP study, and right heart cardiac catheterization on [**1-8**]. This could be due to extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume overload from systolic and diastolic heart failure.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient had a baseline creatinine of 1.1 and is now showing signs of acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.1. This could be due to hypotension during the procedure, leading to pre-renal azotemia, or possibly ATN.
3. Fever: The patient has had a fever since admission to the CCU, which could be due to aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia. Sputum gram stain shows several species, and blood cultures are pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-inch tall individual with a medical history of morbid obesity, drug use history, and ongoing alcohol use. They are currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of high wedge pressures from a swan-ganz catheter placement. The patient has been started on a lasix drip at 6cc/hr and is being considered for a heart transplant. However, there are barriers including morbid obesity, drug use history, and concern for ongoing alcohol use. The patient has been experiencing respiratory issues, as indicated by their sputum gram stain showing heavy growth of GNRs. They have allergies to Cozaar (oral), spironolactone, and lisinopril. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were cefazolin, levofloxacin, and vancomycin on 2193-1-9, 2193-1-10, respectively. The patient is currently on infusions of furosemide (lasix) at 5 mg/hour and propofol at 50 mcg/kg/min. They are also receiving other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-inch-tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of high wedge pressures. The patient has a history of morbid obesity, drug use, and concern for ongoing alcohol use. They have been receiving furosemide (Lasix) at a rate of 5 mg/hour and propofol at 50 mcg/kg/min. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 123/61 to 151/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The high wedge pressures and concern for ongoing alcohol use may indicate heart failure. This condition can lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating respiratory failure. This could be due to the underlying heart condition or other factors.
3. Sepsis: The heavy growth of GNRs in the sputum gram stain suggests a possible infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially worsen the patient's current condition.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The presence of right lower extremity edema"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart cath.
   .
   # Systolic CHF: Patient with profound biventricular systolic
   dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy cocaine use in year
   prior to CHF diagnosis.  Also possibly viral (was tested at time of
   diagnosis and only positive for RSV) or alcoholic (patient endorses
   weekend binges at most). Cardiac catheterization performed on [**1-10**]
   included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of 10% that may be an
   overestimate His situation is grave, as his LV stroke work capacity is
   so profoundly reduced.  [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and wedge
   pressures during cath were markedly elevated. His morbid obesity and
   history of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] following.
   -  F/U catheterization report & pathology
   -  Continue Lasix gtt diuresis, currently at 6cc/hr, but will titrate
   up as patient
s I/O
s net even for CCU stay.
   -  Goal diuresis -1 to 1.5 L today
   -  Continue BB, Digoxin, fluid restriction, and when appropriate, a low
   Na diet
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading
   to elevated elastic pressures. ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory
   acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent
   with patient
s baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation.
   Elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC [**1-8**] with severe
   pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac catheterization with swann placement on
   [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated wedge pressures. Mean PA pressures currently
   in the low 30
s.  Patient was put on was transitioned from AC to CPAP
   on [**1-9**].
   - Wean from ventilator as tolerates
   - Decrease and wean off propofol
   - Continue Lasix diuresis
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Cre up to 1.7 on admission and up to
   2.1 on [**1-9**] (baseline 1.1). Improving to 1.6 today  Patient relatively
   oliguric on admission to the CCU. Currently on Lasix gtt with adequate
   UOP. Most likely, his ARF was pre-renal in setting of hypotension
   during the procedure due to sedation/intubation, exacerbating poor
   forward flow in setting of depressed EF% versus overdiuresis with PO
   lasix at home. No recent contrast administration.
   - Continue Lasix gtt
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] for now
   - Renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .

","The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient has profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, likely secondary to prior heavy cocaine use, as well as possible viral or alcoholic etiologies. His left and right heart pressures are elevated, and he has severe pulmonary hypertension. The patient was transitioned from AC to CPAP on 1/9 and is currently on a lasix drip.

The patient's renal function is improving, with a creatinine level decreasing from 1.7 on admission to 1.6 today. He is oliguric on admission but now has adequate urine output on the lasix gtt. The most likely cause of his acute renal failure was pre-renal azotemia due to hypotension during the procedure. No recent contrast administration was noted.

The patient had a fever on arrival to the CCU, which has since resolved. He had an elevated temperature of 101.4 on 1/8. A sputum gram stain showed 2+ gram positive cocci, 2+ gram negative rods, and 1+ gram negative diplococci. Preliminary culture growing gram negative rods. Most likely aspiration pneumonitis. The patient is awaiting final sputum, blood cultures, and CXR. Tylenol can be given as needed for fever, and vancomycin can be discontinued as blood cultures are negative for >48 hours. Levofloxacin will be continued on day 3.

The patient is status post AICD placement for primary prevention of tachyarrhythmias due to non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%. He experienced one episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in the CCU. His digoxin level was 0.9 on 1/9. The patient will need a PA/lateral CXR once extubated to check lead position. He should be repleted with potassium >4 and magnesium >2. Beta-blocker and digoxin therapy should be continued.

The patient has hyperbilirubinemia, which is likely congestive in nature. His bilirubin level is elevated at 2.1. Given the fever, cholecystitis has been ruled out, and gallbladder agenesis may be a possibility. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and he has been weaned from Neo. He should be weaned from propofol as soon as possible. Final blood and urine cultures should be followed up, and a Clostridium difficile toxin assay should be checked. Broad coverage antibiotics should be continued until culture results return (vancomycin day 3/levofloxacin day 3).

There are no known coronary artery disease risk factors, and the patient's coronary report is pending. He"

   # Systolic CHF: Patient with profound biventricular systolic
   dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy cocaine use in year
   prior to CHF diagnosis.  Also possibly viral (was tested at time of
   diagnosis and only positive for RSV) or alcoholic (patient endorses
   weekend binges at most). Cardiac catheterization performed on [**1-10**]
   included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of 10% that may be an
   overestimate His situation is grave, as his LV stroke work capacity is
   so profoundly reduced.  [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and wedge
   pressures during cath were markedly elevated. His morbid obesity and
   history of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] following.

   Na diet
   -  Do not check PCWP as catheter placement is not ideal
   -  Consider extubation when PA pressures are 20 or RA pressures are
   [**10-4**]
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading
   to elevated elastic pressures. ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory
   acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent
   with patient
s baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation.
   Elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC [**1-8**] with severe
   pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac catheterization with swann placement on
   [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated wedge pressures. Mean PA pressures currently
   in the low 30
s.  Patient was put on was transitioned from AC to CPAP
   on [**1-9**].
   - Wean from ventilator when PA pressures are 20 or RA pressures are

   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Cre up to 1.7 on admission and up to
   2.1 on [**1-9**] (baseline 1.1). Improving to 1.6 today  Patient relatively
   oliguric on admission to the CCU. Currently on Lasix gtt with adequate
   UOP. Most likely, his ARF was pre-renal in setting of hypotension
   during the procedure due to sedation/intubation, exacerbating poor
   forward flow in setting of depressed EF% versus overdiuresis with PO
   lasix at home. No recent contrast administration.
   - Continue Lasix gtt

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following an elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient has profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy cocaine use, and possibly viral or alcoholic etiology. His left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 10%, which may be an overestimation. The patient's situation is grave due to his reduced LV stroke work capacity. The patient's PA pressures and wedge pressures were markedly elevated during catheterization. The patient is also morbidly obese and has a history of substance abuse, making cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Systolic CHF: The patient has profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, leading to systolic CHF. This condition can result in fluid accumulation, pulmonary edema, and respiratory distress.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient initially had elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. This can be due to pre-renal causes such as hypotension during procedures or overdiuresis with PO lasix at home. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Fever: The patient had a fever on arrival to the CCU, which may be due to recent procedures, traumatic intubation, or aspiration pneumonitis. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart cath.
   .
   # Systolic CHF: Patient with profound biventricular systolic
   dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy cocaine use in year
   prior to CHF diagnosis.  Also possibly viral (was tested at time of
   diagnosis and only positive for RSV) or alcoholic (patient endorses
   weekend binges at most). Cardiac catheterization performed on [**1-10**]
   included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of 10% that may be an
   overestimate His situation is grave, as his LV stroke work capacity is
   so profoundly reduced.  [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and wedge
   pressures during cath were markedly elevated. His morbid obesity and
   history of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] following.
   -  F/U catheterization report & pathology
   -  Continue Lasix gtt diuresis, currently at 6cc/hr, but will titrate
   up as patient
s I/O
s net even for CCU stay.
   -  Goal diuresis -1 to 1.5 L today
   -  Continue BB, Digoxin, fluid restriction, and when appropriate, a low
   Na diet
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading
   to elevated elastic pressures. ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory
   acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent
   with patient
s baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation.
   Elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC [**1-8**] with severe
   pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac catheterization with swann placement on
   [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated wedge pressures. Mean PA pressures currently
   in the low 30
s.  Patient was put on was transitioned from AC to CPAP
   on [**1-9**].
   - Wean from ventilator as tolerates
   - Decrease and wean off propofol
   - Continue Lasix diuresis
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Cre up to 1.7 on admission and up to
   2.1 on [**1-9**] (baseline 1.1). Improving to 1.6 today  Patient relatively
   oliguric on admission to the CCU. Currently on Lasix gtt with adequate
   UOP. Most likely, his ARF was pre-renal in setting of hypotension
   during the procedure due to sedation/intubation, exacerbating poor
   forward flow in setting of depressed EF% versus overdiuresis with PO
   lasix at home. No recent contrast administration.
   - Continue Lasix gtt
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] for now
   - Renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Fever: Pt with T to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, spiked to 101.4 on [**1-8**].
   Afebrile since [**1-8**]. Likely febrile in setting of recent procedure with
   traumatic intubation. Sputum gram stain demonstrates 2+ gram positive
   cocci/2+gram negative rods/1+ gram negative diplococci. Preliminary
   culture growing gram negative rods. Most likely aspiration pneumonitis.
   UA/Ucx negative. Blood cx pending, but NGTD. RUQ US: No gallbladder, no
   cholecystitis.
   - f/u final sputum, blood cultures
   - f/u CXR
   - tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - D/C Vancomycin as blood cultures negative >48 hours
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day 3.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].
   - will need PA/lateral CXR once pt is extubated to check lead position
   - replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - continue beta-blocker and Digoxin
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Long-standing but bilirubin is elevated at 2.1.
   Etiologies include obstructive and infiltrative disease though most
   likely congestive as it has trended down with improved renal function.
   Given fever, he was ruled out for cholecystitis and may have
   gallbladder agenesis as it was unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Trend LFT
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved. Patient weaned from Neo in the AM of [**1-9**].
   Since then, sbp
s have been in the 110-140
   - Wean Propofol as soon as possible
   - F/u final blood and urine cultures
   - Check  c. diff toxin assay
   - Continue broad coverage abx until culture return (Vancomycin day 3
   /Levofloaxacin day 3)
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD. Cath report not returned, but no
   report of coronary disease.
   - continue ASA, beta-blocker
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] in setting acute renal failure
   .
   # Asthma:
   - ipratropium prn or albuterol
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.
   - Trend Hct.
   - Continue iron supplements with bowel regimen and vitamin C once able
   to take PO.

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement, extubation
","The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. He has profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, likely secondary to prior heavy cocaine use. His left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) is 10%, and his mean pulmonary artery pressures are in the low 30s. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP and has been intubated since the day of the procedure.

The patient has a history of morbid obesity and substance abuse, which may impact his candidacy for cardiac transplantation. His current medications include beta-blockers, digoxin, and diuretics. He has ongoing renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.7 on admission and 2.1 on day 9, but it is improving. His urine output has improved with the use of Lasix diuresis. He is also on prophylactic antibiotics due to the recent invasive procedures.

The patient's sputum gram stain shows heavy growth of gram-negative rods, and he has been treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics. His fever has resolved, but he remains at risk for further infections due to his immunocompromised state.

Other issues include his difficulty weaning from the ventilator, possibly due to his large body habitus and volume overload. He is also at risk for thromboembolic events due"

   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading
   to elevated elastic pressures. ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory
   acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent
   with patient
s baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation.
   Elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC [**1-8**] with severe
   pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac catheterization with swann placement on
   [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated wedge pressures. Mean PA pressures currently
   in the low 30
s.  Patient was put on was transitioned from AC to CPAP
   on [**1-9**].
   - Wean from ventilator when PA pressures are 20 or RA pressures are

   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Cre up to 1.7 on admission and up to
   2.1 on [**1-9**] (baseline 1.1). Improving to 1.6 today  Patient relatively
   oliguric on admission to the CCU. Currently on Lasix gtt with adequate
   UOP. Most likely, his ARF was pre-renal in setting of hypotension
   during the procedure due to sedation/intubation, exacerbating poor
   forward flow in setting of depressed EF% versus overdiuresis with PO
   lasix at home. No recent contrast administration.
   - Continue Lasix gtt
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] for now

   # Fever: Pt with T to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, spiked to 101.4 on [**1-8**].
   Afebrile since [**1-8**]. Likely febrile in setting of recent procedure with
   traumatic intubation. Sputum gram stain demonstrates 2+ gram positive
   cocci/2+gram negative rods/1+ gram negative diplococci. Preliminary
   culture growing gram negative rods. Most likely aspiration pneumonitis.

   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].
   - will need PA/lateral CXR once pt is extubated to check lead position
   - replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - continue beta-blocker and Digoxin

   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Long-standing but bilirubin is elevated at 2.1.
   Etiologies include obstructive and infiltrative disease though most
   likely congestive as it has trended down with improved renal function.
   Given fever, he was ruled out for cholecystitis and may have
   gallbladder agenesis as it was unable to be imaged by CT or US.

","The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate post-elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. He has a history of profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy cocaine use, as well as possible viral or alcoholic etiology. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is estimated to be around 10%, which may be an overestimation of his true situation. His LV stroke work capacity is profoundly reduced. The patient's PA pressures and wedge pressures during cath were markedly elevated. His morbid obesity and history of substance abuse raise questions about his candidacy for cardiac transplantation.

The patient has been experiencing systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with profound biventricular systolic dysfunction. He is currently on diuretics, beta-blockers, and digoxin. His renal function has improved, but he remains oliguric. The patient also has a fever, which could be due to aspiration pneumonitis or another infectious cause.

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement, extubation
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Systolic CHF (Congestive Heart Failure): The patient has profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, which is causing his heart to fail in pumping blood effectively. This can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs and other parts of the body.

2. Pulmonary Hypertension: Elevated mean PA pressures and wedge pressures indicate high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. This can further worsen the patient's heart function and cause respiratory problems.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's initial creatinine levels were elevated, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. This could be due to factors such as hypotension during procedures, overdiuresis with Lasix, or other underlying conditions.

4. Infection: The patient's fever and sputum gram stain results suggest an ongoing infection, most likely aspiration pneumonitis. The presence of gram-positive cocci, gram-negative rods, and gram-negative diplococci indicates a mixed bacterial infection.

5. Thromboembolic Events: Given the patient's immobility and use of SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis, there is a risk of developing blood clots, especially in the deep veins of the legs.

6. Anemia: The patient has known iron deficiency anemia, which may require ongoing management with iron supplements.

7. Hypoventilation: The patient's obesity and respiratory acid"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart cath.
   .
   # Systolic CHF: Patient with profound biventricular systolic
   dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy cocaine use in year
   prior to CHF diagnosis.  Also possibly viral (was tested at time of
   diagnosis and only positive for RSV) or alcoholic (patient endorses
   weekend binges at most). Cardiac catheterization performed on [**1-10**]
   included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of 10% that may be an
   overestimate His situation is grave, as his LV stroke work capacity is
   so profoundly reduced.  [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and wedge
   pressures during cath were markedly elevated. His morbid obesity and
   history of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.
   -  F/U myocardial pathology
   -  Continue Lasix gtt diuresis, currently at 5cc/hr, but will titrate
   up as patient
s I/O
s net even for CCU stay.
   -  Goal diuresis -1 to 1.5 L today, total goal ~10L diuresis
   -  Continue Digoxin, fluid restriction, and when appropriate, a low Na
   diet
   -  Increase Metoprolol from 50 to 75mg TID
   -  Do not check PCWP as catheter placement is not ideal
   -  Consider extubation when PA pressures <20 or RA pressures are <15
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading
   to elevated pressures. ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory acidosis
   with appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent with
   patient
s baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation.
   Elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC [**1-8**] with severe
   pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac catheterization with swann placement on
   [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated wedge pressures. Mean PA pressures currently
   in the low 30
s.  Patient was put on was transitioned from AC to CPAP
   on [**1-9**].
   - Wean from ventilator when PA pressures are <20 or RA pressures are
   <15
   - Continue Fentanyl/Versed sedation
   - Continue Lasix diuresis
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Cre up to 1.7 on admission and up to
   2.1 on [**1-9**] (baseline 1.1). Improving to 1.4 today. On Lasix gtt with
   negative 2L over the past 24 hours. Most likely, his ARF was pre-renal
   in setting of hypotension during the procedure due to
   sedation/intubation, exacerbating poor forward flow in setting of
   depressed EF%. No recent contrast administration.
   - Continue Lasix gtt
   - Goal diuresis 1-1.5L today
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] for now
   - Renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Fever: Pt with T to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, spiked to 101.4 on [**1-8**].
   Afebrile since [**1-8**], but elevated temperature this AM to 100.9.
   Vancomycin d/c
d on [**1-11**] as blood cultures negative >48 hours and
   received 4 days of treatment. Sputum culture demonstrates pan-sensitive
   Serratia Marcescens. UA/Ucx negative. Blood cx pending, but NGTD. RUQ
   US: No gallbladder, no cholecystitis. Will reculture and expand
   coverage if spikes.
   - repeat blood, urine cultures
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u CXR
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day 4
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].
   - will need PA/lateral CXR once patient is extubated to check lead
   position.
   - replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - continue Digoxin 0.25mg daily
   - Increase Metoprolol from 50mg to 75mg TID
   .
   # Skin Rash: Patient with urticarial appearing skin rash on lower
   abdomen & legs upon presentation to the CCU, thought to be [**1-22**] Keflex,
   switched to Vancomycin, rash no longer urticarial, but patchy and red
   macules now including the forearms and persisting over lower
   abdomen/legs. Vancomycin held on [**1-11**]. [**Month (only) 11**] be red man
s syndrome given
   new appearance/distribution.
   - Will continue to observe for now, but if persists, consider changing
   Levofloxacin.
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Long-standing, but bilirubin is elevated at 2.1.
   Etiologies include obstructive and infiltrative disease though most
   likely congestive as it has trended down with improved renal function.
   Given fever, he was ruled out for cholecystitis and may have
   gallbladder agenesis as it was unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Trend LFT
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved. Patient weaned from Neo in the AM of [**1-9**].
   Since then, sbp
s have been in the 110-140
s. Unlikely to be sepsis as
   bp
s improved and central venous O2
s are appropriate.
   - Continue Fentanyl/Versed sedation
   - F/u final blood cultures
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day 4
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD. No coronary disease reported on
   cardiac catheterization.
   - Continue ASA, beta-blocker
   - Hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] in setting acute renal failure
   .
   # Asthma:
   - Ipratropium prn or Albuterol
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.
   - Trend Hct
   - Continue iron supplements with bowel regimen and vitamin C once able
   to take PO.
   .
   # OSA:
   - restart/encourage nocturnal CPAP at home once extubated.

   [**Name (NI) 129**] status: Full code
   Disposition: pending extubation
","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to the ICU after failing to extubate following an elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. He has profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, possibly secondary to prior heavy cocaine use, viral infection, or alcoholic abuse. His left ventricular stroke work capacity is severely reduced. The patient's obesity and history of substance abuse make cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Systolic CHF: The patient has profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, which may lead to congestive heart failure (CHF). He requires close monitoring for symptoms such as shortness of breath, edema, and fatigue. Diuretics, digoxin, and ACE inhibitors may be necessary to manage this condition.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Weaning from the ventilator will depend on his ability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters, including oxygen saturation, tidal volume, and respiratory rate, is essential. If the patient experiences respiratory distress or failure, non-invasive ventilation strategies (such as CPAP) or reintubation may be required.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level was elevated, indicating potential pre-existing renal impairment. However, his current creatinine level has further increased, suggesting acute renal failure. This"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart cath.
   .
   # Systolic CHF: Patient with profound biventricular systolic
   dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy cocaine use in year
   prior to CHF diagnosis.  Also possibly viral (was tested at time of
   diagnosis and only positive for RSV) or alcoholic (patient endorses
   weekend binges at most). Cardiac catheterization performed on [**1-10**]
   included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of 10% that may be an
   overestimate His situation is grave, as his LV stroke work capacity is
   so profoundly reduced.  [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and wedge
   pressures during cath were markedly elevated. His morbid obesity and
   history of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.
   -  F/U myocardial pathology
   -  Continue Lasix gtt diuresis, currently at 5cc/hr, but will titrate
   up as patient
s I/O
s net even for CCU stay.
   -  Goal diuresis -1 to 1.5 L today, total goal ~10L diuresis
   -  Continue Digoxin, fluid restriction, and when appropriate, a low Na
   diet
   -  Increase Metoprolol from 50 to 75mg TID
   -  Do not check PCWP as catheter placement is not ideal
   -  Consider extubation when PA pressures <20 or RA pressures are <15
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading
   to elevated pressures. ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory acidosis
   with appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent with
   patient
s baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation.
   Elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC [**1-8**] with severe
   pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac catheterization with swann placement on
   [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated wedge pressures. Mean PA pressures currently
   in the low 30
s.  Patient was put on was transitioned from AC to CPAP
   on [**1-9**].
   - Wean from ventilator when PA pressures are <20 or RA pressures are
   <15
   - Continue Fentanyl/Versed sedation
   - Continue Lasix diuresis
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Cre up to 1.7 on admission and up to
   2.1 on [**1-9**] (baseline 1.1). Improving to 1.4 today. On Lasix gtt with
   negative 2L over the past 24 hours. Most likely, his ARF was pre-renal
   in setting of hypotension during the procedure due to
   sedation/intubation, exacerbating poor forward flow in setting of
   depressed EF%. No recent contrast administration.
   - Continue Lasix gtt
   - Goal diuresis 1-1.5L today
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] for now
   - Renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Fever: Pt with T to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, spiked to 101.4 on [**1-8**].
   Afebrile since [**1-8**], but elevated temperature this AM to 100.9.
   Vancomycin d/c
d on [**1-11**] as blood cultures negative >48 hours and
   received 4 days of treatment. Sputum culture demonstrates pan-sensitive
   Serratia Marcescens. UA/Ucx negative. Blood cx pending, but NGTD. RUQ
   US: No gallbladder, no cholecystitis. Will reculture and expand
   coverage if spikes.
   - repeat blood, urine cultures
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u CXR
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day 4
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].
   - will need PA/lateral CXR once patient is extubated to check lead
   position.
   - replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - continue Digoxin 0.25mg daily
   - Increase Metoprolol from 50mg to 75mg TID
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Long-standing, but bilirubin is elevated at 2.1.
   Etiologies include obstructive and infiltrative disease though most
   likely congestive as it has trended down with improved renal function.
   Given fever, he was ruled out for cholecystitis and may have
   gallbladder agenesis as it was unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Trend LFT
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved. Patient weaned from Neo in the AM of [**1-9**].
   Since then, sbp
s have been in the 110-140
s. Unlikely to be sepsis as
   bp
s improved and central venous O2
s are appropriate.
   - Continue Fentanyl/Versed sedation
   - F/u final blood cultures
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day 4
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD. No coronary disease reported on
   cardiac catheterization.
   - Continue ASA, beta-blocker
   - Hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] in setting acute renal failure
   .
   # Asthma:
   - Ipratropium prn or Albuterol
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.
   - Trend Hct
   - Continue iron supplements with bowel regimen and vitamin C once able
   to take PO.
   .
   # OSA:
   - restart/encourage nocturnal CPAP at home once extubated.

   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Also possibly viral (was
   tested at time of diagnosis and only positive for RSV) or alcoholic
   (patient endorses weekend binges at most). Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate His situation is grave, as his LV
   stroke work capacity is so profoundly reduced.  [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA
   pressures and wedge pressures during cath were markedly elevated. His
   morbid obesity and history of substance abuse makes cardiac
   transplantation candidacy questionable.
   -  F/U myocardial pathology
   -  Continue Lasix gtt diuresis
   -  Goal diuresis -2 L today, total goal ~10L diuresis for CCU stay
   -  Continue Digoxin, fluid restriction, and when appropriate, a low Na
   diet
   -  Continue Metoprolol 50mg TID
   -  Do not check PCWP as catheter placement is not ideal
   -  Consider extubation when PA pressures <20 or RA pressures are <15
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, leading
   to elevated pressures. ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory acidosis
   with appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent with
   patient
s baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation.
   Elevated left and right heart pressures noted on RHC [**1-8**] with severe
   pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac catheterization with swann placement on
   [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated wedge pressures. Mean PA pressures currently
   in the low 30
s.  Patient was put on was transitioned from AC to CPAP
   on [**1-9**].

   2.1 on [**1-9**] (baseline 1.1). Improving to 1.4 today. On Lasix gtt with
   negative 2L over the past 24 hours. Most likely, his ARF was pre-renal
   in setting of hypotension during the procedure due to
   sedation/intubation, exacerbating poor forward flow in setting of
   depressed EF%. No recent contrast administration.
   - Continue Lasix gtt
   - Goal diuresis minimum 2L today
   - Restart Valsartan 40mg daily
   - Renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins

   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].
   - will need PA/lateral CXR once patient is extubated to check lead
   position.

   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Long-standing, but bilirubin is elevated at 2.1.
   Etiologies include obstructive and infiltrative disease though most
   likely congestive as it has trended down with improved renal function.
   Given fever, he was ruled out for cholecystitis and may have
   gallbladder agenesis as it was unable to be imaged by CT or US.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's primary diagnosis is acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation, with profound biventricular systolic dysfunction. The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 10% and markedly elevated pulmonary artery pressures. The patient also has a history of substance abuse and morbid obesity, which may affect his candidacy for cardiac transplantation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Failure to extubate: The patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU after ICD placement, EP study, and right heart catheterization. This could be due to extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume overload from the patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure.
2. Respiratory acidosis: The patient's ABG demonstrates chronic respiratory acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, likely due to obesity hypoventilation.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension with elevated mean PA pressures in the low 30s.
4. Fever: The patient had a fever on arrival to the CCU and on [1-8], but is currently afebrile. However"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and a history of cocaine use, who is currently admitted to the ICU after an elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient has profound biventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 10%. His situation is grave, with elevated PA pressures and wedge pressures. He is also morbidly obese and has a history of substance abuse, making cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: The patient's profound biventricular systolic dysfunction and elevated PA pressures indicate ongoing heart failure. Close monitoring and management of fluid balance, diuretics, and cardiac support are essential.

2. Failure to extubate: The patient was unable to be extubated post-procedure, likely due to extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity) and poor lung compliance. Weaning from the ventilator will be challenging, and careful monitoring of PA pressures and RA pressures is necessary.

3. Fever: The patient initially had a fever, which has since resolved. Blood cultures were negative, but there is a concern for a possible infection. Repeat cultures and observation for signs of infection are necessary.

4. Skin rash: The patient has developed a patchy pink rash with onychomycosis of the toenails. This rash may be related to medication, specifically vancomycin, as it"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart
   catheterization.
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Diuresis optimized on [**1-12**] when SBP
s >120, so evening
   Metoprolol dose decreased to 25mg TID with good rate control. CXR
   demonstrates improved pulmonary edema, lower extremity edema nearly
   resolved, length of stay negative 4.5L.
   -  F/U myocardial pathology
   -  Continue Lasix gtt diuresis, goal -.5 to 1 L today
   -  Continue Digoxin, fluid restriction
   -  Continue Metoprolol 50mg TID
   -  Do not check PCWP as catheter placement is not ideal
   -  Consider extubation as PA pressures <20
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure. Cardiac
   catheterization with swann placement on [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated
   wedge pressures.  ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory acidosis with
   appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent with patient
   baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation. Today, CXR
   improved, diastolic PA pressures <20 and edema significantly improved.
   - Transition to pressure support w/ ABG
s PRN
   - Continue Lasix diuresis for goal negative 0.5L to 1L
   - Discuss with Pulmonary re: extubation plan
   - Continue Fentanyl/Versed sedation for now
   .
   # Fever: Patient with fever to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, afebrile while
   on Vancomycin & Levaquin. Sputum culture demonstrates pan-sensitive
   Serratia Marcescens. Vancomycin held after 4 days of treatment on [**1-11**]
   but patient developed persistent fever on [**1-12**] to 102.9 on Tylenol.
   UA/Ucx negative. Blood cx pending, but NGTD. RUQ US: normal. In the
   context of persistent fever, low SVR, and new hardware placement with
   lines in place, restarted IV Vancomycin with defeverescence.
   - f/u blood cultures & repeat sputum and urine cultures
   - f/u CXR
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day 5
   - Continue Vancomycin, day 2
   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Creatinine 1.7 on admission and up to
   2.1 on [**1-9**] (baseline 1.1). Cr stable at 1.4 today. ARF likely [**1-22**] poor
   forward flow in the setting of depressed EF. On Lasix gtt, net negative
   1.5L over the past 24 hours.
   - Lasix gtt with goal negative 0.5L to 1L
   - Continue Valsartan 40mg daily
   - Renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].
   Patient will need PA/lateral CXR once he is extubated to check lead
   position.
   - Replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - Continue Digoxin 0.25mg daily
   - Continue Metoprolol from 50mg TID
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Stable at 2.2. Etiologies include obstructive and
   infiltrative disease though most likely congestive. Given fever, he was
   ruled out for cholecystitis and may have gallbladder agenesis as it was
   unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Trend LFT
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD. No coronary disease reported on
   cardiac catheterization.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Metoprolol 50mg PO TID
   - Valsartan 40mg PO daily
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.
   - Trend Hct
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg PO TID, on bowel regimen
   - Ascorbic acid 250mg PO TID
   .
   # Asthma: Will start Albuterol 1-2 puffs q6H:PRN wheezing when
   extubated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU after failing to extubate following an elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient has a history of profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumed secondary to prior heavy cocaine use. The patient also has morbid obesity and substance abuse, which makes cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: The patient has profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, which can lead to acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure. Complications may include worsening pulmonary edema, respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

2. Failure to extubate: The patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU after ICD placement, EP study, and right heart cardiac catheterization. This could be due to extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance caused by volume overload from the patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure. Complications may include respiratory acidosis and further deterioration of respiratory status.

3. Fever: The patient has persistent fever despite receiving Vancomycin and Levaquin. The sputum culture demonstrates pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. Complications may include worsening infection, sepsis"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart
   catheterization.
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Diuresis optimized on [**1-12**] when SBP
s >120, so evening
   Metoprolol dose decreased to 25mg TID with good rate control. CXR
   demonstrates improved pulmonary edema, lower extremity edema nearly
   resolved, length of stay negative 4.5L.
   -  F/U myocardial pathology
   -  Continue Lasix gtt diuresis, goal -.5 to 1 L today
   -  Continue Digoxin, fluid restriction
   -  Continue Metoprolol 50mg TID
   -  Do not check PCWP as catheter placement is not ideal
   -  Consider extubation as PA pressures <20
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure. Cardiac
   catheterization with swann placement on [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated
   wedge pressures.  ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory acidosis with
   appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent with patient
   baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation. Today, CXR
   improved, diastolic PA pressures <20 and edema significantly improved.
   - Transition to pressure support w/ ABG
s PRN
   - Continue Lasix diuresis for goal negative 0.5L to 1L
   - Discuss with Pulmonary re: extubation plan
   - Continue Fentanyl/Versed sedation for now
   .
   # Fever: Patient with fever to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, afebrile while
   on Vancomycin & Levaquin. Sputum culture demonstrates pan-sensitive
   Serratia Marcescens. Vancomycin held after 4 days of treatment on [**1-11**]
   but patient developed persistent fever on [**1-12**] to 102.9 on Tylenol.
   UA/Ucx negative. Blood cx pending, but NGTD. RUQ US: normal. In the
   context of persistent fever, low SVR, and new hardware placement with
   lines in place, restarted IV Vancomycin with defeverescence.
   - f/u blood cultures & repeat sputum and urine cultures
   - f/u CXR
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day 5
   - Continue Vancomycin, day 2
   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Creatinine 1.7 on admission and up to
   2.1 on [**1-9**] (baseline 1.1). Cr stable at 1.4 today. ARF likely [**1-22**] poor
   forward flow in the setting of depressed EF. On Lasix gtt, net negative
   1.5L over the past 24 hours.
   - Lasix gtt with goal negative 0.5L to 1L
   - Continue Valsartan 40mg daily
   - Renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].
   Patient will need PA/lateral CXR once he is extubated to check lead
   position.
   - Replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - Continue Digoxin 0.25mg daily
   - Continue Metoprolol from 50mg TID
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Stable at 2.2. Etiologies include obstructive and
   infiltrative disease though most likely congestive. Given fever, he was
   ruled out for cholecystitis and may have gallbladder agenesis as it was
   unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Trend LFT
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD. No coronary disease reported on
   cardiac catheterization.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Metoprolol 50mg PO TID
   - Valsartan 40mg PO daily
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.
   - Trend Hct
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg PO TID, on bowel regimen
   - Ascorbic acid 250mg PO TID
   .
   # Asthma: Will start Albuterol 1-2 puffs q6H:PRN wheezing when
   extubated
   .
   # OSA:  Restart nocturnal CPAP once extubated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU after failing to extubate following an elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient has a history of cocaine abuse, which may have contributed to his profound biventricular systolic dysfunction. He also has morbid obesity, making cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: The patient has profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, likely secondary to prior heavy cocaine use. His cardiac catheterization showed elevated PA pressures and wedge pressures.

2. Failure to extubate: The patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU after ICD placement, EP study, and right heart cardiac catheterization. It is likely due to extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume overload from systolic and diastolic heart failure.

3. Fever: The patient has had a persistent fever ranging from 101.2 to 102.9 degrees Fahrenheit. Sputum culture demonstrated pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. Vancomycin was initially held after 4 days of treatment, but the patient developed persistent fever, prompting the restart of IV Vancomycin.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels were initially elevated at"

   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Diuresis optimized on [**1-12**] when SBP
s >120, so evening
   Metoprolol dose decreased to 25mg TID with good rate control. Diastolic
   PA pressures below 20 since evening of [**1-12**], but in context of
   infection, difficult to interpret.
   -  F/U myocardial pathology
   -  Continue Lasix gtt diuresis, goal -1.5 to 2 L today, total goal ~10L
   diuresis for CCU stay
   -  Continue Digoxin, fluid restriction
   -  Continue Metoprolol 50mg TID
   -  Do not check PCWP as catheter placement is not ideal
   -  Consider extubation when PA pressures <20 or RA pressures are <15
   and patient is not persistently febrile
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure. Cardiac
   catheterization with swann placement on [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated
   wedge pressures.  ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory acidosis with
   appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent with patient
   baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation, however pO2
   decreased, so FiO2 and pressure support increased.
   - Consider extubation when PA pressures <20 or RA pressures are <15 and
   patient is not persistently febrile
   - Continue Fentanyl/Versed sedation

   forward flow in the setting of depressed EF. On Lasix gtt, net negative
   1.5L over the past 24 hours.
   - Continue Lasix gtt
   - Continue Valsartan 40mg daily
   - Goal diuresis 1.5 to 2L today
   - Renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted to the CCU after failing to extubate following an elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. He is currently intubated due to profound biventricular systolic dysfunction and has a low ejection fraction of 10%. The patient also has morbid obesity and a history of substance abuse, making cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable. He is experiencing acute-on-chronic systolic CHF exacerbation with elevated PA pressures and wedge pressures. His respiratory status is complicated by obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and he has an infection with pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. The patient's renal function is improving, but he has a history of iron deficiency anemia and asthma. He is currently on multiple medications, including diuretics, digoxin, and beta-blockers, for heart failure management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Failure to extubate: The patient's inability to be extubated in the PACU may indicate a risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation and potential complications associated with being intubated for an extended period.
2. Infection: The patient's persistent fever despite receiving antibiotics suggests the possibility of a persistent infection. This could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction if not appropriately managed.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels on admission and during his hospital stay"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old morbidly obese male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following an elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. He has a history of substance abuse and his cardiac function is severely compromised with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His condition has been complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, fever, hypernatremia, and hyperbilirubinemia. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 102.9°F, heart rate 95 bpm, blood pressure 135/65 mmHg, respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 93%, and central venous pressure (CVP) 15 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS may progress further, leading to worsening oxygenation and potential respiratory failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate, leading to an increase in creatinine levels and potential need for dialysis.
3. Fever: The patient's persistent fever despite antibiotic treatment suggests a possible infection or other underlying cause, which needs to be investigated further.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating a risk of dehydration and potential neurological complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart
   catheterization.
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Diuresis very sensitive to BP, i.e., UOP improves
   significantly when sBP is above 120. CXR demonstrates improved
   pulmonary edema, lower extremity edema improved, length of stay
   negative 4.6L.
   -  Continue Lasix gtt diuresis, goal - 1 L today
   -  F/U myocardial pathology
   -  Eplerenone is structurally similar to spironolactone, so given h/o
   allergy to spironolactone and current rash, would hold off on
   eplerenone
   -  Consider metolazone if UOP poor today
   -  change Metoprolol 50mg TID to carvedilol 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -  decrease valsartan from 40mg to 20mg daily since pt
s UOP is very
   sensitive to BP
   -  Continue Digoxin
   -  once 3 PIVs are in place today, remove swan now that the pressures
   have been stale
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure. Cardiac
   catheterization with swann placement on [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated
   wedge pressures.  ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory acidosis with
   appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent with patient
   baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation. Today, CXR
   improved, diastolic PA pressures around 20 and edema significantly
   improved.  Vent setting was changed from AC to PS yesterday morning
   [**1-13**], which was turned back to PS last night for respiratory acidosis.
   - Continue Lasix diuresis for goal negative 1L
   - switch back to pressure support w/ ABG
s PRN
   - when more stable, will extubate to BiPAP
   - keep HOB at 30
   - f/u pulmonary recs
   - Continue Fentanyl/Versed sedation for now
   .
   # Fever: Patient with fever to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, Tmax 102.9 on
   [**1-12**] and 101.1 on [**1-13**] after vancomycin was held after 4 days of
   treatment on [**1-11**]. Vanc was re-started on [**1-12**].  Sputum culture
   demonstrates pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. UA/Ucx negative. Blood
   cx from [**1-12**] grew GPC, speciation and sensitivities pending. RUQ US:
   normal.  Meds could be responsible to the fever as well.
   - f/u blood cultures GPC speciation and sensitivities
   - Continue Vancomycin, day 3
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day 6
   - will start cefepime today if pt spikes again
   - remove swan catheter if we can get 3 PIVs in
   - f/u CXR
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Creatinine 1.7 on admission and up to
   2.1 on [**1-9**] (baseline 1.1). Cr stable at 1.2 today. ARF likely [**1-22**] poor
   forward flow in the setting of depressed EF. On Lasix gtt.
   - Lasix gtt with goal negative 1L
   - decrease Valsartan from 40mg to 20mg daily
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].
   Patient will need PA/lateral CXR once he is extubated to check lead
   position.
   - Replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - Continue Digoxin 0.25mg daily
   - discontinue Metoprolol 50mg TID, start carvedilol 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Stable at 2.2. Etiologies include obstructive and
   infiltrative disease though most likely congestive. Given fever, he was
   ruled out for cholecystitis and may have gallbladder agenesis as it was
   unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Trend LFT
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD. No coronary disease reported on
   cardiac catheterization.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - discontinue Metoprolol 50mg TID, start carvedilol 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Valsartan 20mg PO daily
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.
   - Trend Hct
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg PO TID, on bowel regimen
   - Ascorbic acid 250mg PO TID
   .
   # Asthma: Will start Albuterol 1-2 puffs q6H:PRN wheezing when
   extubated
   .
   # OSA:  Restart nocturnal CPAP once extubated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and a history of cocaine use. He was admitted to the CCU after failing to extubate following an elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, fever, acute renal failure, rhythm disturbances, hyperbilirubinemia, and anemia. He is currently on various medications and interventions, including diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and sedation. The patient's condition has shown some improvement with reduced pulmonary edema and lower extremity edema. However, he remains intubated and dependent on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Serratia Marcescens infection: The patient's sputum culture demonstrated pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. This bacterium can cause respiratory tract infections, especially in hospitalized patients.
3. GPC bacteremia: The patient's blood culture from January 12th grew Gram-negative bacilli (GNB), which could indicate a bloodstream infection.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's serum creatinine levels have been elevated, suggesting potential kidney dysfunction.
5. Drug rash: The patient has a history"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. He has a history of morbid obesity, substance abuse, and an EF of 10% on TTE. He presented with acute-on-chronic systolic CHF exacerbation and respiratory acidosis. The patient has been on various medications including diuretics, digoxin, metoprolol, and spironolactone. He has been experiencing fevers, and his sputum culture showed pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. His renal function has improved, but he still has hyperbilirubinemia. The patient's anemia is due to iron deficiency. He also has asthma and OSA, and will be started on albuterol and nocturnal CPAP once extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and positive cultures indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and difficulty weaning off the ventilator suggest a risk of respiratory failure if extubation is attempted prematurely.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's history of acute renal failure and elevated creatinine levels indicate a potential risk of kidney injury, especially if fluid balance is not managed"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart
   catheterization.
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Diuresis very sensitive to BP, i.e., UOP improves
   significantly when sBP is above 120. On [**1-14**], decrease valsartan from
   40mg to 20mg daily since pt
s UOP is very sensitive to BP. CXR
   demonstrates improved pulmonary edema, lower extremity edema improved,
   length of stay negative 7L.. Changed Metoprolol 50mg TID to carvedilol
   3.125mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-14**] but held [**1-22**] BP. Changed back to 25 TID metoprolol
   for better rate control. Diuresis complicated by hyperbicarbia
   (contraction)
   -  Continue Lasix gtt with metalozone diuresis, goal - 2 L today
   - adding diamox 500 [**Hospital1 **]
   - replete K to 5
   -  F/U myocardial pathology
   -  Eplerenone is structurally similar to spironolactone, so given h/o
   allergy to spironolactone and current rash, would hold off on
   eplerenone
   - consider restarting metoprolol in place of carvedilol, 25 TID
   -   Continue Digoxin
   - can remove swan once pt has better access
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure. Cardiac
   catheterization with swann placement on [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated
   wedge pressures.  ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory acidosis with
   appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent with patient
   baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation. Today, CXR
   improved, diastolic PA pressures around 20 and edema significantly
   improved.  Vent setting was changed from AC to PS yesterday morning
   [**1-13**], which was turned back to AC o/n for respiratory acidosis. Patient
   now tolerating PS of [**9-29**].
   - Continue diuresis for goal negative of [**8-30**] litres (LOS)
   - consider precedex for sedation pre-extrubation attempt
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - ABG
s PRN
   - when more stable, will extubate to BiPAP
   - keep HOB at 30
   - f/u pulmonary recs
   - Continue Fentanyl/Versed sedation for now
   .
   # Fever: Patient with fever to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, Tmax 102.9 on
   [**1-12**] and 101.1 on [**1-13**] after vancomycin was held after 4 days of
   treatment on [**1-11**]. Vanc was re-started on [**1-12**].  Sputum culture
   demonstrates pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. UA/Ucx negative. Blood
   cx from [**1-12**] grew GPC, speciation and sensitivities pending. RUQ US:
   normal.  Meds could be responsible to the fever as well. Patient has
   blanching lower extremity rash in line with drug reaction
   - f/u blood cultures GPC speciation and sensitivities
   - Continue Vancomycin, day 4
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day 7
   - will start cefepime today if pt spikes again
   - remove swan catheter if PICC placement
   - f/u CXR
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Creatinine 1.7 on admission and up to
   2.1 on [**1-9**] (baseline 1.1). Cr stable at 1.2 today. ARF likely [**1-22**] poor
   forward flow in the setting of depressed EF. On Lasix gtt.
   - Lasix gtt with goal negative 1L
   - decrease Valsartan from 40mg to 20mg daily
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].
   Patient will need PA/lateral CXR once he is extubated to check lead
   position.
   - Replete K to 5, Mg > 2
   - Continue Digoxin 0.25mg daily
   - either Metoprolol 25-50mg TID, start carvedilol 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Stable at 2.2. Etiologies include obstructive and
   infiltrative disease though most likely congestive. Given fever, he was
   ruled out for cholecystitis and may have gallbladder agenesis as it was
   unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Trend LFT
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD. No coronary disease reported on
   cardiac catheterization.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - either Metoprolol 50mg TID or carvedilol 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Valsartan 20mg PO daily
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.
   - Trend Hct
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg PO TID, on bowel regimen
   - Ascorbic acid 250mg PO TID
   .
   # Asthma: Will start Albuterol 1-2 puffs q6H:PRN wheezing when
   extubated

   catheterization.
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Diuresis very sensitive to BP, i.e., UOP improves
   significantly when sBP is above 120. On [**1-14**], decrease valsartan from
   40mg to 20mg daily since pt
s UOP is very sensitive to BP. CXR
   demonstrates improved pulmonary edema, lower extremity edema improved,
   length of stay negative 7L.. Changed Metoprolol 50mg TID to carvedilol
   3.125mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-14**] but held [**1-22**] BP
   -  Continue Lasix gtt with metalozone diuresis, goal - 1 L today
   -  F/U myocardial pathology
   -  Eplerenone is structurally similar to spironolactone, so given h/o
   allergy to spironolactone and current rash, would hold off on
   eplerenone
   - consider restarting metoprolol in place of carvedilol
   -   Continue Digoxin
   - can remove swan once pt has better access
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure. Cardiac
   catheterization with swann placement on [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated
   wedge pressures.  ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory acidosis with
   appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent with patient
   baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation. Today, CXR
   improved, diastolic PA pressures around 20 and edema significantly
   improved.  Vent setting was changed from AC to PS yesterday morning
   [**1-13**], which was turned back to AC o/n for respiratory acidosis. Patient
   now tolerating PS of [**9-29**].

   # Fever: Patient with fever to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, Tmax 102.9 on
   [**1-12**] and 101.1 on [**1-13**] after vancomycin was held after 4 days of
   treatment on [**1-11**]. Vanc was re-started on [**1-12**].  Sputum culture
   demonstrates pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. UA/Ucx negative. Blood
   cx from [**1-12**] grew GPC, speciation and sensitivities pending. RUQ US:
   normal.  Meds could be responsible to the fever as well. Patient has
   blanching lower extremity rash in line with drug reaction
   - f/u blood cultures GPC speciation and sensitivities
   - Continue Vancomycin, day 4
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day 7
   - will start cefepime today if pt spikes again
   - remove swan catheter if PICC placement
   - f/u CXR
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving. Creatinine 1.7 on admission and up to
   2.1 on [**1-9**] (baseline 1.1). Cr stable at 1.2 today. ARF likely [**1-22**] poor
   forward flow in the setting of depressed EF. On Lasix gtt.
   - Lasix gtt with goal negative 1L
   - decrease Valsartan from 40mg to 20mg daily
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].
   Patient will need PA/lateral CXR once he is extubated to check lead
   position.
   - Replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - Continue Digoxin 0.25mg daily
   - either Metoprolol 50mg TID, start carvedilol 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **]

   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Stable at 2.2. Etiologies include obstructive and
   infiltrative disease though most likely congestive. Given fever, he was
   ruled out for cholecystitis and may have gallbladder agenesis as it was
   unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Trend LFT

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted to the CCU after failing to extubate following an elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization.
- The patient has profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy cocaine use.
- He has a history of morbid obesity and substance abuse, which makes cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable.
- The patient's diuresis is sensitive to blood pressure, and his urine output improves significantly when systolic blood pressure is above 120.
- He has been diagnosed with acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation and is currently on diuretic therapy with Lasix and metolazone.
- The patient has an elevated PA pressure and wedge pressure during catheterization, indicating potential pulmonary edema and volume overload.
- He has a history of substance abuse, including cocaine use, which may contribute to his cardiac condition.
- The patient's fever is suspected to be due to a drug reaction or infection, with Serratia Marcescens identified in sputum culture.
- He has a rash in line with a drug reaction and is currently on multiple medications including Lasix, metoprolol, carvedilol, valsartan, and digoxin.
- The patient has acute renal failure,"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**1-14**]:
   - metoprolol d/c'd, carvedilol ordered but held given sBP around 100
   - valsartan decreased from 40 to 20mg daily
   - started to metolazone since UOP was not great on lasix gtt alone
   - diuresing well on lasix gtt and metolazone
   - tried to put in PIVs, no success, plan to keep swan in today, and if
   afebrile today, will order PICC tomorrow.  If he spikes again, will
   remove swan and re-site the central line
   - PICC nurse attempted to put in PICC on the left arm, was able to put
   the line in but couldn't pass the line, then realized the ICD on the
   left side.  Will come back to put in the PICC on the right.

   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure. Cardiac
   catheterization with swann placement on [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated
   wedge pressures.  ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory acidosis with
   appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent with patient
   baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation. Today, CXR
   improved, diastolic PA pressures around 20 and edema significantly
   improved.  Vent setting was changed from AC to PS yesterday morning
   [**1-13**], which was turned back to AC o/n for respiratory acidosis. Patient
   now tolerating PS of [**9-29**].

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health
   care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   Patient is diuresing steadily.  His PAD is 25 and RAP 17.  His CO is
   well-preserved, and BP stable.  Would like to do a modest amount of
   further volume unloading then try to wean vent.  Switch from carvedilol
   to metoprolol given hx asthma and borderline BP

","The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following an elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. He has a history of substance abuse and morbid obesity, which makes cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable. The patient is currently experiencing an acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation, with profound biventricular systolic dysfunction. His ejection fraction (EF) is 10%, and he has elevated PA pressures and wedge pressures during catheterization. 

The patient's diuresis is very sensitive to blood pressure, with significant improvement in UOP when sBP is above 120. His current medications include Lasix gtt, metolazone, carvedilol, digoxin, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

The patient's fever is suspected to be due to a drug reaction, as he has a blanching lower extremity rash and positive blood cultures for GPC, with speciation and sensitivities pending. 

His renal function is resolving, with a stable creatinine level at 1.2. He also has anemia and asthma, for which he will be started on albuterol when extubated. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 119/47 mmHg, respiratory rate"

   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart
   catheterization.
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Diuresis very sensitive to BP, i.e., UOP improves
   significantly when sBP is above 120. On [**1-14**], decrease valsartan from
   40mg to 20mg daily since pt
s UOP is very sensitive to BP. CXR
   demonstrates improved pulmonary edema, lower extremity edema improved,
   length of stay negative 7L.. Changed Metoprolol 50mg TID to carvedilol
   3.125mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-14**] but held [**1-22**] BP. Changed back to 25 TID metoprolol
   for better rate control on [**1-15**], but held on [**1-15**] given hypotension and
   poor UOP. Diuresis complicated by hyperbicarbia (contraction) and now
   acute renal failure (creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3). Eplerenone is
   structurally similar to spironolactone, so given h/o allergy to
   spironolactone and current rash, would hold off on eplerenone
   -  hold lasix gtt, diamox, metolazone and valsartan for now
   -  continue BB
   -  replete K to 5
   -  F/U myocardial pathology
   -  hold Digoxin
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure. Cardiac
   catheterization with swann placement on [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated
   wedge pressures.  ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory acidosis with
   appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent with patient
   baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation. Today, CXR
   improved, diastolic PA pressures around 20 and edema significantly
   improved.  Vent setting was changed from AC to PS on [**1-13**], which was
   turned back to AC o/n for respiratory acidosis. Patient now tolerating
   PS of [**9-29**].
   -  hold lasix gtt, diamox, metolazone for now
   -  decrease PEEP to 8, attempt extubation today, will extubated to
   BiPAP
   -  wean off sedation, consider precedex for sedation pre-extrubation

   [**1-12**] and 101.1 on [**1-13**] after vancomycin was held after 4 days of
   treatment on [**1-11**].  Patient continued to spike fevers on [**1-15**]. Vanc was
   re-started on [**1-12**].  Sputum culture from [**1-9**] and [**1-12**] demonstrates
   pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. Sputum cx from [**1-13**] grew out GNR
   again.  UA/Ucx negative. Blood cx from [**1-12**] grew CoNS, sensitivities
   pending. RUQ US: normal.  Meds could be responsible to the fever as
   well. Patient has blanching lower extremity rash in line with drug
   reaction.  Swan catheter was removed on [**1-15**] after PICC placed.  CXR
   shows persistent LLL opacity, consistent with atelectasis or infection.
   - Continue Vancomycin, day 5
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day 8
   - add cefepime (day1: [**1-16**])
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3 on [**1-15**] in the
   setting of hypotension, patient was receiving lasix gtt as well as
   diamox, metolazone, and captopril.  Patient
s UOP is very sensitive to
   BP.  Feurea 14.

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart
   catheterization.
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Diuresis very sensitive to BP, i.e., UOP improves
   significantly when sBP is above 120. On [**1-14**], decrease valsartan from
   40mg to 20mg daily since pt
s UOP is very sensitive to BP. CXR
   demonstrates improved pulmonary edema, lower extremity edema improved,
   length of stay negative 7L.. Changed Metoprolol 50mg TID to carvedilol
   3.125mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-14**] but held [**1-22**] BP. Changed back to 25 TID metoprolol
   for better rate control on [**1-15**], but held on [**1-15**] given hypotension and
   poor UOP. Diuresis complicated by hyperbicarbia (contraction) and now
   acute renal failure (creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3). Eplerenone is
   structurally similar to spironolactone, so given h/o allergy to
   spironolactone and current rash, would hold off on eplerenone
   -  hold lasix gtt, diamox, metolazone, BB and valsartan for now
   - once BP and UOP recovers, can restart lasix
   - replete K to 5
   -  F/U myocardial pathology
   -  Continue Digoxin
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure. Cardiac
   catheterization with swann placement on [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated
   wedge pressures.  ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory acidosis with
   appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent with patient
   baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation. Today, CXR
   improved, diastolic PA pressures around 20 and edema significantly
   improved.  Vent setting was changed from AC to PS on [**1-13**], which was
   turned back to AC o/n for respiratory acidosis. Patient now tolerating
   PS of [**9-29**].
   -  hold lasix gtt, diamox, metolazone and BB for now
   - attempt extubation today, will extubated to BiPAP
   - consider precedex for sedation pre-extrubation attempt
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - ABG
s PRN
   - keep HOB at 30
   - f/u pulmonary recs
   - Continue Fentanyl/Versed sedation for now
   .
   # Fever: Patient with fever to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, Tmax 102.9 on
   [**1-12**] and 101.1 on [**1-13**] after vancomycin was held after 4 days of
   treatment on [**1-11**].  Patient continued to spike fevers on [**1-15**]. Vanc was
   re-started on [**1-12**].  Sputum culture from [**1-9**] and [**1-12**] demonstrates
   pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. Sputum cx from [**1-13**] grew out GNR
   again.  UA/Ucx negative. Blood cx from [**1-12**] grew CoNS, sensitivities
   pending. RUQ US: normal.  Meds could be responsible to the fever as
   well. Patient has blanching lower extremity rash in line with drug
   reaction.  Swan catheter was removed on [**1-15**] after PICC placed.  CXR
   shows persistent LLL opacity, consistent with atelectasis or infection.
   - Continue Vancomycin, day 5
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day 8
   - consider starting zosyn or cefepime for continued fever
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3 on [**1-15**] in the
   setting of hypotension, patient was receiving lasix gtt as well as
   diamox, metolazone, BB, and captopril.  Patient
s UOP is very sensitive
   to BP.
   - hold lasix, diamox, metolazone, BB and captopril for now
   - follow up urine lytes
   - avoid renal toxins and renally dose meds
   - continue to trend renal function
   .
   # UGIB:  Patient was noted to have UGIB yesterday on [**1-15**].  His hct is
   stable. NGT output was coffee-ground this morning.
   - maintain active T+S
   - continue IV PPI
   - get pm hct
   - f/u GI recs
   - can restart TF once UGIB stops and if not extubating
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].
   Patient will need PA/lateral CXR once he is extubated to check lead
   position.
   - Replete K to 5, Mg > 2
   - Continue Digoxin 0.25mg daily
   - hold BB for now
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Stable at 2.2. Etiologies include obstructive and
   infiltrative disease though most likely congestive. Given fever, he was
   ruled out for cholecystitis and may have gallbladder agenesis as it was
   unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Trend LFT
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD. No coronary disease reported on
   cardiac catheterization.
   - continue ASA 325mg daily
   - hold BB for now
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.  Hct stable despite small GIB
   - Trend Hct
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg PO TID, on bowel regimen
   - Ascorbic acid 250mg PO TID
   .
   # Asthma: Will start Albuterol 1-2 puffs q6H:PRN wheezing when
   extubated.  Use carvedilol with caution since it can exacerbate asthma.
   .
   # OSA:  Restart nocturnal CPAP once extubated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. He has a history of profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, likely secondary to prior heavy cocaine use. The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. He has a fever, elevated PA pressures, and improved pulmonary edema. His renal function has deteriorated, with a creatinine level of 2.3 from 1.3. He also has a history of asthma and OSA.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers, and cultures have grown Serratia Marcescens and CoNS. He has been treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin, but his fever persists. There is a concern for ongoing infection, which may require further antibiotics.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.3 to 2.3, indicating acute renal failure. This could be due to hypotension, as well as the use of diuretics, BB, and captopril. It is important to hold these medications and monitor renal function closely.

3. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient has had UGIB, with coffee-ground NGT output. He is"

   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Diuresis very sensitive to BP, i.e., UOP improves
   significantly when sBP is above 120. On [**1-14**], decrease valsartan from
   40mg to 20mg daily since pt
s UOP is very sensitive to BP. CXR
   demonstrates improved pulmonary edema, lower extremity edema improved,
   length of stay negative 7L.. Changed Metoprolol 50mg TID to carvedilol
   3.125mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-14**] but held [**1-22**] BP. Changed back to 25 TID metoprolol
   for better rate control on [**1-15**], but held on [**1-15**] given hypotension and
   poor UOP. Diuresis complicated by hyperbicarbia (contraction) and now
   acute renal failure (creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3). Eplerenone is
   structurally similar to spironolactone, so given h/o allergy to
   spironolactone and current rash, would hold off on eplerenone
   -  hold lasix gtt, diamox, metolazone, BB and valsartan for now
   - once BP and UOP recovers, can restart lasix
   - replete K to 5
   -  F/U myocardial pathology
   -  Continue Digoxin
   .
   # Failure to extubate: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure. Cardiac
   catheterization with swann placement on [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated
   wedge pressures.  ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory acidosis with
   appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent with patient
   baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation. Today, CXR
   improved, diastolic PA pressures around 20 and edema significantly
   improved.  Vent setting was changed from AC to PS on [**1-13**], which was
   turned back to AC o/n for respiratory acidosis. Patient now tolerating
   PS of [**9-29**].
   -  hold lasix gtt, diamox, metolazone and BB for now
   - attempt extubation today, will extubated to BiPAP
   - consider precedex for sedation pre-extrubation attempt
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - ABG
s PRN
   - keep HOB at 30
   - f/u pulmonary recs
   - Continue Fentanyl/Versed sedation for now
   .
   # Fever: Patient with fever to 101.2 on arrival to CCU, Tmax 102.9 on
   [**1-12**] and 101.1 on [**1-13**] after vancomycin was held after 4 days of
   treatment on [**1-11**].  Patient continued to spike fevers on [**1-15**]. Vanc was
   re-started on [**1-12**].  Sputum culture from [**1-9**] and [**1-12**] demonstrates
   pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. Sputum cx from [**1-13**] grew out GNR
   again.  UA/Ucx negative. Blood cx from [**1-12**] grew CoNS, sensitivities
   pending. RUQ US: normal.  Meds could be responsible to the fever as
   well. Patient has blanching lower extremity rash in line with drug
   reaction.  Swan catheter was removed on [**1-15**] after PICC placed.  CXR
   shows persistent LLL opacity, consistent with atelectasis or infection.
   - Continue Vancomycin, day 5
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day 8
   - consider starting zosyn or cefepime for continued fever
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3 on [**1-15**] in the
   setting of hypotension, patient was receiving lasix gtt as well as
   diamox, metolazone, BB, and captopril.  Patient
s UOP is very sensitive
   to BP.
   - hold lasix, diamox, metolazone, BB and captopril for now
   - follow up urine lytes
   - avoid renal toxins and renally dose meds
   - continue to trend renal function
   .
   # UGIB:  Patient was noted to have UGIB yesterday on [**1-15**].  His hct is
   stable. NGT output was coffee-ground this morning.
   - maintain active T+S
   - get pm lytes
   - f/u GI recs
   - can restart TF once UGIB stops
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].
   Patient will need PA/lateral CXR once he is extubated to check lead
   position.
   - Replete K to 5, Mg > 2
   - Continue Digoxin 0.25mg daily
   - hold BB for now
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Stable at 2.2. Etiologies include obstructive and
   infiltrative disease though most likely congestive. Given fever, he was
   ruled out for cholecystitis and may have gallbladder agenesis as it was
   unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Trend LFT
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD. No coronary disease reported on
   cardiac catheterization.
   - continue ASA 325mg daily
   - hold BB for now
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.  Hct stable despite small GIB
   - Trend Hct
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg PO TID, on bowel regimen
   - Ascorbic acid 250mg PO TID
   .
   # Asthma: Will start Albuterol 1-2 puffs q6H:PRN wheezing when
   extubated.  Use carvedilol with caution since it can exacerbate asthma.
   .
   # OSA:  Restart nocturnal CPAP once extubated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following an elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization.
- The patient has a history of profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, possibly secondary to prior heavy cocaine use.
- He is also morbidly obese and has a history of substance abuse, which makes cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable.
- The patient's diuresis is very sensitive to blood pressure, with significant improvement in urine output when systolic blood pressure is above 120.
- His current medications include metoprolol, carvedilol, valsartan, eplerenone, lasix, diamox, metolazone, and digoxin.
- The patient has been experiencing fever, with spikes on different days, and has been on vancomycin for suspected infection.
- He also has acute renal failure, with a significant increase in creatinine from 1.3 to 2.3, and his urine output is very sensitive to blood pressure.
- The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and his hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable.
- He has a history of tachyarrhythmias and has had one episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT).
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been extubation-attempt"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU after failing to extubate following an elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient has a history of morbid obesity, substance abuse, and chronic systolic heart failure with profound biventricular systolic dysfunction. He underwent cardiac catheterization and myocardial biopsy, which showed an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation, failure to extubate, fever, acute renal failure, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, rhythm disturbances, hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, asthma, and obstructive sleep apnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.3 to 2.3, indicating a decline in renal function. This could be due to hypotension and the use of diuretics. It is important to monitor renal function closely and avoid renal toxins.

2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has experienced coffee-ground NGT output, suggesting a possible UGIB. This needs to be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to stabilize the patient's condition.

3. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers, and cultures have grown pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens and gram-negative rods. The patient is currently on multiple"

   # Fever and leukocytosis: Patient continued to be febrile up to 102F
   this morning despite Tylenol and cooling blanket.  WBC trending up,
   from 10.3 to 15.4, and eos 4.7%.  Patient was started on cefepime
   yesterday on [**1-16**], so this persistent fever and elevated white count
   could be drug-fever related to cefepime.  Vanc was discontinued on
   [**1-16**]. Sputum culture from [**1-9**] and [**1-12**] and [**1-13**] demonstrates
   pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. Sputum cx from [**1-15**] pending but gram
   stain showed no organisms.   CXR shows persistent LLL opacity,
   consistent with atelectasis or infection. UA/Ucx negative, but urine
   eos positive. Blood cx from [**1-12**] grew CoNS in

   contamination.  Swan catheter was removed on [**1-15**] after PICC placed.RUQ
   US: normal.
   - discontinue cefepime
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day 9

   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient was stable on PS [**9-27**] most of the day
   yesterday, but ABG at 3am this morning looked worse with respiratory
   acidosis, so was switched back to AC this morning.  The barrier to
   extubation includes extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large
   body habitus), poor lung compliance due to volume overload from
   patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, and serratia pneumonia.
   Patient was on lasix gtt for aggressive diuresis up until 2 days ago on
   [**1-15**] when he developed acute renal failure.  LOS fluid balance is
   -6700cc today.
   -  continue to hold lasix gtt and metolazone for now

   setting of hypotension, patient was receiving lasix gtt as well as
   diamox, metolazone, and captopril.  Creatinine improved on [**1-16**] to 1.7,
   but this morning it worsened again to 2.4.  Renal was consulted on
   [**1-16**], and urine showed no evidence of ATN.
   - hold lasix, diamox, metolazone, and valsartan for now
   - follow up urine eos
   - renal consult
   - avoid renal toxins and renally dose meds
   - continue to trend renal function
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Diuresis very sensitive to BP, i.e., UOP improves
   significantly when sBP is above 120. On [**1-14**], decrease valsartan from
   40mg to 20mg daily since pt
s UOP is very sensitive to BP. CXR
   demonstrates improved pulmonary edema, lower extremity edema improved,
   length of stay negative 7L.. Changed Metoprolol 50mg TID to carvedilol
   3.125mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-14**] but held [**1-22**] BP. Changed back to 25 TID metoprolol
   for better rate control on [**1-15**], but held on [**1-15**] given hypotension and
   poor UOP. Diuresis complicated by hyperbicarbia (contraction) and now
   acute renal failure (creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3). Eplerenone is
   structurally similar to spironolactone, so given h/o allergy to
   spironolactone and current rash, would hold off on eplerenone

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy who was admitted to the CCU after experiencing respiratory failure post-elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient has been febrile and leukocytosis despite receiving cefepime, which suggests a possible drug fever. Sputum cultures have grown pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens, and the patient's urine is positive for eosinophils. The patient's renal function has been fluctuating, with creatinine levels ranging from 1.7 to 2.4. He also has acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation, morbid obesity, and a history of substance abuse. The patient's respiratory acidosis has led to the decision to hold diuretics and consider a tracheostomy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Serratia Marcescens infection: The presence of pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens in the sputum culture indicates a bacterial infection. This may require adjustment of antibiotic therapy.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The fluctuating creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. It is necessary to monitor renal function and adjust medications accordingly.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF Exacerbation: The patient's biventricular systolic dysfunction and history of cocaine use have led to an exacerbation of systolic CHF. Continued monitoring and management of fluid"

   red stain).  However, this is a very limited sample.
   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart
   catheterization.
   .
   # Fever and leukocytosis: Patient continued to be febrile up to 102F
   this morning despite Tylenol and cooling blanket.  WBC trending up,
   from 10.3 to 15.4, and eos 4.7%.  Patient was started on cefepime
   yesterday on [**1-16**], so this persistent fever and elevated white count
   could be drug-fever related to cefepime.  Vanc was discontinued on
   [**1-16**]. Sputum culture from [**1-9**] and [**1-12**] and [**1-13**] demonstrates
   pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. Sputum cx from [**1-15**] pending but gram
   stain showed no organisms.   CXR shows persistent LLL opacity,
   consistent with atelectasis or infection. UA/Ucx negative, but urine
   eos positive. Blood cx from [**1-12**] grew CoNS in
 bottles, likely
   contamination.  Swan catheter was removed on [**1-15**] after PICC placed.RUQ
   US: normal.
   - continue cefepime day2
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day 9
   - check c.diff
   - start flagyl
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient was stable on PS [**9-27**] most of the day
   yesterday, but ABG at 3am this morning looked worse with respiratory
   acidosis, so was switched back to AC this morning.  The barrier to
   extubation includes extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large
   body habitus), poor lung compliance due to volume overload from
   patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, and serratia pneumonia.
   Patient was on lasix gtt for aggressive diuresis up until 2 days ago on
   [**1-15**] when he developed acute renal failure.  LOS fluid balance is
   -6700cc today.
   -  continue to hold lasix gtt, diamox and metolazone for now
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day [**4-28**] need to consider trachostomy given patient
s dependence on
   ventilator for breathing

   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3 on [**1-15**] in the
   setting of hypotension, patient was receiving lasix gtt as well as
   diamox, metolazone, and captopril.  Creatinine improved on [**1-16**] to 1.7,
   but this morning it worsened again to 2.4.  Renal was consulted on
   [**1-16**], and urine showed no evidence of ATN.
   - hold lasix, diamox, metolazone, and valsartan for now
   - pm lytes
   - consider IVF boluses
   - renal consult
   - avoid renal toxins and renally dose meds
   - continue to trend renal function
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Diuresis very sensitive to BP, i.e., UOP improves
   significantly when sBP is above 120. On [**1-14**], decrease valsartan from
   40mg to 20mg daily since pt
s UOP is very sensitive to BP. CXR
   demonstrates improved pulmonary edema, lower extremity edema improved,
   length of stay negative 7L.. Changed Metoprolol 50mg TID to carvedilol
   3.125mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-14**] but held [**1-22**] BP. Changed back to 25 TID metoprolol
   for better rate control on [**1-15**], but held on [**1-15**] given hypotension and
   poor UOP. Diuresis complicated by hyperbicarbia (contraction) and now
   acute renal failure (creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3). Eplerenone is
   structurally similar to spironolactone, so given h/o allergy to
   spironolactone and current rash, would hold off on eplerenone
   -  continue to hold lasix gtt, diamox, metolazone and valsartan for now
   -  continue BB
   -  Digoxin was restarted on the afternoon of [**1-16**] because of
   tachycardia after being held in the morning, will continue digoxin for
   now
   -  replete K to 5
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient continues to be tachycardic.  HR was up to 140s
   yesterday. Patient is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of
   tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy EF of 10%
   (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 0.9 on [**1-9**].
   Patient will need PA/lateral CXR once he is extubated to check lead
   position.
   - Replete K to 5, Mg > 2

   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Stable at 2.1. Etiologies include obstructive and
   infiltrative disease though most likely congestive. Given fever, he was
   ruled out for cholecystitis and may have gallbladder agenesis as it was
   unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Trend LFT

   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD. No coronary disease reported on
   cardiac catheterization.
   - continue ASA 325mg daily

   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.  Hct stable despite small GIB
   noted on [**1-15**].
   - Trend Hct
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg PO TID, on bowel regimen
   - continue IV PPI
   - Ascorbic acid 250mg PO TID

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:

   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]  on:[**2193-1-17**]
   11:22 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient continues to have a fever of 102.0°F and an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection. The sputum culture from January 9, 12, and 13 shows pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. It is suggested to continue cefepime and levofloxacin, and consider a tracheostomy due to the patient's dependence on the ventilator for breathing.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was stable on pressure support most of the day yesterday but showed worsening ABG results in the early morning, indicating respiratory acidosis. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity), poor lung compliance due to volume overload from systolic and diastolic heart failure, and serratia pneumonia. It is recommended to hold lasix gtt, diamox, and metolazone for now, and continue levofloxacin. The patient's dependence on the ventilator suggests considering a tracheostomy.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level increased from 1.3 to 2.3 on January"

   # Fever and leukocytosis: Patient continued to be febrile up to 102F
   this morning despite Tylenol and cooling blanket.  WBC trending up,
   from 10.3 to 15.4, and eos 4.7%.  Patient was started on cefepime
   yesterday on [**1-16**], so this persistent fever and elevated white count
   could be drug-fever related to cefepime.  Vanc was discontinued on
   [**1-16**]. Sputum culture from [**1-9**] and [**1-12**] and [**1-13**] demonstrates
   pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. Sputum cx from [**1-15**] pending but gram
   stain showed no organisms.   CXR shows persistent LLL opacity,
   consistent with atelectasis or infection. UA/Ucx negative, but urine
   eos positive. Blood cx from [**1-12**] grew CoNS in
 bottles, likely
   contamination.  Swan catheter was removed on [**1-15**] after PICC placed.RUQ
   US: normal.

   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient was stable on PS [**9-27**] most of the day
   yesterday, but ABG at 3am this morning looked worse with respiratory
   acidosis, so was switched back to AC this morning.  The barrier to
   extubation includes extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large
   body habitus), poor lung compliance due to volume overload from
   patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure, and serratia pneumonia.
   Patient was on lasix gtt for aggressive diuresis up until 2 days ago on
   [**1-15**] when he developed acute renal failure.  LOS fluid balance is
   -6700cc today.
   -  continue to hold lasix gtt, diamox and metolazone for now

   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3 on [**1-15**] in the
   setting of hypotension, patient was receiving lasix gtt as well as
   diamox, metolazone, and captopril.  Creatinine improved on [**1-16**] to 1.7,
   but this morning it worsened again to 2.4.  Renal was consulted on
   [**1-16**], and urine showed no evidence of ATN.
   - hold lasix, diamox, metolazone, and valsartan for now
   - pm lytes
   - consider IVF boluses
   - renal consult
   - avoid renal toxins and renally dose meds
   - continue to trend renal function
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Diuresis very sensitive to BP, i.e., UOP improves
   significantly when sBP is above 120. On [**1-14**], decrease valsartan from
   40mg to 20mg daily since pt
s UOP is very sensitive to BP. CXR
   demonstrates improved pulmonary edema, lower extremity edema improved,
   length of stay negative 7L.. Changed Metoprolol 50mg TID to carvedilol
   3.125mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-14**] but held [**1-22**] BP. Changed back to 25 TID metoprolol
   for better rate control on [**1-15**], but held on [**1-15**] given hypotension and
   poor UOP. Diuresis complicated by hyperbicarbia (contraction) and now
   acute renal failure (creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3). Eplerenone is
   structurally similar to spironolactone, so given h/o allergy to
   spironolactone and current rash, would hold off on eplerenone

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has been febrile, with a temperature of 102.0, despite being on cefepime, which was started yesterday. His white blood cell count is trending up, and eosinophils are present in the urine. Sputum cultures have grown pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a creatinine level of 2.4. He has a history of acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation, morbid obesity, and substance abuse, making cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable. The patient's diuresis is sensitive to blood pressure, and he is currently on several medications for heart failure, including metoprolol, carvedilol, digoxin, and eplerenone. His rhythm remains tachycardic, and he is s/p AICD placement for primary prevention of tachyarrhythmias. The patient has also experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which has resolved, and hyperbilirubinemia. He has a known history of iron deficiency anemia and asthma. The patient is expected to undergo a tracheostomy due to dependence on mechanical ventilation."

   [**1-16**]. Cefepime added on [**1-16**].  Sputum culture from [**1-9**] and [**1-12**]
   demonstrates pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. Sputum cx from [**1-13**]
   grew out GNR again.  UA/Ucx negative. Blood cx from [**1-12**] grew CoNS,
   sensitivities pending. RUQ US: normal.  Meds could be responsible to
   the fever as well. Patient has blanching lower extremity rash in line
   with drug reaction.  Swan catheter was removed on [**1-15**] after PICC
   placed.  CXR shows persistent LLL opacity, consistent with atelectasis
   or infection.
   - Continue Vancomycin, day 5
   - Continue Levofloxacin, day 8
   - add cefepime (day1: [**1-16**])
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient was unable to be extubated in the PACU
   s/p ICD placement, EP study and right heart cardiac catherization on
   [**1-8**]. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid
   obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume
   overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure. Cardiac
   catheterization with swann placement on [**1-10**] demonstrated elevated
   wedge pressures.  ABG
s demonstrate chronic respiratory acidosis with
   appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent with patient
   baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation. Today, CXR
   improved, diastolic PA pressures around 20 and edema significantly
   improved.  Vent setting was changed from AC to PS on [**1-13**], which was
   turned back to AC o/n for respiratory acidosis. Patient now tolerating
   PS of [**9-29**].
   -  hold lasix gtt, diamox, metolazone for now
   -  decrease PEEP to 8, attempt extubation today, will extubated to
   BiPAP
   -  wean off sedation, consider precedex for sedation pre-extrubation
   attempt
   -  ABG
s PRN
   -  keep HOB at 30
   -  f/u pulmonary recs

   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3 on [**1-15**] in the
   setting of hypotension, patient was receiving lasix gtt as well as
   diamox, metolazone, and captopril.  Patient
s UOP is very sensitive to
   BP.  Feurea 14.
   - hold lasix, diamox, metolazone, and captopril for now
   - follow up urine eos
   - renal consult
   - avoid renal toxins and renally dose meds
   - continue to trend renal function
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Diuresis very sensitive to BP, i.e., UOP improves
   significantly when sBP is above 120. On [**1-14**], decrease valsartan from
   40mg to 20mg daily since pt
s UOP is very sensitive to BP. CXR
   demonstrates improved pulmonary edema, lower extremity edema improved,
   length of stay negative 7L.. Changed Metoprolol 50mg TID to carvedilol
   3.125mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-14**] but held [**1-22**] BP. Changed back to 25 TID metoprolol
   for better rate control on [**1-15**], but held on [**1-15**] given hypotension and
   poor UOP. Diuresis complicated by hyperbicarbia (contraction) and now
   acute renal failure (creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3). Eplerenone is
   structurally similar to spironolactone, so given h/o allergy to
   spironolactone and current rash, would hold off on eplerenone

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy who was admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient has been febrile to 102 degrees despite Tylenol and cooling blanket. Sputum culture demonstrates pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. The patient has a blanching lower extremity rash consistent with a drug reaction. Swan catheter was removed on 1/15 after PICC placement. CXR shows persistent LLL opacity, consistent with atelectasis or infection.

The patient is unable to be extubated in the PACU following ICD placement, EP study, and right heart cardiac catheterization on 1/8. Likely in setting of extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large body habitus) and poor lung compliance due to volume overload from patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure. Cardiac catheterization with swann placement on 1/10 demonstrated elevated wedge pressures. ABGs demonstrate chronic respiratory acidosis with appropriate metabolic compensation, which is consistent with patient baseline and is likely due to obesity hypoventilation. Today, CXR improved, diastolic PA pressures around 20, and edema significantly improved. Vent setting was changed from AC to PS on 1/13, which was turned back to AC o/n for respiratory acidosis.

   # Fever and leukocytosis: Patient afebrile since noon on [**1-17**] with
   change in antibiotic regimen from Levofloxacin (day 10), Cefepime (day
   3), Vancomycin (day 10), and Flagyl (day 2). WBC today 14.5. Repeated
   sputum cultures, most recently from [**1-16**], demonstrate pan-sensitive
   Serratia Marcescens, but did not respond well to Levofloxacin. CT scan
   from [**1-18**] pending, but preliminary read demonstrates LL lobe collapse
   and partial RLL collapse. Blood cx from [**1-12**] grew CoNS in
 bottles,
   likely contamination.  Swan catheter was removed on [**1-15**] after PICC
   placed, but swan tip culture negative.
   - F/U final CT chest/abdomen/pelvis read
   - F/U outstanding blood cultures/final sputum cultures/c .diff
   - Cefepime, day 3
   - Vancomycin, day 10
   - Flagyl, day 2
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient was stable on PS [**9-27**] x several days,
   but on [**1-17**] was switched back to AC with increasing PEEP requirement
   for worsening respiratory status.  Preliminary CT chest from [**2193-1-18**]
   demonstrated complete LLL collapse and partial RLL collapse. Sputum
   cultures from [**1-16**] continue to grow Serratia. Barriers to extubation
   include: 1. extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large body
   habitus), 2. poor lung compliance due to volume overload from patient's
   systolic and diastolic heart failure, and 3. lobar collapse/pneumonia.
   LOS fluid balance is negative 6.5 to 7L. Pulmonary following,
   recommended changes to antibiotics regimen.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   - Need to consider tracheostomy as patient has been intubated for 10
   days
   - HOB at 30
   - Frequent ABG
   - F/u pulmonary recs
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3 on
   [**1-15**] in the setting of hypotension, patient was receiving lasix gtt as
   well as diamox, metolazone, and captopril.  Creatinine returned to
   baseline of 1.3 this AM. Renal following.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt, Diamox, Metolazone
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/U renal recs
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Length of CCU stay negative 6.5-7L.  Blood pressures
   difficult to control without compromising UOP and diuresis complicated
   by hyperbicarbia (contraction) and acute renal failure (creatinine
   bumped from 1.3 to 2.3), so all antihypertensives and diuretics held on
   [**1-17**]. Since defeverescing, patient with sbp
s in the 130-140
s, ARF
   resolved, hypercarbia noticeably improved.
   - Continue to hold Diamox & Metolazone
   - Consider Lasix boluses PRN, titrating to maintain CCU goal of -6.5 to
   7L
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate PO to 50 mg TID
   - Digoxin 0.25mg PO daily
   - Replete K to 5
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient continues to be tachycardic, but improvement in hr
   to the 90-100
s since defeverescing. Patient is s/p AICD placement for
   primary prevention of tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
   EF of 10% (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 1.3
   on [**1-17**].
   - F/U Final CT chest to confirm lead placement
   - Replete K to 5, Mg > 2
   - Digoxin 0.25mg PO daily
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate PO 50mg TID
   .
   # UGIB:  Patient was noted to have a small amount of bright red blood
   in his NG tube on [**1-15**], NG lavage did not demonstrate an active bleed.
   His Hct has been stable and no further blood has been detected. GI
   aware.
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue IV PPI
   - Continue TF
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Stable at 1.7, last checked on [**2193-1-17**], likely
   congestive. Given fever, he was ruled out for cholecystitis and may
   have gallbladder agenesis as it was unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Intermittent LFT checks

   Complicated problems include resp infection as well as restrictive
   ventilatory physiology hindering vent weaning.  Will require focusewd
   input from pulmonary to assist us with vent weaning.  He remains
   hemodynamically relatively stable and we will try to advance his heart
   failure regimen to treat his severe, advanced cardiomyopathy.  In
   meanwhile we anticipate cardiac transplant evaluation in near future.

","The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy who was admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization due to pulmonary infection. The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient was afebrile since noon on [**1-17**] with a change in antibiotic regimen. WBC today is 14.5. Repeated sputum cultures demonstrate pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens, but did not respond well to Levofloxacin. A CT scan from [**1-18**] is pending, but preliminary read demonstrates LL lobe collapse and partial RLL collapse. Blood cx from [**1-12**] grew CoNS in bottles, likely contamination. Swan catheter was removed on [**1-15**] after PICC placement, but swan tip culture negative.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was stable on PS [**9-27**] x several days, but on [**1-17**] was switched back to AC with increasing PEEP requirement for worsening respiratory status. Preliminary CT chest from [**2193-1-18**] demonstrated complete LLL collapse and partial RLL collapse. Sputum cultures from [**1-16**] continue to grow Serratia. Barriers to extubation include extrap"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including hypertension, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU for septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient's temperature spiked to 104 degrees Fahrenheit this morning, prompting the use of cooling measures and the administration of a new antibiotic regimen. A CT scan of the torso and chest revealed partial collapses in both lungs, which may be due to atelectasis or infection. Serratia was cultured from sputum samples. The patient's blood cultures were negative. C. difficile testing is pending. The patient has allergies to losartan, spironolactone, lisinopril, and ciprofloxacin. His last doses of antibiotics were levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime. The patient is receiving midazolam, fentanyl, heparin, and pantoprazole infusions. His review of systems is unchanged from admission. 

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 104.1 degrees Fahrenheit, current temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 77-128 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 111/52 to 151/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and mixed venous oxygen saturation of 69%. The patient's weight has decreased"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a young obese male who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's temperature spiked to 104 degrees Fahrenheit this morning, and he has been given cooling blankets and ice packs. The fever defervesced in the afternoon after starting a new antibiotic regimen.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 77-128 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 111/52 to 151/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis, and the initial sputum culture grew Serratia Marcescens. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 48 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 164, indicating adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and lactate levels are also elevated. The liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are within normal range.

   # Fever and leukocytosis: Patient afebrile since noon on [**1-17**] with
   change in antibiotic regimen from Levofloxacin (day 10), Cefepime (day
   3), Vancomycin (day 10), and Flagyl (day 2). WBC today 14.5. Repeated
   sputum cultures, most recently from [**1-16**], demonstrate pan-sensitive
   Serratia Marcescens, but did not respond well to Levofloxacin. CT scan
   from [**1-18**] pending, but preliminary read demonstrates LL lobe collapse
   and partial RLL collapse. Blood cx from [**1-12**] grew CoNS in
 bottles,
   likely contamination.  Swan catheter was removed on [**1-15**] after PICC
   placed, but swan tip culture negative.

   - Flagyl, day 2
   - Check c.diff
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient was stable on PS [**9-27**] x several days,
   but on [**1-17**] was switched back to AC with increasing PEEP requirement
   for worsening respiratory status.  Preliminary CT chest from [**2193-1-18**]
   demonstrated complete LLL collapse and partial RLL collapse. Sputum
   cultures from [**1-16**] continue to grow Serratia. Barriers to extubation
   include: 1. extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large body
   habitus), 2. poor lung compliance due to volume overload from patient's
   systolic and diastolic heart failure, and 3. lobar collapse/pneumonia.
   LOS fluid balance is negative 6.5 to 7L. Pulmonary following,
   recommended changes to antibiotics regimen.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   - Need to consider tracheostomy as patient has been intubated for 10
   days
   - HOB at 30
   - Frequent ABG
   - F/u pulmonary recs
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3 on
   [**1-15**] in the setting of hypotension, patient was receiving lasix gtt as
   well as diamox, metolazone, and captopril.  Creatinine returned to
   baseline of 1.3 this AM. Renal following.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt, Diamox, Metolazone
   - Consider restarting low dose Valsartan for blood pressure control as
   renal function tolerates
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/U renal recs
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Length of CCU stay negative 6.5-7L.  Blood pressures
   difficult to control without compromising UOP and diuresis complicated
   by hyperbicarbia (contraction) and acute renal failure (creatinine
   bumped from 1.3 to 2.3), so all antihypertensives and diuretics held on
   [**1-17**]. Since defeverescing, patient with sbp
s in the 130-140
s, ARF
   resolved, hypercarbia noticeably improved.
   - Continue to hold Diamox & Metolazone
   - Consider restarting very low dose [**Last Name (un) 284**] for goal sbp
s in the 120
   - Consider Lasix boluses PRN, titrating to maintain CCU goal of -6.5 to
   7L
   - Metoprolol Tartrate PO 25mg TID
   - Digoxin 0.25mg PO daily
   - Replete K to 5
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient continues to be tachycardic, but improvement in hr
   to the 90-100
s since defeverescing. Patient is s/p AICD placement for
   primary prevention of tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
   EF of 10% (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 1.3
   on [**1-17**].
   - F/U Final CT chest to confirm lead placement
   - Replete K to 5, Mg > 2
   - Digoxin 0.25mg PO daily
   - Metoprolol Tartrate PO 25mg TID
   .
   # UGIB:  Patient was noted to have a small amount of bright red blood
   in his NG tube on [**1-15**], NG lavage did not demonstrate an active bleed.
   His Hct has been stable and no further blood has been detected. GI
   aware.
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue IV PPI
   - Continue TF
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Stable at 1.7, last checked on [**2193-1-17**], likely
   congestive. Given fever, he was ruled out for cholecystitis and may
   have gallbladder agenesis as it was unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Intermittent LFT checks
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD. No coronary disease reported on
   cardiac catheterization.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg PO TID
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.  Hct stable despite small GIB
   noted on [**1-15**].
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg PO TID,  Ascorbic Acid 250mg PO TID, on bowel
   regimen
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Asthma: Albuterol 1-2 puffs q6H:PRN wheezing once extubated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization due to pulmonary infection. He has been intubated for 10 days and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of substance abuse and morbid obesity, which may impact his candidacy for cardiac transplantation. He has multiple medical complications including fever and leukocytosis, respiratory failure with worsening lung compliance and lobar collapse, acute renal failure resolved with improved renal function, acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation with profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, and a small amount of bright red blood in his NG tube. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, with increasing PEEP requirement and lobar collapse seen on CT scan. Sputum cultures continue to grow Serratia. Barriers to extubation include extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity), poor lung compliance due to volume overload from systolic and diastolic heart failure, and lobar collapse/pneumonia. Tracheostomy may be considered for long-term airway management.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels were elevated on [**1-15**], but resolved with conservative management and hold on nephrotoxic medications. Frequent ABG and electrolyte monitoring is recommended"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a young, obese man admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. He has been experiencing spikes in temperature, with the highest recorded at 104 degrees Fahrenheit. To manage this, a cooling blanket and ice packs have been applied, resulting in a decrease in temperature.

The patient's antibiotic regimen has been changed due to the development of a new infection. He is now receiving vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. Levofloxacin has been discontinued.

Pulmonary recommendations include switching from levofloxacin to ciprofloxacin and restarting vancomycin. The respiratory rate has been increased to 28 if the patient continues to hypoventilate.

Renal recommendations involve increasing free water flushes from 200 to 250cc every four hours. A CT torso and chest have been performed, revealing left lower lobe collapse and partial right lower lobe collapse, which are likely due to atelectasis but cannot be ruled out as infection. Serratia was cultured from sputum cultures 1-16.

The patient's arterial line, PICC line, and central venous catheter tip culture are negative. Clostridium difficile testing is pending along with a stool sample. Diamox has been held due to acute renal failure.

The patient has allergies to Cozaar (losartan potassium), cough, spironolactone, rash, itching, and lisinop"

   .
   # Fever and leukocytosis: Patient afebrile since noon on [**1-17**] with
   change in antibiotic regimen from Levofloxacin (day 10), Cefepime (day
   3), Vancomycin (day 10), and Flagyl (day 2). WBC today 14.5. Repeated
   sputum cultures, most recently from [**1-16**], demonstrate pan-sensitive
   Serratia Marcescens, but did not respond well to Levofloxacin. CT scan
   from [**1-18**] pending, but preliminary read demonstrates LL lobe collapse
   and partial RLL collapse. Blood cx from [**1-12**] grew CoNS in
 bottles,
   likely contamination.  Swan catheter was removed on [**1-15**] after PICC
   placed, but swan tip culture negative.
   - F/U final CT chest/abdomen/pelvis read
   - F/U outstanding blood cultures/final sputum cultures/c .diff
   - Cefepime, day 3
   - Vancomycin, day 10
   - Flagyl, day 2
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient was stable on PS [**9-27**] x several days,
   but on [**1-17**] was switched back to AC with increasing PEEP requirement
   for worsening respiratory status.  Preliminary CT chest from [**2193-1-18**]
   demonstrated complete LLL collapse and partial RLL collapse. Sputum
   cultures from [**1-16**] continue to grow Serratia. Barriers to extubation
   include: 1. extrapulmonary restriction (morbid obesity/large body
   habitus), 2. poor lung compliance due to volume overload from patient's
   systolic and diastolic heart failure, and 3. lobar collapse/pneumonia.
   LOS fluid balance is negative 6.5 to 7L. Pulmonary following,
   recommended changes to antibiotics regimen.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   - Need to consider tracheostomy as patient has been intubated for 10
   days
   - HOB at 30
   - Frequent ABG
   - F/u pulmonary recs
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3 on
   [**1-15**] in the setting of hypotension, patient was receiving lasix gtt as
   well as diamox, metolazone, and captopril.  Creatinine returned to
   baseline of 1.3 this AM. Renal following.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt, Diamox, Metolazone
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/U renal recs
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy
   questionable.  Length of CCU stay negative 6.5-7L.  Blood pressures
   difficult to control without compromising UOP and diuresis complicated
   by hyperbicarbia (contraction) and acute renal failure (creatinine
   bumped from 1.3 to 2.3), so all antihypertensives and diuretics held on
   [**1-17**]. Since defeverescing, patient with sbp
s in the 130-140
s, ARF
   resolved, hypercarbia noticeably improved.
   - Continue to hold Diamox & Metolazone
   - Consider Lasix boluses PRN, titrating to maintain CCU goal of -6.5 to
   7L
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate PO to 50 mg TID
   - Digoxin 0.25mg PO daily
   - Replete K to 5
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient continues to be tachycardic, but improvement in hr
   to the 90-100
s since defeverescing. Patient is s/p AICD placement for
   primary prevention of tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
   EF of 10% (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 1.3
   on [**1-17**].
   - F/U Final CT chest to confirm lead placement
   - Replete K to 5, Mg > 2
   - Digoxin 0.25mg PO daily
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate PO 50mg TID
   .
   # UGIB:  Patient was noted to have a small amount of bright red blood
   in his NG tube on [**1-15**], NG lavage did not demonstrate an active bleed.
   His Hct has been stable and no further blood has been detected. GI
   aware.
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue IV PPI
   - Continue TF
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Stable at 1.7, last checked on [**2193-1-17**], likely
   congestive. Given fever, he was ruled out for cholecystitis and may
   have gallbladder agenesis as it was unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Intermittent LFT checks
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD. No coronary disease reported on
   cardiac catheterization.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg PO TID
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.  Hct stable despite small GIB
   noted on [**1-15**].
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg PO TID,  Ascorbic Acid 250mg PO TID, on bowel
   regimen
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Asthma: Albuterol 1-2 puffs q6H:PRN wheezing once extubated.
   .
   # OSA:  Nocturnal CPAP once extubated.

The patient has been febrile since admission, with a high temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit. He has been treated with various antibiotics, including Levofloxacin, Cefepime, Vancomycin, and Flagyl. The patient's sputum cultures have grown pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens, but he did not respond well to Levofloxacin. The patient also has a history of substance abuse and morbid obesity, which makes cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable.

The patient's respiratory status has worsened, with increasing PEEP requirements and a preliminary CT chest showing complete LLL collapse and partial RLL collapse. The patient's blood cultures from January 12th grew CoNS, likely contamination, and the swan catheter tip culture was negative. The patient's fluid balance is negative 6.5 to 7 liters.

The patient's renal function has improved, with a creatinine level returning to baseline after being elevated to 2.3 on January 15th. The patient's antibiotic regimen has been adjusted, and he is currently on Cefepime, Vancomycin, and Flagyl.

The patient's cardiac condition includes profound biventricular systolic dysfunction, with an ejection fraction of 10%."

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization
   c/b atelectasis and pulmonary infection.
   .
   # Fever and leukocytosis: Patient afebrile since noon on [**1-17**] with
   change in antibiotic regimen from Levofloxacin (day 10), Cefepime (day
   4), Vancomycin (day 11), and Flagyl (d/c'd on day 2). WBC today 14.5.
   Repeated sputum cultures, most recently from [**1-16**], demonstrate
   pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens, but did not respond well to
   Levofloxacin. CT scan from [**1-18**] pending, but preliminary read
   demonstrates LL lobe collapse and partial RLL collapse. Blood cx from
   [**1-12**] grew CoNS in
 bottles, likely contamination.  Swan catheter was
   removed on [**1-15**] after PICC placed, but swan tip culture negative.
   Flagyl d/c'd on [**1-17**]. Other major possibilities for source of fever is
   atelectasis and drug reaction
   - F/U final CT chest/abdomen/pelvis read
   - F/U outstanding blood cultures/final sputum cultures/c .diff
   - Cefepime, day 4
   - Vancomycin, day 10
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient was stable on PS [**9-27**] x several days,
   but on [**1-17**] was switched back to AC with increasing PEEP requirement
   for worsening respiratory status.  Preliminary CT chest from [**2193-1-18**]
   demonstrated complete LLL collapse and partial RLL collapse. Sputum
   cultures from [**1-16**] continue to grow Serratia. Extubated on Day 10 of
   intubation. LOS fluid balance is negative at least 7.8L. Pulmonary
   following, recommended changes to antibiotics regimen. Currently
   Saturates 90% on Room air
   - speech and swallow
   - cool mist face tent
   - Antibiotics as above.
   - F/u pulmonary recs
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3 on
   [**1-15**] in the setting of hypotension, patient was receiving lasix gtt as
   well as diamox, metolazone, and captopril.  Creatinine returned to
   baseline of 1.3 this AM. Renal following.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt, Diamox, Metolazone
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/U renal recs
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable
   but it is likely crucial to his long term viability.  Length of CCU
   stay negative 6.5-7L.  Blood pressures difficult to control without
   compromising UOP and diuresis complicated by hyperbicarbia
   (contraction) and acute renal failure (creatinine bumped from 1.3 to
   2.3), so all antihypertensives and diuretics held on [**1-17**]. Since
   defeverescing, patient with sbp
s in the 130-140
s, ARF resolved,
   hypercarbia noticeably improved.
   - PT to evaluate
   - Continue to hold Diamox & Metolazone
   - Consider Lasix boluses PRN, titrating to maintain CCU goal of -6.5 to
   7L
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate PO to 50 mg TID
   - Digoxin 0.25mg PO daily
   - Replete K to 5
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient continues to be tachycardic, but improvement in hr
   to the 90-100
s since defeverescing. Patient is s/p AICD placement for
   primary prevention of tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
   EF of 10% (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 1.3
   on [**1-17**].
   - F/U Final CT chest to confirm lead placement
   - Replete K to 5, Mg > 2
   - Digoxin 0.25mg PO daily
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate PO 50mg TID
   .
   # UGIB:  Patient was noted to have a small amount of bright red blood
   in his NG tube on [**1-15**], NG lavage did not demonstrate an active bleed.
   His Hct has been stable and no further blood has been detected. GI
   aware. This was likely irritation from the NG tube
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue IV PPI
   - Continue TF
s if s/s failed
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Stable at 1.7, last checked on [**2193-1-17**], likely
   congestive. Given fever, he was ruled out for cholecystitis and may
   have gallbladder agenesis as it was unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Intermittent LFT checks
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg PO TID
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.  Hct stable despite small GIB
   noted on [**1-15**].
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg PO TID,  Ascorbic Acid 250mg PO TID, on bowel
   regimen
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Asthma: Albuterol 1-2 puffs q6H:PRN wheezing once extubated.
   .
   # OSA:  Nocturnal CPAP once extubated.

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization
   c/b atelectasis and pulmonary infection.
   .
   # Fever and leukocytosis: Patient afebrile since noon on [**1-17**] with
   change in antibiotic regimen from Levofloxacin (day 10), Cefepime (day
   4), Vancomycin (day 11), and Flagyl (d/c'd on day 2). WBC today 14.5.
   Repeated sputum cultures, most recently from [**1-16**], demonstrate
   pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens, but did not respond well to
   Levofloxacin. CT scan from [**1-18**] pending, but preliminary read
   demonstrates LL lobe collapse and partial RLL collapse. Blood cx from
   [**1-12**] grew CoNS in
 bottles, likely contamination.  Swan catheter was
   removed on [**1-15**] after PICC placed, but swan tip culture negative.
   Flagyl d/c'd on [**1-17**]. Other major possibilities for source of fever is
   atelectasis and drug reaction
   - F/U final CT chest/abdomen/pelvis read
   - F/U outstanding blood cultures/final sputum cultures/c .diff
   - Cefepime, day 4
   - Vancomycin, day 10
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient was stable on PS [**9-27**] x several days,
   but on [**1-17**] was switched back to AC with increasing PEEP requirement
   for worsening respiratory status.  Preliminary CT chest from [**2193-1-18**]
   demonstrated complete LLL collapse and partial RLL collapse. Sputum
   cultures from [**1-16**] continue to grow Serratia. Extubated on Day 10 of
   intubation. LOS fluid balance is negative at least 7.8L. Pulmonary
   following, recommended changes to antibiotics regimen. Currently
   Saturates 90% on Room air
   - speech and swallow
   - cool mist face tent
   - Antibiotics as above.
   - F/u pulmonary recs
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3 on
   [**1-15**] in the setting of hypotension, patient was receiving lasix gtt as
   well as diamox, metolazone, and captopril.  Creatinine returned to
   baseline of 1.3 this AM. Renal following.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt, Diamox, Metolazone
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/U renal recs
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable
   but it is likely crucial to his long term viability.  Length of CCU
   stay negative 6.5-7L.  Blood pressures difficult to control without
   compromising UOP and diuresis complicated by hyperbicarbia
   (contraction) and acute renal failure (creatinine bumped from 1.3 to
   2.3), so all antihypertensives and diuretics held on [**1-17**]. Since
   defeverescing, patient with sbp
s in the 130-140
s, ARF resolved,
   hypercarbia noticeably improved.
   - PT to evaluate
   - Continue to hold Diamox & Metolazone
   - Consider Lasix boluses PRN, titrating to maintain CCU goal of -6.5 to
   7L
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate PO to 50 mg TID
   - Digoxin 0.25mg PO daily
   - Replete K to 5
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient continues to be tachycardic, but improvement in hr
   to the 90-100
s since defeverescing. Patient is s/p AICD placement for
   primary prevention of tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
   EF of 10% (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 1.3
   on [**1-17**].
   - F/U Final CT chest to confirm lead placement
   - Replete K to 5, Mg > 2
   - Digoxin 0.25mg PO daily
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate PO 50mg TID
   .
   # UGIB:  Patient was noted to have a small amount of bright red blood
   in his NG tube on [**1-15**], NG lavage did not demonstrate an active bleed.
   His Hct has been stable and no further blood has been detected. GI
   aware. This was likely irritation from the NG tube
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue IV PPI
   - Continue TF
s if s/s failed
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Stable at 1.7, last checked on [**2193-1-17**], likely
   congestive. Given fever, he was ruled out for cholecystitis and may
   have gallbladder agenesis as it was unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Intermittent LFT checks
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg PO TID
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.  Hct stable despite small GIB
   noted on [**1-15**].
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg PO TID,  Ascorbic Acid 250mg PO TID, on bowel
   regimen
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Asthma: Albuterol 1-2 puffs q6H:PRN wheezing once extubated.
   .
   # OSA:  Nocturnal CPAP once extubated.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   Successfully extubated yesterday thanks to the help from pulmonary.  he
   is doing quite well and stable hemodynamically.  No eviudence of major
   volume overload;  BP actually getting high so we will aggressiveli
   titrate his HF meds.  Increase metoprolol succinate to 200 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   Then observe hemodynamic response and titrate valsartan as tolerated.
   Dur to hx of major bronchospasm, HE SHOULD NOT RECEIVE CARVEDILOL.
   He has a prior skin rash allergy to aldactone so we will try eplerenone
   today

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, who was admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient presented with fever, leukocytosis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation, and rhythm disturbances. He also had a history of iron deficiency anemia, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and possible gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's preliminary CT chest from 1/18 demonstrated complete LLL collapse and partial RLL collapse. He has been experiencing worsening respiratory status, requiring increasing PEEP. Sputum cultures from 1/16 continue to grow Serratia. Extubation on Day 10 of intubation. Negative fluid balance of at least 7.8L. Pulmonary recommendations were made for changes to the antibiotic regimen. Currently saturating 90% on room air.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level increased from 1.3 to 2.3 on 1/15, in the setting of hypotension, while receiving lasix gtt, diamox, metolazone, and captopril. The creatinine returned to baseline of 1.3 this morning. Renal follow-up is recommended. Lasix gtt should be held, diamox"

   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**1-10**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**1-9**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10528**] [**Location (un) 103**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable
   but it is likely crucial to his long term viability.  Length of CCU
   stay negative 6.5-7L.  Blood pressures difficult to control without
   compromising UOP and diuresis complicated by hyperbicarbia
   (contraction) and acute renal failure (creatinine bumped from 1.3 to
   2.3), so all antihypertensives and diuretics held on [**1-17**]. Since
   defeverescing, patient with sbp
s in the 130-140

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy who was admitted to the CCU after failure to extubate following elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization. The patient presented with fever and leukocytosis, but is currently afebrile. The patient also had respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Sputum cultures have grown pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens, and a CT scan showed left lower lobe collapse and partial right lower lobe collapse. The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, but there was a significant increase in creatinine from 1.3 to 2.3 on 1-15 in the setting of hypotension. The patient's acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation is likely due to profound biventricular systolic dysfunction secondary to heavy cocaine use. An echocardiogram showed an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 10%, which may be an overestimate. The patient's morbid obesity and history of substance abuse make cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable. The patient's blood pressures were difficult to control without compromising urine output and diuresis, resulting in hypercarbia and acute renal failure. All antihypertensives and diuretics were held on 1-17. The patient's rhythm remains tachycardic but has improved since defeverescing. The patient underwent AICD placement for primary prevention of tachyarrhythmias given the non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and low EF. There was one episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in the CCU. The patient also had a small amount of bright red blood in his NG tube on 1-15, but no active bleed was detected on NG lavage. The patient's bilirubin levels are stable and likely congestive. The patient has known iron deficiency anemia and has been on a bowel regimen. The patient also has a history of asthma and obstructive sleep apnea.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to the presence of Serratia Marcescens infection and evidence of lung collapse on the CT scan. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation, but may require re-intubation if the respiratory failure worsens.

2. Acute Renal Failure: Although the patient's acute renal failure has resolved, there is a concern for potential recurrence, especially with ongoing use of nephrotoxic agents and the patient's history of substance abuse.

3. Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF Exacerbation: The patient's profound biventricular systolic dysfunction and low EF indicate significant cardiac dysfunction. This exacerbation may lead to worsening heart failure symptoms and potential complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock.
