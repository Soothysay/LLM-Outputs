","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with acute left back pain and abdominal fullness. She is currently admitted to the ICU for suspected acute renal rejection and hyperkalemia. The patient's potassium levels were initially elevated at 6.8, but were corrected to 4.2 after hemodialysis (HD). Her creatinine level was also significantly elevated at 14.7, which has improved to 9 following treatment. The patient has a history of allergy to Bactrim, Cellcept, and an unknown antibiotic. She is currently receiving various medications including dextrose, insulin, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, and her ABG results are within normal limits. Imaging shows perinephritic fluid and fat stranding consistent with renal rejection, as well as a mild left pleural effusion on chest X-ray. The patient's lab results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The assessment and plan include treating acute renal rejection with steroids, managing hypertension, resolving hyperkalemia, addressing anemia, and providing ICU care. Potential complications that can arise include worsening renal function, infection, and electrolyte imbalances."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with acute left back pain and abdominal fullness. She has been on immunosuppressive regimen and is currently experiencing renal rejection. The patient's potassium levels are elevated, and she is being treated for hyperkalemia. She also has mild pleural effusion on her chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal rejection: The patient's symptoms and imaging results indicate acute renal rejection. This condition can lead to further deterioration of kidney function and may require urgent intervention such as renal biopsy and transplantation surgery.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels can be life-threatening and require immediate treatment. If left untreated, it can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory paralysis.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications if not properly managed.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level suggests anemia, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to address this condition.
5. Pleural effusion: The presence of a mild pleural effusion on the chest X-ray may indicate an underlying lung infection or fluid accumulation. This requires monitoring and appropriate intervention if needed.
6. Potential infections: Given the patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with acute left back pain and abdominal fullness. She has been on immunosuppressive therapy, including Prograf. The patient's potassium level was elevated at 6.8, and she received treatment for hyperkalemia in the emergency department. A CT abdomen/pelvis showed perinephric fat stranding, and she was started on empirical antibiotics. The patient's potassium level continued to increase to 7.4, and she required repeated treatment with calcium, insulin, and glucose. Renal function also worsened, with a creatinine level of 9.1. The patient underwent hemodialysis and received high-dose steroids for suspected acute renal rejection. Her potassium level was corrected to 4.2, and her creatinine level improved to 9.0. The patient's other medical history includes allergies to Bactrim, Cellcept, and an exfoliative rash. She is currently receiving various medications including Tacro, Epo, Fe, colace, methylprednisolone, RISS, amlodipine, nitropaste, and Prograf. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Rejection: The patient's symptoms, along with the findings of perinephric fat stranding on CT and elevated creat"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and renal failure post-transplant. She presented with acute renal failure and likely rejection. The patient has been started on steroids and continues to take tacrolimus at a dose of 12 mg daily. Her tacrolimus level is being monitored daily.

The patient also has hypertension, hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), anemia, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR). The hypertension is currently being managed with hydralazine and amlodipine. The hyperkalemia was managed with hemodialysis (HD) and close monitoring of electrolyte levels.

The patient underwent a renal biopsy, and further results are pending. She has been prescribed ceftazidime due to concerns about infection, although the clinical picture suggests it may not be necessary. The patient's urine output is being closely monitored.

Possible Complications:
1. Acute rejection of the transplanted kidney: The patient's symptoms of acute renal failure and likely rejection indicate a high concern for this complication. Further evaluation through renal biopsy and close monitoring of the patient's condition is necessary.
2. Infection: Although the negative urine culture suggests a low likelihood, the patient has been prescribed ceftazidime to address any potential infection.
3. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances: The patient's condition requires"

","The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and renal failure who has undergone a kidney transplant. She is currently presenting with acute renal failure and likely rejection. The patient's vital signs include a blood pressure of 169/75 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, hyperkalemia, and anemia. Her blood glucose levels are also elevated. Other labs, including white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, are within normal range. 

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, trace edema, and a positive bowel sound. 

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Acute rejection: The patient is at high risk for acute rejection, and appropriate medications such as steroids, tacrolimus, and close monitoring of tacrolimus levels have been initiated. Dialysis will be provided as needed, and the patient will follow up with renal and transplant surgery recommendations.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels have normalized with hemodialysis. Close monitoring of labs and repeat EKG will be done, and dialysis will be repeated as necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and renal failure who underwent a kidney transplant. She presents with acute renal failure and suspected rejection. The patient has been started on high-dose steroids and is currently on tacrolimus (tacro) at a dose of 12 ng. Her tacrolimus level is normal. She also received hemodialysis (HD) yesterday and is expected to have another session soon.

The patient's potassium levels were elevated but normalized after HD. She is being monitored closely for any signs of hyperkalemia and may require further dialysis as needed. Her urine output is being closely monitored, and she is on ceftazidime due to concerns about infection, although the clinical picture suggests otherwise.

The patient's chest pain this morning could be related to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), which occurred after the quick correction of potassium with HD or fluid shifts. She responded to diltiazem and will receive it again if needed. If afib with RVR recurs, she may require anticoagulation or ASA therapy.

The patient's blood pressure remains high, and she is currently on hydralazine as needed. She is also taking amlodipine, and her hypertension will be closely monitored.

The patient has anemia with iron studies indicating high ferritin, high total iron-binding capacity ("
