   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma on
   sorafenib who presents with lethargy and weakness found to have a serum
   sodium of 121 now decreased to 119 with IV hydration.
   Hyponatremia:  Differential diagnosis in this patient includes
   dehydration secondary to poor PO intake, hyponatremia associated with
   cirrhosis and SIADH (although no clear precipitants, no offending
   medications, normal CXR, SIADH not typically associated with
   hepatocellular carcinoma).  Currently he appears euvolemic on exam
   which argues against cirrhosis and volume depletion.  Given his urine
   osms of 388 it is not suprising that he did not show improvement in his
   serum sodium with isotonic saline administration.  Urine sodium of 13
   argues somewhat against SIADH but this number is also dependent on
   sodium intake.  Review of literature does not reveal an association
   between sorafenib and hyponatremia.  At present, we will treat as if he
   has SIADH.  IVF have now been discontinued and he is being fluid
   restricted.  PICC placed this AM and plan to start hypertonic saline at
   20cc/hr.
   - nml T4 and cortisol
   - sodium checks Q4H
   - plan to use hypertonic saline with goal of not increasing sodium more
   than 10-12mEq/day and no more than 1/hr.

   progressing.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma on sorafenib. He presented with lethargy and weakness, and was found to have hyponatremia with a serum sodium of 121, which has now decreased to 119 despite IV hydration. The patient appears euvolemic on examination, arguing against cirrhosis and volume depletion. His urine osmolality is 388, and urine sodium is 13. There are no clear precipitants or offending medications, and the patient does not have SIADH typically associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Review of literature does not reveal an association between sorafenib and hyponatremia. The patient's T4 and cortisol levels are normal. The plan is to treat the patient as if he has SIADH, by discontinuing IV fluids and initiating fluid restriction. Hypertonic saline will be started at 20 cc/hr, with careful monitoring of sodium levels every 4 hours and a goal of not increasing sodium more than 10-12 mEq/day or 1/hr. A renal consult has been requested. The patient's hepatocellular carcinoma is progressing, as indicated by a CT scan. Further oncology recommendations and follow-up results are pending. Sorafenib will be held, and a non-contrast head CT will be done to evaluate for metastasis. The patient also has type II diabetes, and his home insulin regimen will be"

Hypertonic saline will be started if the patient becomes symptomatic or if his serum sodium worsens. Further assessments include checking TSH, cortisol, calculated serum osmolality, and renal function. A CT scan suggests progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, and the patient will be followed up by oncology. Sorafenib will be held.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hyponatremia. The patient's medical history includes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDDM), and chronic hepatitis C (HCV). The patient has been diagnosed with SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion) as the likely cause of hyponatremia, rather than hypovolemia or cirrhosis. Fluid restriction has been implemented for SIADH management. The patient's condition is euvolemic, and they are currently on fluid restriction. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate at 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and normal cardiovascular findings. There are no signs of edema, jaundice, or rashes. Neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive, follows commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented, and has normal muscle tone. 

Laboratory results indicate hyponatremia with a sodium level of 109 mg/dL, as well as elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, and liver enzymes"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
   65 year old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma on
   sorafenib who presents with lethargy and weakness found to have a serum
   sodium of 121 now decreased to 119 with IV hydration.
   Hyponatremia:  Differential diagnosis in this patient includes
   dehydration secondary to poor PO intake, hyponatremia associated with
   cirrhosis and SIADH (although no clear precipitants, no offending
   medications, normal CXR, SIADH not typically associated with
   hepatocellular carcinoma).  Currently he appears euvolemic on exam
   which argues against cirrhosis and volume depletion.  Given his urine
   osms of 388 it is not suprising that he did not show improvement in his

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma on sorafenib who presents with lethargy and weakness. He has a serum sodium of 121, which has decreased to 119 despite IV hydration. The differential diagnosis for hyponatremia includes dehydration secondary to poor PO intake, hyponatremia associated with cirrhosis, and SIADH. However, the patient appears euvolemic on exam, arguing against cirrhosis and volume depletion. Given his urine osmolality and urine sodium levels, it is likely that he has SIADH. Treatment includes fluid restriction and hypertonic saline administration. The patient also has hepatocellular carcinoma, which is progressing. He is holding on sorafenib and will undergo further evaluation for metastasis. Additionally, the patient has type II diabetes and requires continued home insulin regimen. He is receiving prophylactic subcutaneous heparin and has peripheral IV access. His code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU for further care and monitoring."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
   65 year old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma on
   sorafenib who presents with lethargy and weakness found to have a serum
   sodium of 121 now decreased to 119 with IV hydration.
   Hyponatremia:  On hypertonic saline, sodium improved to 126 this AM.
   Differential diagnosis of hyponatremia in this patient includes
   dehydration secondary to poor PO intake, hyponatremia associated with
   cirrhosis and SIADH (although no clear precipitants, no offending
   medications, normal CXR, SIADH not typically associated with
   hepatocellular carcinoma).  Currently he appears euvolemic on exam
   which argues against cirrhosis and volume depletion.  Given his urine
   osms of 388 it is not suprising that he did not show improvement in his
   serum sodium with isotonic saline administration.  Urine sodium of 13
   argues somewhat against SIADH but this number is also dependent on
   sodium intake.  Review of literature does not reveal an association
   between sorafenib and hyponatremia.  At present, we will treat as if he
   has SIADH.  IVF have now been discontinued and he is being fluid
   restricted.  PICC placed this AM and plan to start hypertonic saline at
   20cc/hr.  Head CT showed no evidence of metastasis that may trigger
   SIADH.
   - continue hypertonic saline with goal of not increasing sodium more
   than 10-12mEq/day and no more than 1/hr.
   - check sodium q6hrs, stop hypertonic saline drip once Na is >=128
   - fluid restriction to 1200cc/day
   - f/u renal recs
   Hepatocellular carinoma: CT scan from today suggests disease is
   progressing.  Radiology reviewed Abd CT in regards to whether or not
   there has been increased tumor necrosis, as patient had episode of
   hyponatremia previously in setting of chemoembolization of liver
   tumor.  Radiology did not appreciate any new foci of necrosis.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma on sorafenib presenting with lethargy and weakness. He has been diagnosed with hyponatremia, which is characterized by a low serum sodium level. The patient's serum sodium initially measured 121 and decreased to 119 despite IV hydration. With the administration of hypertonic saline, the patient's sodium level improved to 126 this morning.

The differential diagnosis for hyponatremia in this patient includes dehydration secondary to poor oral intake, hyponatremia associated with cirrhosis, and Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH). However, the patient appears euvolemic on examination, which argues against cirrhosis and volume depletion. Additionally, the patient's urine osmolality is 388, indicating that he did not show improvement in his serum sodium with isotonic saline administration. The urine sodium of 13 argues somewhat against SIADH, but this number is also dependent on sodium intake.

Given the lack of clear precipitants, normal chest X-ray, and absence of evidence for metastasis on head CT, the patient's SIADH is likely not due to an underlying malignancy. Review of literature does not reveal an association between sorafenib and hyponatremia. Therefore, at present, the patient will be treated as if he has SIADH.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who presented with hyponatremia. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently euvolemic. The patient has a complex medical history including HCC, hepatitis C virus (HCV), non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and hyperkalemia which has been resolved.

The patient's current issues include hyponatremia, hyperkalemia (resolved), hepatocellular carcinoma, HCV, and NIDDM. The etiology of the hyponatremia is likely multifactorial and may be related to SIADH, hypovolemia, medication side effects, paraneoplastic syndrome, or tumor necrosis from HCC.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, blood pressure ranging from 112/52 mmHg to 137/77 mmHg, heart rate between 80-95 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress and normal heart sounds. He has a diminished left radial pulse and diminished left dorsalis pedis pulse. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present.

Laboratory results show hyponatremia, hyperkalemia (resolved), elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated total bilir"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who presents with hyponatremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/52 to 137/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is not on respiratory support.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. His cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds, and peripheral pulses are present and equal bilaterally. Respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds without wheezing or crackles. Abdominal examination reveals soft and non-tender bowel sounds, and there is no evidence of lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination is limited due to the patient's inability to stand or move, but he is attentive and responds to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show a sodium level of 109 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.7 mEq/L, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and glucose level of 133 mg/dL. Other lab values, including white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and coagulation profile, are within normal ranges. Imaging studies, such as chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound, were not performed"

   CT Head (Final): No acute intracranial abnormality. No evidence for

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma on
   sorafenib who presents with lethargy and weakness found to have a serum
   sodium of 121 now decreased to 119 with IV hydration.
   Hyponatremia:  Sodium up to 131 this AM and hypertonic saline turned
   off last night.  Differential diagnosis of hyponatremia in this patient
   includes dehydration secondary to poor PO intake, hyponatremia
   associated with cirrhosis and SIADH (although no clear precipitants, no
   offending medications, normal CXR, SIADH not typically associated with
   hepatocellular carcinoma).  Currently he appears euvolemic on exam
   which argues against cirrhosis and volume depletion.  Given his urine
   osms of 388 it is not suprising that he did not show improvement in his
   serum sodium with isotonic saline administration.  Urine sodium of 13
   argues somewhat against SIADH but this number is also dependent on
   sodium intake.  Review of literature does not reveal an association
   between sorafenib and hyponatremia.  At present, we will treat as if he
   has SIADH.  IVF have now been discontinued and he is being fluid
   restricted.  PICC placed this AM and plan to start hypertonic saline at
   20cc/hr.  Head CT showed no evidence of metastasis that may trigger
   SIADH.
   - stopped hypertonic saline drip once Na was >=128
   - fluid restriction to 1000cc/day
   - f/u renal recs
   Hepatocellular carinoma: CT scan on admission suggests disease is
   progressing.  Radiology reviewed Abd CT in regards to whether or not
   there has been increased tumor necrosis, as patient had episode of
   hyponatremia previously in setting of chemoembolization of liver
   tumor.  Radiology did not appreciate any new foci of necrosis.
   - f/u onc recs
   - holding sorafenib

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma on
   sorafenib who presents with lethargy and weakness found to have a serum
   sodium of 121 now decreased to 119 with IV hydration.
   Hyponatremia:  Sodium up to 131 this AM and hypertonic saline turned
   off last night.  Differential diagnosis of hyponatremia in this patient
   includes dehydration secondary to poor PO intake, hyponatremia
   associated with cirrhosis and SIADH (although no clear precipitants, no
   offending medications, normal CXR, SIADH not typically associated with
   hepatocellular carcinoma).  Currently he appears euvolemic on exam
   which argues against cirrhosis and volume depletion.  Given his urine
   osms of 388 it is not suprising that he did not show improvement in his
   serum sodium with isotonic saline administration.  Urine sodium of 13
   argues somewhat against SIADH but this number is also dependent on
   sodium intake.  Review of literature does not reveal an association
   between sorafenib and hyponatremia.  At present, we will treat as if he
   has SIADH.  IVF have now been discontinued and he is being fluid
   restricted.  PICC placed this AM and plan to start hypertonic saline at
   20cc/hr.  Head CT showed no evidence of metastasis that may trigger
   SIADH.
   - stopped hypertonic saline drip once Na was >=128
   - fluid restriction to 1000cc/day
   - f/u renal recs
   Hepatocellular carinoma: CT scan on admission suggests disease is
   progressing.  Radiology reviewed Abd CT in regards to whether or not
   there has been increased tumor necrosis, as patient had episode of
   hyponatremia previously in setting of chemoembolization of liver
   tumor.  Radiology did not appreciate any new foci of necrosis.
   - f/u onc recs
   - holding sorafenib

   - continue home insulin regimen

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma on sorafenib. He presented with lethargy and weakness and was found to have hyponatremia, with a serum sodium level initially at 121 and now decreased to 119 despite IV hydration.

The assessment indicates that the patient has hyponatremia, and the differential diagnosis includes dehydration secondary to poor oral intake, hyponatremia associated with cirrhosis and SIADH (although no clear precipitants, no offending medications, normal chest X-ray, SIADH not typically associated with hepatocellular carcinoma). However, the patient appears euvolemic on examination, which argues against cirrhosis and volume depletion.

Given the patient's urine osmolality of 388 and urine sodium of 13, it is not surprising that he did not show improvement in his serum sodium with isotonic saline administration. The head CT showed no evidence of metastasis that may trigger SIADH.

The plan includes stopping hypertonic saline drip once Na is ≥128, fluid restriction to 1000cc/day, and following renal recommendations. The patient's hepatocellular carcinoma is progressing, and further oncological recommendations are needed. Sorafenib is being held.

The patient also has type II diabetes, for which he will continue his home insulin regimen. Prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin is being administered, and the patient"
