   Imaging: SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is a left ventricular
   configuration of the heart, with aortic enlargement and calcification.
   Although the cardiomediastinal contour is similar to prior studies
   allowing for differences in positioning and AP technique, there is
   increased prominence of vascular markings throughout the lung fields
   and upper zone vascular redistribution
   indicative of pulmonary edema. There is also a combination of effusion
   and consolidation at both lung bases in comparison to baseline
   radiographs. Evaluation of the left lung apex is limited given
   patient's head positioning. Osseous structures demonstrate moderate
   degenerative changes of the spine and shoulders.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Congestive heart failure.
   2. Bibasilar effusions/atelectasis and consolidations.
   Post-diuresis repeat PA and lateral when clinically feasible is
   recommended.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease prsents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: unclear trigger for new hypoxic
   respiratory failure. She does not wear oxygen at home, but per report
   has nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. This seems likely to be
   orthopnea related to worsening CHF, although she does not have a hx of
   CAD or CHF. Could be pulm edema related to uncontrolled hypertension
   and had a flash episode last night. CXR also concerning for RLL
   pneumonia, and she does have hx of recent CVA and could be aspirating.
   Other etiology on the differential could be PE as she was hospitalized
   recently, but no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP as below
   - consider echo, CT scan for further eval
   # PNA: has RLL infiltrate on CXR.  No leukocytosis, although higher
   than her baseline.  No history of fevers or chills.  Has recently been
   in rehab.  Has no signs of sepsis related to PNA. Legionella urinary
   antigen negative.
   - treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now
   - consider flagyl if patient decompensates for anaerobic coverage and
   treatment of potential chronic aspiration
   # CHF/Effusion: has what looks like R sided pleural effusion and
   evidence of fluid overload on CXR. Has decreased breath sounds on the
   R, but few crackles. Could either be related to heart failure, which
   seems feasible given her hx of orthopnea. Or could be a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   - echo in AM
   - consider CT scan of chest for better clarification of the pneumonia
   and the effusion
   - consider thoracentesis
   - would hold on diuresis given ARF and is likely dry
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control.
   - consider restarting home meds
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr of 3.2 from 3.3 yesterday from a
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year.  This may be her new baseline
   or may represent some mild pre-renal changes in the setting of an
   infection.
   - urine lytes
   - would hold on diuresis now, but would also be gentle with IVFs given
   her potential CHF and new effusion
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - will add on Ca/Mg/Phos, based on results consider phos binders
   - contact outpatient nephrologist, consider renal consult
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 4.8 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.  Has high baseline K and EKG has mild peaking of TWs but not
   changed from previous EKGs.  Received kayexcelate in the ED.
   - kayexcelate as needed
   - low K+ diet when taking POs
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - speech and swallow when respiratory status improves

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. She presented with worsening shortness of breath starting the previous night and continuing until the morning. The chest X-ray revealed evidence of pneumonia and effusion. She also has worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, possibly due to worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) or pulmonary edema related to uncontrolled hypertension.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe infiltrate on the chest X-ray, indicating pneumonia. There is no leukocytosis, fevers, or chills, suggesting a mild infection.
3. CHF/Effusion: The patient has evidence of fluid overload on the chest X-ray and decreased breath sounds on the right side, which could be related to heart failure or a parapneumonic effusion.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 3.3 to 3.5, indicating acute worsening of her chronic renal failure. This may be due to infection or pre-renal changes.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a potassium level of 4.8, which is higher than normal and can be dangerous. This is likely due to acute"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) starting last night and continuing until morning. The chest X-ray shows evidence of pneumonia and effusion. She also has worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which can be caused by worsening congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary edema, or aspiration pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe infiltrate on the chest X-ray, indicating possible pneumonia. This could be healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
3. CHF/Effusion: The patient has signs of fluid overload on the chest X-ray, indicating possible congestive heart failure. This can lead to pulmonary edema and pleural effusion.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from a baseline in the mid-2s earlier this year. This may be due to pre-renal changes in the setting of an infection.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated at 4.8, which can be dangerous and require immediate attention.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease prsents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: unclear trigger for new hypoxic
   respiratory failure. She does not wear oxygen at home, but per report
   has nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. This seems likely to be
   orthopnea related to worsening CHF, although she does not have a hx of
   CAD or CHF. Could be pulm edema related to uncontrolled hypertension
   and had a flash episode last night. CXR also concerning for RLL
   pneumonia, and she does have hx of recent CVA and could be aspirating.
   Other etiology on the differential could be PE as she was hospitalized
   recently, but no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP as below (vanc/cefepime)
   - TTE today
   # PNA: has RLL infiltrate on CXR.  No leukocytosis, although higher
   than her baseline.  No history of fevers or chills.  Has recently been
   in rehab.  Has no signs of sepsis related to PNA. Legionella urinary
   antigen negative.
   - treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now
   - Vanc level 10.3 this AM, change to [**Hospital1 7**] and check level tomorrow
   - consider flagyl if patient decompensates for anaerobic coverage and
   treatment of potential chronic aspiration
   # CHF/Effusion: has what looks like R sided pleural effusion and
   evidence of fluid overload on CXR. Has decreased breath sounds on the
   R, but few crackles. Could either be related to heart failure, which
   seems feasible given her hx of orthopnea. Or could be a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   - TTE in AM
   - would hold on diuresis given ARF and is likely dry
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Check HR in PM; if tolerates may consider Lopressor given
   hypertension requiring nitro drip yesterday. HR in 50s now.
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr of 3.2 from 3.3 yesterday from a
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year.  This may be her new baseline
   or may represent some mild pre-renal changes in the setting of an
   infection.
   - Fluid challenge today (500cc), then restart diet
   - would hold on diuresis now, but would also be gentle with IVFs given
   her potential CHF and new effusion
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes, re-check Creatinine in PM
   - will add on Ca/Mg/Phos, Phos okay now.
   - contact outpatient nephrologist, consider renal consult
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 4.8 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - F/u PM lytes to ensure stable potassium
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
   -          Start on clears, ADAT
   -          500cc fluid challenge today as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening shortness of breath starting last night and continuing until morning. The chest X-ray shows evidence of pneumonia and effusion. She also has worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which could be due to worsening congestive heart failure (CHF), uncontrolled hypertension, or right lower lobe pneumonia. 
2. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe infiltrate on the CXR, suggesting pneumonia. Treatment for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and cefepime is being initiated.
3. CHF/Effusion: The patient has signs of fluid overload and evidence of right-sided pleural effusion on the CXR. This could be related to heart failure or a parapneumonic effusion.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from a baseline in the mid-2s earlier this year. This may indicate acute kidney injury on top of chronic kidney disease.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient has an elevated potassium level of 4.8, which is concerning in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. The patient presents with worsening shortness of breath starting last night and continuing until morning. The chest X-ray shows evidence of pneumonia and effusion. The patient also has worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's symptoms of orthopnea and evidence of fluid overload on the chest X-ray suggest the possibility of CHF. Further evaluation, such as an echocardiogram, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

2. Bilateral effusions/atelectasis and consolidations: The chest X-ray findings indicate the presence of effusions and consolidations, which could be due to pulmonary edema or parapneumonic effusion. A repeat chest X-ray and possibly a CT scan of the chest may provide more clarity on the nature of these findings.

3. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels and decreased breath sounds on the right side raise concerns about hypoxic respiratory distress. Monitoring the patient's oxygen levels and ensuring adequate ventilation support is crucial.

4. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The presence of right lower lobe infiltrate on the chest X-ray raises suspicion for HAP. Appropriate antibiotic"

   Imaging: SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is a left ventricular
   configuration of the heart, with aortic enlargement and calcification.
   Although the cardiomediastinal contour is similar to prior studies
   allowing for differences in positioning and AP technique, there is
   increased prominence of vascular markings throughout the lung fields
   and upper zone vascular redistribution
   indicative of of pulmonary edema. There is also a combination of
   effusion and consolidation at both lung bases in comparison to baseline
   radiographs. Evaluation of the left lung apex is limited given
   patient's head positioning. Osseous structures demonstrate moderate
   degenerative changes of the spine and shoulders.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Congestive heart failure.
   2. Bibasilar effusions/atelectasis and consolidations.
   Post-diuresis repeat PA and lateral when clinically feasible is
   recommended.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease prsents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning.  CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: unclear trigger for new hypoxic
   respiratory failure. She does not wear oxygen at home, but per report
   has nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. This seems likely to be
   orthopnea related to worsening CHF, although she does not have a hx of
   CAD or CHF. Could be pulm edema related to uncontrolled hypertension
   and had a flash episode last night. CXR also concerning for RLL
   pneumonia, and she does have hx of recent CVA and could be aspirating.
   Other etiology on the differential could be PE as she was hospitalized
   recently, but no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP as below
   - consider echo, CT scan for further eval
   # PNA: has RLL infiltrate on CXR.  No leukocytosis, although higher
   than her baseline.  No history of fevers or chills.  Has recently been
   in rehab.  Has no signs of sepsis related to PNA. Legionella urinary
   antigen negative.
   - treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now
   - consider flagyl if patient decompensates for anaerobic coverage and
   treatment of potential chronic aspiration
   # CHF/Effusion: has what looks like R sided pleural effusion and
   evidence of fluid overload on CXR.  Has decreased breath sounds on the
   R, but few crackles.  Could either be related to heart failure, which
   seems feasible given her hx of orthopnea.  Or could be a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   - echo in AM
   - consider CT scan of chest for better clarification of the pneumonia
   and the effusion
   - consider thoracentesis
   - would hold on diuresis given ARF and is likely dry

   edema leading to worsening SOB.  Unclear baseline BP, although last
   progress note says her BP was 130/70.  Was started on nitro gtt in the

   atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control.
   - titrate off nitro gtt as tolerated
   - restart home meds once BP controlled
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: has Cr of 3.3 today up from a
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year.  This may be her new baseline
   or may represent some mild pre-renal changes in the setting of an

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a complicated medical history, admitted to the ICU with right lower lobe pneumonia and hypoxemia. She is being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia with cefepime and vancomycin. The patient's oxygenation has improved while lying on her left side, and her oxygen supplementation is being weaned as tolerated. Her creatinine level is still elevated but has decreased slightly. The patient also has anemia, hyperkalemia, hypertension, and metabolic acidosis. She is critically ill and currently receiving ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's treatment for healthcare-associated pneumonia with cefepime and vancomycin should be continued, and any effusion observed on ultrasound should be monitored closely.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygenation should continue to be closely monitored, and oxygen supplementation should be adjusted accordingly. Further investigations to identify the underlying cause of hypoxemia may be necessary.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels should be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to manage and improve renal function.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's acid-base balance should be continuously monitored, and any necessary interventions should be implemented to address the metabolic acidosis.
5. Anemia: Further evaluation of the anemia should be conducted, including assessment of iron levels, folate levels, and other relevant factors to determine the cause"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease prsents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: unclear trigger for new hypoxic
   respiratory failure. She does not wear oxygen at home, but per report
   has nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. This seems likely to be
   orthopnea related to worsening CHF, although she does not have a hx of
   CAD or CHF. Could be pulm edema related to uncontrolled hypertension
   and had a flash episode last night. CXR also concerning for RLL
   pneumonia, and she does have hx of recent CVA and could be aspirating.
   Other etiology on the differential could be PE as she was hospitalized
   recently, but no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP as below (vanc/cefepime)
   - TTE today
   # PNA: has RLL infiltrate on CXR.  No leukocytosis, although higher
   than her baseline.  No history of fevers or chills.  Has recently been
   in rehab.  Has no signs of sepsis related to PNA. Legionella urinary
   antigen negative.
   - treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now
   - Vanc level 10.3 this AM, change to [**Hospital1 7**] and check level tomorrow
   - consider flagyl if patient decompensates for anaerobic coverage and
   treatment of potential chronic aspiration
   # CHF/Effusion: has what looks like R sided pleural effusion and
   evidence of fluid overload on CXR. Has decreased breath sounds on the
   R, but few crackles. Could either be related to heart failure, which
   seems feasible given her hx of orthopnea. Or could be a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   - TTE in AM
   - would hold on diuresis given ARF and is likely dry
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Check HR in PM; if tolerates may consider Lopressor given
   hypertension requiring nitro drip yesterday. HR in 50s now.
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr of 3.2 from 3.3 yesterday from a
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year.  This may be her new baseline
   or may represent some mild pre-renal changes in the setting of an
   infection.
   - Fluid challenge today (500cc), then restart diet
   - would hold on diuresis now, but would also be gentle with IVFs given
   her potential CHF and new effusion
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes, re-check Creatinine in PM
   - will add on Ca/Mg/Phos, Phos okay now.
   - contact outpatient nephrologist, consider renal consult
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 4.8 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - F/u PM lytes to ensure stable potassium
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
   -          Start on clears, ADAT
   -          500cc fluid challenge today as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 92-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) starting last night and continuing until the morning. The patient has evidence of pneumonia and pleural effusion on the chest X-ray. She also has worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which can be caused by several factors such as pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary embolism (PE), or aspiration. The patient's nighttime SOB and orthopnea could be related to worsening CHF, although she does not have a history of CHF. It is also possible that the respiratory distress is due to uncontrolled hypertension leading to pulmonary edema.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe infiltrate on the chest X-ray, suggesting pneumonia. The lack of leukocytosis, fever, or chills indicates that this may be a hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Treatment with vancomycin and cefepime is recommended.

3. CHF/Effusion: The patient has evidence of fluid overload on the chest X-ray, along with decreased breath sounds on the right side and crackles. This could be due to heart failure or a par"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease prsents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: unclear trigger for new hypoxic
   respiratory failure. She does not wear oxygen at home, but per report
   has nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. This seems likely to be
   orthopnea related to worsening CHF, although she does not have a hx of
   CAD or CHF. Could be pulm edema related to uncontrolled hypertension
   and had a flash episode last night. CXR also concerning for RLL
   pneumonia, and she does have hx of recent CVA and could be aspirating.
   Other etiology on the differential could be PE as she was hospitalized
   recently, but no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP as below (vanc/cefepime)
   - PICC placement today for antibiotic course
   - TTE today
   .
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Restarted Metoprolol yesterday
   - Given hydral X 1 yesterday for episode of hypertension
   - Will maintain on current regimen today
   .
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr of 3.2 from 3.3 yesterday from a
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year.  This may be her new baseline
   or may represent some mild pre-renal changes in the setting of an
   infection.
   - Urine lytes, eval FeNA
   - Will bolus 500 cc over 2 hours
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes, re-check Creatinine in PM
   .
    # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 4.8 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic
   renal failure.
   - F/u PM lytes to ensure stable potassium
   .
   # PNA: has RLL infiltrate on CXR.  No leukocytosis, although higher
   than her baseline.  No history of fevers or chills.  Has recently been
   in rehab.  Has no signs of sepsis related to PNA. Legionella urinary
   antigen negative.
   - treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now
   - Vanc level pending, if sub-therapeutic will re-dose Vanc today
   .
   # CHF/Effusion: has what looks like R sided pleural effusion and
   evidence of fluid overload on CXR. Has decreased breath sounds on the
   R, but few crackles. Could either be related to heart failure, which
   seems feasible given her hx of orthopnea. Or could be a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   - TTE in AM
   .
    # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
   -          Start on clears, ADAT
   -          500cc fluid challenge today as above

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 92-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening shortness of breath starting last night and continuing until morning, as well as evidence of pneumonia and effusion on chest X-ray. The patient also has worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which may be caused by orthopnea related to worsening congestive heart failure (CHF), uncontrolled hypertension, or pulmonary edema. The cause is unclear, but further evaluation is needed.

2. Healthcare-associated Pneumonia (HAP): The patient has right lower lobe pneumonia on CXR, and there are no signs of sepsis related to HAP. She is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for HAP.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 3.3 to 3.5, indicating worsening renal function. This may be due to pre-renal changes in the setting of an infection. Further evaluation and management are required.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated at 4.8, likely due to acute on chronic renal failure. Close monitoring and management"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with COPD and a complicated medical history, admitted to the ICU with right lower lobe pneumonia and hypoxemia. She has been experiencing significant desaturation when lying on her right side. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 162/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving antibiotics for pneumonia, pain control, and prophylactic medications. She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure and metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition remains critical, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, which is a serious infection that can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and even death if not appropriately managed.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate inadequate oxygen supply to her tissues, which can result in organ damage and respiratory failure if not promptly addressed.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function, which may progress to complete renal failure if not treated promptly. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the accumulation of waste products in the body.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's mild metabolic acidosis"

   ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets
   are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
   area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-13**]+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
   impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
   severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure. Pt without O2 requirement at home but some history of
   nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening
   CHF. CXR concerning for RLL pneumonia and has hx of recent CVA and
   could be aspirating. No leukocytosis at first but now climbing. No
   fever or chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural
   effusion concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of
   fluid overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided
   effusion, but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury.
   Has decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Adding ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  Likely related to COPD
   history.
   - Continue on current regimen
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Restarted Metoprolol yesterday
   - Will maintain on current regimen today
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr appearing stable at 3.3 vs
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year. Possibly new baseline vs
   acute pre-renal etiology
 FEUrea borderline pre-renal.  Developing PNA
   could be causing her to be volume down.
   -          continue to to trend, f/u urine lytes
   -          support with IVF for goal of 1L positive today
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.0 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - F/u PM lytes to ensure stable potassium
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT once able
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
   -          Start on clears, ADAT
   -          500cc fluid challenge today as above
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals, needs PICC today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. The patient presented with worsening shortness of breath starting last night and continuing until morning. A chest X-ray showed evidence of pneumonia and effusion. The patient also has worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxic respiratory failure. She does not require oxygen at home but has a history of nighttime shortness of breath, which seems to be chronic. The cause could be pneumonia versus orthopnea, worsening congestive heart failure (CHF). The chest X-ray is concerning for right lower lobe pneumonia and has a history of recent CVA, which could lead to aspiration. There is no leukocytosis initially but is now climbing. No fever or chills are present. There is no history of coronary artery disease (CAD) or CHF, but there is likely right-sided pleural effusion concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid overload on the chest X-ray. A bedside ultrasound shows a right-sided effusion but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. There are decreased breath sounds on the right side, but a few crackles are present.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease prsents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure. Pt without O2 requirement at home but some history of
   nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening
   CHF. CXR concerning for RLL pneumonia and has hx of recent CVA and
   could be aspirating. No leukocytosis at first but now climbing. No
   fever or chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural
   effusion concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of
   fluid overload on CXR. Has decreased breath sounds on the R, but few
   crackles. New echo with severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology
   on the differential could be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but
   no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Restarted Metoprolol yesterday
   - Will maintain on current regimen today
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr appearing stable at 3.3 vs
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year. Possibly new baseline vs
   acute pre-renal etiology
 FEUrea borderline pre-renal.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes, re-check Creatinine in PM
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.0 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - F/u PM lytes to ensure stable potassium
    # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. She presented with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) starting last night and continuing until morning. The chest X-ray showed evidence of pneumonia and effusion. Additionally, the patient is experiencing worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient has new worsening hypoxic respiratory failure, indicating difficulty in breathing and insufficient oxygen supply to the tissues.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of pneumonia on the chest X-ray suggests an infection in the lungs, which may require treatment with antibiotics.
3. Right Lower Lobe (RLL) Pneumonia: Considering the patient's history of recent CVA and potential aspiration risk, there is a concern for RLL pneumonia.
4. Parapneumonic Effusion: The right-sided pleural effusion observed on the chest X-ray is concerning for a parapneumonic effusion, often associated with pneumonia.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient has evidence of fluid overload on the chest X-ray, indicating that the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
6. Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR): The recent echocardiogram revealed severe TR, which can lead to right-sided heart failure.
7. Pulmonary Artery Hypertension (PAH): The patient also has severe PAH, which can result in further strain on the heart and potentially worsen the respiratory distress.
8. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, indicating worsening kidney function.
9. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, which can be dangerous and requires careful monitoring and management.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, administer appropriate antibiotics for the suspected pneumonia, manage fluid balance, and optimize cardiac function. Regular assessments of renal function and electrolyte levels are also necessary."

She was admitted to the ICU with right lower lobe pneumonia and hypoxemia, which has been slow to improve. The patient's condition has worsened, as indicated by the worsening right lower lobe infiltrate on the chest X-ray.

The patient's vital signs show hypertension, with blood pressure readings ranging from 157/48 to 95/25 mmHg. Her heart rate is stable between 68-85 beats per minute, respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is at 95%. The patient's temperature is slightly low, with readings of 35.9°C and 36.7°C.

The patient's pain is managed, and she reports ongoing hand/arm pain. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,560 mL and output of 521 mL, indicating some fluid retention. Her urine output has been intermittently poor. The patient's weight is currently 64.6 kg, which is slightly lower than her admission weight of 65 kg.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Creatinine (Cr) levels have been consistently around 3.3 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure. Other lab values, such as blood glucose, electrolytes, and cardiac markers, are within normal ranges.

   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure. Pt without O2 requirement at home but some history of
   nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening
   CHF. CXR concerning for RLL pneumonia and has hx of recent CVA and
   could be aspirating. No leukocytosis at first but now climbing. No
   fever or chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural
   effusion concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of
   fluid overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided
   effusion, but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury.
   Has decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Adding ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  Likely related to COPD
   history.
   - Continue on current regimen
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Restarted Metoprolol yesterday
   - Will maintain on current regimen today
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr appearing stable at 3.3 vs
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year. Possibly new baseline vs
   acute pre-renal etiology
 FEUrea borderline pre-renal.  Developing PNA
   could be causing her to be volume down.

The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, with coarse upper airway sounds and scattered crackles on lung auscultation. There is evidence of pneumonia and effusion on the chest X-ray. The patient's renal function is worsening, with signs of fluid overload. She has hyperkalemia and an elevated creatinine level. The patient also has a history of recent CVA and could be at risk for aspiration. Bedside ultrasound shows a right-sided pleural effusion, but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. The patient has decreased breath sounds on the right side. A new echocardiogram reveals severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary artery hypertension. The patient's blood pressure is difficult to interpret due to inconsistent readings. She has chronic kidney disease with an acute on chronic renal failure presentation. The patient's potassium level is elevated. The patient has a history of questionable CVA in the past. The plan includes continuing weaning of oxygen as tolerated, treating for hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and cefepime, adding ciprofloxacin for double gram-negative coverage, restarting amlodipine for hypertension management, and maintaining current"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note. The patient experienced a brief desaturation episode after the placement of a PICC line, which resolved quickly with repositioning. The patient is currently on sevelemer and sodium bicarb.

The patient has allergies to iodine, Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium), and has a rash as a result. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin and cefepime.

The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and other ICU medications. The patient's medical and family history remain unchanged from admission.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/45 to 174/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a nasal cannula. The patient has a first-degree AV block.

The patient's weight is 64.6 kg, and fluid balance shows an input of 1,685 mL (416 mL PO, 120 mL TF, 1,325 mL IVF) and an output of 376 mL urine and 315 mL blood products. The NG, stool, and drain outputs are not assessed.

   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.  Pt. had acute hypoxia in the morning of [**3-4**].
   - F/U stat CXR and ABG
   - Lasix one time dose
   - check EKG

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) starting last night and continuing until morning. The patient has evidence of pneumonia and effusion on chest X-ray, worsening renal failure, and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxic respiratory failure, with recent history of nighttime SOB. Pneumonia and pleural effusion are concerns, along with fluid overload on CXR.

2. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure with a creatinine level of 3.1 from 3.3 yesterday. Fluid management and negative fluid balance are crucial for CKD management.

3. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient has hyperphosphatemia, likely due to acute renal failure. Sevelamer therapy and a low-phosphorus diet are recommended for chronic management.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, which is improving from 6.1 on admission. It is important to monitor potassium levels and manage accordingly.

5. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has evidence of pulmonary hypertension on echo. This condition requires ongoing monitoring and consideration for referral to a pulmonologist.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening shortness of breath starting last night and continuing until morning. Her chest X-ray shows evidence of pneumonia and effusion. She also has worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient has hypoxic respiratory distress, likely right lower lobe pneumonia, and a right-sided pleural effusion. Bedside ultrasound confirms the presence of a right-sided effusion. The patient has decreased breath sounds on the right side, but few crackles. A new echocardiogram shows severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary artery hypertension. Other potential etiologies on the differential could include pulmonary embolism, but there is no leg swelling and she has been ambulating at home.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxic respiratory failure with recent history of nighttime shortness of breath. The chest X-ray findings suggest right lower lobe pneumonia, and the presence of a right-sided pleural effusion is concerning for a parapneumonic effusion.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's serum creatinine level is slightly improved at 3.1 from 3.3 yesterday with more fluids. This indicates worsening renal function on top of her chronic kidney disease.
3. Hyperphosphatemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr slightly improved at 3.1 from 3.3
   yesterday with more fluids, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this
   year. Possibly new baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.
   - goal even to net positive 500cc today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - start sevelamer
   - low phosphorous diet
   - pt to f/u with outpatient renal
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1on admission in setting of acute on
   chronic renal failure.
   - check PM lytes

   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr slightly improved at 3.1 from 3.3
   yesterday with more fluids, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this
   year. Possibly new baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.
   - goal even to net positive 500cc today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - start sevelamer
   - pt to f/u with outpatient renal
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - check PM lytes
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  No history of COPD or
   other documented lung disease.
   - Continue on current regimen
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT once able
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
   -          Start on clears, ADAT

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) starting last night and continuing until morning. A chest X-ray shows evidence of pneumonia and effusion. The patient also has worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient has new worsening hypoxic respiratory failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia versus orthopnea (worsening congestive heart failure), but the CXR is concerning for right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia. There is no leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or chills. There is evidence of fluid overload on CXR. Bedside ultrasound shows a right-sided effusion, but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. The patient has decreased breath sounds on the right, but few crackles. A new echo reveals severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and pulmonary artery hypertension (pulm artery HTN). Other etiology on the differential could be pulmonary embolism (PE) as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.
- Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
- Treat for Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a complicated medical history, including COPD. She was admitted to the ICU with right lower lobe pneumonia and hypoxemia. Her condition has been slow to improve, but her chest X-ray appears better in the morning. However, she experienced an episode of desaturation later in the morning. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate between 59-76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/33 to 174/58 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and high-flow nebulization. She is also on multiple medications, including antibiotics for pneumonia, pain control, and prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and normal glucose levels. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, hypoxemia, and acute renal failure. The plan of care includes continuing antibiotics, weaning off oxygen as tolerated, and monitoring renal function. The patient's overall condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen or lead to further complications if the current treatment plan is not effective. Close monitoring of vital signs and repeat chest X-rays will be necessary to assess the progress"

   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.  Pt. had acute hypoxia in the morning of [**3-4**]
   treated with lasix with some improvement but deteriorating renal
   function.
   - Will consider non-contrast CT later in the day if able to tolerate,
   but suspect that she will not be able to
   - no more lasix for now
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day

   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   .
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr 3.4 this AM after mild diuresis
   this AM, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year. Possibly new
   baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.  FENa yesterday was 1.2%
   (equivocal)
   - No diuresis today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   - Will consult renal this AM for etiology of acute on chronic kidney
   injury
   .
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   .
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - start sevelamer

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 91-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) starting last night and continuing until morning. Chest X-ray shows evidence of pneumonia and effusion. The patient also has worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing new worsening hypoxic respiratory failure with recent history of nighttime SOB. Possible causes include pneumonia versus orthopnea (worsening congestive heart failure) or right lower lobe pneumonia. Bedside ultrasound shows a right-sided effusion, which may be parapneumonic. Fluid overload is evident on CXR, and the patient has decreased breath sounds on the right with few crackles. A new echo reveals severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and pulmonary artery hypertension (pulm artery HTN). Other differential diagnoses could include pulmonary embolism (PE), but there is no leg swelling, and the patient has been ambulating at home. Acute hypoxia in the morning of [3-4] was treated with Lasix, resulting in some improvement but deteriorating renal function.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level this morning is 3.4, indicating mild diuresis this morning. Recent"

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the provided progress note. However, there are several significant events documented.

At 08:27 PM, the patient experienced an acute desaturation to the 80s during rounds with increased SOB (shortness of breath). A stat chest X-ray was performed, which showed worsening. The patient was then placed on 80% face mask oxygen with improvement in oxygenation. Her breathing became less labored, and she was weaned back to 5L NC (5 liters nasal cannula).

The patient's BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) was elevated, but due to worsening renal failure, she was not further diuresed. The patient also had a repeat EKG showing a potassium level of 5.5 without evidence of peaked T waves.

The patient has allergies to iodine, which caused a rash, and to Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium), resulting in arthralgia/arthritis. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin on 03/03/2022 at 12:24 PM, Ciprofloxacin on 03/04/2022 at 11:00 AM, and Cefepime on 03/04/2022 at 10:27 PM.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.  Pt. had acute hypoxia in the morning of [**3-4**].
   - non-contrast CT scan
   - Lasix one time dose
   - check EKG
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr slightly improved at 3.1 from 3.3
   yesterday with more fluids, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this
   year. Possibly new baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.  FENa
   yesterday was 1.2% (equivocal)
   - goal negative 500cc today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - start sevelamer
   - low phosphorous diet
   - pt to f/u with outpatient renal
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1on admission in setting of acute on
   chronic renal failure.
   - check PM lytes
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  No history of COPD or
   other documented lung disease.
   -          Continue on current regimen

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) starting last night and continuing until morning. A chest X-ray (CXR) shows evidence of pneumonia and effusion. The patient also has worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxic respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed. This may require mechanical ventilation support.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of pneumonia increases the risk of complications such as sepsis, respiratory failure, and multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms suggest fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema. This can compromise oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Parapneumonic Effusion: The right-sided pleural effusion may progress to a parapneumonic effusion, which can compromise lung function and increase the risk of infection spread.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's worsening renal function indicates a decline in kidney function. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of infections.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
7. Pulmonary Hypertension:"

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. had acute desaturation to 80s during rounds with increased SOB.
   Stat CXR done which showed maybe some worsening. Added 80% face mask to
   her 5LNC with improvement in oxygenation. Her breathing became less
   labored.  She was weaned back to 5L NC. BNP elevated, but in the
   setting of her somewhat worsening renal failure she was not further
   diuresed. She had a repeat EKG for K of 5.5 without evidence of peaked

The patient is currently experiencing worsening shortness of breath (SOB), pneumonia with effusion, worsening renal failure, and hyperkalemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient has new worsening hypoxic respiratory failure, with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. The chest X-ray shows evidence of pneumonia and effusion.

2. Pneumonia vs orthopnea: The patient's worsening CHF is being considered, but the CXR is concerning for right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia. There is no leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or chills are present. The patient has a history of likely R-sided pleural effusion concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid overload on CXR.

3. Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R-sided effusion, but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. The patient has decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles.

4. Severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and pulmonary artery hypertension (HTN) are seen on a new echo.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a complicated medical history, admitted to the ICU with right lower lobe pneumonia and hypoxemia. The patient's condition has been slow to improve. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia, which is a bacterial infection in the lungs. If not properly managed, the infection may worsen, leading to respiratory distress or sepsis.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate respiratory distress. If oxygenation does not improve, it can lead to further respiratory failure and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting impaired kidney function. If renal function continues to deteriorate, the patient may require dialysis to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance.
4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which needs to be managed to prevent complications such as heart attack or stroke.
5. Potential cardiac issues: The patient's EKG shows a first-degree AV block, which is a type of heart rhythm abnormality. This could indicate underlying cardiac dysfunction and may require further evaluation and management.
6. Other complications: The patient's age and multiple comorbidities make her vulnerable to other complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and pressure injuries.

It is important to closely monitor and"

   trazodone also w/ ICU and ? uremia contributing. Dr. [**Name (NI) 1788**], Pt's
   outpatient nephrologist was consulted. Although initially renal fellow
   thought she was likely hypovolemic, he thought Pt was likely volume
   overloaded. He suggested holding amlodipine (which was d/c) to increase
   MAP and see if that improves UOP. He also suggested that we initiate
   discussions with the family and Pt about short-term hemodialysis.
   Although there is not currently a need for HD, if the Pt remains
   oliguric she may ultimately benefit from short term HD, if this is
   within goals of care for the family.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) starting last night and continuing until morning. The chest X-ray shows evidence of pneumonia and effusion. She also has worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

The patient has hypoxic respiratory distress, with recent history of nighttime SOB. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia versus orthopnea, worsening congestive heart failure (CHF), and right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or chills. The patient has decreased breath sounds on the right side, but few crackles. Bedside ultrasound shows a right-sided effusion, but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. The patient also has severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) on echo.

Other potential etiologies on the differential could be pulmonary embolism (PE) as she was recently hospitalized, but no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home. The patient had acute hypoxia in the morning of [**3-4**] treated with lasix with some improvement but deteriorating renal function.

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt remained delerious through the day, thought to be related to
   trazodone also w/ ICU and ? uremia contributing. Dr. [**Name (NI) 1788**], Pt's
   outpatient nephrologist was consulted. Although initially renal fellow
   thought she was likely hypovolemic, he thought Pt was likely volume
   overloaded. He suggested holding amlodipine (which was d/c) to increase
   MAP and see if that improves UOP. He also suggested that we initiate
   discussions with the family and Pt about short-term hemodialysis.
   Although there is not currently a need for HD, if the Pt remains
   oliguric she may ultimately benefit from short term HD, if this is
   within goals of care for the family.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.  Pt. had acute hypoxia in the morning of [**3-4**]
   treated with lasix with some improvement but deteriorating renal
   function.
   - Will consider non-contrast CT later in the day if able to tolerate,
   but suspect that she will not be able to
   - no more lasix for now
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 5 of 7 day
   course
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr 3.4 this AM after mild diuresis
   this AM, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year. Possibly new
   baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.  FENa yesterday was 1.2%
   (equivocal)
   - No diuresis today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   - will discuss possibility of short term HD with family today
   - touch base with renal re: increasing sevalamer
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - touch base with renal re: increasing sevalamer
   - low phosphorous diet
   - pt to f/u with outpatient renal
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1on admission in setting of acute on
   chronic renal failure.
   - Kayexelate given this AM
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental status
lucid and fully oriented, but endorses hallucinations
   of kids walking around room. Likely from prolonged ICU stay.
   - Continue to monitor mental status
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  No history of COPD or
   other documented lung disease.
    - Continue on current regimen

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening shortness of breath, pneumonia, pleural effusion, worsening renal failure, and hyperkalemia. The patient's mental status has been delirious, likely due to prolonged ICU stay. She also has pulmonary hypertension, and a history of questionable CVA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia and possible right lower lobe effusion. Close monitoring and treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) are necessary.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 3.4. She requires careful management of fluid balance and electrolytes. The possibility of short-term hemodialysis should be discussed with the family.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated at 5.1, which needs to be addressed to prevent cardiac complications. Kayexelate has been given to help reduce potassium levels.

4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary artery hypertension on echo. This requires further evaluation and management by a pulmonologist.

5. Mental Status Changes: The patient remains delirious, likely due to prolonged ICU"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of being delirious. The delirium is thought to be related to trazodone, but may also be contributing factors such as uremia. The patient's outpatient nephrologist was consulted, and it was suggested to hold amlodipine to increase mean arterial pressure (MAP) and see if it improves urine output. The doctor also discussed the possibility of short-term hemodialysis with the family and patient, although it is not currently needed. The patient has allergies to iodine, Lipitor, Trazamine, and confusion/delirium. The last doses of antibiotics were given at various times. The patient is on multiple infusions including heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/53 mmHg to 151/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient has a first-degree AV block. The patient's weight is currently 70.7 kg, an increase from admission weight of 65 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,920 mL with 136 mL going through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and 540 mL through intravenous fluids (IVF), while output includes 1,006 mL of blood products and 256 mL of urine. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 93%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending. Physical examination findings are not provided in the given summary. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and creatinine (Cr) levels, along with low hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet count (Plt). Other lab values are within normal range. The patient is diagnosed with pneumonia, pain control, renal failure, hypertension, and other conditions. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (PICC line), prophylaxis (DVT and stress ulcer), and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal failure, development of sepsis due to pneumonia or VAP, further deterioration of delirium, and potential bleeding complications due to the use of heparin sodium."

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt remained delerious through the day, thought to be related to
   trazodone also w/ ICU and ? uremia contributing. Dr. [**Name (NI) 1788**], Pt's
   outpatient nephrologist was consulted. Although initially renal fellow
   thought she was likely hypovolemic, he thought Pt was likely volume
   overloaded. He suggested holding amlodipine (which was d/c) to increase
   MAP and see if that improves UOP. He also suggested that we initiate
   discussions with the family and Pt about short-term hemodialysis.
   Although there is not currently a need for HD, if the Pt remains
   oliguric she may ultimately benefit from short term HD, if this is
   within goals of care for the family.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.  Pt. had acute hypoxia in the morning of [**3-4**]
   treated with lasix with some improvement but deteriorating renal
   function.
   - Will consider non-contrast CT later in the day if able to tolerate,
   but suspect that she will not be able to
   - no more lasix for now
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 5 of 7 day
   course
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr 3.4 this AM after mild diuresis
   this AM, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year. Possibly new
   baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.  FENa yesterday was 1.2%
   (equivocal)
   - No diuresis today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   - renal consulted, recs appreciated, do not think she is dry
   - will discuss possibility of short term HD with family today
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - start sevelamer
   - low phosphorous diet
   - pt to f/u with outpatient renal
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1on admission in setting of acute on
   chronic renal failure.
   - Kayexelate given this AM
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  No history of COPD or
   other documented lung disease.
    - Continue on current regimen
    - Will need outpatient pulmonologist
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT once able
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
    -low phosph, low potassium diet

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. The patient presents with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) starting last night and continuing until morning. The chest X-ray shows evidence of pneumonia and effusion. The patient also has worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxic respiratory failure due to nighttime SOB. This could be caused by pneumonia or pulmonary edema.

2. Parapneumonic effusion: The patient has a right-sided pleural effusion, which could be related to the pneumonia. This can lead to decreased breath sounds on the right side and crackles.

3. Severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and pulmonary artery hypertension (HTN): The patient has severe TR and pulmonic HTN on the latest echo. This can contribute to the worsening respiratory distress.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 3.4 this morning after mild diuresis. There is a possibility of a new baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology. This can be caused by various factors such as dehydration, hypotension, or medication side effects.

5. Hyperkalemia: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a complicated medical history, including COPD, who was admitted to the ICU with right lower lobe pneumonia and hypoxemia. The patient's renal function continues to deteriorate with evolving hyperkalemia, indicating acute renal failure. The fluid status is tenuous, suggesting possible pulmonary edema during an acute episode of hypoxemia two days ago. However, due to renal dysfunction, diuresis is not tolerated.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include worsening pneumonia, exacerbation of hypoxemia, and progression of acute renal failure. These complications should be closely monitored and managed appropriately to ensure the patient's well-being."
