   (250 mg Solumedrol q 6h) and attempt diuresis with lasix.
   Pneumocystis jiroveci is also on the differential in this patient given
   recent chemotherapy.  Induced sputum is probably not possible given his

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with hypoxemic respiratory failure. They have underlying non-small cell lung cancer and unclear interstitial lung disease (ILD), with recent CT scans showing changes consistent with ILD and superimposed ground-glass opacities that could represent infection, volume overload, or an acute flare of underlying ILD. The patient's markedly impaired diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) suggests ILD and/or pulmonary hypertension from the mentioned mechanisms. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, high-dose steroids, and diuretics. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is also on the differential due to recent chemotherapy. The patient's prognosis is poor, and code status will be discussed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's CT scan shows areas of consolidations, especially in the left upper lobe (LUL), right upper lobe (RUL), right middle lobe (RML), and bilateral lower lobes (LL's), which are concerning for pneumonia. The patient is already being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover this possibility.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has evidence of superimposed edema on the CT scan. This could contribute to the patient's respiratory distress and may require additional management, such as diuretics to alleviate fluid accumulation.

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of non-small cell lung cancer, unclear interstitial lung disease (ILD), and recent chemotherapy. They were admitted overnight and have been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, high-dose steroids, diuretics, and others. The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension and low oxygen saturation. The physical examination reveals dry crackles at the bases of the lungs, diminished breath sounds, and trace edema in both lower extremities. The patient is unable to stand due to musculoskeletal issues. Neurological assessment is not possible at the moment. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. An ECG shows an old left bundle branch block, and a preliminary pulmonary CT scan indicates interstitial lung disease with increased ground glass opacities and areas of consolidation, concerning for pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and abnormal ABG values suggest inadequate oxygenation.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of ground glass opacities and areas of consolidation on the CT scan raises concern for superimposed infection.
3. Volume overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an excess of 400 mL intake without any corresponding output, indicating possible fluid overload.
4. Acute flare of underlying unclassified ILD: The CT findings suggest an acute worsening of the patient's underlying lung condition.
5. Pulmonary hypertension:"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently receiving various medications and treatments. The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation, and an abnormal heart rhythm. The flow sheet data indicates fluid balance and respiratory support. The patient's physical examination reveals signs of respiratory distress, edema in the lower extremities, and diminished breath sounds. Laboratory results show abnormal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and electrolytes. Imaging tests reveal interstitial lung disease with areas of consolidation, suggesting pneumonia. The assessment and plan include treatment for hypoxemic respiratory failure, covering with antibiotics, administering high-dose steroids, attempting diuresis, and discussing code status with the patient.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis due to infection, organ dysfunction (e.g., renal failure, hepatic dysfunction), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and poor glycemic control. It is crucial to monitor the patient closely and manage these potential complications promptly."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple health issues. They have been admitted to the ICU and are experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure, normal heart rate, and slightly elevated respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation is at 92%. The patient's review of systems indicates no significant changes except for the respiratory system, which shows dry crackles at the bases and scant wheezes. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities and is unable to stand. Neurological examination was not performed.

Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's CT scan shows areas of consolidation, especially in the left upper lobe, which raises concern for pneumonia.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of ground glass opacities and increased bilateral lung water on the CT scan suggests the possibility of pulmonary edema.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure, along with the findings of bilateral infiltrates on the CT scan, could indicate ARDS.
4. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer, and the CT scan findings may be consistent with an acute flare-up of underlying interstitial lung disease associated with NSCLC.
5. Intestinal Lung Disease (ILD): The preliminary PE report mentions increased ground glass and areas of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. This includes underlying non-small cell lung cancer, unclear interstitial lung disease (ILD) that may be consistent with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), superimposed ground-glass opacities (GGO) that could represent infection, volume overload, and acute flare of underlying ILD. The patient also has markedly impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) out of proportion to other lung volumes, suggesting ILD and/or pulmonary hypertension.

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential infections, including Pneumocystis jiroveci, given recent chemotherapy. The patient is also receiving high-dose steroids and attempting diuresis with lasix. No pulmonary embolism (PE) is noted on the CT scan.

The patient's prognosis is poor, and code status has been discussed with the patient. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support and is critically ill.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of ILD, development of new infections due to broad-spectrum antibiotics, exacerbation of underlying lung cancer, and potential complications related to the high-dose steroid treatment."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently admitted to the ICU. They have no known drug allergies and have received treatment with Levofloxacin and Morphine sulfate. The patient's vital signs indicate a slightly elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation is at 92%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows stable fluid balance, with an intake of 100 mL and output of 400 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, with normal heart sounds and peripheral pulses. Crackles and bronchial breath sounds are noted in the respiratory system. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities and is unable to stand. Neurological assessment is incomplete due to the patient's critical condition.

Laboratory results show a low white blood cell count, elevated potassium level, slightly decreased sodium level, and normal other values such as hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, total CO2, glucose, and electrolytes.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include hypoxemic respiratory failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and glycemic control issues."

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypoxemic resp failure:   multifactorial including underlying non small
   cell lung CA, unclear ILD (no biopsy) thought by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 206**] to be c/w
   NSIP. His current CT shows these ILD like changes and superimposed GGO
   which could represent superimposed infection, volume overload and acute
   flare of his underlying unclassified ILD.   His markedly impaired DLCO
   out of proportion to his other [**Location (un) 2600**] and lung volumes suggest ILD and
   /or pulm htn from the above mechanisms. It seems reasonable given that
   he is critically ill to cover broadly with Abx: Vanco, Cefepime and
   Azithromycin. DFA for influenza.  I would continue high dose steroids
   (250 mg Solumedrol q 6h) and attempt diuresis with lasix.
   Pneumocystis jiroveci is also on the differential in this patient given
   recent chemotherapy.  Induced sputum is probably not possible given his
   tenuous respiratory status (nor is bronch, however if he gets intubated
   we would proceed with bronch). Notably no PE on CT scan.    Will
   discuss overall poor prognosis with patient re: code status.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical issues. The note mentions acute pain and chronic pain as ongoing concerns. Additionally, the patient is experiencing respiratory failure, but it is specified to be non-ARDS. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), a heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/54 to 125/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 97%. The patient has a first-degree AV block and weighs 76.6 kg.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including morphine sulfate and furosemide (Lasix), both through IV infusions. They have also been given antibiotics such as levofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime.

Fluid balance is being closely monitored, with a total fluid intake of 1,150 mL and a total output of 1,140 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's urine output is within normal range.

Respiratory support is being provided through an aerosol-cool device, and the patient's SpO2 levels are maintained at 97%. An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, PaO2 of 86, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 26 mEq/L. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 87.

Several lab results are also mentioned, including white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), platelet (Plt) count, creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), glucose levels, and electrolyte levels such as sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4). The results indicate some abnormalities in these parameters, but further details would be needed for a comprehensive assessment.

The patient has multiple lines in place, including a 20-gauge line inserted on October 10th. Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis are being implemented.

Overall, the patient is receiving ICU care, including pain management, respiratory support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for various conditions. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is currently in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis and small cell lung cancer. He is currently experiencing progressive shortness of breath, which may be explained by worsening nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis, radiation pneumonitis, or progression of his small cell lung cancer. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and is receiving various treatments including oxygen therapy, nebulizers with albuterol and ipratropium, and steroids.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and treatment include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's compromised respiratory function increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring for symptoms such as fever, productive cough, and leukocytosis is essential.
2. Respiratory Failure: Due to the severity of the patient's respiratory distress, there is a risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation levels, and respiratory effort is crucial. Intubation may be necessary if the patient's work of breathing (WOB) increases.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: As the patient has limited mobility due to his condition, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots, especially deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Prophylactic measures such as compression boots and subcutaneous heparin are being implemented to prevent this complication.
4. Anemia: The patient's baseline hematocrit (Hct"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis, small cell lung cancer, and recent chemotherapy and radiation treatment. He presents with progressive shortness of breath and is currently dependent on oxygen face mask to maintain saturation levels in the 90s. He also has a history of COPD and is being treated with albuterol and ipratropium nebs. His vital signs show a heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/54 to 125/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and temperature of 36.7 C (98.3 F). He has a first-degree AV block, and his oxygen saturation is 97%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1150 mL (including 50 mL IVF), output of 1140 mL (including 245 mL urine), resulting in a balance of 10 mL. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 7.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, sodium of 137 mEq/L, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, and glucose levels ranging from 104 to 208 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient has several medical conditions including respiratory distress, small cell lung cancer, COPD, anemia, and neuropathy."

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname **] with the ICU team; Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10164**]
s note from
   today reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that this 72-year-old
   man with a complex prior pulmonary history (NSCLC, presumptive NSIP)
   now presents with hypoxemic respiratory distress.  On exam, he has
   labored breathing; with any activity becomes very tachypneic and desats
   to mid-80s.  Crackles diffusely.  Flat neck veins. CT read as
Background interstitial lung disease compatible with NSIP and
   emphysema, with continued increase in areas of ground-glass attenuation
   and peribronchovascular airspace opacification and consolidation, which
   is most notable in the left upper lobe as well as the lower lobes.
   Findings again concerning for superimposed infection or inflammation
   (such as drug reaction), or acute worsening of the patient's underlying
   NSIP. Pulmonary edema is considered less likely, and there is no
   pleural effusion.
  On my review, there are definite new areas of GGO
   and consolidations.
   Assessment and Plan
   51-year-old man with NSCLC and probable NSIP now presents with severe
   hypoxemic respiratory distress.  Differential diagnosis is broad, and
   includes infection [CAP/HCAP, influenza (less likely), Pneumocystis,
   etc.].  Hypersensitivity or COP from radiation is possible.
   Exacerbation of ILD is possible.  Doubt heart failure
 seems dry and
   BNP is relatively low.
   He has received antibiotics and high-dose steroids, but remains quite
   tenuous and may require intubation today.  We will continue present
   therapy and add treatment for pneumocystis.  Will see if he can
   tolerate induced sputum, but he may be unable.  Given his clinical
   status, bronchoscopy is contraindicated without intubation.  We will
   also discuss with his outpatient physicians, as well.
   He is critically ill: 40 minutes

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline
   dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
   50-55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
   level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of small cell lung cancer, nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP), and recent completion of chemotherapy and radiation. He presents with progressive shortness of breath and is currently experiencing respiratory distress. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/55 to 124/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient has been induced to provide sputum samples, but the sample obtained was poor quality. Respiratory viral panel is negative, and empiric therapy with TMP-SMX has been initiated. An echo has been obtained, revealing mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mild dilation of the left atrium. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg, and there is no evidence of aortic stenosis or regurgitation. The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. However, there is a slight elevation in lactate, LDH, and glucose levels. The patient's WBC count has been increasing over the past few days. The patient's plan includes a 10-day course of antibiotics, continued coverage for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), and administration of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis, small cell lung cancer, and recent chemotherapy and radiation treatment. He presents with progressive shortness of breath and is currently dependent on oxygen to maintain saturation levels in the 90s. His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/55 mmHg to 124/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 36.8°C. The patient has mild left ventricular hypertrophy on echo and mild anemia with a hematocrit level of 31.0%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's dependence on oxygen and dyspnea may be due to worsening nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis, radiation pneumonitis, or progression of small cell lung cancer. Close monitoring of respiratory function and oxygen saturation is necessary. If the patient's condition worsens, intubation may be required.

2. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): Given the patient's compromised immune system and chronic symptoms, there is a possibility of PCP infection. Starting IV TMP-SMX (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is recommended to cover for PCP pneumonia.

3. Small Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has a history of small cell lung cancer. There is a"

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline
   dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
   50-55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
   level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

   # Respiratory distress: He remains dependent on oxygen face mask to
   maintain sats in the 90s.  Dyspnea may be explained by several
   mechanisms, including worsening nonspecific interstial pneumonitis,

   lung cancer.  Argues against pneumonia given chronicity of symptoms,
   lack of leukocytosis, afebrile, no cough.

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis, small cell lung cancer, and recent chemotherapy and radiation treatment. He presents with progressive shortness of breath. The patient is currently in respiratory distress and is dependent on oxygen face mask to maintain sats in the 90s. 

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis: The patient's respiratory distress may be explained by worsening of his underlying lung condition.
2. Possible radiation pneumonitis: The patient's recent radiation treatment may have caused inflammation and damage to the lung tissue, leading to radiation pneumonitis.
3. Progression of small cell lung cancer: The patient's symptoms could be due to the progression of his lung cancer.
4. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): Given the patient's compromised state, there is a possibility of PCP pneumonia, especially since he is immunocompromised due to chemotherapy and radiation treatment.
5. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and his recent increased dyspnea may be due to an exacerbation of this condition.
6. Intubation: If the patient's work of breathing (WOB) increases, there is a possibility that he may require intubation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who has undergone chemotherapy and radiation therapy. He presents with increased respiratory failure and has a new ground-glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

24-hour events include the administration of various antibiotics such as levofloxacin, cefipime, Bactrim, and vancomycin. The patient also received prophylactic heparin sodium for thrombosis and other ICU medications like thiamine, colace, omeprazole, neurontin, lido patch, azithromycin, albuterol, atrovent, bactrim, rissole, methylprednisolone, and prn tylenol.

Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs with a temperature of 36.6 C, heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/56 mmHg to 121/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has a first-degree AV block and is well-nourished with trace lower extremity edema. Physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, cool skin, and muscle wasting.

Lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 235 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 140 mg/dL, hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L, and elevated lactate levels. Radiology images are attached but not described in the note.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary issues include respiratory failure due to radiation-induced lung injury or infection, stable scleroderma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and goals of care discussion with the patient and family. The plan involves continuing intravenous steroids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and titrating to levo for a ten-day course. The patient remains full code.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient was discussed on interdisciplinary rounds, and his ICU code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection (due to immunosuppression from chemotherapy and radiation therapy), and complications related to the presence of scleroderma. The patient's fragile cardiac status, indicated by the first-degree AV block, may also predispose him to arrhythmias. Additionally, the patient's anemia and leukocytosis could be indicative of an underlying infection or inflammation."

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname **] with the ICU team; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**]
s note from
   today reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that this 72-year-old
   man with a complex prior pulmonary history (NSCLC, presumptive NSIP)
   now presents with hypoxemic respiratory distress.  On exam, his is
   somewhat more comfortable than yesterday, though breathing is still
   quite labored; FiO2 has decreased to 50%.  Crackles at bases, somewhat
   better than before.  Flat neck veins. Labs, micro, meds, and imaging
   reviewed.  Viral negative; PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 10375**]; galactomannan and beta-glucan
   pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   51-year-old man with NSCLC and probable NSIP now presents with severe
   hypoxemic respiratory distress.  Differential diagnosis is broad, and
   includes infection [CAP/HCAP, influenza (less likely), Pneumocystis,
   etc.].  Hypersensitivity or COP from radiation is possible.
   Exacerbation of ILD is possible.  Doubt heart failure
 seems dry and
   BNP was relatively low.  Overall, seems improved from yesterday though
   still quite tenuous.  Today, we will continue present therapy
   (steroids, antibiotics for CAP/HCAP, and PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]).  Will re-attempt
   induced sputum; since he is less hypoxemic it may be more successful.
   If we are unable to get samples (which seems likely), we will decrease
   steroid dose tomorrow, complete treatment for bacterial pneumonia, and
   complete PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
   Other issues as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**]
s note.
   He is critically ill: 45 minutes
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 31**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2100-10-12**] 14:25 ------
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and probable nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) who presents with severe hypoxemic respiratory distress. The differential diagnosis includes infection (community-acquired pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia, influenza, Pneumocystis), hypersensitivity or COP from radiation, exacerbation of interstitial lung disease, and heart failure.

The patient's current condition shows improvement compared to yesterday, with decreased FiO2 usage and somewhat better crackles at the bases. Flat neck veins and a low B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level suggest that heart failure is less likely.

The plan is to continue with the current therapy, including steroids, antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia, and treatment for presumptive Pneumocystis pneumonia. The team will also attempt to obtain induced sputum samples, as they believe it may be more successful given the patient's improved oxygenation. If sputum samples cannot be obtained, the team will decrease the steroid dose tomorrow, complete treatment for bacterial pneumonia, and complete treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress due to uncontrolled infection, exacerbation of interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity or COP from radiation, and heart failure."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP), scleroderma, and previous chemotherapy and radiation treatment for an unspecified cancer. The patient presents with increased respiratory failure, ground-glass opacities (GGO) on chest CT, and cystic changes prominent in the upper lobes.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to radiation, infection, and progression of NSIP. The treatment plan includes continuing intravenous solumedrol at 1 mg/kg starting tomorrow, broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin) for possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and titrating levofoxacin for a ten-day course. Additionally, the patient will continue taking bactrim for presumed Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) for 21 days.
2. Scleroderma: The patient's scleroderma remains stable for now.
3. COPD: Nebulizers will be used as needed, along with steroids.
4. Goals of care: Ongoing discussion with the patient and family, with the current decision to remain full code.

ICU care:
- Nutrition: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) awaiting speech language pathology evaluation.
- Glycemic control: Regular insulin sliding scale will be used.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis, small cell lung cancer, and recent chemotherapy and radiation treatment. He presents with progressive shortness of breath. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory distress, presumed exacerbation of NSIP or radiation changes. The plan includes a 10-day course of antibiotics, continuation of PCP coverage for 21 days, and administration of 1gm solumedrol today, reducing to 1mg/kg tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's respiratory distress and history of lung cancer and chemotherapy, there is a risk of respiratory failure due to worsening pulmonary function or infection.
2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which suggests a concern for bacterial infection. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and adjust the antibiotic regimen accordingly.
3. Steroid-induced complications: The administration of high-dose solumedrol (steroid) can lead to various complications such as immunosuppression, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and delayed wound healing.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct level has decreased from baseline, indicating a possible development of anemia. Further evaluation and management are required.
5. Neuropathy: The patient is on gabapentin for neuropathy. Monitoring for improvement or worsening of symptoms is essential.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who is admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is an ineffective cough, and there are concerns about poor oral intake. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics for suspected infections. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6 C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/42 to 114/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 87%. The patient's weight remains unchanged since admission at 76.6 kg. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,340 mL (including 625 mL IV fluids) and output of 2,010 mL (including 565 mL urine). The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support, with an ABG pending. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's pain management and nutrition are concerns, along with respiratory failure. The patient's code status is full code, and there are no dispositions mentioned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is low at 87%, indicating potential respiratory distress or failure. This could be due to underlying lung pathology or inadequate oxygen delivery through the high-flow nasal cannula.
2. Ineffective Coping: The patient is experiencing ineffective coping"

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname **] with the ICU team; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**]
s note from
   today reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that this 72-year-old
   man with a complex prior pulmonary history (NSCLC, presumptive NSIP)
   now presents with hypoxemic respiratory distress.  On exam, his is
   somewhat more comfortable than earlier in the week, though breathing is
   still quite labored. Crackles at bases.  Flat neck veins.  Labs, micro,
   meds, and imaging reviewed.  He is still unable to produce sputum, even
   with induction.
   Assessment and Plan
   51-year-old man with NSCLC and probable NSIP now presents with severe
   hypoxemic respiratory distress.  Differential diagnosis is broad, and
   includes infection [CAP/HCAP, influenza (less likely), Pneumocystis,
   etc.].  Hypersensitivity or COP from radiation is possible.
   Exacerbation of ILD is possible.  Doubt heart failure
 continues to
   seem dry and BNP was relatively low.  Overall, seems to have improved
   from Sunday/Monday but not so much from yesterday.  Still quite
   tenuous.  Today, we will continue present therapy (steroids,
   antibiotics for CAP/HCAP, and PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]).  We have decreased steroids from
   pulse.  I do not think benefits of BAL outweigh risks at present time,
   given ongoing hypoxemia.  For anemia, will recheck Hct.  For
   thrombocytopenia, he is on the low side of intermediate risk for HIT.
   We will recheck plt count.  If lower, will switch prophylaxis to
   non-heparinoid and check HIT Ab.  Given competing possibilities (e.g.
   ABX), I think the risks of systemic anticoagulation outweigh benefits
   unless HIT Ab (PF4) is positive.  Creatinine elevation without BUN
   elevation suggests Bactrim effect on creatinine secretion, rather than
   ARF, but will follow.  Other issues as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**]
s note.
   Detailed discussion with Mr. [**Known lastname **] and his HCP about course of care, and
   that if he worsens to the point of needing intubation then he probably
   has incurable disease (e.g. ILD exacerbation).  I doubt that this acute
   event represent malignancy.  Discussed possibility of needing life
   support/ventilation in this circumstance.  He is not easily able to
   make this decision.  Discussed with HCP as well, since Mr. [**Known lastname **] notes
   that his thinking feels clouded.  We will plan for a trial of
   intubation/ventilation if needed, with reassessment in a few days
   afterwards.  All questions answered.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of NSCLC and presumptive NSIP who is currently experiencing severe hypoxemic respiratory distress. The patient's respiratory failure can be attributed to various factors such as infection (PCP), NSIP, or radiation hypersensitivity.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's history of NSCLC, NSIP, and recent chemotherapy/radiation therapy, there is a high risk of respiratory failure due to infectious causes like CAP/HCAP, influenza, Pneumocystis pneumonia, or exacerbation of underlying ILD.

2. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: The patient may have developed hypersensitivity pneumonitis as a result of radiation therapy. This condition can cause inflammation and scarring of lung tissue, leading to respiratory distress.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level is decreasing, indicating a possible drop in red blood cell count. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of anemia, which could be due to bleeding or other factors.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, putting him at an increased risk of bleeding. It is important to monitor platelet levels and consider the possibility of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's serum creatinine level"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) and small cell lung cancer. He presented with progressive shortness of breath and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/57 to 134/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's medical history includes small cell lung cancer, treated with chemotherapy and radiation, and nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. He is currently on a 10-day course of antibiotics for presumed exacerbation of NSIP or radiation changes. The antibiotics may be narrowed to levofloxacin if there is improvement after 5 days, or continued as broad-spectrum antibiotics if the patient remains ill and hypoxic. Additionally, the patient is receiving coverage for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) for the full 21-day course.

Other assessments and plans include management for small cell lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anemia, neuropathy, and fecal occult blood testing. The patient is also on home proton pump inhibitor (PPI), heparin subcutaneous injection, and bowel regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis and small cell lung cancer. He presented with progressive shortness of breath and was diagnosed with presumed exacerbation of NSIP or radiation changes. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for 10 days, including azithromycin, vancomycin, and cefepime. He is also being treated for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) with a 21-day course of medication.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's underlying condition and the aggressive treatment may lead to further respiratory complications.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's risk of aspiration is high due to his weakened state and the use of steroids. This could result in aspiration pneumonia.
3. Antibiotic resistance: The prolonged use of antibiotics increases the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant organisms.
4. Renal failure: The patient has been experiencing acute kidney injury (ARF) and it is necessary to monitor his renal function closely.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. Further investigation and management are required.
6. Neuropathy: The patient has neuropathy, which is likely due to his small cell lung cancer or its treatment. However, due to his NPO status, he cannot take gabapentin. Alternative pain management options should be explored.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) and small cell lung cancer, who presented with progressive shortness of breath. He has been treated with chemotherapy and radiation but has experienced worsening respiratory distress. The patient recently aspirated while eating and has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. He is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) due to the risk of aspiration. The patient's hyponatremia has been addressed, and he is being treated for acute renal failure, tooth pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anemia, and neuropathy. The patient's condition remains critical, and a meeting has been scheduled with the ICU team, palliative care, and the patient's family to discuss further management and goals of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's risk factors (e.g., dysphagia, altered mental status) and recent episode of aspiration, there is a high risk for developing aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotics are crucial.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying lung conditions (NSIP and small cell lung cancer) and recent respiratory distress indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. Monitoring of oxygen saturation, ventilation, and frequent assessment of breath sounds are essential.
3. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state from chemotherapy and radiation therapy, there is a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) and small cell lung cancer, who presented with progressive shortness of breath. He has undergone chemotherapy and radiation therapy for his lung cancer. The patient experienced an episode of aspiration while eating scrambled eggs, leading to desaturation, but recovered with supplemental oxygen. He is currently at high risk for aspiration and is being kept NPO (nothing by mouth). The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 123/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His physical examination reveals crackles and wheezes in the chest, as well as a distended abdomen. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, and platelets, with slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's history of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis and recent radiation therapy for lung cancer puts him at risk for respiratory distress. Aggressive treatment is being pursued to rule out treatable conditions such as bacterial pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), and steroid-responsive pneumonitis.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient aspirated while eating scrambled eggs and desaturated, but recovered with the help of BiPAP. The patient has been NPO except for medications, although he would like to eat. A palliative care consult has been initiated and a meeting is scheduled for 10-15 at 1:30 pm. The patient experienced nausea overnight with associated desaturation, so he was placed on BiPAP.

The patient has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were cefepime, Bactrim, azithromycin, and vancomycin, all given on 10/14/2100. He is currently receiving pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, and lorazepam.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7 C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/59 to 155/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a non-rebreather mask. The patient has a first-degree AV block.

The patient has received a total of 2250 mL of IV fluids, with 575 mL coming in the last 24 hours. His current weight is 76.6 kg. He has had a total output of 3160 mL,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of cancer, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, as evidenced by the decreasing SpO2 levels and changes in vital signs. The patient has been on various medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and supportive care. There have been no new developments in terms of medical history or review of systems. The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in potassium, sodium, and glucose levels. Imaging shows improvement in a previously identified area of opacification in the left retrocardiac region, which may be due to resolving aspiration. The patient has a PICC line inserted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's SpO2 level is consistently below 90%, indicating possible respiratory distress or failure. This could be due to aspiration pneumonia or other underlying lung pathology.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, with readings ranging from 105/42 mmHg to 94/36 mmHg. This could indicate poor perfusion and organ hypoxia.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low at 25 mEq/L. This can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or even cardiac arrest if not corrected promptly.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is high at 7.0 mEq/L. This can cause cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis and small cell lung cancer. He presented with progressive shortness of breath and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including respiratory distress, hyponatremia, acute renal failure (ARF), tooth pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anemia, and neuropathy.

Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is presumed to be caused by an exacerbation of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis or radiation changes. He has been aggressively treated for any treatable conditions such as bacterial pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), and steroid-responsive pneumonitis.

Hyponatremia: The patient appears clinically dry today, and his hyponatremia has been addressed by administering Bactrim in normal saline (NS) instead of D5W.

Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is thought to be caused by the Bactrim effort and prerenal factors. His creatinine levels have been monitored, and he received 1 L NS with Bactrim.

Small Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has small cell lung cancer, which was recently treated with radiation therapy. A palliative care consult has been requested.

Tooth Pain: The patient has a new finding of tooth pain, but no visible"

   FINDINGS: The recently developed acute area of opacification in the
   left
   retrocardiac region has improved, and may be due to a resolving area of
   acute
   aspiration. Other widespread pulmonary opacities are unchanged allowing
   for
   slight differences in lung volumes. Note is made of a right PICC with
   tip
   terminating at the junction of the right axillary and subclavian veins.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis and small cell lung cancer, who presented with progressive shortness of breath. He has been admitted to the ICU and has multiple medical conditions including respiratory distress, hyponatremia, small cell lung cancer, tooth pain, COPD, anemia, and neuropathy. The patient's current medications include azithromycin, vancomycin, cefepime, bactrim, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and morphine IV. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but he is experiencing crackles and wheezes in his respiratory system. His lab results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin and platelet count. The patient has a recent chest X-ray showing improvement of an acute area of opacification in the left retrocardiac region, which may be due to a resolving area of acute aspiration. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his disposition is to remain in the ICU with plans for long-term care management.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress due to presumed exacerbation of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis or radiation changes, resistant bacterial pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), steroid-responsive pneumonitis, hyponatremia,"
