   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 46 yoF presenting with 24-26 hours of HA, N/V and
   found to have evidence of bacterial menigitis on OSH w/u of agitation
   and latered MS.
   .
   #. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: no tox screen in records sent; LP on oral
   report only though seems c/w bacterial meningitis.  Head CT negative at
   OSH. Gram positive cocci, appears to be hinting at strep pneumo as
   causative.
   -- will treat empirically for bacterial meningitis with vancomycin 1 g
   IV BID, ceftriaxone 2 g IV BID
   -- per ID, discontinue ampicillin 2 mg IV q6h and acyclovir
   -- will monitor closely for drug rxn (known allergies of rash,
   discussed with ID in ED, on decadron)
   -- cont decadron 10 mg IV Q6 hours x 4 days for possible Strep pneumo
   menigitis
   -- contact precautions while ruling out Neisseria meningitis

   -- will send tox screens
 urine and serum
   -- BCx x 2
   -- f/u CSF cx from OSH
   -- hold home amitriptylline for now

   #. RESPIRATORY STATUS: was on vent for ""airway protection"" with altered
   MS; will try to wean as tolerated; should be able to lighten and
   possible extubate this morning
   .
   #. POSSIBLE LLL PNEUMONIA: may blossom more; mother denied [**Name2 (NI) **] with
   HA; may be aspiration event if she was found altered/down.
   -- empiric coverage as above should cover (though not great for
   anaerobes, but ok to not cover for now)
   -- may prove a little harder to wean if PNA develops
   -- will check for influenza; f/u DFA

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 46-year-old female presenting with symptoms of headache, altered mental status, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial meningitis and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F, blood pressure in the high 70s, heart rate of 85-117 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, and normal to slightly elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient has multiple allergies to medications such as tetracycline, penicillins, sulfa antibiotics, clindamycin, cephalosporins, and macrolide antibiotics. The patient is currently on several medications including fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), pantoprazole (Protonix), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

The patient's physical examination findings include altered mental status, no focal neurologic deficits, decreased breath sounds in the left lung base, and poor skin turgor. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: Due to the presence of bacterial meningitis and pneumonia, the patient is at risk of developing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old individual with a likely diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis. The patient has a history of coils in the brain and meningitis post-operation years ago. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fever, arterial line placement, GPC in CSF, discontinuation of acyclovir, SBP drop, and initiation of levophed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient is diagnosed with septic shock, which can lead to organ failure and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has right and left lower extremity edema, indicating potential impaired skin integrity due to prolonged bed rest or poor circulation.
3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing significant hypoxemia due to pneumonia. This can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
4. Bacterial meningitis: The patient is likely suffering from bacterial meningitis, which can progress rapidly and result in severe complications such as brain damage or death if not treated appropriately.
5. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has developed aspiration pneumonia, which occurs when foreign material enters the lungs. This can lead to respiratory distress and further complications.
6. Code status: The patient's code status is set to full code, indicating that all resuscitative measures should be taken in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, the patient has been experiencing fever, altered mental status, and a sudden drop in blood pressure. The arterial line was started on 12/21/2108 at 4:00 PM. 

The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed. Firstly, the patient is suspected of having bacterial meningitis, which is confirmed by the culture results showing growth of Group B strep. Therefore, ceftriaxone will be continued to treat the Group B strep infection.

Secondly, the patient has pneumonia, as indicated by the chest X-ray findings. The treatment plan includes continuing with ceftriaxone and broadening coverage if necessary to treat either community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or aspiration pneumonia.

Thirdly, the patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) as per the urinalysis from the outside hospital.

Additionally, there is a concern for QTC prolongation on the EKG from the outside hospital, so monitoring of the QTC interval is recommended.

Metformin has been held due to unclear reasons, possibly related to diabetes or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Home medications such as gabapentin, ativan, and oxycodone have been held, while sertraline will be continued with confirmation of the dose.

A nutrition consult has been ordered to start total parenteral nutrition (TF), and the patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female presenting with headache, nausea, and vomiting for 24-26 hours. She has evidence of bacterial meningitis on OSH workup, along with agitation and lethargy. She was found to have altered mental status. A head CT was negative for any significant findings. The patient's allergies include tetracycline, penicillins, sulfa, clindamycin, cephalosporins, and macrolide antibiotics. She is currently intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status. Her respiratory status is stable, but there are concerns about possible LLL pneumonia. She has been started on ceftriaxone for suspected GBS and treatment for bacterial meningitis. Her urine output has decreased, and her central venous pressure is elevated at 18 mmHg. She is receiving IV fluids and Lasix to improve urine output and lower CVP. The patient's blood cultures came back negative, and her sputum culture is pending. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 19.0, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 179, and elevated glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal limits. Imaging studies include an AM CXR pending, and microbiology results are also pending. The patient is being treated empirically for bacterial meningitis with ceftriaxone and closely monitored for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female who presented with symptoms of headache, nausea, and vomiting for 24-26 hours. She was found to have evidence of bacterial meningitis based on an outside hospital workup, and her mental status was altered. A head CT was negative for any significant findings. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation for airway protection due to her altered mental status. She has been diagnosed with possible LLL pneumonia and a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient also has a history of prolonged QTc on the outside hospital EKG, but it has since resolved. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial Meningitis: The patient initially presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of bacterial meningitis, which requires prompt treatment to prevent further complications such as neurological damage, septic shock, and multi-organ failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to her altered mental status and inability to protect her airway. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Pneumonia: The patient may have developed pneumonia, particularly in the left lower lobe (LLL). This condition can progress and lead to sepsis, respiratory failure, and other systemic complications.
4. UTI: The patient likely has a urinary tract infection, which can ascend and lead to kidney infection (pyel"

   #. ALTERED MS: no tox screen in records sent; LP on oral report only
   though seems c/w bacterial meningitis. Head CT negative at OSH.
   -- will treat empirically for bacterial meningitis with ceftriaxone 2 g
   IV QD,
   -- will monitor closely for drug rxn (known allergies of rash,
   discussed with ID in ED, on decadron)
   -- cont decadron 10 mg IV Q6 hours x 6 days for possible Strep pneumo
   menigitis
   -- will also treat empirically for viral menigitis with acyclovir
   -- contact precautions while ruling out Neisseria meningitis
   -- will send tox screens
   -- BCx x 2
   -- f/u CSF cx from OSH
   -- hold home amitriptylline for now
   .
   #. RESPIRATORY STATUS: was on vent for ""airway protection"" with altered
   MS; will try to wean as tolerated; should be able to lighten and
   possible extubate this morning
   .
   #. POSSIBLE LLL PNEUMONIA: may blossom more; mother denied [**Name2 (NI) **] with
   HA; may be aspiration event if she was found altered/down.
   -- Added Azitho on [**11-22**] and continuing Vanco since [**11-20**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female who presented with symptoms of headache, nausea, and vomiting for 24-26 hours. She was found to have evidence of bacterial meningitis on OSH workup and was admitted to the ICU. She is intubated and sedated due to altered mental status. The patient has a history of allergies to tetracycline, penicillins, sulfa, clindamycin, cephalosporins, and macrolide antibiotics. She has been treated empirically for bacterial meningitis with ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and corticosteroids. She also has respiratory distress, suspected to be due to aspiration pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia. She has a urinary tract infection and possible QTC prolongation on EKG. The patient's medications were held, and she is being closely monitored for drug reactions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and sedated, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status and inability to protect her airway may lead to aspiration of gastric contents, increasing the risk of pneumonia.
3. Drug reactions: Given the patient's history of allergies to multiple antibiotics, there is a risk of drug reactions with the current medications being administered.
4. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient has multiple central lines"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old with bacterial meningitis, currently in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with Group B strep meningitis and is being treated with antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show fever, high blood pressure, and low oxygen saturation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, sulfa, clindamycin, cephalosporins, and macrolides. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition suggests possible sepsis due to bacterial meningitis and pneumonia. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and organ function is necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is required.
3. Renal Dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level indicates possible kidney dysfunction. Regular assessment of renal function and close monitoring of fluid balance and medication dosages are necessary.
4. Thromboembolic Events: Immobility and the presence of central venous lines increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin should be continued.
5. Nosocomial Infections: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive devices increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Appropriate infection control measures and regular surveillance cultures should be implemented.
6. Neurological Complications: Bacterial meningitis can lead to neurological complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, and brain abscesses. Neurological monitoring and close observation are necessary.
7. Pressure Ulcers: Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessment and repositioning are essential to prevent and manage any pressure ulcers that may develop.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's condition based on the provided information. Additional details and tests may be necessary to fully assess the patient's medical status and potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 46-year-old with bacterial meningitis, likely caused by pneumococcal bacteria.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, shock, and sepsis.
- Cultures confirm pansensitive Group B strep.
- Antibiotics have been adjusted to include ceftriaxone/azithromycin and re-addition of vancomycin due to fever.
- Right internal jugular (IJ) line was pulled and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed.
- Low urine output and central venous pressure (CVP) led to the administration of lasix.
- The patient was not tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) and was biting on the tube, resulting in dysynchronous ventilation.
- Allergies include tetracycline, penicillins, sulfonamides, clindamycin, cephalosporins, and macrolides.
- The patient received various medications, including propofol, furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), pantoprazole (Protonix), and antibiotics.
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the mentioned events.
- Vital signs show a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 161/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,613 mL and output of 1,787 mL.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 31 mmHg, PaO2 of 194, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 12.2 L/min.
- Physical examination reveals an overweight-obese appearance, clear breath sounds, warm skin without rashes, and no edema in the lower extremities.
- Neurologic examination shows the patient is minimally arousable and not following simple commands.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), as well as elevated blood glucose levels.
- Imaging shows an endotracheal tube in place without infiltrates and a PICC line in good position.
- Assessment and plan include shock and septic meningitis, pneumonia, aspiration, and impaired skin integrity.
- The patient's condition requires continued treatment with antibiotics, sedation reduction, consideration of propofol, and further evaluation for potential abuse given ecchymosis."

   Opacification in the retrocardiac region is consistent with atelectasis
   with blunting of the costophrenic angles, suggesting pleural effusion.
   In view of the clinical history, the possibility of supervening

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female presenting with symptoms of headache, nausea, and vomiting for 24-26 hours. She has evidence of bacterial meningitis on OSH cultures and is initially treated with ceftriaxone. However, she experiences increased oxygen requirements and persistent fevers, so she is switched to broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. The patient also has bilateral pneumonia as seen on CTA chest, and sputum culture is sent. She is on mechanical ventilation for ""airway protection"" but is fighting the ventilator. The patient also has a history of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) meningitis and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her respiratory status is complicated by pneumonia and fluid overload. Other medical issues include a prolonged QTc on OSH EKG, unclear reasons for being on metformin, and home medications including gabapentin, ativan, oxycodone, and sertraline. The patient's family history is significant for penicillin allergy, which may have contributed to her current condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GBS Meningitis: The patient has a history of GBS meningitis, which is a serious infection that can lead to complications such as sepsis, hearing loss, neurological deficits, and even death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Bilateral Pneumonia (PNA):"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female who presented with symptoms of headache, nausea, and vomiting. She was found to have evidence of bacterial meningitis on a lumbar puncture. The patient was intubated for airway protection and has been on mechanical ventilation. She has a history of allergies to penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, clindamycin, and macrolides. The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, respiratory distress, and difficulty weaning from sedation. Imaging studies have revealed bilateral pleural effusions and pneumonia. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but there is a mild elevation in lactate. Blood cultures have been obtained and antibiotic therapy has been initiated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Suppurative Thrombophlebitis: Due to the presence of central lines, there is a risk of developing suppurative thrombophlebitis, which is a localized infection of the vein associated with a thrombus formation.
2. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are on mechanical ventilation.
3. Septic Shock: Given the presence of bacterial meningitis and potential respiratory infections, the patient is at risk of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old female who presented with symptoms of headache, nausea, and vomiting. She was found to have evidence of bacterial meningitis on OSH cultures and was initially treated with ceftriaxone. However, due to increasing oxygen requirements and persistent fevers, the antibiotic regimen was switched to broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. Subsequently, the antibiotics were switched back to penicillin G potassium.

The patient also had respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation for ""airway protection."" There were concerns about pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but no evidence of VAP was found. The sputum culture grew yeast, and Legionella was negative.

Other medical issues mentioned in the progress note include urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Group B Streptococcus (GBS), bilateral pneumonia, and potential prolonged QT interval on OSH EKG. The patient is also being held on metformin, gabapentin, and ativan, and will continue on sertraline.

The patient's current medications include lasix for fluid overload, ranitidine to decrease the risk of VAP, and bisacodyl for bowel regimen. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 38.2 C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 122/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old female who presented with symptoms of headache, nausea, and vomiting for 24-26 hours. She was found to have evidence of bacterial meningitis on the initial workup. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues.

1. Group B Strep Meningitis: The patient initially received ceftriaxone but showed increased oxygen requirements and persistent fevers. She was then switched to broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanc/cefepime/cipro) before being switched back to penicillin alone.

2. Respiratory Status: The patient required mechanical ventilation for airway protection due to altered mental status. However, she had an increasing oxygen requirement and was fighting the ventilator. She was placed on CPAP and tolerated it well. The plan is to wean her off the ventilator as tolerated, reduce fentanyl infusion, and aim for extubation today.

3. Bilateral Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of bilateral pneumonia seen on a CT angiogram of the chest. Her sputum culture grew yeast, indicating a possible fungal infection. No evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or hemodynamic instability was observed, so she was switched back to penicillin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female who presented with symptoms of headache, nausea, and vomiting. She was found to have evidence of bacterial meningitis on OSH cultures and was initially on ceftriaxone, but switched to broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro) due to persistent fevers and increased oxygen requirement. She also has bilateral pneumonia seen on CT angiogram chest, and sputum culture has been sent. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection, but has been fighting the ventilator. There is evidence of fluid overload influencing her respiratory status. 

Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Meningitis: The patient initially had Group B Strep Meningitis, which was sensitive to penicillin. She was on ceftriaxone, but switched to broad-spectrum antibiotics due to persistent fevers and increased oxygen requirement.
2. RESPIRATORY STATUS: The patient is currently intubated for airway protection, but has been fighting the ventilator. Likely components of pneumonia and fluid overload are influencing her respiratory status.
3. B/L PNEUMONIA: The patient has bilateral pneumonia seen on CT angiogram chest. Sputum culture has been sent, and she is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
4. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by Group B Strep. She is already on broad-spectrum"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female who presented with symptoms of headache, nausea, and vomiting. She was found to have evidence of bacterial meningitis on a spinal tap analysis. The patient had an increased oxygen requirement and persistent fevers, leading to a switch in antibiotics from ceftriaxone to penicillin. She also had bilateral pneumonia seen on a CT scan, positive yeast in sputum culture, and a urinary tract infection (UTI) positive for Group B Streptococcus (GBS) on admission but negative at the current facility. The patient has been experiencing fever, and there were non-blanching ecchymotic patches on her right MTP joints and dorsal surface of the hand, which are improving. She has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.0, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/63 mmHg to 150/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with a tracheal tube in place and set on CPAP mode. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 170. Laboratory values indicate elevated"

She is currently on [**Doctor Last Name**] for Group B Strep Meningitis.

The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation due to airway protection and altered mental status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female presenting with symptoms of headache, nausea, and vomiting. She was found to have evidence of bacterial meningitis on initial evaluation. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with Group B Streptococcus (GBS) meningitis, which is sensitive to ceftriaxone. A CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis showed no abscess or pelvic infection, but there is a simple left ovarian cyst. The patient's respiratory status has improved with the use of CPAP and diazepam, and she is being weaned off the ventilator. The patient's urine culture is positive for GBS, and she is already on appropriate antibiotics for this infection. There is no identified source of infection at this point.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged ventilation: The patient's initial respiratory status required intubation and mechanical ventilation. While her condition has improved, there is still a risk of prolonged ventilation if she does not continue to wean off the ventilator successfully.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient was previously on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Although her current status shows improvement, monitoring for signs of pneumonia is essential.
3. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line and a PICC line. Regular assessment and monitoring for signs of infection at the insertion sites are necessary"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old female presenting with symptoms of headache, nausea, and vomiting for 24-26 hours. She was found to have evidence of bacterial meningitis and was initially placed on ventilatory support due to agitation and labored respiratory status. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including group B strep meningitis, bilateral pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and possibly prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). 

The patient's current medications include diazepam, fentanyl, famotidine, heparin sodium, and an unidentified antibiotic. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 156/75 to 158/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, as well as abnormal kidney and liver function test results. 

Imaging studies reveal the presence of free fluid in the pelvis, a simple left ovarian cyst, bibasilar consolidation with residual airspace opacities concerning for infection, and pulmonary edema. 

The patient's plan includes weaning off ventilatory support, continuing with the current antibiotic therapy, and further evaluation of the sputum culture and imaging"

   provided. I agree with the note above, including the assessment and
   plan. I would emphasize and add the following points:
   CT was unremarkable with no pelvic abscess or [**Last Name (un) **]. Low grade fevers
   with no overt signs of new infection. Tolerated CPAP 10 cm overnight,
   SBT in AM. Good urine output, stable hemodynamics. Extubated
   uneventfully this morning. Currently 135/70, HR 94, Sat 94% on 50% O2
   mask. Awake, smiles, responds slowly, moves extremities x 4, lungs
   clear ant, no murmurs. Off pressors.
   Labs notable for persistent leukocytosis. No bands on yesterday
s diff.
   Hct, lytes, renal function stable. Last ABG 7.48/36/95.
   CXR with increased interstitial markings, no infiltrates.
   Impression
   GBS meningitis on Pen G. Source unclear, agree with MRI. Per [**Hospital1 609**]
   records, coils and clips for aneurysm all done in [**2103**]
 should be no
   contraindication for MRI.
   Persistent low grade fever
 possible source are lungs. Small left
   pleural effusion but doubt empyema or active pneumonia. If spikes,
   would broaden antibiotic coverage.
   Acute respiratory failure
 improved, still O2 dependent, extubated on

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female presenting with 24-26 hours of headache, nausea, and vomiting, and evidence of bacterial meningitis on OSH w/u. She has been diagnosed with Group B Streptococcus (GBS) meningitis, which is pan-sensitive on OSH cultures. The source of the infection is unclear at this point. The patient has undergone brain aneurysm surgery and had coils and clips placed. Her current medications include ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin, which were stopped after identifying GBS as the causative organism. She is also on diazepam, famotidine, heparin sodium, and fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient had increasing oxygen requirements and was fighting the ventilator. There is a mention of likely components of pneumonia and fluid overload influencing her respiratory status. The goal is to wean her off the ventilator as tolerated.
2. Bilateral pneumonia: The patient has evidence of bilateral pneumonia seen on CTA chest. She has sputum culture with yeast, and Legionella is negative. There is a low threshold to start broad antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient had a positive urine culture for Group B Strep during her hospital stay. She is currently on appropriate antibiotics for the UTI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female presenting with headache, nausea, and vomiting for 24-26 hours. She was found to have evidence of bacterial meningitis on initial screening and is currently on [Doctor Last Name]'s medication. The patient's condition is complicated by group B strep meningitis, which is pan-sensitive on OSH cultures. There is no identified source of infection at this point. The patient underwent surgery for aneurysm clips compatible with MRI, performed by Dr. [First Name4 Last Name]. She has a history of prior operation and brain coils for previous aneurysm surgery, with records available at [Hospital1 609].

The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, as she was on a ventilator for airway protection but developed increasing oxygen requirements and agitation. She is now on CPAP and has been improving, but continues to have increased sputum production requiring suction. A two-view chest X-ray is recommended to assess the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), although it may be challenging to distinguish from fluid overload.

The patient's mental status has been altered due to active meningitis, possibly withdrawal from benzodiazepines, and current use of diazepam. Mental status has been improving, and further MRI is planned to look for phlegmon. The patient is also at risk for urinary tract infection (UTI) given the positive UCx from O"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 46-year-old female who presented with symptoms of headache, nausea, and vomiting, and was found to have evidence of bacterial meningitis. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being treated for Group B Strep Meningitis. The patient underwent surgery to clip an aneurysm and has a history of brain coils for previous aneurysm surgery. She has been experiencing respiratory issues, including increased oxygen requirement and agitation, possibly due to pneumonia and fluid overload. Her mental status has been improving, and she has been extubated. The patient has multiple allergies, including to tetracycline, penicillins, sulfa, clindamycin, cephalosporins, and macrolide antibiotics. Her vital signs show tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. She has received various medications, including famotidine, heparin sodium, and metformin. The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis, elevated hemoglobin, and slightly low platelet count. Imaging and microbiology results are pending. The patient's current goals include weaning off sedating medications, avoiding further complications, and improving mental status. Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and urinary tract infection (UTI)."

","The patient is a 65-year-old overweight/obese male who presented with altered mental status and was subsequently intubated for respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. He was diagnosed with Group B Streptococcus (GBS) meningitis, which was likely secondary to penicillin G exposure. The patient had a prolonged ICU stay and was extubated uneventfully yesterday. However, he desaturated to 82% overnight on 15L high flow O2 and required suctioning. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 145/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is on CPAP/PSV mode with a respiratory support device and receiving 38% FiO2. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 35 mmHg, PaO2 of 563, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 23. The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, except for right lower extremity edema, which is absent. The patient's laboratory values show a white blood cell count of 18.7 K/uL, hematocrit of 33.1%, platelet count of 349 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, and glucose levels ranging from 115"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old overweight/obese individual who was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure. They were successfully extubated yesterday but experienced desaturation to 82% overnight on high flow oxygen and required suctioning. The patient has a history of allergies to tetracycline, penicillins, sulfa antibiotics, clindamycin, cephalosporins, and macrolide antibiotics. They were last given ciprofloxacin on 12/24/2108 at 12:30 PM and penicillin G potassium on 12/27/2108 at 08:30 AM. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9 C (100.3 F), current temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate of 113 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 145/80 mmHg to 92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance with a total input of 1,403 mL and total output of 2,535 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,132 mL. They are receiving high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy and have been extubated. 

Physical examination findings include general obesity, clear breath sounds, warm skin without rash, and"
