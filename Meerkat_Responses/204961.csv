   Assessment and Plan
   77yo gentleman with h/o COPD as well as restriction from scoliosis and
   left hemidiaphragm elevation admitted with respiratory distress in the
   setting of fever and cough.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Patient has acute decompensation superimposed on chronic lung disease.
   No PFTs in OMR, but likely has predominantly restrictive physiology.
   Acute process may have been aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, viral
   infection, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation.  Contributors to his poor
   baseline lung function include COPD as well as severe scoliosis and
   left hemidiaphragm elevation.   On NPPV overnight, with only
   intermittent improvement in respiratory distress.
   - ? intubation
   - continue vanc/cefepime for possible aspiration vs health care
   associated pneumonia
   - would continue solumedrol and then transition to prednisone in
   tomorrow depending on clinical status
   - continue atrovent and albuterol nebs, standing q6 and prn
   - would repeat chest CT when more stable
   - obtain sputum Cx
   - guafenesin, hyoscyamine to decrease oral secretions
   .
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):
   Possible sources include pneumonia, UTI, viral infection (such as
   influenza), pneumonitis, or C diff.  Does not report diarrhea, but has
   had significant C diff infections in the past.  Not history of
   quinolone resistant UTIs in the past.  Blood culture from ED now
   growing GPCs in clusters, although this could be contaminant.
   - Changed foley and repeat U/A neg
   - continue coverage with vanc and cefepime for now
   - f/u urine and blood cultures from the ED
   - influenza neg and tamiflu stopped
   - send sputum Cx and stool for C diff
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Likely due to respiratory distress and dehydration (he
   has concentrated urine, elevated BUN, and hct above baseline).
   Received gentle volume resuscitation and tachycardia improved.  UOP has
   been adequate at 30 cc/hr
   - continue gentle IV fluids for volume resuscitation; follow Uop
   - monitor
   .
   # Elevated cardiac biomarkers: CE negative with 2 sets 8 hours apart.
   EKG is reassuring and he denies chest pain.  Likely has some demand
   ischemia from respiratory distress and tachycardia.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved with repeat blood draws.
   .
 .H/O PARKINSON'S DISEASE
   - continue sinemet
   - continue hyoscyamine, presumably to decrease oral secretions
   .
   # AFib:  continue amiodarone; not on anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed
   .
   # ? h/o Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin and ASA
   .
   # h/o DVTs:
   - monitor exam given h/o line-associated and unprovoked DVTs in the
   past
   - not on anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed
   .
   # Anxiety:  ativan prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), scoliosis, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. He was admitted with respiratory distress, fever, and cough. The patient has been on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and requires frequent aggressive suctioning. He has had a change in Foley catheter, and blood cultures are positive for aerobic gram-positive cocci in clusters. The patient's cardiac enzymes are flat, and there are no signs of infection or ischemia on the electrocardiogram (EKG). The patient's hyperkalemia has resolved, and his vital signs are stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute decompensation of chronic lung disease may lead to respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by aspiration pneumonia, viral infection, COPD exacerbation, or other acute processes.
2. Fever: The patient's fever could be due to pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), viral infection (such as influenza), pneumonitis, or Clostridium difficile infection. Further evaluation is needed to determine the source of infection.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be caused by respiratory distress and dehydration. Close monitoring and gentle IV fluids for volume resuscitation are recommended.
4. Elevated cardiac biomarkers: Although the patient's cardiac enzymes are negative with two sets 8"

   Assessment and Plan
   77yo gentleman with h/o COPD as well as restriction from scoliosis and
   left hemidiaphragm elevation admitted with respiratory distress in the
   setting of fever and cough.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Patient has acute decompensation superimposed on chronic lung disease.
   No PFTs in OMR, but likely has predominantly restrictive physiology.
   Acute process may have been aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, viral
   infection, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation.  Contributors to his poor
   baseline lung function include COPD as well as severe scoliosis and
   left hemidiaphragm elevation.   On NPPV overnight, with only
   intermittent improvement in respiratory distress.
   - ? intubation
   - continue vanc/cefepime for possible aspiration vs health care
   associated pneumonia
   - would continue solumedrol and then transition to prednisone in
   tomorrow depending on clinical status
   - continue atrovent and albuterol nebs, standing q6 and prn
   - would repeat chest CT when more stable
   - obtain sputum Cx
   .
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):
   Possible sources include pneumonia, UTI, viral infection (such as
   influenza), pneumonitis, or C diff.  Does not report diarrhea, but has
   had significant C diff infections in the past.  Not history of
   quinolone resistant UTIs in the past.  Blood culture from ED now
   growing GPCs in clusters, although this could be contaminant.
   - Changed foley and repeat U/A neg
   - continue coverage with vanc and cefepime for now
   - f/u urine and blood cultures from the ED
   - influenza neg and tamiflu stopped
   - send sputum Cx and stool for C diff
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Likely due to respiratory distress and dehydration (he
   has concentrated urine, elevated BUN, and hct above baseline).
   Received gentle volume resuscitation and tachycardia improved.  UOP has
   been adequate at 30 cc/hr
   - continue gentle IV fluids for volume resuscitation; follow Uop
   - monitor
   .
   # Elevated cardiac biomarkers: CE negative with 2 sets 8 hours apart.
   EKG is reassuring and he denies chest pain.  Likely has some demand
   ischemia from respiratory distress and tachycardia.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved with repeat blood draws.
   .
 .H/O PARKINSON'S DISEASE
   - continue sinemet
   - continue hyoscyamine, presumably to decrease oral secretions
   .
   # AFib:  continue amiodarone; not on anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed
   .
   # ? h/o Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin and ASA
   .
   # h/o DVTs:
   - monitor exam given h/o line-associated and unprovoked DVTs in the
   past
   - not on anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed
   .
   # Anxiety:  ativan prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a history of COPD, scoliosis, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. He was admitted with respiratory distress, fever, and cough. The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia or viral infection. He requires noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and may need intubation. The patient also has a fever of unknown origin, which could be caused by pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), viral infection, or pneumonitis. He is currently being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for possible aspiration vs healthcare-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute decompensation of chronic lung disease, leading to respiratory failure. This may progress to severe respiratory distress requiring intubation.
2. Infection: The patient has a fever and positive blood cultures for GPCs in clusters, suggesting a possible infection. Further evaluation is needed to determine the source of infection.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and fever could be due to pneumonia, especially considering his history of COPD and scoliosis.
4. UTI: The patient's urine culture shows the presence of RBCs, WBCs, and yeast. This could indicate a urinary tract infection, which needs to be treated accordingly.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient had elevated potassium levels, which resolved after"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has been on BiPAP intermittently overnight and required aggressive suctioning. Foley catheter was changed and urine culture was sent. The patient's cardiac enzymes are flat, and blood culture is positive for aerobic gram-positive cocci in clusters. The patient has multiple drug allergies and is on various medications including lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. His review of systems remains unchanged from admission. Vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99-67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on aerosol-cool with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and cefepime, and chest CT has been planned but not yet ordered. Physical examination reveals leukocytosis with a WBC count of 7.0 K/uL and mild anemia with a Hct of 37.3%. Other lab results show elevated glucose levels at 164 mg/dL, decreased potassium at 3.3 mEq/L, and normal liver function tests. Urine dipstick after foley change shows the presence of blood but no nitrite, protein, glucose, ketone, bilirubin, or leukocytes."

   Assessment and Plan
   77yo gentleman with h/o COPD as well as restriction from scoliosis and
   left hemidiaphragm elevation admitted with respiratory distress in the
   setting of fever and cough.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Patient has acute decompensation superimposed on chronic lung disease.
   No PFTs in OMR, but likely has predominantly restrictive physiology.
   Acute process may have been aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, viral
   infection, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation.  Contributors to his poor
   baseline lung function include COPD as well as severe scoliosis and
   left hemidiaphragm elevation.   On NPPV overnight, with only
   intermittent improvement in respiratory distress.
   - will continue Bipap for now, but if unable to wean will likely
   proceed to intubation
   - ABG this AM
   - CXR this AM
   - continue vanc/cefepime for possible aspiration vs health care
   associated pneumonia
   - would continue solumedrol and then transition to prednisone in
   tomorrow depending on clinical status
   - continue atrovent and albuterol nebs, standing q6 and prn
   - would repeat chest CT when more stable
   - obtain sputum Cx
   - guafenesin, hyoscyamine to decrease oral secretions
   .
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):
   Possible sources include pneumonia, UTI, viral infection (such as
   influenza), pneumonitis, or C diff.  Does not report diarrhea, but has
   had significant C diff infections in the past.  Not history of
   quinolone resistant UTIs in the past.  Blood culture from ED now
   growing GPCs in clusters, although this could be contaminant.
   - Changed foley and repeat U/A neg
   - continue coverage with vanc and cefepime for now
   - f/u urine and blood cultures from the ED
   - influenza neg and tamiflu stopped
   - send sputum Cx and stool for C diff
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Likely due to respiratory distress and dehydration (he
   has concentrated urine, elevated BUN, and hct above baseline).
   Received gentle volume resuscitation and tachycardia improved.  UOP has
   been adequate at 30 cc/hr
   - continue gentle IV fluids for volume resuscitation; follow Uop
   - monitor
   .
   # Elevated cardiac biomarkers: CE negative with 2 sets 8 hours apart.
   EKG is reassuring and he denies chest pain.  Likely has some demand
   ischemia from respiratory distress and tachycardia.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved with repeat blood draws.
   .
 .H/O PARKINSON'S DISEASE
   - continue sinemet
   - continue hyoscyamine, presumably to decrease oral secretions
   .
   # AFib:  continue amiodarone; not on anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed
   .
   # ? h/o Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin and ASA
   .
   # h/o DVTs:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of COPD, scoliosis, and left hemidiaphragm elevation admitted for respiratory distress, fever, and cough. He has acute decompensation of chronic lung disease with possible aspiration pneumonia or viral infection. The patient required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) overnight with only intermittent improvement. He is currently on BiPAP, and if unable to wean, intubation may be considered. The patient also has fever, tachycardia, hyperkalemia, and elevated cardiac biomarkers. He is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for possible aspiration or healthcare-associated pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute decompensation of chronic lung disease may lead to worsening respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest possible aspiration pneumonia or viral infection, which can progress and become severe if not treated appropriately.
3. Cardiac complications: The elevated cardiac biomarkers indicate possible myocardial injury, and the patient's tachycardia could be a sign of cardiac distress. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent further cardiac complications.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels should be closely monitored and managed to avoid potential cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The presence of fever and positive blood cultures indicates an ongoing infection"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic aspiration, and Parkinson's disease. He is currently in the ICU due to fevers, respiratory failure, hypoxemia, tachycardia, transient hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and elevated cardiac enzymes.

The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and COPD exacerbation, which are likely contributing to his current condition. The physician has prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics for a suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia, as well as urinary source. The specific antibiotics prescribed include vancomycin and cefepime.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 120/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on BiPAP. His physical examination reveals wheezes on expiration, diminished peripheral pulses, right lower extremity edema, and chronic skin changes.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 156 K/uL, elevated potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, and elevated troponin-T level at 29 mg/dL. Other lab values, including hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes, are within normal range.

The patient is currently on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and may require intubation for adequate pulmonary toilet. The physician plans to repeat a chest X-ray and arterial blood gas analysis, obtain a CT chest once intubated, and assess the patient's condition closely.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of oxygenation, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, and potential need for invasive mechanical ventilation. The patient's underlying COPD may make extubation challenging. Close monitoring and prompt intervention will be necessary to manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   77yo gentleman with h/o COPD as well as restriction from scoliosis and
   left hemidiaphragm elevation admitted with respiratory distress in the
   setting of fever and cough.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Patient has acute decompensation superimposed on chronic lung disease.
   No PFTs in OMR, but likely has predominantly restrictive physiology.
   Acute process may have been aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, viral
   infection, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation.  Contributors to his poor
   baseline lung function include COPD as well as severe scoliosis and
   left hemidiaphragm elevation.   On NPPV overnight, with only
   intermittent improvement in respiratory distress.
   - will continue Bipap for now as needed; patient would like to avoid
   intubation
   - Consider ABG depending on patient respiratory status
   - CXR this AM
   - continue vanc/cefepime for possible aspiration vs health care
   associated pneumonia
   - Transition to prednisone today from solumedrol if patient continues
   to improve
   - continue atrovent and albuterol nebs, standing q6 and prn
   - would repeat chest CT when more stable
   - obtain sputum Cx
   - guafenesin, hyoscyamine to decrease oral secretions
   .
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):
   Possible sources include pneumonia, UTI, viral infection (such as
   influenza), pneumonitis, or C diff.  Does not report diarrhea, but has
   had significant C diff infections in the past.  Not history of
   quinolone resistant UTIs in the past.  Blood culture from ED now
   growing GPCs in clusters, although this could be contaminant.  Max temp
   in 24 hours is 37.2
   - Changed foley and repeat U/A neg; urine cultures pending
   - continue coverage with vanc and cefepime for now
   - f/u urine and blood cultures from the ED
   - influenza neg and tamiflu stopped
   - send sputum Cx and stool for C diff
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Likely due to respiratory distress and dehydration (he
   has concentrated urine, elevated BUN, and hct above baseline).
   Received gentle volume resuscitation and tachycardia improved.  UOP has
   been adequate at 30 cc/hr.  HR this morning in the 70s.
   - continue gentle IV fluids for volume resuscitation; follow Uop
   - monitor
   .
   # Elevated cardiac biomarkers: CE negative with 2 sets 8 hours apart.
   EKG is reassuring and he denies chest pain.  Likely has some demand
   ischemia from respiratory distress and tachycardia.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved with repeat blood draws.
   .
 .H/O PARKINSON'S DISEASE
   - continue sinemet
   - continue hyoscyamine, presumably to decrease oral secretions
   .
   # AFib:  continue amiodarone; not on anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed
   .
   # ? h/o Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin and ASA
   .
   # h/o DVTs:

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   77yo gentleman with h/o COPD as well as restriction from scoliosis and
   left hemidiaphragm elevation admitted with respiratory distress in the
   setting of fever and cough.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Patient has acute decompensation superimposed on chronic lung disease.
   No PFTs in OMR, but likely has predominantly restrictive physiology.
   Acute process may have been aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, viral
   infection, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation.  Contributors to his poor
   baseline lung function include COPD as well as severe scoliosis and
   left hemidiaphragm elevation.   On NPPV overnight, with only
   intermittent improvement in respiratory distress.
   - will continue Bipap for now as needed; patient would like to avoid
   intubation
   - Consider ABG depending on patient respiratory status
   - CXR this AM
   - continue vanc/cefepime for possible aspiration vs health care
   associated pneumonia
   - Transition to prednisone today from solumedrol if patient continues
   to improve
   - continue atrovent and albuterol nebs, standing q6 and prn
   - would repeat chest CT when more stable
   - obtain sputum Cx
   - guafenesin, hyoscyamine to decrease oral secretions
   .
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):
   Possible sources include pneumonia, UTI, viral infection (such as
   influenza), pneumonitis, or C diff.  Does not report diarrhea, but has
   had significant C diff infections in the past.  Not history of
   quinolone resistant UTIs in the past.  Blood culture from ED now
   growing GPCs in clusters, although this could be contaminant.  Max temp
   in 24 hours is 37.2
   - Changed foley and repeat U/A neg; urine cultures pending
   - continue coverage with vanc and cefepime for now
   - f/u urine and blood cultures from the ED
   - influenza neg and tamiflu stopped
   - send sputum Cx and stool for C diff
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Likely due to respiratory distress and dehydration (he
   has concentrated urine, elevated BUN, and hct above baseline).
   Received gentle volume resuscitation and tachycardia improved.  UOP has
   been adequate at 30 cc/hr.  HR this morning in the 70s.
   - continue gentle IV fluids for volume resuscitation; follow Uop
   - monitor
   .
   # Elevated cardiac biomarkers: CE negative with 2 sets 8 hours apart.
   EKG is reassuring and he denies chest pain.  Likely has some demand
   ischemia from respiratory distress and tachycardia.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved with repeat blood draws.
   .
 .H/O PARKINSON'S DISEASE
   - continue sinemet
   - continue hyoscyamine, presumably to decrease oral secretions
   .
   # AFib:  continue amiodarone; not on anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed
   .
   # ? h/o Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin and ASA
   .
   # h/o DVTs:

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), scoliosis, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. He was admitted with respiratory distress, fever, and cough. The patient has been experiencing intermittent improvement with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) but prefers to avoid intubation. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 125/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's blood cultures are growing gram-positive cocci in clusters, which could indicate a possible bacterial infection. He has been receiving vancomycin and cefepime for potential aspiration pneumonia or healthcare-associated pneumonia. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and further tests such as sputum culture, chest X-ray, and stool for Clostridium difficile toxin are pending. The potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, fever, tachycardia, elevated cardiac biomarkers, hyperkalemia, anxiety, and other comorbidities such as Parkinson's disease, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.41, pCO2 of 41, and pO2 of 149, indicating a respiratory alkalosis with hypoxemia. The patient's condition is worsening, and there is concern for possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease and is currently on a face tent with supplemental oxygen. He is being monitored closely in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed. Continuous monitoring and support, such as the use of a face tent and supplemental oxygen, will be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the worsening condition and low oxygen levels, there is a risk of developing ARDS, a severe form of lung injury that can lead to respiratory failure. Close monitoring and prompt intervention will be crucial in preventing or managing ARDS.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. Cultures should be obtained to identify the causative organism and appropriate antibiotics should be initiated promptly.
4. Thromboembolic Events: Immobility in the ICU increases the risk of blood clots, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Patient has acute decompensation superimposed on chronic lung disease.
   No PFTs in OMR, but likely has predominantly restrictive physiology.
   Acute process may have been aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, viral
   infection, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation.  Contributors to his poor
   baseline lung function include COPD as well as severe scoliosis and
   left hemidiaphragm elevation.   On NPPV overnight, with only
   intermittent improvement in respiratory distress.
   - will continue Bipap for now as needed; patient would like to avoid
   intubation
   - Consider ABG depending on patient respiratory status
   - CXR this AM
   - continue vanc/cefepime for possible aspiration vs health care
   associated pneumonia
   - Transition to prednisone today from solumedrol if patient continues
   to improve
   - continue atrovent and albuterol nebs, standing q6 and prn
   - would repeat chest CT when more stable
   - obtain sputum Cx
   - guafenesin, hyoscyamine to decrease oral secretions
   .
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):
   Possible sources include pneumonia, UTI, viral infection (such as
   influenza), pneumonitis, or C diff.  Does not report diarrhea, but has
   had significant C diff infections in the past.  Not history of
   quinolone resistant UTIs in the past.  Blood culture from ED now
   growing GPCs in clusters, although this could be contaminant.  Max temp
   in 24 hours is 37.2
   - Changed foley and repeat U/A neg; urine cultures pending
   - continue coverage with vanc and cefepime for now
   - f/u urine and blood cultures from the ED
   - influenza neg and tamiflu stopped
   - send sputum Cx and stool for C diff
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Likely due to respiratory distress and dehydration (he
   has concentrated urine, elevated BUN, and hct above baseline).
   Received gentle volume resuscitation and tachycardia improved.  UOP has
   been adequate at 30 cc/hr.  HR this morning in the 70s.
   - continue gentle IV fluids for volume resuscitation; follow Uop
   - monitor
   .
   # Elevated cardiac biomarkers: CE negative with 2 sets 8 hours apart.
   EKG is reassuring and he denies chest pain.  Likely has some demand
   ischemia from respiratory distress and tachycardia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a history of COPD, scoliosis, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. He was admitted with respiratory distress, fever, and cough. The patient has acute decompensation of chronic lung disease, likely due to aspiration pneumonia or viral infection. He has been on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) overnight with intermittent improvement in respiratory distress. The patient's baseline lung function is poor due to COPD, scoliosis, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. He wants to avoid intubation but is aware that he may need to be intubated if he becomes actively dying and cannot breathe on his own. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C, blood pressure ranging from 125/62 to 136/83 mmHg, heart rate between 85 and 100 bpm, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 7.0-7.9 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and positive Legionella antigen test. The patient's blood culture is growing gram-positive cocci in clusters, which could be a contaminant or indicate a bacterial infection. The patient's urine output is adequate at 30 cc/hr, and his central venous pressure is within normal limits. The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and deep vein thrombosis. He is on various medications including Bipap, vanc/cefepime, prednisone, atrovent, albuterol nebs, sinemet, hyoscyamine, amiodarone, statin, ASA, and heparin SC TID for DVT prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU. Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, Clostridium difficile infection, and cardiac ischemia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a history of presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and scoliosis, admitted with respiratory distress, fever, and cough. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management of his condition.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient has acute decompensation of his underlying lung disease. His respiratory failure may be due to aspiration pneumonia, viral infection, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation. Factors contributing to poor lung function include COPD, severe scoliosis, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. He is currently on intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) and may require intubation if his respiratory status worsens.
2. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): Possible sources of fever include pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), viral infection (such as influenza), pneumonitis, or Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has had significant C. diff infections in the past but does not currently report diarrhea. Blood culture from the emergency department (ED) is growing gram-positive cocci in clusters, although this could be a contaminant. Max temperature in the past 24 hours is 37.2.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is likely elevated due to respiratory distress and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of COPD, left hemidiaphragm elevation, prior left lobectomy, chronic aspiration, and Parkinson's disease. He presents with fever, respiratory failure requiring noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), hypoxemia (probable aspiration pneumonia and COPD flare), tachycardia, transient hypotension, elevated cardiac enzymes with probable demand ischemia (now resolved), and hyperkalemia (resolved). The patient is suspected to have aspiration pneumonia and COPD exacerbation, which are the primary issues leading to his presentation. He also has polymicrobial urinary tract infection (UTI). His respiratory status is slowly improving, although he remains tenuous. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of chronic aspiration increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and potentially death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD can worsen due to the current respiratory issues. This may result in increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, and potential respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. UTI: The presence of a polymicrobial UTI increases the risk of systemic infection and sepsis. It is essential to treat the infection appropriately to prevent complications.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and resolved demand"

s ds presents with fever, tachycardia, transient hypotension
   and resp distress/failure requiring NPPV.  Suspect aspiration
   pna/pneumonitis and possible copd exacerbation are the primary issues
   leading to this presentation in a pt with significant underlying lung

   physiology from kyphosis and chronic L hemid elevation.  Also with
   polymicrobial UTI.
   --His resp status is improving though he remains tenuous.
   Agree with plan to continue day 2 empiric antbx for possible NH
   acquired pna/asp and UTI  w/ vanco/cefe, tailoring per cx data.  Now
   with
 GPC clusters from blood (likely a contaminant).  CXR suggests
   vascular congestions, and wheezing on exam may be in part related to
   pulm edema likely from IVFs and tachycardia at presentation.  Would
   diruese gently.  Unclear if pt truly has copd, as suspect restriction
   is the primary lung physiology, though no PFTs and is clinically
   responding to treatment. Would continue nebs and steroids, tapering
   over the next few days. Will wean supp O2 as he is now appearing more
   comfortable off NPPV. He remains HD stable with resolution of
   presenting hypotension and tachycardia.. Can restart TFs. ICU: PIVs,
   PPI, sq hep.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old male nursing home resident with a history of COPD, left hemidiaphragm elevation, chronic aspiration, and Parkinson's disease. He presented with fever, tachycardia, transient hypotension, and respiratory distress/failure requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). The patient is suspected to have aspiration pneumonia and possible COPD exacerbation. He also has a polymicrobial urinary tract infection (UTI).

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he remains tenuous. The plan includes continuing day 2 empiric antibiotics for possible nursing home-acquired pneumonia and UTI with vancomycin and cefepime, tailoring the treatment based on chest X-ray data. Nebulizers and steroids will be continued, tapering over the next few days. Supplemental oxygen will be weaned as the patient appears more comfortable off NPPV. The patient remains hemodynamically stable with resolution of presenting hypotension and tachycardia. Tube feeding can be restarted. In the ICU, the patient will have peripheral intravenous lines, peritoneal lavage, and subcutaneous heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's risk factors include chronic aspiration and COPD. Improving respiratory status indicates positive response to treatment.
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient's symptoms may be related to underlying restrictive pulmonary"

   77yo gentleman with h/o presumed COPD as well as restriction from
   scoliosis and left hemidiaphragm elevation admitted with respiratory
   distress in the setting of fever and cough.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Patient has acute decompensation superimposed on chronic lung disease.
   No PFTs in OMR, but likely has predominantly restrictive physiology.
   Acute process may have been aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, viral
   infection, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation.  Contributors to his poor
   baseline lung function include COPD as well as severe scoliosis and
   left hemidiaphragm elevation.   Only on intermittent BIPAP overnight,
   now on facemask
   - Wean to nasal cannula as tolerated
   - No need to repeat ABG as respiratory status continues to improve
   - continue vanc/cefepime for possible aspiration vs health care
   associated pneumonia
   - Start prednisone 60mg QD; d/c solumedrol
   - continue atrovent and albuterol nebs, standing q6 and prn
   - Can consider repeating CT chest when more stable to evaluate
   underlying disease
   - Follow-up sputum culture speciation
   - guafenesin, hyoscyamine to decrease oral secretions
   .
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):
   Possible sources include pneumonia, UTI, viral infection (such as
   influenza), pneumonitis, or C diff.  Does not report diarrhea, but has
   had significant C diff infections in the past.  Not history of
   quinolone resistant UTIs in the past.  Blood culture from ED now
   growing GPCs in clusters, although this could be contaminant.  Max temp
   in 24 hours is 37.2
   - Urine culture consistent with fecal contamination
   - continue coverage with vanc and cefepime for now
   - f/u urine and blood cultures from the ED
   - influenza neg and tamiflu stopped
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Likely due to respiratory distress and dehydration (he
   has concentrated urine, elevated BUN, and hct above baseline).
   Received gentle volume resuscitation and tachycardia improved.  UOP has
   been adequate at 30 cc/hr.  HR this morning in the 70s.
   - continue gentle IV fluids for volume resuscitation; follow Uop
   - monitor
   .
   # Elevated cardiac biomarkers: CE negative with 2 sets 8 hours apart.
   EKG is reassuring and he denies chest pain.  Likely has some demand
   ischemia from respiratory distress and tachycardia.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved with repeat blood draws.
   .
 .H/O PARKINSON'S DISEASE
   - continue sinemet
   - continue hyoscyamine, presumably to decrease oral secretions
   .
   # AFib:  continue amiodarone; not on anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed
   .
   # ? h/o Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin and ASA

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), scoliosis, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. He was admitted with respiratory distress, fever, and cough. The patient has acute respiratory failure not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). His respiratory status continues to improve, and he is currently on a face mask with intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) support. 

The patient's fever is likely due to pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), viral infection such as influenza, pneumonitis, or Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection. Blood culture from the emergency department (ED) is growing Gram-positive cocci in clusters, although this could be a contaminant. Urine culture is consistent with fecal contamination, and both blood and urine cultures from the ED should be followed up.

The patient's tachycardia is likely due to respiratory distress and dehydration. Gentle volume resuscitation has improved his tachycardia, and his heart rate this morning is in the 70s. Continuous gentle IV fluids for volume resuscitation should be continued, and urine output should be monitored.

   77yo gentleman with h/o presumed COPD as well as restriction from
   scoliosis and left hemidiaphragm elevation admitted with respiratory
   distress in the setting of fever and cough.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Patient has acute decompensation superimposed on chronic lung disease.
   No PFTs in OMR, but likely has predominantly restrictive physiology.
   Acute process may have been aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, viral
   infection, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation.  Contributors to his poor
   baseline lung function include COPD as well as severe scoliosis and
   left hemidiaphragm elevation.   Only on intermittent BIPAP overnight,
   now on facemask
   - Wean to nasal cannula as tolerated
   - No need to repeat ABG as respiratory status continues to improve
   - continue vanc/cefepime for possible aspiration vs health care
   associated pneumonia
   - Start prednisone 60mg QD; d/c solumedrol
   - continue atrovent and albuterol nebs, standing q6 and prn
   - Can consider repeating CT chest when more stable to evaluate
   underlying disease
   - Follow-up sputum culture speciation
   - guafenesin, hyoscyamine to decrease oral secretions
   .
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):
   Possible sources include pneumonia, UTI, viral infection (such as
   influenza), pneumonitis, or C diff.  Does not report diarrhea, but has
   had significant C diff infections in the past.  Not history of
   quinolone resistant UTIs in the past.  Blood culture from ED now
   growing GPCs in clusters, although this could be contaminant.  Max temp
   in 24 hours is 37.2
   - Urine culture consistent with fecal contamination
   - continue coverage with vanc and cefepime for now
   - f/u urine and blood cultures from the ED
   - influenza neg and tamiflu stopped
   - send sputum Cx and stool for C diff
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Likely due to respiratory distress and dehydration (he
   has concentrated urine, elevated BUN, and hct above baseline).
   Received gentle volume resuscitation and tachycardia improved.  UOP has
   been adequate at 30 cc/hr.  HR this morning in the 70s.
   - continue gentle IV fluids for volume resuscitation; follow Uop
   - monitor
   .
   # Elevated cardiac biomarkers: CE negative with 2 sets 8 hours apart.
   EKG is reassuring and he denies chest pain.  Likely has some demand
   ischemia from respiratory distress and tachycardia.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved with repeat blood draws.
   .
 .H/O PARKINSON'S DISEASE
   - continue sinemet
   - continue hyoscyamine, presumably to decrease oral secretions
   .
   # AFib:  continue amiodarone; not on anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed
   .
   # ? h/o Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin and ASA
   .
   # h/o DVTs:

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), scoliosis, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. He was admitted with respiratory distress, fever, and cough. The patient has been on intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) and is now on a face mask. His respiratory status continues to improve, so there is no need to repeat an arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for possible aspiration versus healthcare-associated pneumonia. He is also receiving prednisone, atrovent, and albuterol nebs. The patient's fever is likely due to pneumonia or a viral infection. Blood cultures from the emergency department are growing gram-positive cocci in clusters, although this could be a contaminant. The patient's tachycardia is likely due to respiratory distress and dehydration. He received gentle volume resuscitation and his tachycardia improved. The patient's elevated cardiac biomarkers are likely due to demand ischemia from respiratory distress and tachycardia. Hyperkalemia has resolved with repeat blood draws. The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is currently being treated for anxiety with ativan. The patient is on strict nothing by mouth (NPO) status, holding tube feeds while considering intubation. He is also on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a history of presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), scoliosis, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. He was admitted with respiratory distress, fever, and cough. 

The patient has acute respiratory failure not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He likely has predominantly restrictive physiology due to severe scoliosis and left hemidiaphragm elevation, in addition to his COPD. The acute process may have been caused by aspiration pneumonia, viral infection, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation. The patient was previously on intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) and is now on a face mask. 

The patient's respiratory status continues to improve, so there is no need to repeat the arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. A chest X-ray (CXR) is planned for today. The patient will continue to receive vancomycin and cefepime for possible aspiration versus healthcare-associated pneumonia. Prednisone will be transitioned from solumedrol if the patient continues to improve. 

The patient has a fever, but the source is not yet identified. Possible sources include pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), viral infection (such as influenza), pneumonitis, or Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has had significant C. difficile infections in the past. Blood culture from the emergency department is growing gram-positive cocci in clusters, although this could be a contaminant"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a history of presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and scoliosis, admitted for respiratory distress. He presented with fever and cough. The patient has acute respiratory failure not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely due to an aspiration pneumonia or viral infection. He is currently on a face mask for respiratory support and being weaned off intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP).

The patient also has a fever, possibly caused by pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), viral infection such as influenza, pneumonitis, or Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Blood cultures have shown growth of Gram-positive cocci in clusters, which could be a contaminant or indicate a bacterial infection. Urine culture is consistent with fecal contamination.

Other assessments include tachycardia, likely due to respiratory distress and dehydration, elevated cardiac biomarkers possibly from demand ischemia, hyperkalemia that resolved with repeat blood draws, and a history of Parkinson's disease, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and anxiety.

Plan:

1. Continue vancomycin and cefepime for possible aspiration versus healthcare-associated pneumonia.
2. Start prednisone 60mg once daily; discontinue solumedrol.
3. Continue atrovent and albuterol nebs every six hours and"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Patient has acute decompensation superimposed on chronic lung disease.
   No PFTs in OMR, but likely has predominantly restrictive physiology.
   Acute process may have been aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, viral
   infection, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation.  Contributors to his poor
   baseline lung function include COPD as well as severe scoliosis and
   left hemidiaphragm elevation.   Only on intermittent BIPAP overnight,
   now on facemask
   - Wean to nasal cannula as tolerated
   - No need to repeat ABG as respiratory status continues to improve
   - continue vanc/cefepime for possible aspiration vs health care
   associated pneumonia
   - Start prednisone 60mg QD; d/c solumedrol
   - continue atrovent and albuterol nebs, standing q6 and prn

","Summary:
- 77-year-old male with a history of presumed COPD, scoliosis, and left hemidiaphragm elevation admitted with respiratory distress, fever, and cough.
- Diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), due to acute decompensation on chronic lung disease.
- Possible sources of fever include pneumonia, UTI, viral infection, pneumonitis, or COPD exacerbation.
- Blood culture from ED growing GPCs in clusters, but this could be a contaminant.
- Influenza tests negative.
- Elevated cardiac biomarkers, but CE negative with 2 sets 8 hours apart.
- Hyperkalemia resolved with repeat blood draws.
- Patient has Parkinson's disease, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and history of DVTs.
- Currently on vanc/cefepime, prednisone, atrovent, and albuterol nebs.
- Plan to wean off nasal cannula, continue facemask, and consider repeating CT chest when more stable.
- Follow-up sputum culture speciation and guafenesin/hyoscyamine to decrease oral secretions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute decompensation on chronic lung disease increases the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever and cough suggest a possible infection, such as pneumonia.
3. UTI"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a history of presumed COPD, scoliosis, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. He was admitted with respiratory distress, fever, and cough. The patient has acute decompensation of chronic lung disease, likely due to aspiration pneumonia or viral infection. He is currently on a facemask and being weaned to a nasal cannula as tolerated.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, and there is no need to repeat the ABG. He will continue on vanc/cefepime for possible aspiration versus healthcare-associated pneumonia. Prednisone 60mg QD will be started, and solumedrol will be discontinued. Nebulized atrovent and albuterol will be given q6 and as needed. A repeat CT chest may be considered when the patient is more stable to evaluate underlying disease. Follow-up sputum culture speciation will also be done.

The patient has a fever, but it is not high-grade. Possible sources of the fever include pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), viral infection (such as influenza), pneumonitis, or Clostridium difficile (C diff) infection. The patient does not report diarrhea, but he has had significant C diff infections in the past. Blood culture from the ED is growing Gram-positive cocci in clusters, although this could be a contaminant. Urine culture shows pseudomonas and E. Coli as"

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a history of presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), scoliosis, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. He was admitted with respiratory distress, fever, and cough. The assessment and plan indicate that the patient has acute respiratory failure not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been placed on intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) and later transitioned to a facemask. 

The patient's respiratory status continues to improve, so there is no need to repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. He will continue receiving vancomycin and cefepime for possible aspiration versus healthcare-associated pneumonia. Prednisone 60mg daily will be started, and solumedrol will be discontinued. Nebulizations with atrovent and albuterol will be given every six hours and as needed. A follow-up sputum culture speciation will be done, and a repeat CT chest scan may be considered when the patient is more stable to evaluate underlying disease.

The patient also has a fever, which could be due to pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), viral infection (such as influenza), pneumonitis, or Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. He does not report diarrhea but has had significant C. diff infections in the past. Blood culture from the emergency department is growing gram-positive cocci in clusters, although this could be a contamin"

Blood cultures are growing GPCs in clusters, and urine culture shows pseudomonas and E. coli. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued. The patient's tachycardia is likely due to respiratory distress and dehydration. Gentle fluid resuscitation has improved his heart rate. His elevated cardiac biomarkers are no longer an acute issue. He has hyperkalemia, which has resolved. The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, deep vein thrombosis, and anxiety.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Patient has acute decompensation superimposed on chronic lung disease.
   No PFTs in OMR, but likely has predominantly restrictive physiology.
   Acute process may have been aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, viral
   infection, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation.  Contributors to his poor
   baseline lung function include COPD as well as severe scoliosis and
   left hemidiaphragm elevation.  Has not required BiPAP for over 48 hrs,
   now on nasal cannula.

","The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a history of presumed COPD, scoliosis, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. He was admitted with respiratory distress, fever, and cough. The patient has acute respiratory failure due to an acute decompensation of his chronic lung disease. The underlying cause could be aspiration pneumonia, viral infection, pneumonia, or a COPD exacerbation. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/50 to 146/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. 

His physical examination reveals coarse central rhonchi and central expiratory wheezes, decreased sounds on the left side, faint heart sounds, and a soft non-tender abdomen. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15700 uL, elevated hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, elevated glucose level of 164 mg/dL, and elevated potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L. Imaging studies indicate left hemithorax opacification on the chest X-ray. 

The patient's medical history includes Parkinson's disease, atrial fibrillation, anxiety, hyperlipidemia, deep vein thrombosis, and a gastrointestinal bleed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15700/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 35 mg/dL, elevated creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 5.6 mEq/L. Imaging shows complete opacification of the left hemithorax on chest X-ray, suggesting a possible mucus plug or pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic aspiration, Parkinson's disease, and left hemiplegia. He presented with fever, tachycardia, transient hypotension, and respiratory distress requiring noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). The primary issues leading to this presentation are suspected aspiration pneumonia and possible COPD exacerbation, due to significant underlying lung disease. He also has a polymicrobial urinary tract infection (UTI). His respiratory status has improved but remains tenuous, with stable oxygen saturation on nasal cannula. Imaging shows opacification of the left lung, concerning for intermittent plugging. The plan is to continue empiric antibiotics for nursing home-acquired pneumonia and UTI with cefepime, and discontinue vancomycin given no MRSA from sputum and blood culture likely being a contaminant. The patient will be diuresed gently, continue nebulizers, mucomyst, and aggressive chest physiotherapy. Consider bronchoscopy if the lung does not re-expand, but given his respiratory stability, will try less invasive approaches for now. Unclear if the patient truly has COPD, as suspected restriction is the primary lung physiology, though no pulmonary function tests on record and is clinically responding to treatment.

   Assessment and Plan
   77yo gentleman with h/o presumed COPD as well as restriction from
   scoliosis and left hemidiaphragm elevation admitted with respiratory
   distress in the setting of fever and cough.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Patient has acute decompensation superimposed on chronic lung disease
   (COPD).  Acute process may have been aspiration pneumonia vs
   pneumonitis, mild pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation.
   Contributors to his poor baseline lung function include COPD as well as
   severe scoliosis and left hemidiaphragm elevation.  Has not required
   BiPAP for the past 3 days, now satting well on room air.
   - Pseudomonas in sputum sensitive to cipro (intermediate to cefepime);
   will start cipro today for a total of 10 days (today is day #6 of
   antibiotics)
   - chest PT to loosen up secretions and help with possible plugging.
   - Slowly wean prednisone 60mg today, 40mg tomorrow
   - continue atrovent and albuterol nebs, standing q6 and prn
   - guafenesin, hyoscyamine to decrease oral secretions
   - Consider call out to floor today if stable
   .
   #URINARY TRACT INFECTION:  Pseudomonas sensitive to cefepime
   - Continue cefepime for a total 7 day course (started on [**1-27**], today
   is day#4)
   # Elevated cardiac biomarkers: No longer acute issue
   EKG is reassuring and he denies chest pain.  Likely has some demand
   ischemia from respiratory distress and tachycardia.
   .
   .
 .H/O PARKINSON'S DISEASE
   - continue sinemet
   - continue hyoscyamine, presumably to decrease oral secretions
   .
   # AFib:  continue amiodarone; not on anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed
   .
   # ? h/o Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin and ASA
   .
   # h/o DVTs:
   - monitor exam given h/o line-associated and unprovoked DVTs in the
   past
   - On subcu heparin

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient's sputum grew pseudomonas, leading to the discontinuation of vancomycin and initiation of cefepime. The patient received Lasix and had a fluid balance of -500 mL at midnight. Steroids were started due to high FSG levels. The patient has multiple allergies, including sulfa, hydantoins, trimethadione/paramethadione, phenacemide, barbiturates, primidone, and gadolinium-containing agents. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was cefepime on 01/28/2167 at 03:26 PM, and vancomycin on 01/29/2167 at 08:25 AM. The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium and furosemide infusions. The review of systems remains unchanged except for respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/57 to 130/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's weight remains the same as at admission. Fluid intake and output are documented, with a total input of 1658 mL and total output of 228"

   Assessment and Plan
   77yo gentleman with h/o presumed COPD as well as restriction from
   scoliosis and left hemidiaphragm elevation admitted with respiratory
   distress in the setting of fever and cough.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Patient has acute decompensation superimposed on chronic lung disease.
   No PFTs in OMR, but likely has predominantly restrictive physiology.
   Acute process may have been aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, mild
   pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation.  Contributors to his
   poor baseline lung function include COPD as well as severe scoliosis
   and left hemidiaphragm elevation.  Has not required BiPAP for the past
   3 days, now on nasal cannula.  His CXR remains concerning for white-out
   of left lung, ? mucus plugging.
   - continue cefepime for possible aspiration vs health care associated
   pneumonia, today day [**7-16**].  Discontinued vanc as sputum and urine
   sensitive to cefepime.
   - gentle diuresis as tolerated, goal -1L today.
   - chest PT to loosen up secretions and help with possible plugging.
   - Slowly wean prednisone; 40mg today
   - continue atrovent and albuterol nebs, standing q6 and prn
   - Can consider repeating CT chest when more stable to evaluate
   underlying disease
   - guafenesin, hyoscyamine to decrease oral secretions
   - Consider call out to floor today if stable
   .
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN): No longer
   active issue
   Possible sources include pneumonia, UTI, viral infection (such as
   influenza), pneumonitis, or C diff.  Does not report diarrhea, but has
   had significant C diff infections in the past.  Not history of
   quinolone resistant UTIs in the past.  Blood culture from ED now
   growing GPCs in clusters, although this could be contaminant.  Now
   afebrile x 3 days
   - Continue cefepime for now
   - influenza neg and tamiflu stopped
   #URINARY TRACT INFECTION:  Pseudomonas sensitive to cefepime
   - Continue cefepime
   # Elevated cardiac biomarkers: No longer acute issue
   EKG is reassuring and he denies chest pain.  Likely has some demand
   ischemia from respiratory distress and tachycardia.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved with repeat blood draws.
   .
 .H/O PARKINSON'S DISEASE
   - continue sinemet
   - continue hyoscyamine, presumably to decrease oral secretions
   .
   # AFib:  continue amiodarone; not on anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed
   .
   # ? h/o Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin and ASA
   .
   # h/o DVTs:
   - monitor exam given h/o line-associated and unprovoked DVTs in the
   past
   - not on anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed.  Just on SC heparin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 77-year-old male with a history of presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and scoliosis, was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient also has a history of restriction from scoliosis and left hemidiaphragm elevation. The initial assessment suggests acute respiratory failure not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's baseline lung function is compromised due to COPD, severe scoliosis, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. The chest X-ray shows white-out of the left lung, possibly indicating mucus plugging.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient has acute decompensation of chronic lung disease, likely due to aspiration pneumonia, mild pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation. This is supported by the presence of white-out on the chest X-ray, indicating possible mucus plugging.
2. Fever (Hyperthermia, Pyrexia): The patient initially had a fever, which is now resolved. Possible sources of fever include pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), viral infection such as influenza, pneumonitis, or Clostridium difficile (C diff) infection. Blood culture from the emergency department is growing Gram-positive cocci in clusters, although this could be a contaminant.
3. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a UTI caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of COPD, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, scoliosis, and Parkinson's disease. He was admitted with respiratory distress due to pneumonia and was initially on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The patient's allergies are to sulfa, hydantoins, trimethadione/paramethadione, phenacemide, barbiturates, and gadolinium-containing agents. The last dose of antibiotics was cefepime on 01/28 at 03:26 PM, and vancomycin was given on 01/29 at 08:25 AM. The patient is currently receiving furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. He is also on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, simvastatin, ASA, lansoprazole, albuterol/atrovent nebs, and a prednisone taper.

24-hour events include the administration of Lasix. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/95 to 130/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for coughing.
