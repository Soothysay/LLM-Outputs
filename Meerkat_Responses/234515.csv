   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Patient is an 81 yo man with pmhx CAD s/p CABG, recent NSTEMI,
   HTN, CKD here for ERCP now with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: In PACU received 500 cc LR and neo gtt. Patient
   persistently hypotensive. Transferred to Unit. CVL placed. CVP 12-17 on
   arrival so speaks against volume depletion and patient did not lose any
   blood during procedure per anesthesia. Hematocrit stable from yesterday
   and no e/o active bleeding.  Possibilities for hypotension include
   sepsis given white count 46, fever, biliary source. Another possibility
   is cardiogenic given recent NSTEMI and known CHF with EF 35%. No
   evidence of tamponade on ekg and patient does not have muffled heart
   sounds or elev JVD.  Yesterday patient had evidence of demand ischemia.
   - as patient is full code and not with too large of oxygen requirement
   will tolerate moderate pulmonary edema as long as sats okay => will
   order 500 cc bolus of NS and consider additional boluses as needed
   (current CVP 10-12)
   -continue to treat biliary sepsis with vanc and zosyn
 vanc trough
   this AM is 15 so will re-order more vanco this morning
   - blood culture no growth to date
   - sputum culture is contaminated, will have to order another one
   - UA with mod leukocyte esterase, negative nitrate, mod bacteria, urine
   culture pending however zosyn should cover potential urinary source of
   infection
   -BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes initially > 1, now trending down to 0.7 as is CK
   - echo ordered, not yet complete
   - off of neo gtt
   - use dopamine drip for iontropic effect, will tolerate lower MAP as
   patient is tachycardic and trying to not whip the heart if possible
   -cvo2 is 68, crit > 30 so no need for transfusion at this time, would
   consider blood if crit < 25
   .
   # Cholangitis: p/t is s/p ERCP. Elevated white count which has improved
   since yesterday. Patient is currently afebrile x 24 hours.
   -ERCP recs initially to hold asa and plavix, however after event of
   last night, discussed with them need to re-start aspiring and plavix
   and heparin which they are okay with
   -npo for now
   -LFTs are trending down, will continue to follow daily
   -cont zosyn and vanco for now for biliary sepsis
   .
   # CAD: Patient with recent NSTEMI and hypotension. EKG initially
   unchanged but then with concordance of ST depression in V4 in the
   setting of Left anterior fascilar block.
   -echo ordered which is pending
   -cardiac enzymes trending down, max troponin > 1
   -continue on aspirin and plavix and heparin
   .
   # CHF: Patient with EF 35%. Hold lasix given hypotension. CXR with mild
   vol overload but patient maintaining sats with supplemental oxygen.
   - will tolerate some fluid overload in the setting of sepsis as long as
   maintains adequate oxygenation, as patient is full code always able to
   intubate as neede
   - dopamine for pressor support
   .
   # HTN: currently hypotensive, hold bp meds
   .
   # AoCRF: creatinine current trending down still >4. Likely pre-renal or
   atn as patient is likely septic and was getting diuresed. Hold off on
   diuresis for now.  Ordered urine lytes.
   -calculate Feurea today
   -avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -monitor UO
   .
   # BPH:
   hold hytrin given hypotension
   .
   # Macular degeneration: not on any eye gtts, has previously had
   injections with some success.
   .
   # FEN: 500 cc bolus NS, no lasix given blood pressure, replete lytes
   prn, okay to have ice chips
   .
   # PPx: protonix, iv heparin
   .
   # Access: PIV x 2, RIJ and A-line

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and macular degeneration. The patient presented to the hospital for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and is now experiencing hypotension. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating possible infection. The patient's cardiac enzymes are also elevated, suggesting ongoing cardiac stress or ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is persistently hypotensive, which may be due to sepsis, cardiogenic shock, or demand ischemia. The patient has been receiving fluids and inotropic support.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and biliary source could indicate sepsis. The patient is being treated with antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) for biliary sepsis.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's recent NSTEMI and known coronary artery disease with an ejection fraction of 35% put him at risk for cardiogenic shock. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AoCRF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting renal"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) but experienced hypotension after the procedure. He has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including sepsis, acute kidney injury, congestive heart failure, and possible biliary source of infection (cholangitis). The patient is currently on several medications including heparin, aspirin, and Plavix, and is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics. He requires close monitoring and management of his vital signs, fluid balance, and organ function.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to worsening heart failure or myocardial ischemia.
2. Sepsis-related organ failure syndrome affecting multiple organs such as the kidneys, liver, or lungs.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
4. Hepatic failure due to biliary sepsis or pre-existing liver dysfunction.
5. Renal failure exacerbation or progression of chronic kidney disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recent admission for NSTEMI and biliary sepsis following an ERCP/sphincterotomy procedure. The patient became hypotensive post-procedure and was transferred to the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs include a blood pressure in the 80s, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range.

The patient has been on multiple vasopressors, including dopamine and levophed, to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP). He is also receiving antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam), heparin, and cardiac medications (aspirin, Plavix, and nitroglycerin for chest pain).

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated troponin T, elevated liver enzymes, and acute kidney injury. Imaging reveals engorged pulmonary vasculature on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is critically ill with suspected septic shock, cardiac ischemia, and acute on chronic renal failure. The plan includes continuing vasopressors, fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and cardiac support. Monitoring for respiratory status, renal function, and hepatic function is ongoing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypotension, leukocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes suggests possible sepsis, especially considering his recent ERCP procedure.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent NSTEMI increase the risk of recurrent cardiac ischemia.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate possible acute kidney injury.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate and abnormal chest X-ray suggest potential respiratory compromise.
5. Hepatic Dysfunction: Elevated liver enzymes may indicate hepatic dysfunction related to sepsis or biliary sepsis.
6. Arrhythmias: The patient's EKG changes and history of heart failure put him at risk for arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Patient is an 81 yo man with pmhx CAD s/p CABG, recent NSTEMI,
   HTN, CKD here for ERCP now with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Concern for hypovolemia, demand ischemia and sepsis. Now
   only on dopamine with good urine output, steady BP and HR. Echo will be
   performed tomorrow to further evaluate cardiac function. Cardiac
   enzymes trending down, likely in light of demand ischemia and not new
   reinfarction. In terms of sepsis, blood and urine cultures still
   pending while WBC trending down. Will need to repeat a sputum culture
   if possible. Will continue antibiotic coverage for GI sources given
   instrumentation.
   -continue vanc and zosyn for biliary sepsis
   - f/u blood cultures
   -TTE tomorrow
   -continue to attempt at weaning off pressors
   .
   # Cholangitis: p/t is s/p ERCP. WBC and LFTs trending down (only LDH
   remains elevated). Has remained afebrile with minimal abdominal
   discomfort. On vanco/zosyn.
   -adv diet as tolerated if ok with ERCP
   -continue to trend labs
   -cont zosyn and vanco for biliary sepsis; clarify with ERCP what is end
   date of abx coverage
   .
   # CAD: Patient with recent NSTEMI and hypotension. Appreciate
   cardiology recommendations- the feel is that this is demand ischemia
   and not reinfarction. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Continue on ASA,
   plavix, heparin.
   -f/u echo as above
   -telemetry
   -continue on aspirin and plavix and heparin; can restart BB once
   hemodynamically stable
   .
   # CHF: Patient with EF 35%. CXR with mild vol overload but patient
   maintaining sats with supplemental oxygen. Would hold off on giving
   lasix since on exam he still appears slightly dry. Would cautiously
   give fluids with goal of 30cc/hr.
   - monitor BP, holding
   - attempt to wean dopamine as tolerated
   .
   # HTN: currently hypotensive, hold bp meds
   .
   # AoCRF: FeUrea 41.7% with is borderline and nondiagnostic. Would
   repeat urine lytes as those used to calculate were from [**9-8**]. However
   most likely pre-renal/ATN in etiology. Hold off on lasix for time being
   given hypotension unless UOP is not responding to fluid boluses.
   -avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -monitor UO
   .
   # BPH:
   hold hytrin given hypotension
   .
   # Macular degeneration: not on any eye gtts, has previously had
   injections with some success.
   .
   # FEN: prn bolus NS, replete lytes prn, adv diet as tolerated (pending
   ERCP ok today)
   .
   # PPx: protonix, iv heparin
   .
   # Access: PIV x 2, RIJ and A-line (can be d/c once off pressors)
   .
   # Full code- confirmed with pt

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and had a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He presented to the hospital for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and was found to be hypotensive. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for several conditions including cholangitis, CAD, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), acute kidney injury (AoCRF), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and macular degeneration. The patient's current medications include dopamine, heparin, pantoprazole, and antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam). The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement in cardiac function. The patient's urine output is good, and he is maintaining oxygen saturation with supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension could be due to hypovolemia, demand ischemia, or sepsis. Since the patient's blood pressure and heart rate are now stable, the concern for hypotension has decreased. However, careful monitoring is still necessary"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and receiving multiple medications, including dopamine and heparin. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 111/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. They also have various IV infusions and have had multiple arterial and venous lines placed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels, and normal platelet (Plt) levels. Kidney function appears to be impaired with elevated creatinine (Cr) levels. Cardiac enzymes, including troponin-T, are within normal range.

The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating but remain within a relatively stable range. Liver enzymes and other lab values are also provided.

In terms of medical complications, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to their prolonged intubation. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis is being given, and stress ulcer prophylaxis is also mentioned."

   only on dopamine with good urine output, steady BP and HR. Echo will be
   performed tomorrow to further evaluate cardiac function. Cardiac
   enzymes trending down, likely in light of demand ischemia and not new
   reinfarction. In terms of sepsis, blood and urine cultures still
   pending while WBC trending down. Will need to repeat a sputum culture
   if possible. Will continue antibiotic coverage for GI sources given
   instrumentation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He presented to the hospital for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient has been experiencing hypotension and is being treated with dopamine as a pressor. His cardiac enzymes are trending down, suggesting that he may not have had a new heart attack. Blood and urine cultures are pending to evaluate for sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is currently hypotensive, which can lead to decreased organ perfusion and potential organ damage. The cause of hypotension needs to be identified and treated promptly.
2. Sepsis: With the patient's recent instrumentation during ERCP and elevated white blood cell count, there is a concern for biliary sepsis. Blood and urine cultures are pending to confirm this diagnosis. Prompt identification and treatment of sepsis are crucial to improve the patient's outcomes.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine level indicates possible renal dysfunction. The use of nephrotoxic agents should be avoided, and careful monitoring of urine output is necessary.
4. Cardiac Function: The"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), recent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35%, and a recent course notable for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and biliary sepsis following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)/sphincterotomy. The patient experienced shock post-procedure due to combination shock and increased cardiac ischemia. Currently, the patient remains pressor dependent but with a decreasing requirement since yesterday. There is a reduction in abdominal tenderness, liver function tests (LFTs), and leukocytosis, suggesting improving sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac ischemia: The patient has a history of CAD, recent CABG surgery, and NSTEMI. These factors increase the risk of cardiac ischemia, which can lead to further myocardial damage or arrhythmias.
2. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient's baseline creatinine level was 2.1 and has remained unchanged. Considering the recent severe illness and potential sepsis, there is a risk of developing acute kidney injury, especially in the context of renal insufficiency.
3. Sepsis: The patient's recent biliary sepsis and improvement in symptoms such as abdominal tend"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension following an ERCP procedure. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 117/47 mmHg, heart rate of 56 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and his central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range. The patient has been weaned off pressors and started on clear diet. Renal ultrasound shows no evidence of hydronephrosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation was hypotension after an ERCP procedure. It is essential to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure closely to prevent further complications.

2. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) for potential or existing infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as necessary is important.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, with a lowest value of 34,000/uL. Monitoring for bleeding tendencies and considering platelet transfusion if the platelet count drops significantly is necessary.

4. Kidney function: The patient's creatinine levels have been slightly"

ERCP was performed in the past month. Renal USG shows no evidence of hydronephrosis. The patient has no known drug allergies. Antibiotics were administered on 2124-09-09 at 12:00 PM (Vancomycin) and 2124-09-11 at 02:00 AM (Piperacillin/Tazobactam). The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion and pantoprazole (Protonix). Review of systems remains unchanged except for persistent cough. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure ranging from 117/47 to 135/67 mmHg, heart rate between 56-71 bpm, respiratory rate of 20-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,223 mL and output of 1,685 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 462 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and ABG results are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, normal heart sounds, hypoactive bowel sounds, soft abdomen, and no extremity edema. Lab results show elevated white blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo man with CAD s/p CABG, recent NSTEMI at OSH, HTN, CKD here for
   ERCP ([**2124-8-9**]) now with hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Now resolved. Initially concern for hypovolemia, demand
   ischemia, and sepsis. Pressures discontinued yesterday around 5pm.
   Maintaining pressures very well. Good urine output.
       In terms of etiology, cardiac enzymes trended down; no indication
   of new reinfarction.
       In terms of sepsis, blood and urine cultures still pending while
   WBC trending down. Will continue antibiotic coverage for GI sources
   given instrumentation.
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for biliary sepsis
   - Continue to monitor cultures
   .
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP. WBC and LFTs trending down (only LDH remains
   elevated). Has remained afebrile with minimal abdominal discomfort.
   - Continue vanco/zosyn for possible biliary sepsis
   - Touch base with GI
 if okay, will advance diet as tolerated; also
   find out how long to dose antibiotics
   - Continue to trend labs
   .
   # CAD: Patient with recent NSTEMI and hypotension. Appreciate
   cardiology recommendations- the feel is that this is demand ischemia
   and not reinfarction. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Continue on ASA,
   plavix, heparin. When able to tolerate, will add on beta-blcoker.s
   - Continue on telemetry
   - Continue on aspirin and Plavix
   - D/c heparin drip
   - Continue adding on beta-blocker when able to tolerate
   .
   # CHF: Patient with EF 35%. Appears euvolemic at this time.
   .
   # HTN: As off of pressors for <24 hours, will hold BP meds at this
   time.
   .
   # AoCRF: Still pre-renal by serum lytes. Good urine output. Will hold
   off on given fluid at this time given history of heart failure. Avoid
   nephrotoxic agents. Renal ultrasound without hydronephrosis.
   - Continue to monitor UOP closely
   .
   # BPH:
   -          Continue to hold hytrin
   -          Foley in place
   .
   # Macular degeneration: Not on any eye gtts, has previously had
   injections with some success.
   .
   # FEN: prn bolus NS, replete lytes prn, adv diet as tolerated
   .
   # PPx: protonix, heparin SC TID
   .
   # Access: PIV x 2, RIJ and A-line
   - Will d/c A-line, RIJ today
   .
   # Full code- confirmed with pt
   .
   # Communication: wife [**Name (NI) 1139**] called. # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1140**]

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo man with CAD s/p CABG, recent NSTEMI at OSH, HTN, CKD here for
   ERCP ([**2124-8-9**]) for cholangitis and admitted to ICU with hypotension,
   now resolved.
   .
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP. WBC and LFTs still elevated but trending down.
   Has remained afebrile with no abdominal discomfort this morning.
   Appetite improving; asking for solid foods this morning. Able to
   tolerate jello and apple sauce last night.
   - Continue vanco/zosyn for possible biliary sepsis, likely for 14 day
   course (currently day 5)
   - Follow-up GI recs
   - Continue to trend labs
   .
   # CAD: Patient with recent NSTEMI and hypotension. No recent episodes
   of chest pain, hypotension. Cardiac enzymes trending down when last
   checked [**9-9**]. Heparin drip d/c
d [**9-11**].
   - Continue on telemetry
   - Continue on aspirin and Plavix
   - Per cards recs, started on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID
   .
   # CHF (systolic dysfunction): Per history, patient with EF 35% by
   previous TTE (date unknown). TTE on [**9-11**] with significantly reduced EF
   (20-25%) and
severe global hypokinesis
. Patient appears euvolemic by
   exam.
   - Continue metoprolol as above.
   - Unable to start ACE I given renal failure.
   .
   # HTN: Systolic BP down to 90s overnight, but otherwise hypotension
   resolved. BP well-controlled.
   - Continue metoprolol as above.
   .
   # AoCRF: Still pre-renal by serum lytes. Good urine output over past 24
   hours. Will hold off on fluid at this time given severe systolic
   dysfunction. Avoid nephrotoxic agents. Renal ultrasound without
   hydronephrosis.
   - Continue to monitor UOP closely; Foley in place
   .
   # BPH:
   -          Continue to hold hytrin
   -          Foley in place

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU for cholangitis and is currently in stable condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholangitis: The patient has a history of cholangitis and was admitted for ERCP. Although his symptoms are improving, he still has elevated white blood cell count and liver function tests. Continued monitoring and treatment are necessary.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has pre-renal azotemia due to hypotension. Close monitoring of urine output and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents are essential.
3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has severe systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. Monitoring of fluid status and careful management of medications are important.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled with metoprolol.
5. Biliary Sepsis: The patient is receiving antibiotics for possible biliary sepsis, which should be continued for a 14-day course.
6. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): The patient has absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities, indicating potential PAD. Regular assessment of peripheral circulation is necessary.
7. Macular Degeneration: The patient has a"

   TTE ([**2124-9-11**]): The left atrium is elongated. The left ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). There is no ventricular
   septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The ascending aorta
   is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated LV cavity with
   severe global hypokinesis. Mild mitral regurgitation.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo man with CAD s/p CABG, recent NSTEMI at OSH, HTN, CKD here for
   ERCP ([**2124-8-9**]) for cholangitis and admitted to ICU with hypotension,
   now resolved.
   .
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP. WBC and LFTs still elevated but trending down.
   Has remained afebrile with no abdominal discomfort this morning.
   Appetite improving; asking for solid foods this morning. Able to
   tolerate jello and apple sauce last night.

   (currently day 5)
   - Follow-up GI recs
   - Continue to trend labs
   .
   # CAD: Patient with recent NSTEMI and hypotension. No recent episodes
   of chest pain, hypotension. Cardiac enzymes trending down when last
   checked [**9-9**]. Heparin drip d/c
d [**9-11**].
   - Continue on telemetry
   - Continue on aspirin and Plavix
   - Per cards recs, started on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID
   .
   # CHF (systolic dysfunction): Per history, patient with EF 35% by
   previous TTE (date unknown). TTE on [**9-11**] with significantly reduced EF
   (20-25%) and
severe global hypokinesis
. Patient appears euvolemic by
   exam.
   - Continue metoprolol as above.
   - Unable to start ACE I given renal failure.
   .
   # HTN: Systolic BP down to 90s overnight, but otherwise hypotension
   resolved. BP well-controlled.
   - Continue metoprolol as above.
   .
   # AoCRF: Still pre-renal by serum lytes. Good urine output over past 24
   hours. Will hold off on fluid at this time given severe systolic
   dysfunction. Avoid nephrotoxic agents. Renal ultrasound without
   hydronephrosis.
   - Continue to monitor UOP closely; Foley in place
   .
   # BPH: Good urine output
   - D/c Foley
   - Restart hytrin
