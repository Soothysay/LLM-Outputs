","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of permanent atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. He presented to the hospital with acute on chronic congestive heart failure exacerbation and was transferred to the ICU for persistent chest pain. He underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the right coronary artery (RCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). He is currently asymptomatic, but has a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. The patient is being treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) empirically with ciprofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's history of congestive heart failure exacerbation and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (30-40%) puts him at risk for further deterioration in cardiac function, leading to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and hypotension.
2. Arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of permanent atrial fibrillation and the presence of a bi-ventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), there is a risk of ventricular arrhythmias and ICD shocks.
3. Coronary Artery Disease Progression: Although the patient underwent PCI and stenting of the RCA and LAD, there is still a possibility of progression of coronary artery disease, which could lead to recurrent myocardial ischemia and inf"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of permanent atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD) post myocardial infarction (MI), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%. The patient presented to an outside hospital (OSH) on 9/25/2108 for an acute exacerbation of chronic CHF and was transferred to this facility for persistent chest pain. The patient is now experiencing chest pain and there is a suggestion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) on the electrocardiogram (EKG). 

The cardiac catheterization revealed right-dominant coronary artery disease with three-vessel involvement. The left main coronary artery (LMCA) had mild diffuse 40% stenosis distally. The proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery had 50% in-stent restenosis, which was not flow-limiting. The mid to distal LAD was totally occluded just beyond the D2 segment.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Cardiac cath revealed:
   1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three
   vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a mild diffuse 40% stenosi
   s
   distally. The proximal LAD had 50% in stent restenosis which was not
   flow-limiting. The mid to distal LAD was totally occluded just beyond
   the D2. The LCx had a proximal 60-70% stenosis which was unchanged from
   the prior catheterization. The RCA had an ostial 60% stenosis in the
   stent and a 50% distal lesion.
   2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal systemic arterial
   blood pressure (SBP 120 mm Hg). The left sided filling pressure was
   mildly elevated (LVEDP 17 mm Hg).
   3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
   4. Successful PCI of the distal LAD with a 2.25x12mm bare metal stent.
   - 8:45PM post cath check shows no hematoma or bruit and good pulses
   peripherally.  No cholesterol emboli.  PM metoprolol and lasix held due
   to low BPs in the 90s. Pt asymptomatic.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of permanent atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%. The patient presented to the emergency department with acute on chronic CHF exacerbation and was transferred to the ICU for persistent chest pain. 

The cardiac catheterization revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease, including 50% in-stent restenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD), total occlusion in the mid to distal LAD, and 60-70% stenosis in the proximal left circumflex artery (LCx). The right coronary artery (RCA) had an ostial 60% stenosis within the stent and a 50% distal lesion. The left ventricular filling pressures were mildly elevated. 

The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with successful placement of a bare metal stent in the distal LAD. Post-procedure, the patient's vital signs were stable, with no hematoma or bruit at the catheterization site, and good peripheral pulses. The patient was asymptomatic.

The patient's current medications include metoprolol, lasix, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and aspirin.

The patient's condition was initially stable but then developed multiple episodes of chest pain, which were relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin (Nitro SL). The patient's troponin levels are elevated, and there are suggestions of ST-segment elevation in precordial leads on the electrocardiogram (EKG), although the interpretation is difficult due to the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient has been started on heparin therapy, and cardiac enzymes are trending down.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, which is currently well-controlled with medication. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which he has not undergone anticoagulation due to fall risk, presyncope, syncope, and other comorbidities. The patient's current rhythm is atrial fibrillation with LBBB morphology and is being paced at a rate of 90-100 beats per minute (bpm) with a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of permanent atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction who presented to the hospital with acute on chronic congestive heart failure exacerbation. He has undergone cardiac catheterization and stenting of the right coronary artery, left circumflex artery, and left anterior descending artery due to three-vessel coronary artery disease. The patient experienced multiple episodes of chest pain overnight, which were relieved by nitroglycerin. He was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads, suggesting acute coronary syndrome despite being ruled out for myocardial infarction at the other hospital. The patient's ejection fraction is 30-40%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. In-stent thrombosis: The patient's chest pain episodes and elevated cardiac enzymes may indicate a possible in-stent thrombosis, which could lead to myocardial ischemia or infarction.
2. Pericarditis: The patient's symptoms and EKG changes could also suggest pericarditis, an inflammation of the pericardium that can cause chest pain.
3. Heartburn: The patient's symptoms may be attributed to heartburn, especially considering he is now on Plavix, a medication that can increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
4. New thrombus formation in the LAD: There is a possibility of new thrombus formation in the left anterior"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of permanent atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction who presented to the emergency department with acute on chronic congestive heart failure exacerbation. He was transferred to the ICU for persistent chest pain, which has since resolved. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and stenting of the left anterior descending artery. He experienced multiple episodes of chest discomfort overnight, each relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. The patient is currently being treated with heparin and has declining enzyme levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. In-stent thrombosis: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent stenting, there is a risk of in-stent thrombosis, which can lead to recurrent chest pain and myocardial infarction.
2. Pericarditis: The patient's ongoing chest discomfort and elevated troponin levels may suggest pericarditis, an inflammation of the pericardium that can cause chest pain.
3. Heartburn: The patient has a history of heartburn, and the recent initiation of Plavix may exacerbate this condition.
4. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypertension and the use of antihypertensive medications may increase the risk of hypotension.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The presence of leukocytes and nitrites in the urinalysis suggests a UTI, which"

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of permanent atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and a previous myocardial infarction. He presented to the emergency department with acute on chronic heart failure exacerbation and was transferred to the ICU for persistent chest pain. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and stenting of the left anterior descending artery. He experienced multiple episodes of chest pain overnight, which were relieved by nitroglycerin. His troponin levels are elevated, indicating a possible acute coronary syndrome.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient's symptoms and elevated troponin levels suggest ACS. It is important to monitor his condition closely and consider further interventions, such as additional cardiac catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), if necessary.

2. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, and his current presentation with acute on chronic exacerbation indicates worsening cardiac function. Close monitoring of his fluid status, respiratory effort, and cardiac output is essential to prevent further deterioration.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension overnight. It is crucial to assess his hemodynamic stability regularly and adjust medication doses accordingly to maintain adequate blood pressure.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The positive urine analysis at the other hospital showing leukocytes and nitrite suggests a possible UTI. Empirical treatment with ciprof"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of permanent atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. He presented to the hospital with acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure exacerbation and was transferred to the ICU due to persistent chest pain. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and stenting of the left anterior descending artery on September 29th.

The patient experienced multiple episodes of chest pain overnight, which were relieved by nitroglycerin sublingually. His vital signs show a blood pressure of 105/60 mmHg, heart rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals a paced rhythm with regular rate, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, and several premature ventricular contractions. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or bruits. His extremities are cool and clammy, and there are no peripheral pulses abnormalities.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels. Troponin-T levels are elevated, as well as creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB levels. Electrolytes show mild imbalances, including potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels.

The patient's chest pain was initially thought to be due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o male with permanent afib (without anticoagulation), CAD s/p MI
   with stenting to RCA, LAD, h/o CHF with EF 30% with biV ICD who
   presented to an OSH on [**2108-9-25**] for acute on chronic chf exacerbation,
   transferred here for persistent chest pain, chest pain free on arrival,
   but re-developed chest pain overnight and taken to cath on [**9-29**], last
   night, patient developed multiple episodes of chest pain which were
   relieved by nitro SL.
   .
   # CORONARIES: cardiac cath [**2106-10-9**] showed right-dominant system with
   three-vessel coronary artery disease (90% RCA ostial in-stent
   restenosis, 50% proximal LCX stenosis, 50% mid vessel LAD stenosis).
   Patient was ruled out for MI at OSH, but now transferred for persistent
   chest pain and now suggestion of ACS on EKG.  Taken to cath with LAD
   stented on [**9-29**] and minimal dye load given.   CEs on arrival CK=360,
   MB=57, trop=0.67; repeat CK=635, MB=103, trop=1.63 with suggestion of
   ST elevation in precordial leads but difficult to interpret in the
   setting of his LBBB.  Cath performed and LAD stented.  Patient with
   known 3VD.   Multiple episodes of chest discomfort overnight- each
   relieved by sublingual nitro.  Patient started on a heparin gtt-
   enzymes trending down from high reached on [**9-30**].

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of permanent atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction who presented with acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure exacerbation. He underwent cardiac catheterization and stenting of the right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery due to significant blockages in these vessels. The patient also has a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation, and a bi-ventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

During his stay in the ICU, the patient experienced multiple episodes of chest pain, which were relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. His electrocardiogram (EKG) showed changes suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, and he was taken for another cardiac catheterization, where the left anterior descending artery was stented again. The patient's cardiac enzymes were elevated, indicating ongoing myocardial damage.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 105/60 mmHg and heart rate of 83 beats per minute. He is currently normotensive, and his blood pressure medications can be continued. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with left bundle branch block morphology and is v-paced at 90-100 beats per minute.

The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy, and ulcerative colitis. He is currently being treated empirically for a"
