 HYPOTHERMIA
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia, but did not have a swift fall
   in Na today.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - avoid flumazenil because it lowers seizure threshold
   - d/c cipro bc it also lower seizure threshold
   - follow up neuro recs
   - follow up final read CT head
   - consider MRI if stable for transport
   - if more awake, trial of lactulose, if still somnulent would consider
   intubation and NGT for lactulose trial
   - infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis later
   .
   # Respiratory Status: is protecting airway right now but is tenuous
   with poor gag reflex and depressed respiratory rate to 8.  She is
   satting well on 3L NC right now.
   - monitor for now, if mental status worsening, consider intubation
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue gabapentin, but hold for mental status
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected
   - started vanco [**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant
   - lactulose when PO access
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider ceftriaxone for ppx
   - consider diagnostic paracentesisi.
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # ARF: resolved, was thought most likely secondary to hepatorenal
   syndrome initially.
   - follow urine output
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports.
   - IVF boluses prn, continue levophed for pressure support.  Add
   vasopressin as needed.
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia, but did not have a swift fall
   in Na today.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - d/c cipro bc it also lower seizure threshold
   - follow up neuro recs
   - follow up final read CT head
   - consider MRI if stable for transport
   - if more awake, trial of lactulose, if still somnulent would consider
   intubation and NGT for lactulose trial
   - infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis later
   - Avoid ativan as it will be cleared/metabolized slowly
   .
   # Respiratory Status: is protecting airway right now but is tenuous
   with poor gag reflex and depressed respiratory rate to 8.  She is
   satting well on 3L NC right now.
   - monitor for now, if mental status worsening, intubated
   - consider bronchoscopy today
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue gabapentin, but hold for mental status
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected
   - started vanco [**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant
   - lactulose when PO access
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider ceftriaxone for ppx
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # ARF: resolved, was thought most likely secondary to hepatorenal
   syndrome initially.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / NPO for now, consider

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, recent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and new-onset seizures. She was admitted to the MICU with altered mental status and multiple medical complications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but she has hypothermia, respiratory depression, hyponatremia, and potential liver failure. She also has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, esophageal varices, asthma/COPD, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient appears intravascularly dry on examination and laboratory reports. This indicates poor perfusion and potential shock. IV fluids and vasopressor support are being provided.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, which could be due to post-ictal state, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, status epilepticus, or hyponatremia. Close monitoring for respiratory depression is necessary. Lactulose administration may be considered if the patient is more awake.
3. Respiratory Status: The patient's respiratory status is currently tenuous, with a depressed respiratory rate. Intubation may be necessary if her mental status worsens. A bronchoscopy may be considered today.
4. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, which could"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, recent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and new-onset seizures. She is being transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with altered mental status.

The patient appears to be in shock, intravascularly dry on exam and lab reports. She is receiving IV fluids as needed, continue levophed for pressure support, and adding vasopressin as needed. Her central venous pressure (CVP) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (ScVO2) are to be monitored.

The patient's altered mental status has multiple potential etiologies, including post-ictal state, worsening hepatic encephalopathy, infection, status epilepticus, hyponatremia, or bacteremia. Further evaluation is warranted, including a head CT with no evidence of acute process. The patient should be closely monitored for respiratory depression, and ciprofloxacin should be discontinued due to its potential to lower the seizure threshold. Lactulose may be considered if the patient is more awake, but intubation and nasogastric tube placement for lactulose trial may be necessary if she remains somnolent. An infectious workup with blood cultures, urine cultures, and a diagnostic paracentesis should be performed.

The patient's respiratory status is a concern, as"

   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports.
   - IVF boluses prn, continue levophed for pressure support.  Add
   vasopressin as needed.
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia, but did not have a swift fall
   in Na today. Head CT with no evidence for acute process.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - d/c cipro bc it also lower seizure threshold
   - follow up neuro recs
   - consider MRI if stable for transport
   - if more awake, trial of lactulose, if still somnulent would consider
   intubation and NGT for lactulose trial
   - infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis later
   - Avoid ativan as it will be cleared/metabolized slowly
   .
   # Respiratory Status: Intubated with concern over airway protection.
   - Currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trial
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue gabapentin, but hold for mental status
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected
   - started vanco [**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current MELD =
   31.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD = 31 today.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant
   - lactulose when PO access
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider ceftriaxone for ppx
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.

   # ARF: resolved, was thought most likely secondary to hepatorenal
   syndrome initially.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload (more congestion on CXR today)
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   - Currently on vasopressin
 will hold for now and monitor BPs
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia. Head CT with no evidence for
   acute process. Possibly secondary to bacteremia as below. Also concern
   for cerebral edema.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - follow up neuro recs
   - F/U infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if enough ascites to tap
   - Avoid ativan and other sedatives
   .
   # Respiratory Status: Intubated with concern over airway protection.
   - Currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trial (seems going well)
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Abx with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**].
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   - If S. aureus, will need PICC changed out; if S. epi could be
   contaminant
 consider treating through if only
 bottle positive
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs: off meds at this time
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current MELD =
   31.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD = 31 today.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / plan to start TF today

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, recent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and new seizures. She is being transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with altered mental status. The patient appears intravascularly dry on examination and laboratory reports, possibly secondary to sepsis. She is on vasopressin and will hold for now and monitor blood pressures.

The patient's altered mental status is unclear etiology, possibly post-ictal with slow metabolism or due to worsening hepatic encephalopathy, secondary to infection, status epilepticus, or hyponatremia. Head CT shows no evidence for acute process. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging and collapse. She is intubated with concern over airway protection.

The patient has positive blood cultures (BCx) with GPC in clusters from 04/27. She is currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) with creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0), most likely due to poor renal perfusion, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), or prerenal azotemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with ongoing oliguric output, hyponatremia, and suspected cerebral edema. They have a history of allergies to sulfa, Aldactone, penicillins, and Bactrim. The patient is currently on vasopressin and other ICU medications. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/56 to 117/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 3,576 mL total in, with 2,972 mL given intravenously, and 410 mL output via urine. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a PSV/SBT mode, set tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 18. Physical examination findings include a white blood cell count of 6.6-11.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 27.8-25.6 g/dL, platelet count of 102-106 K/uL, creatinine levels of 1.2-1.6 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 93 to 135 mg/dL, and other lab results within normal ranges. The patient is on multiple medications, including vasopressin and antibiotics. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been on antibiotics, indicating a possible infection.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's oliguric output and elevated creatinine levels suggest compromised kidney function.
3. Cerebral edema: The patient's suspected cerebral edema may lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological deterioration.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and venous stasis can increase the risk of DVT, which may lead to PE if a clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
6. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and critical illness can increase the risk of developing stress ulcers.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels need careful monitoring and management to avoid complications such as seizures or cerebral edema."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload (more congestion on CXR today)
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   - Currently on vasopressin
 will hold for now and monitor BPs
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia. Head CT with no evidence for
   acute process. Possibly secondary to bacteremia as below. Also concern
   for cerebral edema.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - follow up neuro recs
   - F/U infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if enough ascites to tap
   - Avoid ativan and other sedatives
   .
   # Respiratory Status: Intubated with concern over airway protection.
   - Currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trial (seems going well)
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Abx with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**].
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   - If S. aureus, will need PICC changed out; if S. epi could be
   contaminant
 consider treating through if only
 bottle positive
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs: off meds at this time
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current MELD =
   31.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD = 31 today.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / plan to start TF today

   24 Hour Events:
   - Vasopressin stopped over concern for contribution to hyponatremia.
   Levophed continued to maintain pressures at 0.06 mcg/kg/mg.
   - Blood cx positive from [**2200-4-27**] speciated to coagulase negative staph.
   As this was 1/4 bottles, thought to be possibly a contaminant.
   Continuing to treat through existing PICC line (though would pull line
   if 2nd bottle positive).
   - Renal recs: ARF likely [**2-25**] prerenal vs. HRS. Given weak response to
   hypertonic saline, consider D/C or change vasopressin. No indication
   for RTT at this time. If metabolic acidosis worsens, may need HD.
   - Liver recs: Continue hypertonic saline, current mgmt (including
   current Abx, hypertonic saline). Pt does not require antifungal
   treatment
   - Neuro recs: 24-hour EEG, repeat head CT
   - Somewhat poor UOP overnight (20-60 cc/hr)
   - Repeat head CT: (prelim read) no cerebral edema (should patient
   develop cerebral edema, pharmacy provided protocol for treatment which
   is in patient's chart)
   - Started on TF
   - Needs to have family meeting scheduled to discuss goals of care

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note, but there are several significant events that occurred within the last 24 hours.

The patient has been experiencing hyponatremia, which is a low sodium level in the blood. As a result, vasopressin was stopped due to its potential contribution to this condition. Levophed is being used to maintain pressures at 0.06 mcg/kg/min.

There is also a positive blood culture from 04/27/2200 that showed coagulase-negative staphylococcus. This could be a contaminant, but the patient is being treated with antibiotics through the existing PICC line. If another bottle tests positive, the line will be removed.

Renal recommendations suggest that acute renal failure (ARF) is likely prerenal versus hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Given the weak response to hypertonic saline, it is suggested to discontinue or change vasopressin. No indication for renal replacement therapy (RRT) at this time is mentioned. If metabolic acidosis worsens, hemodialysis (HD) may be needed.

Liver recommendations include continuing with hypertonic saline and the current management plan, including antibiotic treatment. The patient does not require antifungal treatment.

Neurological recommendations involve conducting a 24-hour EEG and repeating a head CT scan. The patient's urine output has"

   moderate to severe encephalopathy. Medications, toxic/metabolic
   disturbances, or infection are common causes. No focal areas of
   slowing, epileptiform discharges, or electrographic seizures were seen
   during this recording.
   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload
   -  CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02
   - continue levophed to MAP >60
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG
   - Neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin will need ID
   approval)
   - F/U final read CT head
   - continue to correct hyponatremia
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**].
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   - If S. aureus, will need PICC changed out; if S. epi could be
   contaminant
 consider treating through if only
 bottle positive
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - f/u final read CT head
   - MRI when stable
   - F/U with neuro regarding starting anti-epileptics (concern with
   Keppra due to elevated LFT)
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 24 hours with hypertonic saline.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD score of 33
   this AM.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status, shock, respiratory distress, seizures, hyponatremia, hypothermia, cholestasis, ascites, lower extremity edema, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative staphylococcus, which may indicate an ongoing infection. She is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but further investigation and treatment are needed.
2. Seizures: The patient has experienced seizures, and it is unclear about their etiology. Further evaluation, including a 24-hour EEG, is recommended to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment includes lactulose and avoiding medications that can worsen the condition.
4. Hepato-renal syndrome: The patient's renal function has worsened, and there is concern for the development of hepatorenal syndrome. Monitoring urine output and following renal recommendations are crucial.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which has been partially corrected with hypertonic saline"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, recent SBP, and new seizures. She is being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status. The patient appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports, possibly secondary to sepsis. She is intubated due to altered mental status and concern for inability to protect airway. The patient's respiratory status is compromised because of mental status. She has hyponatremia, hypothermia, cholestasis, and hepatorenal syndrome. She has a positive blood culture showing coagulase-negative staph, possibly a contaminant. The patient's medical team is concerned about potential complications such as shock, respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), seizures, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient may be experiencing septic shock due to intravascular volume depletion and possible infection.
2. ARDS: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and there is concern for ARDS, possibly secondary to sepsis or pneumonia.
3. Seizures: The patient has a history of new-onset seizures, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, especially considering her history of Hep C cirrh"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, recent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and new-onset seizures. She is currently in the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory distress, and multiple organ dysfunction. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, but she has positive blood cultures for coag-negative staphylococci. She has an elevated creatinine level and is at risk for hepatorenal syndrome. She also has hyponatremia, hypothermia, cholestasis, and a history of SBP. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, norepinephrine for hypotension, and other medications as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and altered mental status suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient's elevated creatinine level and history of cirrhosis make her at risk for HRS. This condition can occur when the liver fails to produce enough proteins to maintain kidney function.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation indicate a risk of respiratory failure. She is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of liver disease and altered"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP this AM.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02 (91% on [**4-29**])
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   this morning.
   - 24 hour EEG in progress: prelim read
 epileptiform activity; neuro
   considering starting AED (?zonegran)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out).
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AEL at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 139 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.

   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AEL
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites

","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, and HIV. She is currently in the ICU due to altered mental status and concerns for airway protection. She has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. 

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 5.2 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, sodium of 145 mg/dL, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, and albumin of 1.5 g/dL. 

The patient's medical conditions include shock, respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), altered mental status, positive blood cultures, acute kidney injury (AKI), seizures, hyponatremia, hypothermia, Hepatitis C cirrhosis, cholestasis, history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and a history of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The patient is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, norepinephrine for hypotension, and albumin for SBP. She is also receiving renal dosed medications for her HIV. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's liver function, development of hepatorenal syndrome, further deterioration of the patient's respiratory status, and the possibility of new infections due to her immunocompromised state. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and overall clinical condition to promptly address any potential complications."

   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload
   -  CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02 (91% on [**4-29**])
   - continue levophed to MAP >60 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity. Continues minimally
   responsive to pain.
   - 24 hour EEG in progress
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out).
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AEL at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 139 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD score of 33
   this AM.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AEL
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN

   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) who is currently in the ICU with altered mental status. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple organ dysfunctions and potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient appears intravascularly dry and may be experiencing septic shock. Fluid resuscitation will be monitored closely to avoid fluid overload.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to altered mental status and concern for airway protection. There are concerns about acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mucous plugging.
3. Altered Mental Status: The etiology of the altered mental status is unclear, with differentials including seizures, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia, and medication-induced effects.
4. Positive Blood Culture: The patient has a positive blood culture for coag-negative staphylococci, which could be a contaminant or indicate an infection.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has an elevated creatinine level, suggesting renal dysfunction. It is likely due to poor renal perfusion, potentially secondary to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
6. Hyponatremia: The patient had new-onset hyponatremia, possibly secondary to diuretic use and possible"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, recent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and new-onset seizures. She is currently intubated due to altered mental status and concerns for airway protection. The patient appears to be in shock, possibly secondary to sepsis, with intravascular dryness on examination and laboratory reports. She has respiratory distress with possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has hyponatremia, which has resolved, and positive blood cultures for coag-negative staphylococcus, which may be a contaminant. She has acute kidney injury with a rising creatinine level and concern for hepatorenal syndrome. The patient has a history of seizures, possibly secondary to liver failure or an underlying organic disorder. She is being evaluated for liver transplant but is unlikely to be a candidate. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple comorbidities, including Hepatitis C cirrhosis, HIV, recent SBP, and previous ESBL UTI. She has tense abdomen due to ascites and mild peripheral edema. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, and HIV. She has been admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with sepsis and severe pneumonia, and there is concern for possible ARDS. She also has a positive blood culture for coag-negative staphylococci, which may be a contaminant. Her renal function has improved from hepatorenal syndrome, but she has developed hyponatremia and hypothermia. She has a history of seizures, and an EEG is ongoing to evaluate for epileptiform activity. There is a concern for underlying organic seizure disorder due to liver failure. The patient's liver function is worsening, with elevated INR and bilirubin levels. She is being evaluated for liver transplantation but is considered an unlikely candidate due to comorbidities. She also has a history of SBP and ESBL UTI. Her asthma/COPD is stable, but her respiratory status is compromised due to altered mental status. She has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and ascites/LE edema. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Shock: The patient appears intravascularly dry on examination and laboratory reports, indicating a possible shock state. This could be secondary to sepsis or other causes. Close monitoring of fluid status is necessary to avoid fluid overload.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to altered mental status and concern for inability to protect airway. There is a possibility of ARDS, and bronchoscopy showed evidence of mucous plugging and collapse.
3. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a concern for new infection in the setting of altered mental status.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of liver failure and intermittent encephalopathy. Lactulose is being continued, and neurologic evaluation is ongoing.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient had new-onset hyponatremia, which has since resolved. It is important to monitor sodium levels carefully and hold diuretics.
6. Hypothermia: The patient has hypothermia, which may be infected. Empirical treatment for possible infection is being provided.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to liver disease. Close monitoring of platelet levels and consideration for DDAVP if actively bleeding are important.
8. Renal failure: Although the patient's renal function has improved from hepatorenal syndrome, close monitoring of urine output and fluid balance is necessary.
9. HIV/AIDS: The patient's HIV status requires ongoing management, including monitoring of CD4 count and administration of home medications.
10. Asthma/COPD: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to altered mental status. Nebulizer treatments are being given as needed.
11. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is slowly trending down. Close monitoring and transfusion for HCT <25 are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02 (91% on [**4-29**])
   - continue levophed to MAP >60 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity. Continues minimally
   responsive to pain.
   - 24 hour EEG in progress: prelim read
 epileptiform activity; neuro
   considering starting AED (?zonegran)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out).
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AEL at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 139 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD score of 33
   this AM.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AEL
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and seizures.
- The patient has been intubated due to her altered mental status and concern for airway protection. She is currently on mechanical ventilation in CPAP/PSV mode.
- She has been diagnosed with hypotension and started on norepinephrine. Her renal function has recovered, but there are concerns about the development of hepatorenal syndrome.
- The patient has hyponatremia, which has resolved after correction with hypertonic saline. She also has thrombocytopenia and anemia.
- She has a history of esophageal varices and is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. She is currently on prophylactic medications for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis.
- The patient has positive blood cultures for coag-negative Staphylococcus, possibly a contaminant.
- Her liver function tests show worsening bilirubinemia, and she is being evaluated for liver transplant.
- She has been treated for an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) urinary tract infection (UTI) with meropenem.

 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP this AM.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to altered mental status, hypothermia, and respiratory distress. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications, including shock, respiratory failure, seizures, acute kidney injury (AKI), hyponatremia, positive blood culture, and possible hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient appears intravascularly dry on examination and laboratory reports, indicating poor perfusion. This could be secondary to sepsis or another cause. Monitoring volume status closely to avoid fluid overload is recommended.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to altered mental status and concern for airway protection. She meets criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging and collapse suggests possible mucus plugging contributing to respiratory failure.
3. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, and it is unclear why she has developed seizure disorder. Differential diagnosis includes hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia, medication-induced seizures, or an underlying organic seizure disorder.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creat"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, recent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and new-onset seizures. She is currently intubated due to altered mental status and concerns for airway protection. The patient is in shock, with intravascular dryness noted on examination and laboratory reports. She has respiratory issues, possibly consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and mucous plugging observed during bronchoscopy. The patient also has altered mental status, with unclear etiology, and evidence of epileptiform activity on EEG. She has positive blood cultures for coag-negative staphylococci, which may be a contaminant. The patient's renal function has worsened, with a creatinine level of 1.4 from baseline 1.0, and concern for hepatorenal syndrome. She has hyponatremia, which has resolved, and hypothermia. The patient has a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, worsening bilirubinemia, and intermittent encephalopathy. There is also mention of cholestasis possibly due to worsening liver failure or a side effect of keppra. The patient has a history of SBP and was started on ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. She previously had an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) urinary tract infection (UT"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP this AM.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics but change vancomycin to 750mg
   Q24 and dose by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   this morning.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.7 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26

   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. He has a history of multiple medical conditions including hypertension, renal disease, liver disease, and allergies to certain medications. The patient is currently on life support and has been receiving multiple medications. His vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing low urine output and requires vasopressor support. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the presence of urine sediment consistent with acute tubular necrosis or hepatorenal syndrome. There are concerns about the potential development of sepsis, as evidenced by elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels. The patient's liver enzymes are also elevated, indicating possible liver dysfunction. There is a need for central access to monitor intravascular status, and the patient is not a candidate for liver transplantation. The patient's goals of care remain unchanged.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) - The patient's low urine output and deteriorating renal function suggest the possibility of AKI.
2. Sepsis - The elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels indicate a potential infection, which could lead to sepsis.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) - The presence of urine sediment consistent with ATN or HRS suggests the possibility of HRS.
4. Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) - Given the patient's multiple organ dysfunction (liver,"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinin trending up to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely
   due to poor renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na
   concern for development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - re-check urine lytes and sediment, re-check Creatinine later in day
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   - Discuss with family goals of care, CVVH (may not improve status
   overall)
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   - Check bladder pressure
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

Assessment and plan:
1. Shock: The patient appears intravascularly dry on examination and laboratory reports. She is likely experiencing septic shock, although fluid overload should be avoided due to the possibility of fluid retention. CVP should be maintained between 8-12 mmHg, and levophed should be continued to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >75 mmHg PRN. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and vancomycin dosage should be based on trough levels.

2. Respiratory: The patient is intubated due to altered mental status and concern for airway protection. She may meet criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Bronchoscopy showed evidence of mucous plugging and collapse. It is recommended to continue antibiotics with vancomycin and [Last Name (un)]. Low tidal volume ventilation should be attempted, but the patient was unable to tolerate it, and pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode should be used instead.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   - Add on cortisol to AM labs
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED needed, no seizure PPx at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinin trending up to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely
   due to poor renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na
   concern for development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - re-check urine lytes and sediment, re-check Creatinine later in day
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   - Discuss with family goals of care, CVVH (may not improve status
   overall)
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger if temps stay low
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   - Check bladder pressure (trending down)
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / continue TF

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, recent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and new-onset seizures. The patient is currently intubated in the MICU due to altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/65 to 132/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including shock, respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), altered mental status, positive blood cultures for coag-negative staphylococci (likely contaminant), acute kidney injury (AKI), hyponatremia, hypothermia, cholestasis, and a history of SBP.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated creatinine level of 2.4 (from baseline 1.0), low urine output, high bilirubin levels, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). The patient also has thrombocytopenia, anemia, and is HIV-positive.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem), maintaining intravascular volume status, adjusting vancomycin dosage based on levels, monitoring renal function, and discussing goals of care with the family"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hep C cirrhosis, HIV, recent SBP, new seizures, and altered mental status. She is being transferred to the MICU with intravascular dryness and fluid administration unlikely to remain intravascular. The patient appears more interactive with higher MAP. There are multiple medical complications including shock, respiratory issues, altered mental status, hyponatremia, positive BCx with GPC clusters from 4/27, ARF, seizures, hypothermia, hepatic encephalopathy, cholestasis, history of SBP, ESBL UTI, ascites/LE edema, HIV, asthma/COPD, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and liver failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is intravascularly dry, indicating poor perfusion. This may be secondary to sepsis or other causes.
2. Respiratory issues: The patient is intubated due to altered mental status and concern for airway protection. There is evidence of mucous plugging and collapse, which could be consistent with ARDS.
3. Altered mental status: The etiology is unclear, with differential diagnoses including seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia, medication-induced, etc. Further evaluation is needed.

1. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture and gram-positive cocci in clusters from the previous day, indicating a possible bacterial infection. She is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem), but further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function as a result of severe liver disease.
3. Hypotension and Shock: The patient appears intravascularly dry and has low blood pressure, indicating hypotension and possible shock. Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support with norepinephrine are being provided to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   to maintain MAP > 75
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12 (though no current mechanism to monitor)
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, recent SBP, and new-onset seizures. She was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status and concern for airway protection. The patient appears to be in shock, with increased pressor requirement to maintain MAP >75 and low urine output. She is also experiencing hyponatremia, which has resolved with hypertonic saline. The patient has a positive blood culture for coag-negative staphylococci, likely a contaminant. Her renal function is worsening, with a creatinine level of 1.8 and FeNa <1%, suggesting hepatorenal syndrome. The patient has a history of SBP and is on ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. She also has a history of an ESBL UTI, which has been treated with meropenem. The patient is stable with regards to her HIV and asthma/COPD. She has anemia and thrombocytopenia, both likely secondary to liver disease. The patient's liver function tests and coagulation profile are trending down. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin/meropenem), and her seizures are being managed with lactulose. The patient's condition remains critical, and she is being evaluated for liver transplantation."

   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   to maintain MAP > 75 but this AM narrow complex tachycardia with rate
   to 140s possibly due to increased levophed.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload

   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection

   Assessment and Plan
 Septic shock
   -vanc, meropenem
   -cx data unrevealing so far
   - pressor requirement is increasing
   -hypothermia - improving with blankets, inc room temp
   -associated with hypotension - broke on its own
   -check EKG, abg, lytes to assess for potential addressable etiologies
   -pressors could be impacting given inc dose.  Consider start
   vasopressin to allow [**Month (only) 453**] in pressor dose.
 H/O ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
   -EEG negative for NCSE
   -likely delerium related to medications/sepsis
 Hyponatremia
   -improving
 Acute on chronic renal failure
   -creatinine trending up, urine output minimal
   -not responding to IVF boluses
   -bladder pressure lower than yesterday
   -ATN from hypotension/sepsis vs. HRS
   -renal team following - are not inclined to dialyze
Respiratory failure
   -requiring sig PEEP to offload diaphragm due to elevated intra-abd
   pressures
Liver failure
   -liver service following
   -not a transplant candidate since looks like would require liver/kidney
   tx which has poor outcome in HIV population
Goals of care
   -prognosis worsening -need to discuss goals of care

   Patient is critically ill.
   Total time spent: 45 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of septic shock. The patient has multiple medical complications including:

1. C-diff infection: The patient has a confirmed c-diff infection, which is causing an increase in levophed requirement and minimal improvement in urine output. This indicates that the infection is contributing to the patient's overall poor condition.

2. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient's creatinine levels are trending upward, and urine output is minimal, suggesting acute kidney injury. This could be due to hypotension and sepsis or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The renal team is monitoring the situation but does not recommend dialysis at this time.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient requires significant positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to offload the diaphragm due to elevated intra-abdominal pressures. This indicates respiratory failure, likely secondary to sepsis and the patient's compromised condition.

4. Liver failure: The patient has signs of liver failure, with elevated liver enzymes and abnormal liver function tests. The liver service is following up on the patient, but they do not consider the patient a transplant candidate due to the poor prognosis in the HIV population.

5. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, likely related to medications and sepsis. An EEG was performed, ruling out nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is intubated. The patient's main medical issues include being icteric (jaundiced) with low urine output, dependence on vasopressor (levophed) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation.

The patient experienced an episode of narrow complex tachycardia, likely PSVT, which resolved spontaneously. Adenosine was administered at the bedside.

The patient continues to require levophed infusion to maintain MAP above 65, despite attempts to reduce the dose. The patient's current FiO2 is set at 40% and they are on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a respiratory rate of 21-30, peak inspiratory pressure of 16, and tidal volume of 508-648 mL.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate in the 80s-170s bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/52-127/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 inspiratory/min, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight is currently 100 kg.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,653 mL, including 768 mL of enteral feeding and 1,273 mL of intravenous fluids. The total output includes 1,602 mL of urine,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient has been intubated and remains on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. He is dependent on vasopressor support (norepinephrine) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. The patient continues to be icteric with low urine output (10-20cc/hr). His SpO2 levels are maintained between 94-96% on FiO2 40%, and he has a respiratory rate of 21-30 breaths per minute. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he has experienced episodes of narrow complex tachycardia, likely supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which resolved spontaneously. The patient has multiple allergies, including angioedema to aldactone, hives to penicillins, and blisters to Bactrim. He is currently receiving multiple IV antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:
1. Organ dysfunction: The patient's low urine output suggests possible renal dysfunction. Additionally, his liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and bilirubin levels are elevated, indicating potential hepatic involvement. Monitoring liver"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.4 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Previously more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   to maintain MAP > 75 but this AM narrow complex tachycardia with rate
   to 140s possibly due to increased levophed.
   - Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - Monitor volume status closely to avoid further fluid overload
 avoid
   IVF as minimal UOP
   - CVP 8-12 (though no current mechanism to monitor)
   - continue levophed to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  The differential includes seizure/post-ictal,
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia , medication induced
   (started following ativan administration).   CT head with no evidence
   of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common causes.  Cannot
   exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia.  CXR
   on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine ranging from 1.8  to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0) and
   continues to have low urine output (10-25cc/hr). The differential
   includes poor renal perfusion, possibly ATN vs. HRS. Given very low
   urine Na concern for development of HRS.  Renal evaluation over the
   weekend noted that renal replacement therapy will not be an option.
   Bladder pressures 24 today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - monitor bladder pressure
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   consider bolus if < 20 cc/hr
   - F/U renal and liver recs regarding treatment for HRS
   - monitor bladder pressure
   .
   # SVT: Patient had episode of regular narrow complex tachycardia on
   [**2200-5-3**] likely PSVT, broke spontaneously.  Possibly due to increasing
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - lower MAP requirement to >65 (from >75)
   - adenosine at bedside
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI when stable
   - neurology recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent SBP. She is being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
- The patient appears intravascularly dry and has worsening renal function, with a creatinine ranging from 1.8 to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0) and low urine output (10-25cc/hr).
- She is intubated due to altered mental status and concern for inability to protect airway. There is evidence of mucous plugging and collapse in the bronchoscopy.
- The patient had an episode of regular narrow complex tachycardia, likely PSVT, which broke spontaneously. It may have been due to increasing levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75.
- The patient had seizures, and a 24-hour EEG showed generalized epileptiform discharges consistent with non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
- The patient has positive blood cultures with gram-positive cocci in clusters from 4/27, likely coag-negative staph, which is considered a contaminant.
- She has hyponatremia, which has resolved, and concern for hepatorenal syndrome. Renal replacement therapy is not an option.

   45 y/o F with hx of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.4 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   to maintain MAP > 75 but this AM narrow complex tachycardia with rate
   to 140s possibly due to increased levophed.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12 (though no current mechanism to monitor)
   - continue levophed to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  The differential includes seizure/post-ictal,
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia , medication induced
   (started following ativan administration).   CT head with no evidence
   of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common causes.  Cannot
   exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia.  CXR
   on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine ranging from 1.8  to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0) and
   continues to have low urine output (10-25cc/hr). The differential
   includes poor renal perfusion, possibly ATN vs. HRS. Given very low
   urine Na concern for development of HRS.  Renal evaluation over the
   weekend noted that renal replacement therapy will not be an option.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - monitor bladder pressure
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   consider bolus if < 20 cc/hr
   - F/U renal and liver recs regarding treatment for HRS
   - monitor bladder pressure
   .
   # SVT: Patient had episode of regular narrow complex tachycardia on
   [**2200-5-3**] likely PSVT, broke spontaneously.  Possibly due to increasing
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - lower MAP requirement to >65 (from >75)
   - adenosine at bedside
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI when stable
   - neurology recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger for low temperature
   .
   # Hepatitis C Cirrhosis:  She continues to be anicteric with a
   worsening INR and liver function tests and a MELD today of 44.
   Per hepatology likely not candidate for transplant at this time.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR

   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.

","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent SBP. She is currently intubated due to altered mental status and concern for airway protection. The patient has multiple medical complications including shock, respiratory distress, altered mental status, seizures, hypothermia, renal failure, hyponatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a positive blood culture.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Severe sepsis or septic shock due to positive blood culture and signs of infection.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the need for mechanical ventilation and evidence of mucous plugging and collapse on bronchoscopy.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy due to worsening liver function and elevated INR.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) due to low urine output and elevated creatinine levels.
5. Hepatitis C-related complications such as cirrhosis and potential liver failure.
6. HIV-related complications such as anemia and thrombocytopenia.
7. Potential bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia and anemia.
8. Drug-induced complications such as hyponatremia from diuretic use and potential adverse effects from medications like ativan.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease), HIV, admitted to the ICU for encephalopathy and septic shock. He has a history of respiratory failure and renal failure. The patient has multiple allergies, including sulfa, Aldactone, penicillins, and Bactrim. He is currently receiving infusions of norepinephrine and pantoprazole. His vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia, with a heart rate of 94 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 106/53 to 127/77 mmHg. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and an FiO2 of 40%. His ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia. Physical examination reveals jaundice, edema in both lower extremities, and a firm abdomen. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and high lactate levels. The patient's MELD score is 44, indicating a poor prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which may worsen due to his underlying conditions and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Septic Shock: The patient has septic shock, and without identifying and treating the source of infection, there is a risk of further deterioration.

   24 Hour Events:
   - Pt received cefepime accidental dose x 1 (another patient's
   medication). Has PCN allergy (hives) but no known anaphylaxis. No
   immediate rxn. No meds given at this time.
   - Discussed poor prognosis with son. Renal also discussed futility of
   RRT. Change in code status to DNR (ok to continue intubation, ok to
   continue pressors). Son contacting family for potential family meeting
   on Tuesday.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC; post-transfusion Hct - 24 (from 22)
   - Coags markedly worse with PM labs; son was called to notify him that
   patient's labs are becoming progressively unstable and that family
   meeting should not be detained until Friday as complications may arise
   before then. He will try to arrange for meeting tomorrow afternoon. Had
   Qs about meaning of ""CMO"" when this issue was raised; still seems very
   hesitant to change plan of care.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Hepatitis C Cirrhosis with hepatic failure:  She continues to be
   grossly icteric with a worsening INR and liver function tests and a
   MELD today of 51. Vitamin K for elevated INR has not been helpful in
   lowering INR.  With new likely GIB noted on suctioning today, will
   likely need FFP/DDAVP depending on goals of  care.
   Per hepatology likely not candidate for transplant at this time.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose
   - 1PRBC, 1 unit platelets, 2 unit FFP as temporizing measure until
   goals of care re-addressed this afternoon
   - consider FFP/DDAVP for UGIB if goals of care remain the same.  Repeat
   HCT at 0900 this morning.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.4 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Previously more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   with addition of an additional pressor.
   - Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - Monitor volume status closely to avoid further fluid overload
 avoid
   IVF as minimal UOP
   - continue levophed/vasopressin to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - if MAP continues to decline will add neosynephrine
   - ABG at noon, if pH <7.2 then consider bicarbonate
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   # Goals of Care: patient
s hepatic failure continues to worsen as
   evidenced by worsening t. bili and INR.  Extremely unlikely that
   patient will recover from this illness.
   - Arrange family meeting as expeditiously as possible to address goals
   of care.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  The differential includes seizure/post-ictal,
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia , medication induced
   (started following ativan administration).   CT head with no evidence
   of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common causes.  Cannot
   exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia.  CXR
   on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine ranging from 1.8  to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0) and
   continues to have low urine output (10-25cc/hr). The differential
   includes poor renal perfusion, possibly ATN vs. HRS. Given very low
   urine Na concern for development of HRS.  Renal evaluation over the
   weekend noted that renal replacement therapy will not be an option.
   Bladder pressures 24 today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - monitor bladder pressure
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal and liver recs regarding treatment for HRS
   .
   # SVT: Patient had episode of regular narrow complex tachycardia on
   [**2200-5-3**] likely PSVT, broke spontaneously.  Possibly due to increasing
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - lower MAP requirement to >65 (from >75)
   - adenosine at bedside
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI if stable
   - neurology recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent SBP. She is being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status. The patient's condition is worsening, with gross icterus, worsening INR, and elevated liver enzymes. She also has hypothermia, hyponatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and is positive for GPC clusters from 04/27/2022, which may be a contaminant. The patient is intubated due to AMS and concern for airway protection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic failure: The patient's worsening INR, elevated liver enzymes, and gross icterus indicate hepatic failure. This can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and liver-related infections.
2. Infection: The patient has positive BCx and GPC clusters, indicating possible infection. There is concern for new infections due to altered mental status. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.
3. Renal failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level and low urine output, suggesting renal failure. This could be due to hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular necrosis. Renal replacement therapy may not be an option.
4. Seizures: The patient had an episode of non-convulsive status epileptiform discharges. It is"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Pt received cefepime accidental dose x 1 (another patient's
   medication). Has PCN allergy (hives) but no known anaphylaxis. No
   immediate rxn. No meds given at this time.
   - Discussed poor prognosis with son. Renal also discussed futility of
   RRT. Change in code status to DNR (ok to continue intubation, ok to
   continue pressors). Son contacting family for potential family meeting
   on Tuesday.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC; post-transfusion Hct - 24 (from 22)
   - Coags markedly worse with PM labs; son was called to notify him that
   patient's labs are becoming progressively unstable and that family
   meeting should not be detained until Friday as complications may arise
   before then. He will try to arrange for meeting tomorrow afternoon. Had
   Qs about meaning of ""CMO"" when this issue was raised; still seems very
   hesitant to change plan of care.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Hepatitis C Cirrhosis with hepatic failure:  She continues to be
   grossly icteric with a worsening INR and liver function tests and a
   MELD today of 51. Vitamin K for elevated INR has not been helpful in
   lowering INR.  With new likely GIB noted on suctioning today, will
   likely need FFP/DDAVP depending on goals of  care.
   Per hepatology likely not candidate for transplant at this time.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose
   - consider FFP/DDAVP for UGIB if goals of care remain the same.  Repeat
   HCT at 0900 this morning.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.4 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Previously more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   with addition of an additional pressor.
   - Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - Monitor volume status closely to avoid further fluid overload
 avoid
   IVF as minimal UOP
   - continue levophed/vasopressin to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   # Goals of Care: patient
s hepatic failure continues to worsen as
   evidenced by worsening t. bili and INR.  Extremely unlikely that
   patient will recover from this illness.
   - Arrange family meeting as expeditiously as possible to address goals
   of care.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  The differential includes seizure/post-ictal,
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia , medication induced
   (started following ativan administration).   CT head with no evidence
   of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common causes.  Cannot
   exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia.  CXR
   on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine ranging from 1.8  to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0) and
   continues to have low urine output (10-25cc/hr). The differential
   includes poor renal perfusion, possibly ATN vs. HRS. Given very low
   urine Na concern for development of HRS.  Renal evaluation over the
   weekend noted that renal replacement therapy will not be an option.
   Bladder pressures 24 today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - monitor bladder pressure
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal and liver recs regarding treatment for HRS
   .
   # SVT: Patient had episode of regular narrow complex tachycardia on
   [**2200-5-3**] likely PSVT, broke spontaneously.  Possibly due to increasing
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - lower MAP requirement to >65 (from >75)
   - adenosine at bedside
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI if stable
   - neurology recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger prn for low temperature
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   -  re-check bedside US today and consider diagnostic and therapeutic
   paracentesis if sufficient ascites
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]

   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.  Multiple UA
   and cultures no growth to date.

   # Anemia: slowly trending down with  guaiac + stool
   -  continue to monitor HCT (check PM)
   - consider transfusion for active bleed or HCT <24

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, recent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and new-onset seizures. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status and concern for airway protection.

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Hepatitis C Cirrhosis with hepatic failure: The patient continues to show signs of liver failure, as evidenced by gross jaundice, worsening INR, and liver function tests. She is not a candidate for transplant at this time.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with ESLD (end-stage liver disease), HIV, and worsening septic shock. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa, Aldactone, penicillins, and hives/blisters from Bactrim. 

The patient is currently on increasing doses of pressors and has been trying for a family meeting today to address goals of care. The patient's condition is described as a ""worsening overall picture with multi-organ system failure and increasing pressor requirements."" 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 76/41 mmHg to 112/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, distended abdomen, right and left lower extremity edema, warm skin with jaundice, and no neurologic assessment due to unresponsiveness. 

Laboratory results show low hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. Blood glucose is elevated, as well as liver enzymes, creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid levels. Electrolyte imbalances are present, including low sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels. 

The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV ventilation"

   ICU team, including Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2728**] from hepatology.   Discussed that patient
   has progressively worsening multiorgan system failure, including
   increasing pressor requirement, renal failure, respiratory failure, and
   no is having GI bleeding.  At this point, given severity of disease and
   lack real treatment options, there is not much more we can do to save
   her, and prognosis is grim.  Given this pt
s family agrees that we will
   limit care, pending visits from other family members, at which point
   she will be made CMO.  At this point we will give no further

The patient is in the ICU and has been on increasing doses of pressors. A do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order was made yesterday. The patient's family is scheduled to have a meeting today to discuss the goals of care, considering the minimal chances of recovery.

The patient has several allergies, including sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), Aldactone (spironolactone), penicillins, and Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim). The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient is receiving multiple infusions, including vasopressin and norepinephrine. She is also on various medications such as pantoprazole, sodium bicarbonate, levoxyl, rifaximin, thiamin, folate, ursadiol, lactulose, protonix, epivir/zidovudin, and sevelamer.

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 76/41 mmHg to 112/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature of 37.5°C. The patient is on CPAP/PS"
