","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on 07/14/2135 with no source of bleeding found. He was intubated for a colonoscopy on 07/15/2135 and an orogastric (OG) tube was placed for golytely prep.

The patient is experiencing tachycardia and has a low hematocrit level, resulting in the administration of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's potassium level is slightly elevated at 5.5, so Kayexalate was given. Cardiac markers are trending up, but the electrocardiogram (ECG) shows no changes. This is likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of anemia and tachycardia.

An arterial line was placed for tachycardia and hypotension, but after normal saline (NS) bolus, the heart rate came down. The patient also experienced melena during the go-lytely prep.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 88/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

   86M with h/o [**Telephone/Fax (3) 1882**], recent GIB of unclear etiology, presenting with
   altered mental status (by report), HCT drop, guaic positive stools, and
   transient hypotension.
   .
   # ?GIB - no known h/o cirhosis or NSAIDs abuse, though on aspirin and
   plavix.  no recent groin access to suggest RP bleed at present,
   although had R femoral TLC placed in ED (sterile per ED documentation),
   and no recent medications changes to suggest hemolysis.  given dark
   stools, and HCT drop, concerning for duodenal source given recent EGD
   results, so would proceed with repeat EGD now.
   - appreciate GI recs.
   - plan for EGD today, though likely to need intubation.
   - continue protonix gtt.
   - ACCESS = TLC, PIVs.
   - T&C x2 UNITS.
   - cycle HCT Q6HR.
   - transfuse additional 1U PRBC now.
   - continue fluid [**Last Name (LF) 7980**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] give 2L IVF now.
   .
   # hypotension - concerning for GIB given guaic positive stool,
   decreased HCT, and recent similar admission.  ddx also includes sepsis,
   so would evaluate for possible sources as below, though no obvious
   infectious source at present.
   - CXR (PNA vs perforated ulcer), UA, BCx.
   - check AXR supine and upright after EGD (per radiology ?free air under
   right hemi-diaphragm).
   - continue volume resuscitation (received unknown fluids at OSH, 1L in
   ED), will give 1-2L now, and follow pulm status given known CHF.
   - continue levophed gtt for MAP>65.
   - cycle HCT as above, and transfuse 1U PRBC now.
   .
   # leukocytosis - no bands, and while this could represent a stress
   reaction, given hypotension, also concerning for infectious etiology.
   received empiric CTX and azithro at [**Hospital1 19**]-N.
   - hold antibiotics for now.
   - infectious workup as above.
   .
   # confusion - per family, current confusion is typical of pt's
   hospitalizations, and likely multifactorial with contribution from poor
   neurologic reserve (h/o CVA, chronic vascular changes), hypotension,
   and possible septic picture.  No evidence to suggest primary CNS
   infection at present (no meningismus, headache, kernig, brudzinki
   negative), no focal neurologic deficits on exam.
   - hold seroquel.
   - haldol prn for ICU psychosis.
   - follow mental status and neuro exam.
   - frequent re-orientation.
   - infectious workup as above.
   .
   # hyperkalemia - likely [**3-14**] ARF. no ECG changes c/w hyperkalemia.
   - fluid replete as above.
   - trend K in afternoon.
   - if remains elevated, would give insulin + d50, 1 amp bicarb, and can
   give kayexalate after EGD if no gross findings.
   .
   # ARF - likely [**3-14**] volume depletion.  lactate negative.
   - hydrate with volume as above.
   - trend creatinine.
   - check urine for eos given recent antibiotics.
   - consider renal consult if k not improving.
   .
   # CAD - s/p [**Month/Day (2) 1882**].  denies chest pain or dyspnea, and EKG without
   frank evidence of ischemia though has old LBBB, and worsening TWI and
   STD in V4-6 in setting of sinus tach and anemia (likely reflects both
   LVH and some demand ischemia).  feels ACS is unlikely, but given
   +troponin and recent [**Last Name (LF) 1882**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] proceed as follows:
   - hold aspirin, and plavix at present, once EGD complete, would restart
   aspirin, and discuss restarting plavix based on EGD findings.
   (per discussion with pt's cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7981**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7982**] pager #
   [**Pager number 7983**]), prefer to continue aspirin, ok to hold plavix pending EGD).
   - hold metoprolol, lisinopril given hypotension.
   - transfuse to maintain HCT > 27.
   - consider repeat TTE if HCT stable, and afebrile to evaluate for WMA.
   .
   # CHF - EF 40% at OSH in [**6-18**], on lasix at home.
   - cautious fluid resuscitation as above.
   - hold lisinopril, and lasix for now.
   .
   # PVD - hold aspirin, plavix for now.
   .
   # HTN - hold antihypertensives given hypotension.
   .
   # DM2 - on orals at home, will cover with SSI for now.
   .
   # hyperlipidemia - hold statin for now.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) of unclear etiology, presenting with altered mental status, HCT drop, guaiac positive stools, and transient hypotension. The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient's current conditions include hypotension, atrial fibrillation, electrolyte and fluid disorder, GIB, confusion, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury, and congestive heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) - The patient has a history of recent GIB, and there is a concern for a duodenal source given the recent endoscopy results. Further evaluation with repeat endoscopy is planned.
2. Hypotension - The patient's hypotension could be due to GIB, sepsis, or volume depletion. The source of GIB needs to be identified and treated, and fluid resuscitation will continue.
3. Atrial fibrillation - The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, which needs to be managed with appropriate medications and close monitoring.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder - The patient has hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, and volume depletion. These need to be corrected with appropriate interventions.
5. Confusion - The patient's confusion could be due to multiple"

   86M with h/o [**Telephone/Fax (3) 1882**], recent GIB of unclear etiology, presenting with
   altered mental status (by report), HCT drop, guaic positive stools, and
   transient hypotension.
   .
   # ?GIB - no known h/o cirhosis or NSAIDs abuse, though on aspirin and
   plavix.  no recent groin access to suggest RP bleed at present,
   although had R femoral TLC placed in ED (sterile per ED documentation),
   and no recent medications changes to suggest hemolysis.  given dark
   stools, and HCT drop, concerning for duodenal source given recent EGD
   results, so would proceed with repeat EGD now.
   - appreciate GI recs.
   - plan for EGD today, though likely to need intubation.
   - continue protonix gtt.
   - ACCESS = TLC, PIVs.
   - T&C x2 UNITS.
   - cycle HCT Q6HR.
   - transfuse additional 1U PRBC now.
   - continue fluid [**Last Name (LF) 7980**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] give 2L IVF now.
   .
   # hypotension - concerning for GIB given guaic positive stool,
   decreased HCT, and recent similar admission.  ddx also includes sepsis,
   so would evaluate for possible sources as below, though no obvious
   infectious source at present.
   - CXR (PNA vs perforated ulcer), UA, BCx.
   - check AXR supine and upright after EGD (per radiology ?free air under
   right hemi-diaphragm).
   - continue volume resuscitation (received unknown fluids at OSH, 1L in
   ED), will give 1-2L now, and follow pulm status given known CHF.
   - continue levophed gtt for MAP>65.
   - cycle HCT as above, and transfuse 1U PRBC now.
   .
   # leukocytosis - no bands, and while this could represent a stress
   reaction, given hypotension, also concerning for infectious etiology.
   received empiric CTX and azithro at [**Hospital1 19**]-N.
   - hold antibiotics for now.
   - infectious workup as above.
   .
   # confusion - per family, current confusion is typical of pt's
   hospitalizations, and likely multifactorial with contribution from poor
   neurologic reserve (h/o CVA, chronic vascular changes), hypotension,
   and possible septic picture.  No evidence to suggest primary CNS
   infection at present (no meningismus, headache, kernig, brudzinki
   negative), no focal neurologic deficits on exam.
   - hold seroquel.
   - haldol prn for ICU psychosis.
   - follow mental status and neuro exam.
   - frequent re-orientation.
   - infectious workup as above.
   .
   # hyperkalemia - likely [**3-14**] ARF. no ECG changes c/w hyperkalemia.
   - fluid replete as above.
   - trend K in afternoon.
   - if remains elevated, would give insulin + d50, 1 amp bicarb, and can
   give kayexalate after EGD if no gross findings.
   .
   # ARF - likely [**3-14**] volume depletion.  lactate negative.
   - hydrate with volume as above.
   - trend creatinine.
   - check urine for eos given recent antibiotics.
   - consider renal consult if k not improving.
   .
   # CAD - s/p [**Month/Day (2) 1882**].  denies chest pain or dyspnea, and EKG without
   frank evidence of ischemia though has old LBBB, and worsening TWI and
   STD in V4-6 in setting of sinus tach and anemia (likely reflects both
   LVH and some demand ischemia).  feels ACS is unlikely, but given
   +troponin and recent [**Last Name (LF) 1882**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] proceed as follows:
   - hold aspirin, and plavix at present, once EGD complete, would restart
   aspirin, and discuss restarting plavix based on EGD findings.
   (per discussion with pt's cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7981**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7982**] pager #
   [**Pager number 7983**]), prefer to continue aspirin, ok to hold plavix pending EGD).
   - hold metoprolol, lisinopril given hypotension.
   - transfuse to maintain HCT > 27.
   - consider repeat TTE if HCT stable, and afebrile to evaluate for WMA.
   .
   # CHF - EF 40% at OSH in [**6-18**], on lasix at home.
   - cautious fluid resuscitation as above.
   - hold lisinopril, and lasix for now.
   .
   # PVD - hold aspirin, plavix for now.
   .
   # HTN - hold antihypertensives given hypotension.
   .
   # DM2 - on orals at home, will cover with SSI for now.
   .
   # hyperlipidemia - hold statin for now.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) of unclear etiology. The patient presented with altered mental status, HCT drop, guaiac positive stools, and transient hypotension. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, which may contribute to his current symptoms and requires ongoing monitoring.

3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has hyperkalemia, likely secondary to acute renal failure (ARF). Close monitoring of electrolytes and fluid status is necessary.

4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has guaiac positive stools and a history of recent GIB. A repeat endoscopy (EGD) is planned to identify the source of bleeding.

5. Confusion: The patient is experiencing confusion, which could be attributed to various factors such as poor neurologic reserve, hypotension, or sepsis. Frequent reorientation and neurological assessment are essential.

6. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient likely has pre-renal ARF due to volume depletion. Hydration with fluids and close monitoring of renal function are necessary.

7. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD with recent positive cardiac markers. Further evaluation and management are required, including consideration for repeat cardiac enzyme levels and cardiac imaging.

8. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction of 40%. Fluid resuscitation should be cautious to prevent exacerbation of CHF symptoms.

9. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient is advised to hold aspirin and Plavix due to potential bleeding risks associated with PVD.

10. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's statin medication is held for now.

11. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (DM2): The patient's oral hypoglycemic agents are withheld, and he will be covered with SSI for now.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of these potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of NSTEMI, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) of unclear etiology, presenting with altered mental status, HCT drop, guaiac positive stools, and transient hypotension. The patient's EGD was negative for bleeding, but he has melanic stools suggestive of an upper GI source. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/46 mmHg to 191/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient has been given 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and is being closely monitored for potential complications. His cardiac markers are trending up, but the ECG shows no changes. There is a concern for left lower lobe (LLL) pulmonary infarct versus pleural effusion based on the chest X-ray (CXR). 

The patient's laboratory results show an increased white blood cell count (WBC), elevated troponin T level, and abnormal kidney function. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium (K+). 

The patient's physical examination reveals tachycardia, regular rapid rhythm, and equal bilateral chest auscultation. His abdomen is soft and non-t"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) of unclear etiology, presenting with altered mental status, HCT drop, guaiac positive stools, and transient hypotension. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which was negative for any bleeding source. He is currently intubated and undergoing a colonoscopy preparation with Golytely. The patient has been given Kayexalate for elevated potassium levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): Despite melena suggestive of an upper GI source, the patient's EGD was negative. The plan is to proceed with a colonoscopy to investigate further and determine the cause of the lower GIB.

2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be attributed to likely recent GIB and hypovolemia. However, the possibility of sepsis is also being considered. The patient is receiving fluid resuscitation and has been transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBCs).

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels, which could suggest an infectious etiology or stress reaction. However, the patient's AKI is more likely due to recent volume depletion. Fluid resuscitation is ongoing.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of NSTEMI, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) of unclear etiology, presenting with altered mental status, HCT drop, guaiac positive stools, and transient hypotension. He has hypernatremia, hypotension/tachycardia, confusion, acute renal failure (ARF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has had recent GIB, which could recur and may require further investigation such as a tagged red cell scan if bleeds again.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia due to hypovolemic dehydration. It needs to be corrected carefully to avoid rapid changes in serum sodium levels.
3. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate ongoing blood loss or sepsis. Monitoring for signs of hypoperfusion and considering sepsis workup is necessary.
4. Confusion: The patient's confusion could be due to multiple factors including poor neurologic reserve, hypotension, and possible septic picture. Frequent re-orientation and monitoring for any changes in mental status are important.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is resolving,"

   COLONOSCOPY [**2135-7-15**]:
   There was a very tight bend at the sigmoid colon which could represent
   previous anastomosis if patient has had prior surgery.
   There were a few areas of a few red drops of blood seen in the
   ascending colon which were washed without underlying lesion seen.
   Mucosa appeared very friable and occasional contact bleeding was seen.
   However, this was minimal and does not account for transfusion
   requirement.
   Polyp in the sigmoid colon
   Bile was seen in the terminal ileum and cecum without evidence of
   blood. Ileum was normal up to 25 cm.
   Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum to 20 cm
   Assessment and Plan
   86M with h/o NSTEMI, recent GIB of unclear etiology, presenting with
   altered mental status (by report), HCT drop, guaiac positive stools,
   and transient hypotension.
   .
   # Lower GIB: Hct stable s/p 6units pRBCs here. Colonoscopy without
   source of bleed but difficult anatomy.
   - F/u GI recs
   - Q8H Hct, maintain active T&S, access via TLC/PIVs,
   - ASA and plavix continued as no source of bleed id
   - Change protonix to [**Hospital1 7**]
   - consider tagged red cell scan if bleeds again
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia given intubated.
   - Wrote for 1/2NS to correct Na at <0.5mEq/hr (200mL/hr = 0.5mEq/hr)
   but got 100mL/hr for h/o CAD so not corrected this am
   - Start D5W at 125mL/hr
   - Check urine lytes if does not correct with IVF and PO intake today.
   # Hypotension/tachycardia: thought likely [**3-14**] GIB and hypovolemia now
   resolved s/p resuscitation. Sepsis w/u pending. Concerned that other
   etiology might be cardiac event in setting of anemia and demand
   ischemia.
   - Consider TTE today although now that more stable could also do this
   as outpatient.
   - F/U BCx pending
   - Ucx negative
   .
   # Confusion: per family, current confusion is typical of pt's
   hospitalizations, and likely multifactorial with contribution from poor
   neurologic reserve (h/o CVA, chronic vascular changes), hypotension,
   and possible septic picture.  No evidence to suggest primary CNS
   infection at present (no meningismus, headache, kernig, brudzinki
   negative), no focal neurologic deficits on exam.
   - hold seroquel.
   - haldol prn for ICU psychosis.
   - follow mental status and neuro exam.
   - frequent re-orientation.
   - infectious workup as above.
   .
   # ARF: Resolving.
   - trend Creatinine, check PM lytes
   .
   # CAD - s/p NSTEMI.  denies chest pain or dyspnea, and EKG without
   frank evidence of ischemia though has old LBBB, and worsening TWI and
   STD in V4-6 in setting of sinus tach and anemia (likely reflects both
   LVH and some demand ischemia). ACS is unlikely
   - Cont ASA; and plavix (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7981**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7982**] pager # [**Pager number 7983**])
   - if ctes to have slight hypertension (155 for SBP this am) would
   consider adding back short-acting ACE-I
   .
   # CHF - EF 40% at OSH in [**6-18**], on lasix at home.
   - hold lasix for now.
   - follow weights, I/Os, and UOP closely.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of NSTEMI, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) of unclear etiology, presenting with altered mental status, HCT drop, guaiac positive stools, and transient hypotension. He has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

Medical Complications:
1. Lower GIB: The patient's HCT has stabilized after receiving 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). Colonoscopy did not identify the source of bleeding, but there was a very tight bend at the sigmoid colon, which could represent a previous anastomosis. There were also areas of minimal contact bleeding seen, but this does not account for the transfusion requirement. Polyp in the sigmoid colon was found, and bile was seen in the terminal ileum and cecum without evidence of blood. The patient's anemia is being monitored, and further gastrointestinal recommendations are pending.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level of 154, likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia given his intubation. He requires correction of sodium but should not drop too quickly. Initially, half-normal saline (1/2 NS) was ordered at 200 mL/hr to make up for the sodium deficit of 3L. However, due to the patient's history of coronary artery disease (CAD), the rate was reduced to 100 mL/hr. D"

   # Hypotension/tachycardia: thought likely [**3-14**] GIB and hypovolemia now
   resolved s/p resuscitation. Sepsis w/u pending. Concerned that other
   etiology might be cardiac event in setting of anemia and demand
   ischemia.
   - Consider TTE today although now that more stable could also do this

   # Confusion: per family, current confusion is typical of pt's
   hospitalizations, and likely multifactorial with contribution from poor
   neurologic reserve (h/o CVA, chronic vascular changes), hypotension,
   and possible septic picture.  No evidence to suggest primary CNS
   infection at present (no meningismus, headache, kernig, brudzinki
   negative), no focal neurologic deficits on exam.
   - hold seroquel.
   - haldol prn for ICU psychosis.
   - follow mental status and neuro exam.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of NSTEMI, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) of unclear etiology, presenting with altered mental status, hemoglobin drop, guaiac positive stools, and transient hypotension. The patient underwent a colonoscopy that revealed a tight bend in the sigmoid colon, which could represent a previous anastomosis if the patient had prior surgery. There were also areas of minimal bleeding seen in the ascending colon, but no underlying lesion was identified. The mucosa appeared very friable with occasional contact bleeding. Polyps were found in the sigmoid colon, and bile was seen in the terminal ileum and cecum without evidence of blood. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 129/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals sinus rhythm, tachycardia, regular rate and rhythm, clear lung fields bilaterally, and equal bilaterally in the chest. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and renal failure. The patient's current medications include aspirin, Plavix"

   - Given no obvious source at present, will hold off on antibiotics for
   now, though would have low threshold to add empiric coverage for
   possible abdominal source (cipro/flagyl vs vanc/zosyn given recent
   hospitalization).
   .
   # Leukocytosis - no bands, and while this could represent a stress
   reaction, given hypotension, also concerning for infectious etiology.
   received empiric CTX and azithro at [**Hospital1 19**]-N.
   - hold antibiotics for now.
   - infectious workup as above.
   .
   # Confusion: per family, current confusion is typical of pt's
   hospitalizations, and likely multifactorial with contribution from poor
   neurologic reserve (h/o CVA, chronic vascular changes), hypotension,
   and possible septic picture.  No evidence to suggest primary CNS
   infection at present (no meningismus, headache, kernig, brudzinki
   negative), no focal neurologic deficits on exam.
   - hold seroquel.
   - haldol prn for ICU psychosis.
   - follow mental status and neuro exam.
   - frequent re-orientation.
   - infectious workup as above.
   .
   # ARF: Likely [**3-14**] volume depletion with some improvement from
   yesterday. Lactate negative.
   - hydrate with volume as above.
   - trend Creatinine, check PM lytes
   .
   # CAD - s/p NSTEMI.  denies chest pain or dyspnea, and EKG without
   frank evidence of ischemia though has old LBBB, and worsening TWI and
   STD in V4-6 in setting of sinus tach and anemia (likely reflects both
   LVH and some demand ischemia). ACS is unlikely
   - Cont ASA; will discuss plavix with cardiologist as DES 6 months ago
   (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7981**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7982**] pager # [**Pager number 7983**])
   - hold metoprolol, lisinopril given hypotension.
   - 1 unit pRBC today, transfuse to maintain HCT > 27.
   - consider repeat TTE if HCT stable, and afebrile to evaluate for WMA.
   .
   # CHF - EF 40% at OSH in [**6-18**], on lasix at home.
   - cautious fluid resuscitation as above.
   - hold lisinopril, and lasix for now.
   - follow weights, I/Os, and UOP closely.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of NSTEMI, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) of unclear etiology, presenting with altered mental status, HCT drop, guaiac positive stools, and transient hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

24-hour events include a negative colonoscopy for bleed, CT scan negative for right pneumothorax (RP) bleed but pending further results. The patient is hypernatremic at 154 on PM lytes with a free water deficit of 3L. The plan is to administer 1/2 NS at 200 mL/hr for 3L to make up for sodium without dropping too quickly. Follow-up electrolytes are ordered.

Medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) at 8 mg/hr, midazolam (Versed), and fentanyl. Other medications are also mentioned.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), current temperature of 35.7 C (96.3 F), heart rate of 97 bpm (94-119 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 129/56 mmHg to 145/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute (15-30 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 9,968 mL, with 812 mL given in the last 24 hours. Total output is 3,085 mL, with 670 mL in the last 24 hours. Urine output is 2,485 mL, NG output is 600 mL, stool output is 600 mL, and drain output is 142 mL. The overall fluid balance is 6,883 mL positive.

Respiratory support includes ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 400 mL, set RR of 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, PIP of 13 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 11 cmH2O, compliance of 66.7 cmH2O/mL, and SpO2 of 99%. ABG results show pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 28, PaO2 of 242, Ve of 8.3 L/min, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 242.

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic status.

Lab results show leukocyte count of 18.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, platelet count of 175 mg/dL, sodium of 154 mEq/L, potassium of 3.8 mEq/L, chloride of 28.2%, bicarbonate of 11.3 mEq/L, BUN of 56 mg/dL, creatinine of 1."
