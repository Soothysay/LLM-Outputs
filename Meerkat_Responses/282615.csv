   ## Bilateral PEs: significant clot burden. No clear precipitant: no
   self-reported history of immobility (although her obesity would seem to
   limit her mobility), no history of malignancy, no family history of
   blood clots, no recent surgery.  Holding heparin gtt given hypotension
   and bleeding.

   ## Rectus sheath hematoma: Appears to be spontaneous bleed after
   initiation of heparin. Currently not responding to prbc infusions.  BP
   is responsive to fluids. IR will not take for study given acute renal
   failure. Will discontinue heparin, support with blood transfusions and
   IVF.

   ##Acute Renal Failure: Cr increase from 0.9 to 2.4, in setting of
   hypotension and IV contrast.  Currently anuric. Hematoma may be
   increasing abdominal pressure, causing obstruction.  Will recheck Cr
   after fluid resuscitation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who was found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli and developed a spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma after starting heparin. She was transferred to the ICU with anemia and hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/67 mmHg to 98/29 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is tachycardic and has soft bowel sounds with LLQ tenderness and mild erythema of the ankles. Neurologic examination is normal.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 22.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 25.1 g/dL, platelet count of 258 K/uL, creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.04 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to hypovolemia from bleeding rectus sheath, possibly worsened by pulmonary embolism. Fluid resuscitation has been initiated, and blood transfusions have been given.

2. Bilateral PEs: The patient has significant clot burden with no clear precipitant. Heparin infusion is being held"

   A/P: 70 y.o. woman with pmh rheumatoid arthritis found to have
   bilateral pulmonary emboli, spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma after

   hypotension.
   .
   ## Hypotension: Likely secondary to hypovolemia from bleeding rectus

   check lactate. Continue prbc's and IVF.
   - 1L bolus NS
   - pRBC if Hct drops currently stable at 25.2
   - consider rechecking lactate
   .
   ## Bilateral PEs: significant clot burden. No clear precipitant: no
   self-reported history of immobility (although her obesity would seem to
   limit her mobility), no history of malignancy, no family history of
   blood clots, no recent surgery.  Holding heparin gtt given hypotension
   and bleeding.
   - holding heparin
   - will get IVC filter to prevent further dvts while not on heparin
   - may need hypercoagulable workup as outpatient
   .
   ## Increased bladder pressure
 possibly chronicallly elevated [**3-16**]
   obesity, currently at 22, Surgeons evaluated and believe pt is at low
   risk for abdominal compartment syndrome.
   - surgery will sign off
   - will moniter bladder pressure occasionally
   ## Rectus sheath hematoma: Appears to be spontaneous bleed after
   initiation of heparin. Currently not responding to prbc infusions.  BP
   is responsive to fluids. IR will not take for study given acute renal
   failure. Will discontinue heparin, support with blood transfusions and
   IVF.
   - continue ot moniter
   .
   ##Acute Renal Failure: Cr increase from 0.9 to 2.4, and now increase to
   3.2 in setting of hypotension and IV contrast.  FeNa 2% supporting
   etiology as contrast nephropathy vs. ATN. Currently anuric. Hematoma

","The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who was found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli and a spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma after the initiation of heparin. She was transferred to the ICU with anemia and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure of 108/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. She is tachycardic and hypotensive.

Her physical examination reveals increased respiratory effort, alert mental status, dry mucous membranes, no neck stiffness, tachycardia, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, soft abdomen with tenderness in the left lower quadrant, no rebound tenderness, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly, no rashes or lesions on the skin, 2+ bilateral symmetrical edema with mild erythema of the ankles, and poor capillary refill. Neurologic examination shows an alert and oriented patient with no focal deficits.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 22.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 25.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 25.5%, platelet count of 258 K/uL, creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL, troponin T of 0.04 ng/mL, CK-MB of 6 U/L, CK of 136 U/L, and lactate of 1.7 mmol/L. Other labs are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypotension secondary to hypovolemia from bleeding rectus sheath, possibly worsening pulmonary embolism, or sepsis. She is receiving prbc transfusions and IV fluids. Bilateral pulmonary emboli with significant clot burden are present, and heparin gtt is being held due to hypotension and bleeding. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter will be placed to prevent further deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while not on heparin. Hypercoagulable workup may be needed as an outpatient. Increased bladder pressure is noted but surgeons believe the patient is at low risk for abdominal compartment syndrome. The rectus sheath hematoma appears to be spontaneous and not responding to prbc infusions. Acute renal failure is present with an increase in creatinine from 0.9 to 2.4, and now to 3.2, likely due to hypotension and IV contrast. Leukocytosis is also noted. Tachypnea may be due to hypotension, anemia, worsening PE, myocardial ischemia, or anxiety. The patient's hypertension medications are being held due to acute bleed. Rheumatoid arthritis medications are being held"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y.o. woman with pmh rheumatoid arthritis found to have bilateral
   pulmonary emboli, spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma after initiation
   of heparin gtt, transferred to ICU with anemia and hypotension.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 bilateral significant clot burden.
   No clear precipitant: no self-reported history of immobility (although
   her obesity would seem to limit her mobility), no history of
   malignancy, no family history of blood clots, no recent surgery.
   Holding heparin gtt given hypotension and bleeding.
   - holding heparin
   - s/p IVC filter placement
   - may need hypercoagulable workup as outpatient
   - will need to restart anticoagulation eventually to prevent IVC filter
   clot.
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING) Rectus
   sheath hematoma: Appears to be spontaneous bleed after initiation of
   heparin. Currently not responding to prbc infusions.  BP is responsive
   to fluids. IR will not take for study given acute renal failure. S
   - Continue to support with blood transfusions and IVF.
   - anticoagulation stopped
   ## Hypotension: Likely secondary to hypovolemia from bleeding rectus
   sheath vs sepsis vs worsening PE (echo without elevated PASP).
   - 1L bolus NS

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who presented with bilateral pulmonary emboli and developed a spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma after starting heparin. She was transferred to the ICU due to anemia and hypotension.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. Firstly, she has acute renal failure with an increase in creatinine levels from 0.9 to 2.4 and now to 3.2. This could be due to hypotension and IV contrast, and further evaluation by a renal consultant is recommended.

Secondly, the patient has hypotension, which is likely secondary to hypovolemia from bleeding rectus sheath or sepsis versus worsening pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has received 1L bolus NS and pRBC if Hct dropping. It is also suggested to recheck lactate and consider pancultures and cdiff.

Thirdly, the patient has anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding) due to the rectus sheath hematoma. Despite receiving prbc infusions, the patient's condition is not improving. IV fluids are being continued to support the patient, and anticoagulation has been stopped.

Fourthly, the patient has leukocytosis, which has improved from 25 to 14 without treatment. This is likely a stress reaction from PE. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y.o. woman with pmh rheumatoid arthritis found to have bilateral
   pulmonary emboli, spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma after initiation
   of heparin gtt, transferred to ICU with anemia and hypotension.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 bilateral significant clot burden.
   No clear precipitant: no self-reported history of immobility (although
   her obesity would seem to limit her mobility), no history of
   malignancy, no family history of blood clots, no recent surgery.
   Holding heparin gtt given hypotension and bleeding.
   - holding heparin
   - s/p IVC filter placement
   - may need hypercoagulable workup as outpatient
   - will need to restart anticoagulation eventually to prevent IVC filter
   clot.
 TACHYPNEA - RR 30 on admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**], was 20 on floor. Possibly
   from hypotension and anemia, peripheral PEs.  Cardiac ischemia ruled
   out with neg Ces, unchanged EKG.  On ABG pt has metabolic acidosis in
   addition to respiratory alkalosis
   - watch for resolution as primary problems improve
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING) Rectus
   sheath hematoma: Appears to be spontaneous bleed after initiation of
   heparin. Currently not responding to prbc infusions.  BP is responsive
   to fluids. IR will not take for study given acute renal failure.
   - Continue to support with blood transfusions and IVF.
   - anticoagulation stopped
   ## Hypotension: Likely secondary to hypovolemia from bleeding rectus
   sheath vs sepsis (unlikely as improving without antibiotics) vs
   worsening PE (echo without elevated PASP). Responded well to IVF.
   - IVF prn
   - consider rechecking lactate
   - f/u pancultures, cdiff
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) Cr increase from 0.9
   to 3.2 in setting of hypotension and IV contrast, now 1.5.  FeNa 2%
   supporting etiology as contrast nephropathy and ATN ruled out with no
   muddy brown casts on sediment. Starting to make urine. Hematoma and
   obesity likely increasing abdominal pressure, but not causing
   compartment syndrome clinically.
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to moniter
   - no need to recheck bladder pressure
   #Leukocytosis: Improved from 25 to 14 without treatment. Likely stress
   reaction from PE. Ruling out infectious sources
   -f/u blood,urine, sputum, stool c.diff
   ## HTN: holding amlodipine, lisinopril, metoprolol for now given acute
   bleed
   ## RA: Humira and MTX held since last admission, per rheum,  No
   contraindication to restarting these meds with PEs. However, will first
   tbw with rheumatologist re: their plan.
   ## hyperlipidemia: continue statin

","The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who was found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli. She developed a spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma after the initiation of heparin therapy and was transferred to the ICU with anemia and hypotension. The patient's current conditions include pulmonary embolism, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, resolved hypotension, acute renal failure (resolved), leukocytosis, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, and hyperlipidemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions are as follows:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has bilateral significant clot burden, and there is a risk of further clot formation or migration, which can lead to worsening respiratory distress or even death.
2. Acute anemia: The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss, and if not adequately managed with blood transfusions, it can lead to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.
3. Hypotension: Although the patient's hypotension has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrent episodes, especially if the underlying cause is not addressed. This can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure.
4. Acute renal failure: Although the patient's renal failure has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrence, particularly if the patient does not maintain adequate fluid balance and continues to experience episodes of hypotension. This can lead to chronic kidney disease or"

","The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis who was found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli and developed a spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma after the initiation of heparin therapy. She was transferred to the ICU with anemia and hypotension. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient already has bilateral significant clot burden, indicating a high risk for further pulmonary embolism if anticoagulation is not restarted.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient may develop DVT due to immobilization or hypercoagulable state.

3. Rectus sheath hematoma: The spontaneous bleed could recur if anticoagulation is continued without proper monitoring.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient initially had elevated creatinine levels due to hypotension and IV contrast, but it resolved. However, ongoing hypotension and the use of nephrotoxic medications can lead to acute renal failure.

5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to hypovolemia from bleeding, cardiac ischemia, or sepsis. Proper fluid management is crucial to maintain adequate blood pressure.

6. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis which improved without treatment, suggesting a possible stress response from PE. However, ruling out infectious sources is important, especially given her immunocompromised state.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who has been diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary emboli and a spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma after starting heparin. She was transferred to the ICU due to anemia and hypotension. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient already has bilateral significant clot burden, indicating a high risk for further clot formation and potential worsening of her PE condition.

2. Spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma: This hematoma may continue to expand and cause compression on surrounding structures, leading to respiratory distress or other complications.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient initially had elevated creatinine levels, suggesting possible renal impairment. It is important to monitor renal function closely and address any underlying causes such as contrast nephropathy or acute tubular necrosis.

4. Hypotension: The patient previously experienced hypotension, which can be caused by bleeding, hypovolemia, or medication effects. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid management is crucial.

5. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. Transfusion support and careful monitoring of hemodynamic status are necessary.

6. Leukocytosis: Although the patient's leukocyte count has improved, it is essential to continue monitoring for any signs of infection or worsening leukocytosis.
