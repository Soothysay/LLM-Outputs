   Assessment and Plan
   88F h/o metastatic breast cancer (malignant pleural effusion,
   pericardial effusion) on chemotherapy with acute on chronic dyspnea,
   tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension.
   # Dyspnea, tachypnea: Acute worsening may be due to mucous plugging in
   patient with little pulmonary reserve (effusions, lobar collapse,
   extensive mets with lymphangitic spread), compounded by tachycardia
   leading to CHF [**1-28**] decreased diastolic filling and acute pulmonary
   edema. Pneumonia (post-obstructive, aspiration pneumonitis) also
   possible especially given immunosuppression from malignancy, although
   less likely. Recent negative LENIs and CTA chest make PE lower on
   differential.
   - High-flow O2, nebs prn
   - Attempt PPV if tolerates
   - Treat atrial fibrillation per below
   - Continue levo/flagyl, add vanco for now
   - Blood, urine, sputum, pleurex catheter cultures
   -f/u IP recs, re ? daily pleurex catheter drainage.
   # Atrial fibrillation: New onset in setting of acute illness, may be
   related to hypoxia and possible underlying pneumonia. Normal atria by
   recent echo.
   - Amiodarone given hypotension
   # Hypotension: Likely volume depletion in the setting of poor filling
   and CO due to tachycardia. Less likely sepsis, cardiogenic, or adrenal
   etiology. No evidence bleeding or tamponade (normal pulsus, JVP, and no
   effusion on recent echo).
   - Volume resuscitate with IVF bolus prn
   - Antibiotics per above
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Recheck Hct
   #Altered mental status.  Delerious overnight.  Ddx includes 0.5mg
   lorazepam received earlier, hypoxia, dehydration, pain, urinary
   retention, infection, ICU delerium.  Foley d/c'd as pt c/o dysuria,
   pulling at catheter
   -avoid benzos
   -follow 02 sats
   -no UOP overnight despide boluses for dehydration, bladder scan this am
   -continue abx
   -continue to bolus for low BP as 02 tolerates
   # Esophageal stenosis: Last dilation failed, currently with limited PO
   intake [**1-28**] dysphagia.
   - Needs speech/swallow exam when more stable
   - Nutrition following
   # Mandibular nodules: CT mandible negative for bony involvement;
   appears to be hematoma. Was receiving levofloxacin, metronidazole for
   ?dental abscess, but no fluctuance.
   - Dental consult pending; panorex imaging ordered STAT per dental
   consult. Consider ENT or oral maxillofacial surgery consult if
   appropriate after dental consult.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, presenting with acute on chronic dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension. She is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications, including malignant pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and esophageal stenosis. The patient is on chemotherapy and has an indwelling portacath. She is experiencing altered mental status, delirium, and possible urinary retention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's acute worsening of dyspnea and tachypnea may be due to mucous plugging, which can lead to pneumonia. Given her immunosuppression from malignancy, she is at higher risk for developing an infection.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypotension and hypoxia could indicate the development of ARDS, a severe lung condition that can occur as a complication of infections or other illnesses.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's tachycardia leading to decreased diastolic filling and acute pulmonary edema may result in cardiogenic shock, which can cause hypotension and organ dysfunction.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and malignancy increase her risk of developing blood clots"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo female with a history of metastatic breast CA with associated
   effusions and drainage now presenting with hypotension and hypoxia to
   ICU with admission for sepsis in the setting of new onset atrial
   fibrillation and hypoxemia.  This may well represent evolution of
   infection or aspiration triggering acute worsening.
   1)Sepsis
[**Month (only) 60**] be pulmonary source but source not clear.  Will
   -Follow up cultures but WBC not elevated
   -Will maintain euvolemic today with bolus as needed.
   -Continue broad specturm ABX
   -The blood pressure insult here may well be exaggerated by the
   compromised cardiac output in the setting of diastolic dysfunction and
   atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
   -IVF bolus is intervention of choice but are limited by evolution of
   effusion, hypoxemia and pulmonary edema.
   2)Atrial Fibrillation-Likely secondary to acute trigger in this
   setting
patient is on thyroid replacement therapy and evaluation of
   adequacy would be reasaonable.
   -Amiodarone
   -Follow up TSH when stable
   3)Hypoxemia-Severe compromise of the right lung is seen by the presence
   of significant effusion in the setting of hydration required to
   stabilize blood pressure in the setting of infectious insult seen
   above.
   -Address pleural effusion with drainage
   -Supplemental oxygen as needed.
   4)Acute Renal Failure-Oliguric renal failure seen with possible
   contribution from pre-renal source which has been persistent overnight
   5)Pleural Effusion-
   -Will pursue drainage today with sampling for culture desired.
   6)Altered mental status
likely multifactorial and will avoid
   benzodiazepine medications.  Hope for improvement with stabilization of
   medical insult and appropriate medications.
   7)Breast Cancer
Hold on chemotherapeutic intervention at this time and
   will discuss with oncology planning for treatment in the setting of
   acute illness.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer presenting to the ICU with sepsis, hypotension, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and is experiencing severe compromise of the right lung due to a significant effusion. The patient also has acute renal failure, pleural effusion, altered mental status, and a history of breast cancer. She is on thyroid replacement therapy and has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already in the ICU for sepsis, and there is a need to follow up with cultures, maintain euvolemic, continue broad-spectrum ABX, and address the potential pulmonary source of infection.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may continue or worsen due to acute triggers, and further evaluation of thyroid function should be done.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's severe compromise of the right lung due to the effusion may lead to persistent hypoxemia. Addressing the pleural effusion with drainage and providing supplemental oxygen will be necessary.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure may persist or worsen, potentially contributing to pre-renal causes. Monitoring fluid balance and avoiding nephrotoxic agents will be important.
5. Pleural Effusion: The patient's pleural effusion needs to be"

   pleural effusions s/p pleur-X catheter insertion now with acute
   respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress:  Likely worsening of underlying recurrent
   malignant effusions/ lymphangitic spread of cancer.   The decision was
   made to make the patient CMO, we will discontinue antibiotics for
   possible post-obstructive pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer, who has undergone pleur-X catheter insertion for recurrent malignant pleural effusions. She is now experiencing acute respiratory distress. The patient has made comfort-measures-only (CMO) decisions per discussion with the family and primary oncology team. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (96.9°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/33-76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. She is on high-flow oxygen and nebulizers as needed. The patient's physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress, bilateral 3+ pitting edema, and normal cardiovascular examination. Lab results show leukocytosis, anemia, elevated creatinine, and decreased platelet count. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range. The assessment and plan indicate that the respiratory distress is likely due to worsening of underlying recurrent malignant effusions or lymphangitic spread of cancer. The decision has been made to discontinue antibiotics for possible post-obstructive pneumonia and focus on comfort measures. The patient's metastatic breast cancer treatment was last administered on [**2192-4-5**], and she will continue with CMO. The patient also has hypothyroidism, for which outpatient levothyroxine will be prescribed."
